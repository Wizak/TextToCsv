 the winds of chance by rex beach author of the silver horde the spoilers the iron trail etc chapter i with an ostentatious flourish mr lucky broad placed a crisp tendollar bill in an eager palm outstretched across his foldingtable the gentleman wins and the gambler loses mr broad proclaimed to the world the eye is quicker than the hand and the dealers moans is music to the strangers ear with practised touch he rearranged the three worn walnutshells which constituted his stock in trade beneath one of them he deftly concealed a pellet about the size of a fivegrain allopathic pill it was the erratic behavior of this tiny ball its mysterious comings and goings that had summoned mr broads audience and now held its observant interest this audience composed of roughly dressed men listened attentively to the seductive monologue which accompanied the dealers deft manipulations and was greatly entertained thereby three tiny tepees in a row and a little black medicineman inside the speakers voice was highpitched and it carried like a thirtythirty you see him walk in you open the door and you double your money awfully simple simpully awful what as i live the gentleman wins ten more ten silvertongued songbirds ten messengers of mirth the price of a hard days toil take it sir and may it make a better and a stronger man of you times are good and i spend my money free i made it packin grub to linderman four bits a pound but easy come easy go now then whos next youve seen me work i couldnt baffle a soreeyed siwash with snowglasses lucky broads threelegged table stood among some stumps beside the muddy roadway which did service as the main street of dyea and along which flowed an irregular stream of pedestrians incidental to his practised manipulation of the polished walnutshells he maintained an unceasing chatter of the sort above set down now his voice was loud and challenging now it was apologetic always it stimulated curiosity one moment he was jubilant and gay again he was contrite and querulous occasionally he burst forth into plaintive selfdenunciations fixing a hypnotic gaze upon a bland blueeyed bystander who had just joined the charmed circle he murmured invitingly better try your luck olaf its danish dice three chances to win and one to lose the object of his address shook his head aye ant danish aye ban norvegen said he danish dice or norwegian poker theyre both the same ill deal you a free hand and it wont cost you a cent fix your baby blues on the little ball and watch me close dont let me deceive you now then which hut hides the grain noting a halfdozen pairs of eyes upon him the norseman became conscious that he was a center of interest he grinned halfheartedly and after a brief hesitation thrust forth a clumsy paw lifted a shell and exposed the object of general curiosity you guessed it there was commendation there was pleased surprise in mr broads tone you cant fool a foreigner can you boys my my aint it lucky for me that we played for fun but you got to give me another chance lars ill fool you yet in walks the little pill once more i make the magic pass and you follow me attentively knowing in your heart of hearts that im a slick un now then shoot kid you cant miss me the onlookers stirred with interest with eager fingers the artless norwegian fumbled in his pocket at the last moment however he thought better of his impulse grunted once then turned his back to the table and walked away missed him murmured the dealer with no display of feeling then to the group around him he announced shamelessly you got to lead those birds they fly fast one of mr broads boosters he who had twice won for the norsemans benefit carelessly returned his winnings sure he agreed they got a head like a turtle them swedes mr broad carefully smoothed out the two bills and reverently laid them to rest in his bankroll yes and they got bony mouths you got to set your hook or it wont hold slow pickins yawned an honest miner with a pack upon his back attracted by the group at the table he had dropped out of the procession in the street and had paused long enough to win a bet or two now he straightened himself and stretched his arms these michael strogoffs is hep to the old stuff lucky im thinking of joining the big rush they say this klondike is some rich inasmuch as there were no strangers in sight at the moment the proprietor of the deadfall gave up barking he daintily folded and tore in half a cigarette paper out of which he fashioned a thin smoke for himself it was that wellearned moment of repose that welcome recess from the days toil mr broad inhaled deeply then he turned his eyes upon the former speaker youve been thinking again have you he frowned darkly with a note of warning in his voice he declared you aint strong enough for such heavy work kid thats why ive got you packing hay the object of this sarcasm hitched his shoulders and the movement showed that his burden was indeed no more than a cunning counterfeit a bundle of hay rolled inside a tarpaulin oh i got a head and ive been doing some heavy thinking with it the kid retorted this here dawson is going to be a good town im getting readied up to join the parade are you now the shellman mocked i spose you got it all framed with the canucks to let you through i spose the chief of police knows you and likes you eh you and

addressed his bevy of boosters have i nursed a serpent in my breast or has the kid met a bankers son gimme room boys im going to shuffle the shells for him and let him double his money keep your eye on the magic pea mr bridges three tiny tepees in a row there was a general laugh as broad began to shift the walnutshells but kid bridges retorted contemptuously thats the trouble with all you wiseacres you get a dollar ahead and you fall for another mans game i never knew a farodealer that wouldnt shoot craps no i havent met no bankers son and i aint likely to in this place these pilgrims have sewed their money in their underclothes and they sleep with their eyes open seems like theyd go blind but they dont these aint rubes lucky theyre city folks theyve seen threeringed circuses and

by the totem pole new york chicago frisco seattle theyre all hick towns for every city guy thats been stung by a bee theres a hundred that still thinks honey comes from a fruit this rush is just starting and the bigger it grows the better well do say kid if you mush over to tagish with that load of timothy on your spine the police will put you on the woodpile for the winter while mr lucky broad and his business associates were thus busied in discussing the latest decree of the northwest mounted police other townsmen of theirs were similarly engaged details of this proclamation the most arbitrary of any hitherto had just arrived from the international boundary and had caused a halt an eddy in the stream of goldseekers which flowed inland toward the chilkoot pass a human tide was setting northward from the states a tide which swelled and quickened daily as the news of george carmacks discovery spread across the world but at healy wilsons logstore where the notice above referred to had been posted the stream slowed a crowd of newcomers from the barges and steamers in the roadstead had assembled there and now gave voice to hoarse indignation and bitter resentment late arrivals from skagway farther down the coast brought word of similar scenes at that point and a similar feeling of dismay they reported a similar increase in the general excitement too there as here a tent city was springing up the wooded hills were awakening to echoes of unaccustomed life a thrill and a stir were running through the wilderness and the odor of spruce fires was growing heavier with every ship that came pierce phillips emerged from the tradingpost and drawn by the force of gravitation joined the largest and the most excited group of argonauts he was still somewhat dazed by his perusal of that police edict the blow to his hopes was still too stunning his disappointment was still too keen to permit of clear thought a ton of provisions and a thousand dollars he repeated blankly why that was absurd out of all possible reason it would bar the way to fully half this rushing army it would turn men back at the very threshold of the golden north nevertheless there stood the notice in black and white a clear and unequivocal warning from the canadian authorities evidently designed to forestall famine on the foodless yukon from the loud arguments round about him phillips gathered that opinion on the justice of the measure was about evenly divided those fortunate men who had come well provided commended it heartily those less fortunate fellows who were sailing closehauled were equally noisy in their denunciation of it the latter could see in this precautionary ruling nothing except the exercise of a tyrannical power aimed at their ruin and in consequence they voiced threats and promises of violence the which phillips put down as mere resentful mouthings of no actual significance as for himself he had never possessed anything like a thousand dollars at one time therefore the problem of acquiring such a prodigious sum in the immediate future presented appalling difficulties he had come north to get rich only to find that it was necessary to be rich in order to get north a fine situation truly a ton of provisions would cost at least five hundred dollars and the expense of transporting it across summer swamps and tundras then up and over that mysterious and forbidding chilkoot of which he had heard so much would bring the total capital required up to impossible proportions the prospect was indeed dismaying phillips had been ashore less than an hour but already he had gained some faint idea of the country that lay ahead of him already he had noted the almost absolute lack of transportation already he had learned the price of packers and as a result he found himself at an impasse one thousand dollars and two hundred pounds it was enough to dash high hopes and yet strangely enough phillips was not discouraged he was rather surprised at his own rebound after the first shock his reasonless optimism vaguely amazed him until in contemplating the matter he discovered that his thoughts were running somewhat after this fashion they told me i couldnt make it they said something was sure to happen well it has im up against it hard most fellows would quit and go home but i shant im going to win out somehow for this is the real thing this is life adventure it will be wonderful to look back and say i did it nothing stopped me i landed at dyea with one hundred and thirtyfive dollars but look at me now thoughts such as these were in his mind and their resolute nature must have been reflected in his face for a voice aroused him from his meditations it dont seem to faze you much partner i spose you came heeled phillips looked up and into a sullen angry face it nearly kills me he smiled im the worstheeled man in the crowd well its a darned outrage a ton of grub why have you seen the trail take a look its a mankiller and the rate is forty cents a pound to linderman itll go to fifty now maybe a dollarand there arent enough packers to handle half the stuff things are worse at skagway another man volunteered i came up yesterday and theyre losing a hundred head of horses a day bogging em down and breaking their legs you can walk on dead carcasses from the porcupine to the summit a third stranger evidently one of the wellprovided few laughed carelessly if you boys cant stand the strain youd better stay where you are said he grubs skyhigh in dawson and mighty short i knew what i was up against so i came prepared better go home and try it next summer the first speaker he of the sullen visage turned his back muttering resentfully another wise guy they make me sick ive a notion to go through anyhow dont try that cautioned the man from skagway if you got past the police theyd follow you to hell but what theyd bring you back they aint like our police still meditating his plight pierce phillips edged out of the crowd and walked slowly down the street it was not a street at all except by courtesy for it was no more than an open waterfront faced by a few log buildings and a meandering line of new white tents tents were going up everywhere and all of them bore painful evidence of their newness so did the clothes of their owners for that matter mens garments still bore their pricetags the beach was crowded with piles of merchandise over which there was much wrangling barges plying regularly back and forth from the anchored ships added hourly to the confusion as outfits were dumped upon the sand their owners assembled them and bore them away to their temporary camp sites in this occupation every man faced his own responsibilities singlehanded for there were neither drays nor carts nor vehicles of any sort as phillips looked on at the disorder along the waters edge as he stared up the firflanked dyea valley whither a steady stream of traffic flowed he began to feel a fretful eagerness to join in it to be up and going way yonder through those hills towered the chilkoot and beyond that was the mighty river rushing toward dawson city toward life and adventure for that was what the goldfields signified to phillips yes life adventure he had set out to seek them to taste the flavor of the world and there it lay his world at least just out of reach a fierce impatience a hot resentment at that senseless restriction which chained him in his tracks ran through the boy what right had any one to stop him here at the very door when just inside great things were happening past that whiteandpurple barrier which he could see against the sky a new land lay a radiant land of promise of mystery and of fascination pierce vowed that he would not could not wait fortunes would reward the first arrivals how then could he permit these other men to precede him the world was a good place it would not let a person starve to the young and the footfree adventure lurks just over the hill life opens from the crest of the very next divide it matters not that we never quite come up with either that we never quite attain the summit whence our promises are realized the everpresent expectation the eager straining forward is the breath of youth it was that breath which phillips now felt in his nostrils it was pungent salty he noted a group of people gathered about some center of attraction whence issued a highpitched intonation oh look at the cute little pea klondike croquet the packers pastime wholl risk a dollar to win a dollar its a healthy sport its good for young and old a cheeild can understand it three eskimo igloos and an educated pill a shellgame pierce phillips halted in his tracks and stared incredulously then he smiled a shellgame running wide open on the main street of the town this was the frontier the very edge of things with an odd sense of unreality he felt the world turn back ten years he had seen shellgames at circuses and fairgrounds when he was much younger but he supposed they had long since been abandoned in favor of more ingenious and less discreditable methods of robbery evidently however there were some gulls left for this device appeared to be well patronized still doubting the evidence of his ears he joined the group the gentleman wins and the gambler loses droned the dealer as he paid a bet now then were off for another journey wholl ride with me this time phillips was amazed that any one could be so simpleminded as to squander his money upon such a notoriously unprofitable form of entertainment nevertheless men were playing and they did not seem to suspect that the persons whom the dealer occasionally paid were his confederates the operator maintained an incessant monologue at the moment of pierces arrival he was directing it at an oxeyed individual evidently selected to be the next victim the fellow was stupid nevertheless he exercised some caution at first he won a few dollars then he lost a few but alas the gambling fever mounted in him and greed finally overcame his hesitation with an eager gesture he chose a shell and phillips felt a glow of satisfaction at the realization that the man had once more guessed aright drawing forth a wallet the fellow laid it on the table ill bet the lump he cried the dealer hesitated how much you got in that alligator valise two hundred dollars two hundred berries on one bush the proprietor of the game was incredulous boys he aims to leave me cleaner than a snowbird seizing the walnutshell between his thumb and forefinger he turned it over but instead of exposing the elusive pellet he managed by an almost imperceptible forward movement to roll it out from under its hidingplace and to conceal it between his third and fourth fingers the stranger was surprised dumfounded at sight of the empty shell he looked on openmouthed while his wallet was looted of its contents every now and then i win a little one the gambler announced as he politely returned the billcase to its owner he lifted another shell and by some sleightofhand managed to replace the pellet upon the table then gravely flipped a fivedollar gold piece to one of his boosters phillipss eyes were quick from where he stood he had detected the maneuver and it left him hot with indignation he felt impelled to tell the victim how he had been robbed but thought better of the impulse and assured himself that this was none of his affair for perhaps ten minutes he looked on while the sheepshearing proceeded after a time there came a lull and the dealer raised his voice to entice new patrons meanwhile he paused to roll a cigarette the size of a wheat straw while thus engaged there sounded the hoarse blast of a steamers whistle in the offing and he turned his head profiting by this instant of inattention a hand reached across the table and lifted one of the walnutshells there was nothing under it five bucks on this one a soiled bill was placed beside one of the two remaining shells the empty one thus far phillips had followed the pea unerringly therefore he was amazed at the new betters mistake the dealer turned back to his layout and winked at the bystanders saying brother ill bet you ten more that youve made a bad bet his offer was accepted simultaneously phillips was seized with an intense desire to beat this sharper at his own game impulsively he laid a protecting palm over the shell beneath which he knew the little sphere to lie ill pick this one he heard himself say better let me deal you a new hand the gambler suggested nothing of the sort a man at phillips shoulder broke in hang on to that shell kid youre right and im going down for the size of his bankroll the speaker was evidently a miner for he carried a bulky pack upon his shoulders he placed a heavy palm over the back of phillips hand then extracted from the depths of his overalls a fat roll of paper money the size of this wager together with the determination of its owner appeared briefly to nonplus the dealer he voiced a protest but the miner forcibly overbore it say i eat up this shell stuff he declared its my meat and ive trimmed every tinhorn that ever came to my town theres three hundred dollars you cover it and you cover this boys bet too the fellow winked reassuringly at phillips you heard him say the sky was his limit didnt you well lets see how high the sky is in these parts there was a movement in the crowd whereupon the speaker cried warningly boosters stand back dont try to give us the elbow or ill close up this game to pierce he murmured confidentially weve got him right dont let anybody edge you out he put more weight upon phillips hand and forced the young man closer to the table pierce had no intention of surrendering his place and now the satisfaction of triumphing over these crooks excited him he continued to cover the walnutshell while with his free hand he drew his own money from his pocket he saw that the owner of the game was suffering extreme discomfort at this checkmate and he enjoyed the situation i watched you trim that farmer a few minutes ago phillips companion chuckled now im going to make you put up or shut up theres my three hundred i can use it when it grows to six how much are you betting the dealer inquired of phillips pierce had intended merely to risk a dollar or two but now there came to him a thrilling thought that notice at healy business appears to be picking up murmured the proprietor of the game phillips neighbor continued to hold the boys hand in a vicelike grip now he leaned forward saying look here are you going to cover our coin or am i going to smoke you up the groans of the gambler is sweet music in their ears the dealer shrugged reluctantly and counted out four hundred and thirtyfive dollars which he separated into two piles a certain shame at his action swept over phillips when he felt his companions grasp relax and heard him say turn her over kid this was diamond cut diamond of course nevertheless it was a lowdown trick and pierce phillips started he examined the interior of the walnutshell in bewilderment for he had lifted it only to find it quite empty every now and then i win a little one the dealer intoned gravely pocketing his winnings it only goes to show you that the hand damnation exploded the man at phillips side trimmed for three hundred or im a goat as pierce walked away some one fell into step with him it was the sullen blackbrowed individual he had seen at the tradingpost so they took you for a hundred and thirtyfive eh you must be rolling in coin the man observed even yet pierce was more than a little dazed do you know said he i was sure i had the right shell why of course you had the right one the stranger laughed shortly they laid it up for you on purpose then kid bridges worked a shift when he held your hand you cant beat em pierce halted was he was that fellow with the pack a booster certainly theyre all boosters the kid carries enough hay on his back to feed a team its his bed ive been here a week and i know em the speaker stared in surprise at phillips who had broken into a hearty laugh look here a little hundred and thirtyfive must be chicken feed to you if youve got any more to toss away toss it in my direction thats what makes it so funny you see i havent any more that was my last dollar well it serves me right now i can start from scratch and win on my own speed the darkbrowed man studied phillips curiously youre certainy game he announced i spose now youll be wanting to sell some of your outfit thats why ive been hanging around that game ive picked up quite a bit of stuff that way but im still short a few things and ill buy i havent a pound of grub i came up secondclass huh then youll go back steerage oh no i wont im going on to dawson there was a momentary silence you say youve been here a week put me up for the night until i get a job will you the blackeyed man hesitated then he grinned youve got your nerve but im blamed if i dont like it said he my brother jim is cooking supper now suppose we go over to the tent and ask him chapter ii the headwaters of the dyea river spring from a giants punchbowl three miles above timberline the valley bottom widens out into a flinty field strewn with boulders which in ages past have lost their footing on the steep hills forming the sides of the cup between these boulders a thin carpet of moss is spread but the slopes themselves are quite naked they are seamed and cracked and weatherbeaten their surfaces are split and shattered from the play of the elements high up toward the crest of one of them rides a glacier a pallid weeping sentinel which stands guard for the great icecaps beyond winter snows summer fogs and rains have washed the hillsides clean they are leached out and they present a lifeless forbidding front to travelers in many places the granite fragments which still encumber them lie piled one above another in such titanic chaos as to discourage mans puny efforts to climb over them nevertheless men have done so and by the thousands by the tens of thousands on this particular morning an unending procession of human beings was straining up and over and through the confusion they lifted themselves by foot and by hand where the slope was steepest they crept on allfours they formed an unbroken threadlike stream extending from timberline to crest each individual being dwarfed to microscopic proportions by the size of his surroundings they flowed across the floor of the valley then slowly very slowly they flowed up its almost perpendicular wall now they were lost to sight again they reappeared clambering over glacier scars or toiling up steep rocky slides finally they emerged away up under the arch of the sky looking down from the roof of the pass itself the scene was doubly impressive for the wooded valley lay outstretched clear to the sea and out of it came that long wavering line of ants they did indeed appear to be ants those men as they dragged themselves across the meadow and up the ascent they resembled nothing more than a file of those industrious insects creeping across the bottom and up the sides of a bathtub and the likeness was borne out by the fact that all carried burdens that was in truth the marvel of the scene for every man on the chilkoot was bent beneath a backbreaking load three miles down the gulch where the upward march of the forests had been halted there among scattered outposts of scrubby spruce and windtwisted willow stood a village a sprawling formless aggregation of flimsy tents and green logs known as sheep camp although it was a temporary makeshift town already it bulked big in the minds of men from maine to california from the great lakes to the gulf for it was the last outpost of civilization and beyond it lay a land of mystery sheep camp had become famous by reason of the fact that it was linked with the name of that via dolorosa that summit of despair the chilkoot already it had come to stand for the weak mans ultimate milepost the end of many journeys the approach from the sea was easy if twelve miles of boulder and bog of swamp and niggerhead of root and stump can be called easy under the best of circumstances but easy it was as compared with what lay beyond and above it nevertheless many argonauts had never penetrated even thus far and of those who had a considerable proportion had turned back at the giant pit three miles above one look at the towering barrier had been enough for them the chilkoot was more than a mountain more than an obstacle of nature it was a presence a tremendous and a terrifying personality which overshadowed the minds of men and could neither be ignored at the time nor forgotten later no wonder then that sheep camp which was a part of the chilkoot represented a sort of acid test no wonder that those who had moved their outfits thus far were of the breed the northland loves the stout of heart and of body provisions were cached at frequent intervals all the way up from the sea but in the open meadow beneath the thousandfoot wall an immense supply depot had sprung up this pocket in the hills had become an openair commissary stocked with every sort of provender and gear there were acres of sacks and bundles of boxes and bales of lumber and hardware and perishable stuffs and all day long men came and went in relays one relay staggered up and out of the canon and dropped its packs another picked up the bundles and ascended skyward pound by pound ton by ton this vast equipment of supplies went forward but slowly oh so slowly and at such effort it was indeed fit work for ants for it arrived nowhere and it never ended antlike these burdenbearers possessed but one idea to fetch and to carry they traveled back and forth along the trail until they wore it into a bottomless bog until every rock every tree every landmark along it became hatefully familiar and their eyes grew sick from seeing them the character of then labor and its monotony even in this short time had changed the mens characters they had become packanimals and they deported themselves as such all laborsaving devices all mechanical aids all short cuts to comfort and to accomplishment had been left behind here was the wilderness primitive hostile merciless every foot they moved every ounce they carried was at the cost of muscular exertion it was only natural that they should take on the color of their surroundings money lost its value a mile above sheep camp said became a thing of weight a thing to carry the standard of value was the pound and men thought in hundredweights or in tons yet there was no relief no respite for famine stalked in the yukon and the northwest mounted were on guard hence these unfortunates were chained to their grubpiles as galleyslaves are shackled to their benches toe to heel like peons rising from the bowels of a mine they bent their backs and strained up that riven rock wall blasphemy and pain high hopes and black despair hearts overtaxed and eyes blind with fatigue that was what the chilkoot stood for permeating the entire atmosphere of the place so that even the dullest could feel it was a feverish haste an apprehensive demand for speed more speed to keep ahead of the pressing thousands coming on behind pierce phillips breasted the last rise to the summit slipped his packstraps and flung himself full length upon the ground his lungs felt as if they were bursting the blood surged through his veins until he rocked his body streamed with sweat and his legs were as heavy as if molded from solid iron he was pumped out winded nevertheless he felt his strength return with magic swiftness for he possessed that marvelous recuperative power of youth and like some fabled warrior new strength flowed into him from the earth round about him other men were sprawled some lay like corpses others were propped against their packs a few stirred and sighed like the sorely wounded after a charge those who had lain longest rose took up their burdens and went groaning over the skyline and out of sight every moment new faces purple with effort or white with exhaustion rose out of the depths all were bitten deep with lines of physical suffering on buckled knees their owners lurched forward to find restingplaces in their eyes burned a sullen rage in their mouths were foul curses at this devils stairway there were striplings and graybeards in the crowd strong men and weak men but here at the summit all were alike in one particular they lacked breath for anything except oaths here too as in the valley beneath was another great depot of provision piles near where phillips had thrown himself down there was one man whose bearing was in marked contrast to that of the others he sat astride a bulging canvas bag in a leather harness and in spite of the fact that the mark of a tumpline showed beneath his cap he betrayed no signs of fatigue he was not at all exhausted and from the interest he displayed it seemed that he had chosen this spot as a vantagepoint from which to study the upcoming file rather than as a place in which to rest this he did with a quick appreciative eye and with a genial smile in face in dress in manner he was different for one thing he was of foreign birth and yet he appeared to be more a piece of the country than any man pierce had seen his clothes were of a pattern common among the native packers but he wore them with a free unconscious grace all his own from the peak of his canadian toque there depended a tassel which bobbed when he talked his boots were of indian make and they were soft and light and waterproof a sash of several colors was knotted about his waist but it was not alone his dress which challenged the eye there was something in this fellows easy open bearing which arrested attention his dark skin had been deepened by windburn his wellset wellshaped head bore a countenance both eager and intelligent a countenance that fairly glowed with confidence and good humor oddly enough he sang as he sat upon his pack high up on this hillside amid blasphemous complaints he hummed a gay little song chante rossignol chante toi qui a le coeur gai tu as le coeur a rire mai jlaita pleurer ran his chanson phillips had seen the fellow several times and the circumstances of their first encounter had been sufficiently unusual to impress themselves upon his mind pierce had been resting here at this very spot when the canuck had come up into sight bearing a hundredpound pack without apparent effort two floursacks upon a mans back was a rare sight on the roof of the chilkoot there were not many who could master that slope with more than one but this fellow had borne his burden without apparent effort and what was even more remarkable what had caused pierce phillips to open his eyes in genuine astonishment was the fact that the man climbed with a pipe in his teeth and smoked it with relish on that occasion the frenchman had not stopped at the crest to breathe but had merely paused long enough to admire the scene outspread beneath him then he had swung onward of all the sights young phillips had beheld in this new land the vision of that huge unhurried canadian smoking had impressed him deepest it had awakened his keen envy too for pierce was beginning to glory in his own strength a few days later they had rested near each other on the long lake portage that is phillips had rested the canadian it seemed had a habit of pausing when and where the fancy struck him his reason for stopping there had been the antics of a peculiarly fearless and impertinent camprobber with a crust of bread he had tolled the bird almost within his reach and was accepting its scolding with intense amusement having both teased and made friends with the creature he finally gave it the crust and resumed his journey this was a land where brawn was glorified the tales told oftenest around the stoves at sheep camp had to do with feats of strength or endurance they were stories of mighty men and mighty packs of long marches and of grim staying powers already the names of certain oldtimers like dinsmore and mcdonald and peterson and stick jim had become famous because of some conspicuous exploit dinsmore according to the legend had once lugged a hundred and sixty pounds to the summit mcdonald had bent a horseshoe in his hands peterson had lifted the stempiece out of a polingboat lodged on the rocks below white horse stick jim had run down a moose and killed it with his knife from what phillips had seen of this french canadian it was plain that he too was an oldtimer one of that jovian band of supermen who had dared the dark interior and robbed the bars of forty mile in the hard days before the el dorado discovery since this was their first opportunity of exchanging speech phillips ventured to address the man i thought i had a load this morning but id hate to swap packs with you he said the frenchman flashed him a smile which exposed a row of teeth snowwhite against his tan ho youre stronger as me i see you plenty tams biffore this was indeed agreeable praise and pierce showed his pleasure oh no he modestly protested im just getting broken in look out you don broke your back warned the other dis chilkoot shes

to understand for he nodded seriously sometimes it scares me a little wat you scare bout you myself i suppose sometimes im afraid i havent the stuff in me to last dats good sign the speaker slipped

with a smile on his face the speaker nodded i know its peety too dese poor feller is scare lak you dey don onderstan but bimeby dey get wise dey learn to hep de oder feller dey learn dat a smile will carry a pack or row a boat you remember dat a smile and a song shell shorten de miles and mak frens wid everybody don forget wat i tell you thank you i wont said pierce with a flicker of amusement at the mans brief sermon this doret was evidently a sort of backwoods preacher adieu with another flashing smile and a wave of his hand the fellow joined the procession and went on over the crest it had been pleasant to exchange even these few friendly words for of late the habit of silence had been forced upon pierce phillips for weeks now he had toiled among reticent men who regarded him with hostility who made way for him with reluctance haste labor strain had numbed and brutalized them fatigue had rendered them irritable and the strangeness of their environment had made them both fearful and suspicious there was no goodfellowship no consideration on the chilkoot this was a race against time and the stakes went to him who was most ruthless phillips had not exaggerated until this morning he had received no faintest word of encouragement no slightest offer of help not once had a hand been outstretched to him and every inch he had gained had been won at the cost of his own efforts and by reason of his own determination he was yet warm with a wordless gratitude at the frenchmans cheer when a figure came lurching toward him and fell into the space doret had vacated this man was quite the opposite of the one who had just left he was old and he was far from robust he fell face downward and lay motionless impulsively phillips rose and removed the newcomers pack that last lift takes it out of you doesnt it he inquired sympathetically after a moment the stranger lifted a thin colorless face overgrown with a bushy gray beard and began to curse in a gasping voice the youth warned him youre only tiring yourself my friend its all downhill from here the sufferer regarded phillips from a pair of hard smokyblue eyes in which there lurked both curiosity and surprise i say he panted youre the first white man ive met in two weeks pierce laughed its the result of a good example a fellow was decent to me just now this is the kind of work that gives a man dead babies groaned the stranger and these darned trailhogs he ground his teeth vindictively get out of the way hurry up old man step lively grandpa thats what they say they snap at your heels like coyotes hurry you cant force your luck the speaker struggled into a sitting posture and in an apologetic tone explained i dassent lay down or ill get rheumatism tough guysfrontiersmen pah he spat out the exclamation with disgust then closed his eyes again and sank back against his burden coyotes thats what they are theyd rob a carcass theyd gnaw each others bones to get through ahead of the ice up out of the chasm below came a slowmoving file of indian packers their eyes were bent upon the ground and they stepped noiselessly into one anothers tracks the only sound they made came from their creaking packleathers they paused briefly to breathe and to take in their surroundings then they went on and out of sight when they had disappeared the stranger spoke in a changed tone poor devils i wonder what theyve done and you he turned to phillips what sins have you committed oh just the ordinary ones but i dont look at it that way this is a sort of a lark for me and im having a great time its pretty fierce ill admit but i wouldnt miss it for anything would you would i in a minute youre young im old ive got rheumatism and a partner he cant pack enough grub for his own lunch and i have to do it all hes a jonah too born on friday or something last night somebody stole a sack of our bacon sixty pounds and every pound had cost me sweat again the speaker ground his teeth vindictively lord id like to catch the fellow that did it id take a drop of blood for every drop of sweat that bacon cost have you lost anything i havent anything to lose im packing for wages to earn money enough to buy an outfit after a brief survey of phillips burden the stranger said enviously looks like you wouldnt have to make more than a trip or two i wish i could pack like you do but im stove up at that im better than my partner he couldnt carry a tune there was a pause he eats good though eats like a hired man and he snores so i cant sleep i just lie awake nights and groan at the joints and listen to him grow old he cant even guard our grubpile the vigilantes will put a stop to this stealing pierce ventured think so whos going to keep an eye on them whos going to strangle the stranglers chances are theyre the very ones that are lifting our grub i know these citizens committees whatever the physical limitations of the rheumatic argonaut it was plain that his temper was active and his resentment strong phillips had cooled off by this time in fact the chill breath of the snowfields had begun to penetrate his sodden clothing therefore he prepared to take up his march going through to linderman queried the other man so am i if youll wait a second ill join you maybe we can give each other a hand the speakers motive was patent nevertheless phillips obligingly acceded to his request and a short time later assisted him into his harness whereupon they set out one behind the other pierces pack was at least double the weight of his companions and it gave him a pleasurable thrill to realize that he was one of the strong one of the elect he wondered pityingly how long this feeble middleaged man could last before they had tramped far however he saw that the object of his pity possessed a quality which was lacking in many of the younger stronger stampeders namely a grim determination a dogged perseverance no poor substitute indeed for youth and brawn once the man was in motion he made no complaint and he managed to maintain a very good pace leaving the crest of chilkoot behind them the travelers bore to the right across the snowcap then followed the ridge above crater lake every mile or two they rested briefly to relieve their chafed and aching shoulders they exchanged few words while they were in motion for one soon learns to conserve his forces on the trail but when they lay propped against their packs they talked phillips abundant vigor continued to evoke the elder mans frank admiration he eyed the boy approvingly and plied him with questions before they had traveled many miles he had learned what there was to learn for pierce answered his questions frankly and told him about the sacrifice his family had made in order to send him north about the trip itself about his landing at dyea and all the rest when he came to the account of that shellgame the grizzled stranger smiled ive lived in wideopen countries all my life said the latter but this beats anything i ever saw why the crooks outnumber the honest men and theyre running things to suit themselves one of em tried to lay me me he chuckled as if the mere idea was fantastically humorous have you heard about this soapy smith hes the boss the bellcow and hes made himself mayor of skagway can you beat it ill bet some of his men are on our citizens committee at sheep camp they need a lot of killing they do and theyll get it what did you do after you lost your money i fell in with two brothers and went to packing went partners with them no they phillips face clouded he hesitated briefly i merely lived with them and helped them with their outfit from time to time were at sheep camp now and i share their tent whenever im there im about ready to pull out and go it alone right and dont hook up with anybody the old man spoke with feeling look at me im nesting with a dodo darned graywhiskered milliner hes so ornery i have to hide the ax every time i see him i just yearn to put him out of his misery but i dassent of course he has his points everybody has hes a game old rooster and he loves me thats all that saves him phillips was greatly interested to learn that two men so unfitted for this life this country should have essayed the hardships of the chilkoot trail it amazed him to learn that already most of their outfit was at linderman do you mean to say that you have done all the packing for yourself and your partner he inquired n no old jerry totters across with a package of sodacrackers once in a while you must have heard him he creaks like a gate of course he eats up all the crackers before he gets to linderman and then gorges himself on the heavy grub that ive lugged over but in spite of that weve managed to make pretty good time after a moment of meditation he continued say you ought to see that old buzzard eat its disgusting but its interesting it aint so much the expense that i care about as the work old jerry ought to be in an institution some place where theyve got wheelchairs and a big marketgarden but hes plumb helpless so i cant cut him loose and let him bleach his bones in a strange land i havent got the heart they were resting at the long lake outlet some time later when the old man inquired i presume youve got a camp at linderman eh no i have some blankets cached there and i sleep out whenever i cant make the round trip round trip round trip in one day why thats thirty miles real miles too this country makes a man of a fellow i wouldnt mind sleeping out if i were sure of a hot meal once in a while but money is no good this side of the summit and these people wont even let a stranger use their stoves you cant last long at that my boy phillips smiled cheerfully i dont have to last much longer i sent a thousand dollars to dyea this morning by jim mccaskey one of the fellows i live with hes going to put it in healy hes altogether different to us tenderfeet he made me rather ashamed of myself the elderly man nodded most pioneers are bigcalibered im a sort of pioneer myself but that infernal partner of mine has about ruined my disposition take it by and large though it pays a man to be accommodating chapter iii having crossed the high barrens phillips and his companion dropped down to timberline and soon arrived at linderman their journeys end this was perhaps the most feverishly busy camp on the entire thirtymile dyea trail but unlike the coast towns there was no merrymaking no gaiety no gambling here lindermans fever came from overwork not from overplay a tent village had sprung up at the head of the lake and from dawn until dark it echoed to the unceasing sound of ax and hammer of plane and saw the air was redolent with the odor of freshcut spruce and of boiling tar for this was the shipyard where an army of jasons hewed and joined and fitted each upon a bark of his own making halfway down the lake was the boundary and a few miles below that again was the customs station with its hateful redjacketed police beyond were uncharted waters quite as perilous because quite as unknown as those traversed by that first band of argonauts deep lakes dark canons roaring rapids lay between linderman and the land of the golden fleece but the nearer these men approached those dangers the more eagerly they pressed on already the weedingout process had gone far and the citizens of linderman were those who had survived it the weak and the irresolute had disappeared long since these fellows who labored so mightily to forestall the coming winter were the strong and the fit and the enduring the kind the north takes to herself in spite of his light pack phillips elderly trailmate was all but spent he dragged his feet he stumbled without reason the lines in his face were deeply set and his bearded lips had retreated from his teeth in a grin of exhaustion yonders the tent he said finally and his tone was eloquent of relief in and out among canvas walls and taut guyropes the travelers wound their way emerging at length upon a gravelly beach where vast supplies of provisions were cached all about in various stages of construction were skeletons of skiffs of scows and of barges the ground was spread with a carpet of shavings and sawdust pierces companion paused then after an incredulous stare he said look is that smoke coming from my stovepipe why yes there could be no mistake about it from the tent in question arose the plain evidence that a lively fire was burning inside well ill be darned breathed the elder man somebodys jumped the cache perhaps your partner hes in sheep camp the speaker laboriously loosened his pack and let it fall then with stiff clumsy fingers he undid the top buttons of his vest and to pierces amazement produced a largecalibered revolver which he mechanically cocked and uncocked several times the while his eyes remained hypnotically fixed upon the telltale streamer of smoke not only did his action appear to be totally uncalled for but he himself had undergone a startling transformation and phillips was impelled to remonstrate here what the deuce he began listen to me the old man spoke in a queer suppressed tone and his eyes when he turned them upon his fellowpacker were even smokier than usual somebodys up to a little thievin most likely and it looks like i had em redhanded ive been layin for this pierce divested himself of his packharness then said simply if thats the case ill give you a hand better stand back the other cautioned him i dont need any help this is my line the mans fatigue had fallen from him of a sudden he had become surprisingly alert and forceful he stole forward making as little noise as possible and phillips followed at his back they came to a pause within armslength of the tent flaps which they noted were securely tied hello inside the owner spoke suddenly and with his free hand he jerked at one of the knots there came an answering exclamation a movement then the flaps were seized and firmly held you cant come in cried a voice let go quick the old mans voice was harsh youll have to wait a minute im undressed phillips retreated a step as did the other man they stared at each other a woman pierce breathed lord the owner of the premises slowly reluctantly sheathed his weapon under his left arm i invited myself in the voice explained it was a deeppitched contralto voice i was wet and nobody offered to let me dry out so i took possession of the first empty tent i came to is it yours it is half of it im mighty tired and i aint particular how you look so hurry up as the two men returned for their loads the speaker went on irritably shes got her nerve i spose shes one of these actresses theres a bunch of em on the trail actresses he snorted derisively i bet she smells of cologne and gosh how i hate it when he and pierce returned they were admitted promptly enough and any lingering suspicions of the trespassers intent were instantly dissipated the woman was clad in a short damp underskirt which fell about to her knees she had drawn on the only dry article of apparel in sight a mans sweater jacket she had thrust her bare feet into a pair of beaded moccasins on a line attached to the ridgepole over her head sundry outer garments were steaming phillips first thought was that this woman possessed the fairest the whitest skin he had ever seen it was like milk but his first impressions were confused for embarrassment followed quickly upon his entrance and he felt an impulse to withdraw the trespasser was not at all the sort of person he had expected to find and her complete selfpossession at the intrusion her dignified greeting left him not a little chagrined at his rudeness she eyed both men coolly from a pair of iceblue eyes eyes that bespoke her nationality quite as plainly as did her features her dazzling complexion and her head of fine straight flaxen hair she was scandinavian she was a norsewoman that much was instantly apparent she appeared to derive a certain malicious pleasure now from the consternation her appearance evoked there was a hint of contempt of defiance in her smile in a voice so lowpitched that its quality alone saved it from masculinity she said pray dont be distressed you merely startled me thats all my indians managed to get hold of some hootch at tagish and upset our canoe just below here it was windy and of course they couldnt swim none of them can you know so i had hard work to save them ive already explained how i happened to select this particular refuge your neighbors her lip curled disdainfully then she shrugged well i never got such a reception as they gave me but i suppose theyre cheechakos ill be off for dyea early in the morning if you can put me up for the night ill pay you well during this speech delivered in a matteroffact businesslike tone the owner of the tent had managed to overcome his first surprise he removed his hat now and began with an effort im a bad hand at begging pardons miss but you see ive been suffering the pangs of bereavement lately over some dear departed grub i thought you were a thief and i looked forward to the pleasure of seeing you dance i apologize would you mind telling me where you came from from dawson there was a silence the while the flaxenhaired woman eyed her interrogator less disdainfully yes by polingboat and birchbark im not fleeing the law im not a cacherobber youre all alone the woman nodded can you stow me away for the night you may name your own price the price wont cripple you im sorry there aint some more women here at linderman but there aint we had one a doctors wife but shes gone i met her at lake marsh weve a lot more coming but theyre not here my name is linton the moreorless christian prefix thereto is tom ive got a partner named jerry put the two together and drink hearty this young man is mr the speaker turned questioningly upon phillips who made himself known im a family man mr phillips is a well hes a good packer thats all i know about him im safe and sane but hes about the right age to propose marriage to you as soon as he gets his breath a pretty woman in this country has to expect that as you probably know the woman smiled and shook hands with both men exchanging a grip as firm and as strong as theirs i am the countess courteau said she the which mr linton queried with a start the countess laughed frankly it is french but im a dane i think my husband bought the title theyre cheap in his country he was a poor sort of count and im a poor sort of countess but im a good cook a very good cook indeed and if youll excuse my looks and permit me to wear your sweater ill prepare supper lintons eyes twinkled as he said ive never et with the nobility and i dont know as id like their diet for a steady thing but the bakingpowder is in that box and we fry with bacon grease wood and water were handy the countess courteau had a quick and capable way therefore supper was not long delayed the tent was not equipped for housekeeping hence the diners held their plates in their laps and either harpooned their food from the fryingpan or ladled it from tin cans but even so it had a flavor tonight so unaccustomed so different that both men grasped the poignant fact that the culinary art is mysteriously wedded to female hands mr linton voiced this thought in his own manner if a countess cooks like this he observed id sure love to board with a duke later while the dishes were being washed and when his visitor had shown no intention of explaining her presence in further detail he said whimsically see here maam our young friend has been watching you like he was afraid youd disappear before he gets an eyeful and its plain to be seen that hes devoured by curiosity as for me im totally lacking in that miserable trait and i abhor it in others but all the same if you dont see fit to tell us pretty quick how you came to pole up from dawson and what in heavens name a woman like you is doing here a lone and without benefit of chaperon i shall pass away in dreadful agony its very simple the countess told him i have important business outside i couldnt go down the river for the yukon is low the steamers are aground on the flats and connections at st michaels are uncertain at best naturally i came up against the stream ive been working upstream all my life she flashed him a smile at this latter statement as for a chaperon ive never felt the need of one do you think theyre necessary in this country does your husband count my husband doesnt count thats the trouble the speaker laughed again and without the faintest trace of embarrassment he has been out of the picture for years she turned to phillips and inquired abruptly what is the packing price to sheep camp fifty cents a pound coming this way going back it is nothing he told her gallantly i havent much to carry but if youll take it ill pay you the regular price id like to leave at daylight you seem to be in a rush mr linton hazarded mildly i am now then if you dont mind ill turn in for i must be in dyea tomorrow night pierce phillips had said little during the meal or thereafter to be sure nevertheless he had thought much he had indeed used his eyes to good purpose and now he regretted exceedingly that the evening promised to be so short the more he saw of this unconventional countess the more she intrigued his interest she was the most unusual woman he had ever met and he was eager to learn all about her his knowledge of women was peculiarly elemental his acquaintance with the sex was extremely limited those he had known in his home town were one kind a familiar kind those he had encountered since leaving home were for the most part of a totally different class and of a type that awoke his disapproval to a youth of his training and of his worldly experience the genus woman is divided into two species old women and young women the former are interesting only in a motherly way and demand nothing more than abstract courtesy they do not matter the latter on the contrary separate themselves again into two families or suborders viz good women and bad women the demarcation between the two branches of the suborder is distinct there is nothing common to the two good women are good through and through bad ones are likewise thoroughly bad there are no intermediate types no troublesome variations no hybrids nor crosses the countess courteau it seemed to him was a unique specimen and extremely hard to classify in that she was neither old nor youngor what was even more puzzling in that she was both in years she was not far advanced little older than he in fact but in experience in wisdom in selfreliance she was vastly his superior and experience he believed is what makes women old as to the family the suborder to which she belonged he was at an utter loss to decide for instance she accepted her present situation with a sangfroid equaling that of a camp harpy a few of whom pierce had seen then too she was or had been married to a noaccount foreigner to whom she referred with a calloused and most unwifely flippancy moreover she bore herself with a freedom a boldness quite irreconcilable to the modesty of socalled good women those facts were enough to classify her definitely and yet despite them she was anything but common and it would have taken rare courage indeed to transgress that indefinable barrier of decorum with which she managed to surround herself there was something about her as cold and as pure as blue ice and she gave the same impression of crystal clarity all in all hers was a baffling personality and phillips fell asleep with the riddle of it unanswered he awoke in the morning with it still upon his mind the countess courteau had been first to arise she was fully dressed and the sheetiron stove was glowing when her companions roused themselves by the time they had returned from the lake she had breakfast ready old jerry is going to be awful sore at missing this court function mr linton told her during the meal hes a great ladies man old jerry is perhaps i shall meet him you wouldnt like him if you did nobody likes him except me and i hate him linton sighed hes a handicap to a young man like me why dont you send him home home old jerry would die before hed turn back hed lift his muzzle and bay at the very idea until some stranger terminated him well hes my cross i spose ive got to bear him who is mr linton the countess inquired as she and pierce left the village behind them just an ordinary stampeder like the rest of us i think hes more than that hes the kind wholl go through and make good i dare say his partner is just like him phillips approved of the countess courteau this morning even more thoroughly than he had on the evening previous and they had not walked far before he realized that as a traveler she was the equal of him or of any man she was lithe and strong and light of foot the way she covered ground awoke his sincere admiration she did not trouble to talk much and she dispensed with small talk in others she appeared to be absorbed in her own affairs and only when they rested did she engage in conversation the more phillips studied her and the better acquainted he became with her the larger proportions did she assume not only was she completely mistress of herself but she had a forceful compelling way with others there was a natural air of authority about her and she managed in some subtle manner to invest herself and her words with importance she was quite remarkable now the trail breeds its own peculiar intimacy although the two talked little they nevertheless got to know each other quite well and when they reached the summit about midday phillips felt a keen regret that their journey was so near its end a mist was drifting up from the sea it obscured the valley below and clung to the peaks like ragged garments up and out of this fog came the interminable procession of burdenbearers the countess paused to observe them and to survey the accumulation of stores which crowned the watershed i didnt dream so many were coming said she its getting worse daily pierce told her dyea is jammed and so is skagway the trails are alive with men how many do you think will come theres no telling twenty thirty fifty thousand perhaps about half of them turn back when they see the chilkoot and the rest will wish they had its a hard country not one in a hundred will prosper they picked their way down the drunken descent to the scales then breasted the sluggish human current to sheep camp a group of men were reading a notice newly posted upon the wall of the log building which served as restaurant and hotel and after scanning it pierce explained its another call for a miners meeting were having quite a time with cacherobbers if we catch them well hang them the countess nodded right they deserve it you know we dont have any stealing on the inside now then ill say goodby she paid pierce and extended her hand to him thank you for helping me across ill be in dyea by dark i hope well meet again he said with a slight flush the woman favored him with one of her generous friendly smiles i hope so too youre a nice boy i like you then she stepped into the building and was gone a nice boy phillips was pained a boy and he the sturdiest packer on the pass with perhaps one exception that was hardly just to him if they did meet again and he vowed they would hed show her he was more than a boy he experienced a keen desire to appear well in her eyes to appear mature and forceful he asked himself what kind of man count courteau could be he wondered if he pierce phillips could fall in love with such a woman as this an older woman a woman who had been married it would be queer to marry a countess he reflected as he walked toward his temporary home he beheld quite a gathering of citizens and paused long enough to note that they were being harangued by the confidenceman who had first initiated him into the subtleties of the threeshell game mr broad had climbed upon a raised tent platform and was presenting an earnest argument against capital punishment two strangers upon the fringe of the crowd were talking and pierce heard one of them say of course he wants the law to take its course inasmuch as there isnt any law hes one of the gang the surest way to flush a covey of crooks is to whistle for old judge lynch the other man agreed listen to him have they caught the cacherobbers phillips made bold to inquire no and they wont catch them with fellows like that on the committee the crooks hang together and we dont if i had my way thats just what theyd do hang together id start in by bending a limb over that rascal phillips had attended several of these indignation meetings and remembering that all of them bad proved purposeless he went on toward the mccaskey brothers tent he and the mccaskeys were not the closest of friends in spite of the fact that they had done him a favor a favor by the way for which he had paid many times over nevertheless they were his most intimate acquaintances and he felt an urgent desire to tell them about his unusual experience his desire to talk about the countess courteau was irresistible but when he entered the tent his greeting fell flat for joe the elder mccaskey addressed him sharply almost accusingly say its about time you showed up whats the matter pierce saw that the other brother was stretched out in his blankets and that his head was bandaged hello he cried what ails jim is he sick sick worse than sick joe grumbled that money of yours is to blame for it its a wonder he isnt dead my money how phillips was both mystified and alarmed jim raised himself in his blankets and said irritably after this you can run your own paycar kid im through dyou hear speak out whats wrong jim was stuck up thats whats wrong thats enough isnt it they bent a sixgun over his head and grabbed your coin hes got a dent in his crust the size of a saucer phillips face whitened slowly my money robbed he gasped jim who did it how could you let them the younger mccaskey fell back weakly he waved a feeble gesture at his brother joell tell you im dizzy my head aint right yet a stranger stopped him asked him something or other and another guy flattened him from behind thats all he remembers when he came to he found hed been frisked he was still dippy when he got home so i put him to bed he got up and moved around a bit this morning but hes wrong in his head phillips seated himself upon a candlebox robbed he exclaimed weakly broke again gee that was hard money it was the first i ever earned joe mccaskeys dark face was doubly unpleasant as he frowned down upon the youth thinking about nothing except your coin eh why dont you think about jim he did you a favor and most lost his life oh im sorry of course phillips rose heavily and crossed to the bed i didnt mean to appear selfish i dont blame you jim ill get a doctor for you then you must describe the holdups give me a hint who they are and ill go after them the younger brother rolled his head in negation and mumbled sullenly im all right i dont want a doctor joe explained for him he never saw the fellows before and he dont seem to remember much about them thats natural enough your moneys gone clean kid and a yelp wont get you anything the crooks are organized and if you set up a holler theyll get all of us theyll alibi anybody you accuse its no trick to alibi a pal isnt it the question was uttered unexpectedly it came from the front of the tent and startled the occupants thereof who turned to behold a stranger just entering their premises he was an elderly man he possessed a quick shrewd eye he had poked the tent flap aside with the barrel of a colts revolver through the dooropening could be seen other faces and the bodies of other men who had likewise stolen up unheard during the moment of amazement following his first words these other men crowded in behind him maybe it ll be more of a trick than you figure on the strangers gray mustache lifted in a grin that was not at all friendly what the blazes joe mccaskey exploded go easy the intruder cautioned him weve been laying around waiting for your pal to get back with a movement of the revolver muzzle he indicated phillips now then stretch on your toes and reach high you there get up he addressed himself to jim who rose from his bed and thrust his hands over his bandaged head thats nice the stranger nodded approvingly now dont startle me dont make any quick moves or i may tremble this gun off shes easy on the trigger to his friends he called come in gentlemen theyre gentle there were four of the latter they appeared to be substantial men men of determination all were armed pierce phillips amazement gave way to indignation what is this an arrest or a holdup he inquired its right smart of both the leader of the posse drawled in a voice which betrayed the fact that he hailed from somewhere in the far southwest were in quest of a bag of rice a bag with a rip in it and w k on the side while i slap your pockets just to see if youre ironed these gentlemen are goin to look over your outfit this is an outrage jim mccaskey complained im just getting over one stickup im a sick man sure his brother exclaimed furiously youre a pack of fools what dyou want anyhow we want you to shut up see that you do the old mans eyes snapped if youve got to say something tell us how there happens to be a trail of rice from this mans cache he indicated one of his companions right up to your tent the mccaskeys exchanged glances phillips turned a startled face upon them it isnt much of a trail but its enough to follow for a few moments nothing was said and meanwhile the search of the tent went on when pierce could no longer remain silent he broke out theres some mistake these boys packed this grub from dyea and i helped with some of it arent you partners some one inquired joe mccaskey answered this question no he landed broke we felt sorry for him and took him in joe was interrupted by an exclamation from one of the searchers here it is said the man he had unearthed a bulging canvas sack which he flung down for inspection theres my mark w k and theres the rip i knew we had em right after a brief examination the leader of the posse turned to his prisoners whose hands were still held high saying anything you can think of in the way of explanations youd better save for the miners meeting its waitin to welcome you well put a guard over this plunder till the rest of it is identified now then fall in line and dont crowd after you gentlemen pierce phillips realized that it was useless to argue for his words would not be listened to therefore he followed the mccaskeys out into the open air the odium of this accusation was hard to bear he bitterly resented his situation and something told him he would have to fight to clear himself nevertheless he was not seriously concerned over the outcome public feeling was high to be sure the men of sheep camp were in a dangerous frame of mind and their actions were liable to be hasty illconsideredtheir verdict was apt to be fantastic but secure in the knowledge of his innocence pierce felt no apprehension rather he experienced a thrill of excitement at the contretemps and at the ordeal which he knew was forthcoming the countess courteau had called him a boy this wasnt a boys business this was a real mansized adventure gee what a day this has been he said to himself chapter iv the story of the first trial at sheep camp is an old one but it differs with every telling in the hectic hurry of that goldrush many incidents were soon forgotten and such salient facts as did survive were deeply colored for those were colorful days that trial marked an epoch in early yukon history for although its true significance was unsensed at the time it really signalized the dawn of common honesty on the chilkoot and the chilkat trails and it was the first move taken toward the disruption of organized outlawry a bitter fight by the way which ended only in the tragic death of soapy smith and the flight of his notorious henchmen although the circumstances of the sheep camp demonstration now seem shocking they did not seem so at the time and they served a larger purpose than was at first apparent not only did theft become an unprofitable and an uninteresting occupation thereafter but also the men who shaped a code and drew first blood in defense of it experienced a beneficial reaction and learned to fit the punishment to the crime no easy lesson to learn where life runs hot and where might is right the meeting was in session and it had been harangued into a dangerous frame of mind when pierce phillips and the two mccaskeys were led before it a statement by the leader of the posse corroborated by the owner of the missing sack of rice roused the audience to a fury even while these stories were being told there came other men who had identified property of theirs among the provision piles inside the mccaskey tent and when they too had made their reports the crowd began to mill there were demands for a speedy trial and a swift vengeance these demands found loudest echo among the outlaw element for which lucky broad had acted as mouthpiece although the members of that band were unknown as a matter of fact no man knew his neighbor nevertheless it was plain that there was an organization of crooks and that a strong bond of understanding existed between them now inasmuch as the eye of suspicion had been turned away from them now that a herring had been dragged across the trail their obstructive tactics ended and they too became noisy in their clamor that justice be done the meeting was quickly organized along formal lines and a committee of three was appointed to conduct the hearing the chairman of this committeehe constituted himself chairman by virtue of the fact that he was first nominated made a ringing speech in which he praised his honesty his fairness and his knowledge of the law he complimented the miners for their acumen in selecting for such a position of responsibility a man of his distinguished qualifications it was plain that he believed they had chosen wisely then having inquired the names of his two committeemen he likewise commended them in glowing terms although of course he could not praise them quite as unstintedly as he had praised himself still he spoke well of them and concluded by stating that so long as affairs were left in his hands justice would be safeguarded and the rights of this miserable cringing trio of thieves would be protected albeit killing in his judgment was too mild a punishment for people of their caliber hear hear yelled the mob pierce phillips listened to this speech with a keenly personal and yet a peculiarly detached interest the situation struck him as unreal grotesque and the whole procedure as futile under other circumstances it would have been grimly amusing now he was uncomfortably aware that it was anything but that there was no law whatever in the land save the will of these men in their hands lay life or death exoneration or infamy he searched the faces round about him but could find signs neither of friendship nor of sympathy this done he looked everywhere for a glimpse of a womans strawcolored hair and was relieved to discover that the countess courteau was not in the audience doubtless she had left for dyea and was already some distance down the trail he breathed easier for he did not wish her to witness his humiliation and her presence would have merely added to his embarrassment the prosecutions case was quickly made and it was a strong one even yet the damning trickle of rice grains could be traced through the moss and mire directly to the door of the prisoners tent and the original package identified positively by its owner was put in evidence this in itself was enough testimony from the other men who had likewise recovered merchandise they had missed and mourned merely strengthened the case and further inflamed the minds of the citizens from the first there had never been a doubt in phillips mind that the mccaskeys were guilty the facts offered in evidence served only to explain certain things which had puzzled him at various times nevertheless his indignation and his contempt for them were tempered with regrets for he could not but remember that they had befriended him it was of course imperative that he establish his own innocence but he determined that in so doing he would prejudice their case as little as possible that was no more than the merest loyalty when it came tune to hear the defense the mccaskeys stared at pierce coolly therefore he climbed to the tent platform and faced his accusers he made known his name his birthplace the ship which had borne him north he told how he had landed at dyea how he had lost his last dollar at the gamblingtable how he had appealed to the mccaskey boys and how they had given him shelter that chance association he took pains to explain had continued but had never ripened into anything more anything closer it was in no wise a partnership he had nothing to do with them and they had nothing to do with him inasmuch as the rice had been stolen during the previous night he argued that he could have had no hand in the theft for he had spent the night in linderman which fact he offered to prove by two witnesses produce them ordered the chairman one of them is still at linderman the other was here in sheep camp an hour ago she has probably started for dyea by this time a woman yes sir i brought her across what is her name phillips hesitated the countess courteau said he there was a murmur of interest the members of the committee conferred with one an other do you mean to tell us that youve got a titled witness the selfappointed spokesman inquired his face wore a smile of disbelief when the prisoner flushed and nodded he called out over the heads of the crowd countess courteau there was no answer do any of you gentlemen know the countess courteau he inquired his question was greeted by a general laugh dont let him kid you cried a derisive voice never heard of her but i met four kings last night yelled another call the marquis of queensberry shouted still a third countess courteau repeated the chairman using his hands for a megaphone the cry was taken up by other throats countess courteau countess courteau they mocked come countess nice countess pretty countess there was a ribald note to this mockery which caused phillips eyes to glow she and the count have just left the palace lets get along with the hangin one shrill voice demanded you wont hang me phillips retorted angrily be not so sure taunted the acting judge inasmuch as your countess appears to be constituted of that thin fabric of which dreams are made inasmuch as there is no such animal hol up came a peremptory challenge msieu jodge it was the big french canadian whom pierce had met on the crest of the divide he came forward now pushing his resistless way through the audience wat for you say dere aint nobody by dat name eh he turned his back to the committee and addressed the meeting wat for you hack lak dis anyhow by gosh i heard bout dis lady shes oltimer lak me well trot her out where is she shes on her way to dyea pierce insisted she cant be far poleon doret was angry i don listen to no woman be joke bout you hear dis boy spik true he was in linderman las night for i seen him on top of chilkoot yesterday mysef wit pack on his back so beeg as a barn do you know the accused queried the spokesman poleon turned with a shrug non no but yes i know him lil bit anybody can tell hes hones boy by gar shes strong feller too pack lak hell pierce phillips was grateful for this evidence of faith inconclusive as it was in point of law he was sorry therefore to see the frenchman after replying shortly impatiently to several senseless crossquestions force his way out of the crowd and disappear shaking his head and muttering in manifest disgust at the temper of his townsmen but although one friend had gone another took his place a champion by the way whom pierce would never have suspected of being such profiting by the break in the proceedings lucky broad spoke up frenchy was right this kids on the square he declared im the gentleman who gathered his wheat at dyea he fairly fed it to me like he said so i guess im acquainted with him were all assembled up to mete out justice and justice is going to be met but say a sucker like this boy wouldnt know enough to steal it was doubtful if this witness wellintentioned as he was carried conviction for although his followers took their cue from him and applauded loudly their very manifestations of faith aroused suspicion among the honest men present one of the latter a redfaced squareshouldered person thrust a determined countenance close to broads and cried angrily is that so well im for hangin anybody you boost this sentiment met with such instantaneous second that the confidenceman withdrew precipitately have it your own way he gave in with an airy gesture but take it from me youre a bunch of boobs hangin aint a nice game and the guy that hollers loudest for it is usually the one that needs it worst it took some effort on the part of the chairman to bring the meeting to order so that the hearing could be resumed phillips went on with his story and told of spending the night with tom linton then of his return to sheep camp to learn that he had been robbed of all his savings corroboration of this misfortune he left to the oral testimony of the two brothers mccaskey and to the circumstantial evidence of jims bandaged head while it seemed to him that he had given a simple straightforward account of himself which would establish his innocence so far at least as it applied to the theft of the sack of rice he was uncomfortably aware that evidence of systematic pilfering had been introduced and that evidence he had not met except indirectly his proof seemed good so far as it went but it did not go far and he believed it all too likely that his hearers still considered him an accomplice at the best jim mccaskey was next called and pierce made way for him the younger brother made a poor start but he warmed up to his own defense gaining confidence and ease as he talked in the first place both he and joe were innocent of this outrageous charge as innocent as unborn babes and this air of suspicion was like to smother them this jim declared upon his honor the evidence was strong he admitted but it was purely circumstantial and he proposed to explain it away he proposed to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth letting the blame fall where it would and leaving the verdict entirely up to his hearers joe would substantiate his every statement it was quite true that he and his brother had been good samaritans they had opened their doors and had taken in this young man when he was hungry and homeless but that was their habit they had fed him they had shared their blankets with him they had helped him in a thousand ways not without serious inconvenience to themselves why only on the day before the speaker himself had volunteered to take the young mans earnings to dyea for safekeeping thereby letting himself in for an unmerciful mauling and suffering a semifractured skull the marks of which would doubtless stay with him for a long time phillips had left camp early the previous morning to be sure and he had not come home until an hour or two ago but where he had gone how he had occupied himself during his absence where he had spent the night of course the speaker had no way of knowing phillips was often absent at night he came and he went at all hours and neither joe nor the witness ever questioned him believing his statements that he was packing for hire neither his brother nor he had ever seen that sack of rice antil it was uncovered by the posse and as for the other plunder it was all part and parcel of an outfit which their guest had been assembling for some time they supposed of course that he had bought it bit by bit with his earnings pierce phillips listened in speechless amazement scarcely believing his own ears the while jim mccaskey struck the fetters from his own and his brothers limbs and placed them upon his it seemed impossible that such a story could carry weight but from all indications it did when joe mccaskey took the center of the stage and glibly corroborated his brothers statements pierce interrupted him savagely only to be warned that hed better be silent thats all weve got to say concluded the elder of the precious pair when he had finished you can judge for yourselves who did the stealing jim and ive got all the grub we want this fellow hasnt any have you anything to say for yourself the chairman addressed himself to phillips i have pierce again took the stand youre making a great mistake he said earnestly these men have lied theyre trying to save themselves at my expense ive told you everything now i demand that you wait to hear the countess courteau or mr linton theyll prove where i spent last night at least mr chairman a stranger claimed general attention ive listened to the evidence and its strong enough for me the grub didnt get up and walk away by itself somebody took it grub is more than grub in this country its more than money its a mans life thats what it is now then the mccaskeys had an outfit when they landed they didnt need to steal but this fellow this dirty ingrate he hadnt a pound i dont swallow his countess story and i dont care a hoot where he was last night lets decide first what punishment a thief gets then lets give it to him hear hear came the cry hanging is good enough for thieves shouted the choleric individual who had so pointedly made known his distrust of lucky broad i say stretch em right lets make an example hang him there rose a hoarse chorus of assent to this suggestion whereupon the chairman stepped forward all those in favor of hanging he began but again he was interrupted by poleon doret who once more bored his way into the crowd crying wait i got someting to say he was breathing heavily as if from a considerable exertion perspiration stood upon his face his eyes were flashing he vaulted lightly to the platform then flung out his long arms crying you hack lak crazee mans wat talk is dis bout hangin you aint wild hanimals the redfaced advocate of the noose who had spoken a moment before answered him in a loud voice i paid hard money for my grub and ive packed every pound of it on my back you can take a marks life by stealing his matches the same as by shooting him i want to see thieves on the end of a rope doret bent down to him all right msieu you want blood we give it to you bring on dat rope ill put it on dis boys neck if youll do de pullin for me i aint care bout killin nobody but you youre brave man you hang

mebbe you got pardner wat lak give you hand eh he raised his head and laughed at the crowd messieurs you see how tis it tak brave man to hang a feller lak dis some day policemans goin come along an say by gar i been lookin for you long tarn de new jodge at dyea he tell me you murder a boy at sheep camp spose you come wit me an do little hangin yoursef no messieurs we aint hinjuns were good sensible peoples eh a member of the committee one who had hitherto acted a passive part now stepped forward frenchy has put it right he acknowledged well have courts in this country some day and well have to answer to them miners law is all right so far as it goes but i wont be a party to a murder thats what this would be murder if youre going to talk hanging you can take me off of your committee lucky broad uttered a yelp of encouragement hangin sounds better n it feels he declared think it over you family men when you make your stakes and go home little johnnys going to climb onto your knee and say papa tell me why you hung that man at sheep camp and youll say why son we hung him because he stole a sack of rice like hell you will poleon doret regained public attention by saying messieurs i got sprise for you he lifted himself to his toes and called loudly over the heads of the assembled citizens dis way madame from the direction he was looking there came a swiftly moving figure the figure of a tall woman with strawgold hair men gave way before her she hurried straight to the tent platform where poleon leaned down took her beneath her arms and swung her lightly up beside him madame de countess courteau he announced then with a flourish he swept off his knitted cap and bowed to the newcomer to those beneath him he cried sharply tak off dose hat or i knock dem off the countess too had evidently made haste for she was breathing deeply she flashed a smile at pierce phillips then said so that all could hear i understand you accuse this young man of stealing something last night well he was in linderman he brought me over today we dont care so much about the rice this stealing has been going on for a long time a bystander explained true but the rice was stolen last night wasnt it the man who stole it probably stole the other stuff theyre two to one pierce told her theyre trying to saw it off on me the countess turned and stared at the mccaskey brothers who met her look defiantly ban she exclaimed i havent heard the evidence for i was on my way to dyea when mr she glanced inquiringly at poleon he bowed again doret said he napoleon doret when mr doret overtook me but im willing to wager my life that this boy isnt a thief again she smiled at phillips and he experienced a tumult of conflicting emotions never had he seen a woman like this one who radiated such strength such confidence such power she stood there like a goddess a splendid creature fashioned of snow and gold she dominated the assembly he was embarrassed that she should find him in this predicament shamed that she should be forced to come to his assistance nevertheless he was thrilled at her ready response it was the elder mccaskey who next claimed attention weve made our spiel he began then he launched into a repetition of his former statement of facts the countess stepped to pierces side inquiring quickly what is this a joke i thought so at first but it looks as if ill be cutting figure eights on the end of a tentrope what makes them think you did the stealing the mccaskeys swear i did you see i had no outfit of my own are you broke n no i wasnt yesterday i am now in a few sentences pierce made known the facts of his recent loss and pointed to jim mccaskeys bandaged head when the elder brother had concluded the countess again addressed the meeting you men take it for granted that phillips did the stealing because he needed grub said she as a matter of fact he wasnt broke he had a thousand dollars and say who hired you to argue this case it was jim mccaskey speaking he had edged his way forward and was scowling darkly at the woman whats the idea anyhow are you stuck on this kid the countess courteau eyed her interrogator coolly her cheeks maintained their even coloring her eyes were as icy blue as ever it was plain that she was in no wise embarrassed by his insinuation very quietly she said ill tell you whether i am if youll tell me who got his thousand dollars was it your brother jim mccaskey recoiled his face whitened who hit you over the head the woman persisted did he thats none of your business jim shouted i want to know what youre doing in this case you say the kid was in linderman last night well i say youre a how dyou know he was there how dyou know he didnt steal that rice before he left for that matter i know he was in linderman because i was with him with him all night the speaker grinned insultingly yes all night i slept in the same tent with him and now ive got your number the younger mccaskey cried in triumph bah the countess shrugged unconcernedly as for the rice being stolen before he countess ha jim burst forth again swell countess you are the dyea dancehalls are full of countesses like you counting percentage checks boys who are you going to believe she slept all night mccaskey got no further for with a cry of rage pierce phillips set his muscles and landed upon him it was a mighty blow and it found lodgment upon the side of its victims face jim mccaskey went down and his assailant maddened completely by the feel of his enemys flesh lunged forward to stamp him beneath his heels but stout arms seized him bodies intervened and he was hurled backward a shout arose there was a general scramble for the raised platform there were yells of shame hang on to him stretch him up dirty ingrate phillips fought with desperation his struggles caused the structure to creak and to strain men piled over it and joined in the fight he was whining and sobbing in his fury meanwhile ready hands had rescued jim from the trampling feet and now held his limp body erect it was the clarion call of the countess courteau which first made itself heard above the din she had climbed to the railing and was poised there with one arm outflung a quivering finger leveled at jim mccaskeys head look she cried look men at his head theres proof that hes been lying the victim of the assault had lost his cap in the scuffle and with it had gone the bandage his head was bare now and oddly enough it showed no matted hair no cut no bruise no swelling it was in fact a perfectly normal healthy wellpreserved cranium phillips ceased his struggles he passed a shaking hand over his eyes to clear his vision his captors released him and crowded closer to jim mccaskey who was now showing the first signs of returning consciousness he told you he was held up that his skull was cracked didnt he the countess threw back her head and laughed unrestrainedly my but you men are fools now then who do you suppose got young phillips money use your wits men there was a great craning of necks a momentary hush the while jim mccaskey rolled his head loosely opened his eyes and stared wildly about the countess bent down toward him and now her cheeks had grown white her blue eyes were flaming well my man she cried in a shaking voice now you know what kind of a woman i am counting percentage checks eh she seemed upon the point of reaching out and throttling jim with her long strong fingers lets see you and your precious brother do a little counting count out a thousand dollars for this boy quick it was poleon doret who searched the palsied victim while other hands restrained the older brother he went through the younger one and having done so handed pierce phillips a bulky envelope addressed in the latters handwriting shes yours eh poleon inquired phillips made a hasty examination then nodded the countess turned once more to the crowd i move that you apologize to mr phillips are you game her question met with a yell of approval now then theres a new case on the docket and the charge is highway robbery are you ready to vote a verdict her face was set her eyes still flashed guilty came with a roar very well hang the ruffians if you feel like it she leaped down from her vantagepoint and without a word without a glance behind her set out along the dyea trail chapter v looked kind of salty for a spell didnt it the grizzled leader of the posse he who had effected the capture of the thieves was speaking to pierce well im due for a private apology i hope you cherish no hard feelings eh none whatever sir im only too glad to get out whole and get my money back it was quite an experience already phillips mind had ranged the events of the last crowded hour into some sort of order his fancy had tinged them with a glamour already turning rosy with romance and he told himself that his thrills had been worth their price lucky that woman showed up who is she phillips shook his head in his turn he inquired what are you going to do with the mccaskeys the elder mans face hardened i dont know this talk about hangin makes me weary id hang em id kick a barl out from under either of em ive done such things and i never had any bad dreams but it was plain that the sentiment favoring such extreme punishment had changed for a suggestion was made to flog the thieves and send them out of the country this met with instant response a motion was put to administer forty lashes and it was carried with a whoop preparations to execute the sentence were immediately instituted a scourge was prepared by wiring nine heavy leather thongs to a whiphandle the platform was cleared and a call was issued for a man to administer the punishment some delay ensued at this point but finally a burly fellow volunteered climbed to the stage and removed his canvas coat since the younger mccaskey appeared to be still somewhat dazed from the rough handling he had suffered his brother was thrust forward the latter was stripped to the waist his wrists were firmly bound then trussed up to one of the stout endpoles of the tentframe which skeletonlike stood over the platform this done the committee fell back and the wielder of the whip stepped forward the crowd had watched these grim proceedings intently it became quite silent now the hour was growing late the day had been overcast and a damp chill that searched the marrow was settling as the short afternoon drew to a close the prisoners naked body showed very white beneath his shock of coalblack hair his flesh seemed tender and the onlookers stared at it in fascination joe mccaskey was a man of nerve he held himself erect there was defiance in the gaze which he leveled at the faces below him but his brother jim was not made of such stern stuff he was the meaner the more cowardly of the pair and these methodical preparations the certainty of his own forthcoming ordeal bred in him a desperate panic the sight of his brothers flesh bared to the bite of the lash brought home to him the horrifying significance of a flogging and then as if to emphasize that significance the executioner gave his catoninetails a practice swing as the lashes hissed through the air the victim at the post stiffened rigidly but his brother outside the inclosure writhed in his tracks and uttered a faint moan profiting by the inattention of his captors jim mccaskey summoned his strength and with an effort born of desperation wrenched himself free hands grasped at him as he bolted bodies barred his way but he bore them down before the meaning of the commotion had dawned upon the crowd at large he had fought his way out and was speeding down the street but fleetfooted men were at his heels a roar of rage burst from the mob and in a body it took up the chase down the stumpy muddy trail went the pursuit and every command to halt spurred the fleeing man to swifter flight cabin doors opened people came running from their tents some tried to fling themselves in the way of the escaping criminal packers toiling up the trail heard the approaching clamor shook off their burdens and endeavored to seize the figure that came bounding ahead of it but jim dodged them all failing in their attempt to intercept him these newcomers joined the chase and the fugitive once the first frenzy of excitement had died in him heard their footsteps gaining on him he was stark mad by now black terror throttled him then some one fired a shot that shot was followed by others there came a scattered fusillade and with a mighty leap jim mccaskey fell he collapsed in midair he was dead when his pursuers reached him mob spirit is a peculiar thing its vagaries are difficult to explain or to analyze some trivial occurrence may completely destroy its temper or again merely serve to harden it and give it edge in this instance the escape the flight the short swift pursuit and its tragic ending had the effect not of sobering the assembled citizens of sheep camp not of satisfying their longslumbering rage but of inflaming it of intoxicating them to a state of insane triumph like the paris mobs that followed shouting in the wake of the tumbrels bound for the guillotine these men came trooping back to the scene of execution and as they came they bellowed hoarsely and they waved their arms men react powerfully to environment they put on rough ways with rough clothes smooth pavements soap and hot water safetyrazors are strong civilizing agents but a man begins to revert in the time it takes his beard to grow these fellows had left the world they knew behind them they were in a world they knew not old standards had fallen new standards had been reared new values had attached to crime therefore they demanded that the business in hand go on such was the spirit of the chilkoot trail at the first stroke of the descending whip a howl went up a merciless howl a howl of fierce exultation joe mccaskey rocked forward upon the balls of his feet his frame was racked by a spasm of agony he strained at his thongs until his shoulder muscles swelled the flesh of his back knotted and writhed livid streaks leaped out upon it then turned crimson and began to trickle blood one roared the mob the wielder of the scourge swung his weapon again again the leather strips wrapped around the victims ribs and laid open their defenseless covering two mccaskey lunged forward then strained backward the tentframe creaked as he pulled at it his head was drawn far back between his shoulders his face was convulsed and his gums were bared in a skyward grin if he uttered any sound it was lost in the uproar three it was a frightful punishment the mans flesh was being stripped from his bones four five the count went on monotonously for the fellow with the whip swung slowly putting his whole strength behind every blow when it had climbed to eight the prisoners body was dripping with blood his trousersband was sodden with it when it had reached ten he hung suspended by his wrists and only a fierce involuntary muscular reaction answered the caress of the nine lashes forty stripes had been voted as the penalty but poleon doret vaulted to the platform seized the upraised whip and tore it from the executioners hand he turned upon the crowd a countenance white with fury and disgust enough he shouted by gar you keel him next if you mus wip somebody wip me dis feller is mos dead he strode to the post and with a slash of his huntingknife cut mccaskey down this action was greeted by an angry yell of protest there was a rush toward the platform but poleon was joined by the leader of the posse who scrambled through the press and ranged himself in opposition to the audience the old man was likewise satiated with this torture his face was wet with sweat beneath his drooping gray mustache his teeth were set back up you hyenas he cried shrilly the shows over the man took his medicine and he took it like a man hes had enough gimme the whip ill finish the job some one shouted the former speaker bent forward abristle with defiance you try it he spat out you touch that whip and by god ill kill you he lent point to this threat by drawing and cocking his sixshooter if you men aint had enough blood for one day ill let a little more for you his words ended in a torrent of profanity climb aboard he shrilled whos got the guts to try doret spoke to him shortly dese men aint goin mak no trouble msieu with that he turned his back and heedless of the clamor began to minister to the bleeding man he had provided himself with a bottle of lotion doubtless some antiseptic snatched from the canvas drugstore down the street and with this he wet a handkerchief then he washed mccaskeys lacerated back a member of the committee joined him in this work of mercy soon others came to their assistance and gradually the crowd began breaking up some one handed the sufferer a drink of whisky which revived him considerably and by the time he was ready to receive his upper garments he was to some extent master of himself joe mccaskey accepted these attentions without a word of thanks without a sign of gratitude he appeared to be numbed paralyzed by the nervous shock he had undergone and yet he was not paralyzed for his eyes were intensely alive they were wild baleful his roving glance was like poison to the men it fell upon youre due to leave camp he was told and youre going to take the first boat from dyea is there anything you want to say anything you want to do before you go i want something to eat joe answered hoarsely im hungry these were the first words he had uttered they met with astonishment nevertheless he was led to the nearest restaurant surrounded by a silent curious group he crouched over the board counter and wolfed a ravenous meal when he had finished he rose turned and stared questioningly at the circle of hostile faces his eyes still glittered with that basilisk glare of hatred and defiance there was something huge disconcerting about the man not once had he appealed for mercy not once had he complained not once had he asked about his brother he showed neither curiosity nor concern over jims fate and now he betrayed the utmost indifference to his own he merely shifted that venomous stare from one face to another as if indelibly to photograph each and every one of them upon his mind but the citizens of sheep camp were not done with him yet his hands were again bound this time behind him a blanket roll was roped upon his shoulders upon his breast was hung a staring placard which read i am a thief spit on me and send me along thus decorated he met his crowning indignity extending from the steps of the restaurant far down the street twin rows of men had formed and this gauntlet joe mccaskey was forced to run he bore this ordeal as he had borne the other men jeered at him they flung handfuls of wet moss and mud at him they spat upon him some even struck him bound as he was sickened at the sight pierce phillips witnessed the final chapter of this tragedy into which the winds of chance had blown him for one instant only did his eyes meet those of his former tentmate but during that brief glance the latter made plain his undying hatred mccaskeys gaze intensified his upper lip drew back in a grimace similar to that which he had lifted to the sky when agony ran through his veins like fire he seemed to concentrate the last ounce of his souls energy in the sending of some wordless message hellish fury a threat too baneful too ominous for expression dwelt in that stare then a splatter of mire struck him in the face and blotted it out when the last jeer had died away when the figure of joe mccaskey had disappeared into the misty twilight phillips drew a deep breath what a day this had been what a tumult he had lived through what an experience he had undergone this was an adventure he had lived he had made an enemy life had come his way and the consciousness of that fact caused him to tingle this would be something to talk about what would the folks back home say to this and the countess that wonderful woman of ice and fire that superwoman who could sway the minds of men whose wit was quicker than light well she had saved him saved his good name if not his neck and his life was hers who was she what mission brought her here what hurry crowded on her heels what idle chance had flung them into each others arms or was it idle chance was there such a thing as chance after all were not mens random fortunes all laid out in conformity with some obscure purpose to form a part of some intricate design dust he was dust blown upon the breath of the north as were these other human atoms which had been borne thither from the farthest quarters of the earth but when that dust had settled would it not arrange itself into patterns mapped out at the hour of birth or long before somehow he believed that such would be the case as for the countess his way was hers her way was his he could not bear to think of losing her she was big she was great she drew him by the spell of some strange magic the peppery old man who with dorets help had defied the miners meeting approached him to inquire say why didnt old tom come back with you from linderman old tom sure old tom linton were pardners im jerry quirk he was tired out tired mr quirk snorted derisively what tired him he cant tote enough grub to satisfy his own hunger me im doubletrippin relayin our stuff to the summit and breakin my back at it i cant make him understand wed ought to keep the outfit together hes got it scattered like a mad womans hair but old toms in the sere and yellow leaf hes onnery like all old men i try to humor him but heres a limit the speaker looked pierce over shrewdly you said you was packin for wages well old tom aint any help to me you look strong mebbe i could hire you phillips shook his head i dont want work just now said he im going to dyea in the morning jim mccaskey was buried where he had fallen and there beside the trail so that all who passed might read and ponder the men of sheep camp raised a board with this inscription here lies the body of a thief chapter vi a certain romantic glamour attaches to all new countries but not every man is responsive to it to the person who finds enjoyment preoccupation in studying a ruin or in contemplating glories triumphs dramas long dead and gone old buildings old cities and old worlds sound a resistless call the past is peopled with impressive figures to be sure it is a tapestry into which are woven scenes of tremendous significance and events of the greatest moment and it is quite natural therefore that the majority of people should experience greater fascination in studying it than in painting new scenes upon a naked canvas with colors of their own imagining to them new countries are crude uninteresting but there is another type of mind which finds a more absorbing spell in the contemplation of things to come than of things long past another temperament to which the proven and the tried possess a flat and tasteless flavor they are restless anticipative people they are the ones who blaze trails to them great cities established order the intricate structure of wellsettled life are both monotonous and oppressive they do not thrive well thereunder but put them out on the fringe of things transplant them to wild soil and the sap runs they flower rankly to pierce phillips the new surroundings into which he had been projected were intensely stimulating they excited him as he had never been excited and each day he awoke to the sense of new adventures life as he had known it had always been good and full too for that matter and he had hugely enjoyed it nevertheless it had impressed upon him a sense of his own insignificance he had been lost submerged in it here on the threshold of a new world he had begun to find himself and the experience was delightful by some magic he had been lifted to a common level with every other man and no one had advantage over him the momentous future was as much his as theirs and the god of luck was in charge of things there was a fever in the very air he breathed the food he ate the water he drank life ran at a furious pace and it inspired in him supreme exhilaration to be swept along by it over all this new land was a purple haze of mystery a sense of the unknown right at hand the beyond was beckoning it was as if great curtains had parted and he beheld vistas of tremendous promise keenest of all perhaps was his joy at discovering himself appreciation of this miraculous rebirth was fullest when at rare intervals he came off the trail and back to dyea for then he renewed his touch with that other world and the contrast became more evident dyea throbbed nowadays beneath a mighty head of steam it had grown surprisingly and it was intensely alive phillips never came back to it without an emotional thrill and a realization of great issues great undertakings in process of working out the knowledge that he had a part in them aroused in him an intoxicating pleasure dyea had become a metropolis of boards and canvas of logs and corrugated iron stores had risen there were hotels and lodginghouses busy restaurants and busier saloons whence came the sounds of revelry by night and by day it was a healthy revelry by the way like the boisterous hilarity of a robust boy dyea was just that an overgrown hilarious boy there was nothing querulous or sickly about this child it was strong it was sturdy it was rough it romped with everybody and it grew out of its clothes overnight every house every tent in the town was crowded supply never quite overtook demand packanimals were being imported bridges were being built the swamps were being hastily corduroyed there was talk of a tramway up the side of the chilkoot but the gold rush increased daily and despite better means of transportation the call for packers went unanswered and the price per pound stayed up new tribes of indians from down the coast had moved thither babies and baggage and they were growing rich the stampede itself resembled the spring run of the silver salmon it was equally mad equally resistless it was equally wasteful too for birds and beasts of prey fattened upon it and the outsetting current bore a burden of derelicts values were extravagant money ran like water the town was wide open and it took toll from every newcomer the ferment was kept active by a trickle of outgoing klondikers a considerable number of whom passed through on their way back to the states these men had been educated to the liberal ways of the inside country and were prodigal spenders the scent of the salt sea the sight of new faces the proximity of the open world were like strong drink to them hence they untied their mooseskin pokes and scattered the contents like sawdust their tales of the new el dorado stimulated a similar recklessness among their hearers to a boy like pierce phillips in whom the spirit of youth was a flaming torch all this spelled glorious abandon a supreme riot of olympic emotions precisely what reason he had for coming to town this morning he did not know nevertheless he was drawn seaward as by a mighty magnet he told himself that ordinary gratitude demanded that he thank the countess courteau for her service to him but as a matter of fact he was less interested in voicing his gratitude than in merely seeing her again he was not sure but that she would resent his thanks nevertheless it was necessary to seek her out for already her image was nebulous and he could not piece together a satisfactory picture of her she obsessed his thoughts but his intense desire to fix her indelibly therein had defeated its purpose and had blurred the photograph who was she what was she where was she going what did she think of him the possibility that she might leave dyea before answering those questions spurred him into a gait that devoured the miles but when he turned into the main street of the town his haste vanished and a sudden embarrassment overtook him what would he say to her now that he was here how would he excuse or explain his obvious pursuit would she see through him if so what light would kindle in those iceblue eyes the countess was an unusual woman she knew men she read them clearly and she knew how to freeze them in their tracks pierce felt quite sure that she would guess his motives therefore he made up his mind to dissemble cunningly he decided to assume a casual air and to let chance arrange their actual meeting when he did encounter her a quick smile of pleased surprise on his part a few simple words of thanks a manly statement that he was glad she had not left before his duties permitted him to look her up and she would be completely deceived thereafter fate would decree how well or how badly they got acquainted yes that was the way to go about it having laid out this admirable program he immediately defied it by making a beeline for the main hotel a big board structure still in process of erection his feet carried him thither in spite of himself like a homingpigeon he went and instinct guided him unerringly for he found the countess courteau in the office she was dressed as on the day before but by some magic she had managed to freshen and to brighten herself in her hand she held her travelingbag she was speaking to the proprietor as pierce stepped up behind her fifteen thousand dollars as it stands he heard her say thats my price ill make you a present of the lumber the queen leaves in twenty minutes the proprietor began to argue but she cut him short thats my last word three hundred per cent on your money but think it over her tone was cool her words were crisp i take the lighter in ten minutes she turned to find phillips at her shoulder good morning her face lit up with a smile she extended her hand and he seized it as a fish swallows a bait he blushed redly im late he stammered i mean i i hurried right in to tell you so they didnt hang you no you were wonderful i couldnt rest until i had told you how deeply grateful nonsense the countess shrugged her shoulders im glad you came before i left youre not going away he queried with frank apprehension in ten minutes see here it was the hotel proprietor who addressed the woman you cant possibly make it before snow flies and the boats are overloaded coming north they cant handle the freight theyve got ill be back in three weeks the countess asserted positively ill bring my own packtrain if something should delay me ill open up here and put you out of business this town will be good for a year or two you cant threaten me the fellow blustered twenty thousand is my price goodby the countess turned once more to pierce are you leaving for good he inquired despondently unable to dissemble bless you no ill probably die in this country im going out on business but ill be back in dawson ahead of the ice youll be going across soon i dare say come walk down to the beach with me together they left the building and found their way to the landingplace where a lighter was taking on passengers for the steamship queen i suppose you know how sorry i am for what happened yesterday pierce began the countess looked up from her abstracted contemplation of the scene there was a faint inquiry in her face sorry i should think youd be about the happiest boy in dyea i mean what jim mccaskey said id have killed him if i could i tried to oh the woman nodded her teeth gleamed in a smile that was not at all pleasant i heard about the shooting this morning i meant to ask you about it but i was thinking of other things she measured the burly frame of the young man at her side and the vindictiveness died out of her expression phillips was good to look at he stood a full six feet in height his closecropped hair displayed a shapely head and his features were well molded he was a handsome open lad the countess acknowledged aloud she said i dare say every woman loves to have a man fight for her i do my own fighting usually but its nice to have a champion her gaze wandered back to the hotel then up the pineflanked valley toward the chilkoot her abstraction returned she appeared to weigh some intricate mathematical calculation with his hands in his pockets the hotelkeeper came idling down to the waters edge and approaching his departing guest said carelessly ive been thinking it over maam there isnt room for two of us here i might make it seventeen thousand five hundred if fifteen no more there came a signal from the steamer in the offing the countess extended her hand to pierce goodby if youre still here three weeks from now you may be able to help me then she joined the procession up the gangplank but the hotelkeeper halted her fifteen is a go he said angrily the countess courteau stepped back out of the line very well make out the bill of sale ill meet you at healy wilsons in ten minutes a moment later she smiled at pierce and heaved a sigh of relief well i brought him to time didnt i id never have gone aboard id have paid him twentyfive thousand dollars as a matter of fact but he hadnt sense enough to see it i knew i had him when he followed me down here what have you bought that hotel yonder all but the lumber all but the lumber why there isnt much else pierce was more than a little astonished oh yes there is dishes hardware glass beds bedding windows fixtures everything inside the building thats what i bought thats all i wanted ill have the place wrecked and the stuff packed up and on mens backs in two days it cost i dont know what it cost and i dont care the fellow was perfectly right though i havent time to get to seattle and back again know any men who want work i want it know any others pierce shook his head find some the more the better carpenters first if there are any the speaker was all business now youre working for me from this minute understand treat me right and ill treat you right ill take you through to dawson i want carpenters packers boatmen they must work fast long hours long chances big pay thats what it will mean that outfit must be in dawson ahead of the ice such a thing has never been done it cant be done but ill do it do you want to tackle the job phillips eyes were dancing ill eat it up he cried breathlessly good i think youll do wait for me at the hotel with a brisk nod she was off leaving him in a perfect whirl of emotions her man she had called him that fast work long hours long chances an impossible task what happy impulse had sped him to town this morning ten minutes was the narrow margin by which he had won his opportunity and now the door to the north had opened at a womans touch inside lay everything she thought hed do why she must know hed do she must know hed give up his life for her he pinched himself to ascertain if he were dreaming the northern hotel was less than threequarters built but within an hour after it had changed ownership it was in process of demolition the countess courteau was indeed a lightning striker while phillips went through the streets offering double wages to men who could wield hammer and saw and the possibility of transportation clear to dawson for those who could handle an oar she called off the building crew and set them to new tasks then she cleared the house of its guests rooms were invaded with peremptory orders to vacate the steady help was put to undoing what they had already done and soon the premises were in tumult such rooms as had been completed were dismantled even while the protesting occupants were yet gathering their belongings together beds were knocked down bedding was moved out windows doorknobs hinges fixtures were removed dishes lamps mirrors glassware were assembled for packing through all this din and clatter the countess courteau passed spurring the wreckers on to speed yielding to phillips knowledge of transportation problems and limitations she put him in general charge and before he realized it he found that he was in reality her first lieutenant toward evening a ship arrived and began to belch forth freight and passengers whereupon there ensued a rush to find shelter pierce was engaged in dismantling the office fixtures when a stranger entered and accosted him with the inquiry got any rooms no sir were moving this hotel bodily to dawson the newcomer surveyed the littered premises with some curiosity he was a tall grayhaired man with a long impassive face of peculiar ashen color he had lost his left hand somewhere above the wrist and in place of it wore a metal hook with this he gestured stiffly in the direction of a girl who had followed him into the building shes got to have a bed he declared i can get along somehow till my stuff is landed tomorrow im sorry pierce told him but the beds are all down and the windows are out im afraid nobody could get much sleep here for well be at work all night any other hotels some bunkhouses but theyre pretty full money no object i suppose the onearmed man ventured oh none the stranger turned to his companion looks like wed have to sit up till our tents come off i hope theyve got chairs in this town we can stay aboard the ship the girl had a pleasant voice she was in fact a pleasant sight to look upon for her face was quiet and dignified her eyes were level and gray she wore a head of wavy chestnut hair combed neatly back beneath a trim hat alaska during the first rush was a land of pretty women owing to the fact that a large proportion of those who came north did so for the avowed purpose of trading upon that capital but even in such company this girl was noticeable and pierce phillips regarded her with distinct approval you can have my part of that the man told her with a slight grimace this racket is music to the bellow of those steers and it smells better here if i go aboard again ill be hogtied why id rather sit up all night and deal casino to a mad chinaman well manage somehow dad the girl turned to the door and her father followed her he paused for a moment while he ran his eye up and down the busy street looks like old times doesnt it letty then he stepped out of sight when darkness came the wrecking crew worked on by the light of lamps lanterns and candles for the inducement of double pay was potent along about midnight mr lucky broad the shellman picked his way through the bales and bundles and recognizing phillips greeted him familiarly hello kid wheres her nibs the corntassel countess gone to supper well she sprung you didnt she some gal i knew you was all right but them boys was certainly roily pierce addressed the fellow frankly im obliged to you for taking my part i hardly expected it why not i got nothing against you i got a sort of tenderness for guys like you i hate to see em destroyed mr broad grinned widely and his former victim responded in like manner i dont blame you said the latter i was an awful knothead but you taught me a lesson pshaw the confidenceman shrugged his shoulders carelessly the best of em fall for the shells i was up against it and had to get some rough money but its a hard way to make a living these pilgrims squawk so loud it isnt safe youd think their coin was soldered onto em thats why im here i understand her grace is hiring men to go to dawson yes well take a flash at me mr broad stiffened his back arched his chest and revolved slowly upon his heels pretty nifty eh what kind of men does she want packers boatmen principally boatmen fellows who can run white water the new applicant was undoubtedly in a happy and confident mood for he rolled his eyes upward exclaiming devoutly im a gift from heaven born in a batteau and cradled on the waves thats me the countess herself appeared out of the night at this moment and pierce somewhat reluctantly introduced the sharper to her heres an able seaman in search of a job said he able seaman the woman raised her brows inquiringly he said it mr broad nodded affirmatively im a jolly tar a bosuns mate a salthorse wrangler i just jumped a fullrigged ship thimblerigged he winked at phillips and thrust his tongue into his cheek heres my papers from his shirt pocket he took a book of brown ricepapers and a sack of tobacco then deftly fashioned a tiny cigarette roll one for me said the countess why sure mr broad obliged instantly and with a flourish are you really a boatman the woman inquired dont stall for ill find you out pierce undertook to get her eye but she was regarding broad intently and did not see his signal im all of that the latter said seriously im going to move this outfit in small boats two men to a boat double crews through the canon and in swift water can you get a good man to help you hes yours for the askin kid bridges aint his name enough hes a good packer too been packin hay for two months pierce knows him again mr broad winked meaningly at phillips come and see me tomorrow said the countess lucky nodded agreement to this arrangement why dont you load the whole works on a scow he asked youd save men and we could all be together happy family stuff thats what kirbys going to do kirby sam kirby onearmed kirby you know he got in today with a big liquor outfit him and his gal are down at the ophir now playing faro no scow for mine the countess said positively i know what im doing after the visitor had gone pierce spoke his mind albeit with some hesitancy that fellow is a gambler said he and kid bridges is another bridges held my hand for a minute the day i landed and his little display of tenderness cost me one hundred and thirtyfive dollars do you think you want to hire them why not the countess inquired then with a smile they wont hold my hand and they may be very good boatmen indeed she dropped her cigarette stepped upon it then resumed her labors phillips eyed the burntoffering with disfavor until just now he had not known that his employer used tobacco and the discovery came as a shock he had been reared in a close homecircle therefore he did not approve of women smoking in particular he disapproved of the countess his countess smoking after a moment of consideration however he asked himself what good reason there could be for his feeling it was her own affair why shouldnt a woman smoke if she felt like it he was surprised at the unexpected liberality of his attitude this country was indeed working a change in him he was broadening rapidly as a matter of fact he assured himself the countess courteau was an exceptional woman she was quite different from the other members of her sex and the rules of decorum which obtained for them did not obtain for her she was one in ten thousand one in a million yes and he was her man while he was snatching a bit of midnight supper pierce again heard the name of kirby mentioned and a reference to the big game in progress at the ophir recalling lucky broads words he wondered if it were possible that kirby and his girl were indeed the father and daughter who had applied at the northern for shelter it seemed incredible that a young woman of such apparent refinement could be a gamblers daughter but if it were true she was not only the daughter of a sporting man but a very notorious one judging from general comment prompted by curiosity pierce dropped in at the ophir on his way back to work he found the place crowded as usual but especially so at the rear where the games were running when he had edged his way close enough to command a view of the farotable he discovered that sam kirby was for a fact the onearmed man he had met during the afternoon he was seated and close at his back was the grayeyed brownhaired girl with the pleasant voice she was taking no active part in the game itself except to watch the wagers and the cases carefully now and then her father addressed a lowspoken word to her and she answered with a nod a smile or a shake of her head she was quite at ease quite at home she was utterly oblivious to the closepacked ring of spectators encircling the table the sight amazed phillips he was shocked he was mildly angered and mildly amused at the false impression this young woman had given it seemed that his judgment of female types was exceedingly poor who is mr kirby he inquired of his nearest neighbor big sport hes rich or he was i heard he just lost a string of racehorses he makes a fortune and he spends it overnight hes on his way inside now with a big saloon outfit thats letty his girl another man laughed under his breath saying old sam wont bet a nickel unless shes with him hes superstitious i guess he has reason to be shes his rudder the first speaker explained mr kirby rapped sharply upon the table with the steel hook that served as his left hand then when a waiter cleared a passageway through the crowd he mutely invited the house employees to drink the dealer declined the lookout and the casekeeper ordered whisky and kirby signified by a nod that the same would do for him but his daughter laid a hand upon his arm he argued with her briefly then he shrugged and changed his order make it a cigar he said with a smile bosss orders there was a ripple of laughter sams a bad actor when hes drinking one of pierces informants told him letty keeps him pretty straight but once in a while he gets away when he does oh boy long after he had returned to his tasks the memory of that stillfaced girl in the foul tobaccoladen atmosphere of the gamblinghall remained to bother pierce phillips he could not get over his amazement and his annoyance at mistaking her for a well for a good girl early in the morning when he wearily went forth in quest of breakfast and a bed he learned that the game at the ophir was still going on i want you to hire enough packers to take this stuff over in one trip two at the most engage all you can offer any price the countess was speaking she had snatched a few hours sleep and was now back at the hotel as fresh as ever you must take more rest pierce told her youll wear yourself out at this rate she smiled brightly and shook her head but he persisted go back to sleep and let me attend to the work im strong nothing tires me nor me ill rest when we get to dawson have those packers here day after tomorrow morning there were numerous freighters in dyea outfits with animals too some of them but inquiry developed the fact that none were free to accept a contract of this size at such short notice therefore pierce went to the indian village and asked for the chief failing to discover the old man he began a tenttotent search and while so engaged he stumbled upon joe mccaskey the outcast was lying on a bed of boughs his face was flushed and his eyes were bright with fever evidently in avoiding the town he had sought shelter here and the natives had taken him in without question overcoming his first impulse to quietly withdraw pierce bent down to the fellow and said with genuine pity im sorry for you joe is there anything i can do mccaskey stared up at him wildly then a light of recognition kindled in his black eyes it changed to that baleful gleam of hatred his hair lay low upon his forehead and through it he glared his face was covered with a smut of beard which made him even more repellent i thought you were jim he croaked but jims dead youre sick can i help you do you want money or jims dead the man repeated you killed him i nonsense dont talk you killed him you mccaskeys unblinking stare became positively venomous he showed his teeth in a frightful grin you killed him but theres more of us plenty more well get you he appeared to derive a ferocious enjoyment from this threat for he dwelt upon it he began to curse his visitor so foully that pierce backed out of the tent and let the flap fall it had been an unwelcome encounter it left an unpleasant taste in his mouth as he went on in search of the village shaman he heard joe muttering jims dead dead jims dead chapter vii sam kirbys outfit was one of the largest one of the costliest and one of the most complete that had ever been landed on the dyea beach for kirby was a man who did things in a large way he was a plunger he had long since become casehardened to risks and he knew how to weigh probabilities hence the fact that he had staked his all upon one throw did not in the least disturb him many a time he had done the same and the dice had never failed to come out for him possessing a wide practical knowledge of new countries he had shrewdly estimated the klondike discovery at its true worth and had realized that the opportunity for a crowning triumph a final cleanup had come his way this accounted for the energetic manner in which he had set about improving it most men are successful in direct proportion to their ability to select and retain capable assistants fortune had favored sam kirby by presenting him with a daughter whose caution and good sense admirably supplemented his own best qualities and he was doubly blessed in possessing the intense nay the ferocious loyalty of one danny royal a dependable retainer who had graduated from various minor positions into a sort of castellan an admirable crichton a good left hand to replace that missing member which kirby had lost during the whitehot climax of a certain celebrated feud a feud by the way which had added a notch to the ivory handle of sams famous sixshooter this danny royal was all things he could take any shift in a gamblinghouse he was an accomplished fixer he had been a jockey and had handled the kirby string of horses he was a miner of sorts too having superintended the rouletta mine during its brief and prosperous history as a trainer he was without a peer he had made book on many tracks he it was who had brought out the filly rouletta sam kirbys bestknown thoroughbred and mopped up with her both mine and mare danny had named after kirbys girl and under dannys management both had been quick producers all in all royal was considered by those who knew him best as a master of many trades and a jack of none he was an irreligious man but he possessed a code which he lived up to strictly epitomized it ran as follows sam kirbys will be done he believed in but one god and that rouletta kirby was his profit equipped with the allegiance of such a man as royal together with several tons of highproof spirits a stock of casegoods and cigars some gambling paraphernalia and a moderate bank roll with which to furnish the same old sam felt safe in setting out for any country where gold was mined and where the trails were new of course he took his daughter with him sooner than leave her behind he would have severed his remaining hand rouletta and agnes they constituted the foundation upon which the kirby fortunes rested they were the rocks to which sam clung they were his assets and his liabilities his adjuncts and his adornments agnes was his gun having seen his freight safely ashore kirby left royal in charge of it first impressing upon him certain comprehensive and explicit instructions then he and rouletta and agnes went up the trail and over the chilkoot somehow between the three of them they intended to have a scow built and ready when danny landed the last pound of merchandise at linderman mr royal was an energetic little person he began an immediate hunt for packers only to discover that another outfit was ahead of his and that no men were immediately available he was resourceful he was in the habit of meeting and overcoming obstacles hence this one did not greatly trouble him once he became acquainted with the situation two days and nights enabled the countess courteau to strip the northern hotel to assemble the movable appurtenances thereto and to pack them into boxes bales and bundles none of which weighed more than one hundred pounds this lapse of time likewise enabled the indians whom pierce had hired to finish their contracts and return to the coast in spite of the appalling amount of freight pierce believed he had enough men to move it in two trips and when the hour came to start the countess complimented him upon his thorough preparations as swiftly as might be he formed his packers in line weighed their burdens and sent them on their journey these preparations occasioned much confusion and a considerable crowd assembled among the onlookers was a brighteyed weazened little man who attached himself to the chief and engaged him in conversation when the last burdenbearer had departed the countess directed lucky broad and kid bridges to stay in the hotel and stand guard over the remainder of her goods take sixhour shifts she told them ill hold you responsible for whats here its as safe as wheat broad assured her ill camp at the scales with the stuff that has gone forward and pierce will bring the indians back dyou think you can ride herd on it bridges inquired i understand theres a lawless element at large the countess smiled im sort of a lawless element myself when i start she said her eyes twinkled as she measured mr bridges burly proportions youre going to miss your alfalfa bed before i get you to linderman the kid nodded seriously i know said he serves me right for quittin a profession for a trade but i got to look over this dawson place they say its soft pickin lucky is taking his stock in trade along all three of em so maybe well tear off a penny or two on the way pierces pack consisted of a tent for the countess some bedding and food with this on his back he and his employer set out to overtake their train this they accomplished a short distance below the first crossing of the river already the white packers of whom there were perhaps a score had drawn together the indians were following them in a long file having seen his companion safely across the stream pierce asked her somewhat doubtfully do you think broad and his partner are altogether trustworthy nobody is that she told him but theyre at least intelligent in this kind of a country i prefer an intelligent crook to an honest fool most people are honest or dishonest when and as they think it is to their advantage to be so those men want to get to dawson and they know the police would never let them across the line im their only chance theyll stand assay it was midforenoon when the countess halted pierce who was a short distance ahead of her saying wait didnt you hear somebody calling us they listened they were about to move onward when there came a faint hallo and far down the trail behind them they saw a figure approaching after a moment of scrutiny pierce declared why its broad something has happened the countess stepped upon a fallen log and through her cupped palms sent forth an answering call mr broad waved his hat and broke into a run he was wet with sweat he was muddy and out of breath when he finally overtook them whew he panted thought id never run you down well set yourselves whats wrong demanded the woman plenty youve been doublecrossed whipsawed your noble red men have quit you they dumped your stuff at the river and made a deal at double rates to move sam kirbys freight theyre back in dyea now the whole works the countess courteau exploded with a mans oath her face was purple her eyes were blazing danny royal kirbys man done it sams gone on to linderman to build a boat i saw danny curled up on the chiefs ear while you were loading after youd gone him and the old pirate followed me n bridges never thought anything about it until by and by back came the whole party empty danny trooped em down to the beach and begun packin em i know him so i asked him what the devil hands off says he sam kirbys got a rush order in ahead of yours and these refreshments is going through by express ive raised your ante money no object understand ill boost the price again if i have to and keep on boosting it then he warned me not to start anything or hed tack two letters onto the front of my name hed do it too i took it on the run and here i am sam kirby eh the countess flaming rage had given place to a cool calculating anger pierce protested violently i hired those indians we agreed on a price and everything was settled well danny unsettled it theyre workin for him and he intends to keep em what about our white packers the woman inquired of broad they must have crossed before danny caught up or hed have had them too money no object he said im danged if id turn a trick like that wheres our stuff at the crossing the countess turned back down the trail and pierce followed her ill settle this royal he declared furiously dannys a bad boy lucky broad warned falling into step if old sam told him to hold a buzzsaw in his lap hed do it maybe there wouldnt be much left of danny but hed of hugged it some while he lasted little more was said during the swift return to the river it was not a pleasant journey for the trail was miserable the mud was deep and there was a steady upward flow of traffic which it was necessary to stem there were occasional interruptions to this stream for here and there horses were down and a blockade had resulted behind it men lay propped against logs or treetrunks resting their tired frames and listening apathetically to the profanity of the horseowners rarely did any one offer to lend a helping hand for each mans task was equal to his strength in one place a line of steers stood belly deep in the mire waiting the command to plow forward broken carts abandoned vehicles of various patterns lined the way there were many swollen carcasses underfoot and not infrequently pedestrians crossed mudholes by stepping from one to another holding their breaths and battling through swarms of flies much costly impedimenta strewed the roadside each article a milestone of despair a monument to failure there were stoves camp furniture lumber hardware boat fittings the wreckage and the wastage of the stampede were enormous and every ounce every dollars worth of it spoke mutely of blasted hopes now and then one saw piles of provisions some of which had been entirely abandoned the rains had ruined most of them when the countess came to her freight she paused you said royal was loading his men when you left she faced broad inquiringly right then hell soon be along well wait here of phillips she asked do you carry a gun pierce shook his head what are you going to do he could see that she was boiling inwardly and although his own anger had increased at every moment during the return journey her question caused him genuine apprehension avoiding a direct answer the woman said if royal is with the indians you keep your eye on him i want to talk to them dont inaugurate any violent measures mr broad cautioned nervously dannys a sudden sort of a murderer of course if worse comes to worst ill stick but my rating in the community aint a theres a lot of narrowminded church members would like to baptize me at high tide as if that would get their money back a suggestion of a smile crept to the countess lips and she said i knew youd stick when i hired you then she seated herself upon a box danny royal did accompany his packers he did so as a precaution against precisely such a coup as he himself had engineered and in order to be doubly secure he brought the head indian with him the old tribesman had rebelled mildly but royal had been firm and in consequence they were the first two to appear when the procession came out of the woods the chief halted at sight of phillips the man who had hired him and his people but at a word from royal he resumed his march he averted his eyes however and he held his head low showing that this encounter was not at all to his liking royal on the contrary carried off the meeting easily he grinned at lucky broad and was about to pass on when the countess courteau rose to her feet and stepped into the trail just a minute she said of royals companion she sternly demanded what do you mean by this trick the old redskin shot her a swift glance then his face became expressionless and he gazed stolidly at the river what do you mean the woman repeated in a voice quivering with fury him people the chief began but royal spoke for him removing his hat he made a stiff little bow then said courteously enough im sorry to hold you up maam but youre not holding me up im holding you up the woman broke in what do you take me for anyhow she stared at the white man so coldly there was such authority and such fixity of purpose in her tone and her expression that his manner changed im on orders said he theres no use to argue id talk plainer to you if you was a man but she had turned her eyes to the chief again you lying scoundrel she cried accusingly i made a straight deal with you and your people and i agreed to your price im not going to let you throw me down the woodenfaced object of her attack became inexplicably stupid he strove for words me no speak good he muttered me no savvy perhaps youll savvy this as the countess spoke she took from her pocket a shortbarreled revolver which she cocked and presented in a capable and determined manner so close to the old natives face that he staggered backward fending off the attack the woman followed him look here danny royal exploded he made a movement with his right hand but pierce phillips and lucky broad stepped close to him the former said shortly if you make a move ill brain you thats me seconded mr broad lift a finger danny and we go to the mat royal regarded the two men searchingly dyou think ill let you people stick me up he queried youre stuck up the countess declared shortly make sure of this im not bluffing ill shoot here you she called to one of the packers at the rear of the line who had turned and was making off get back where you were and stay there she emphasized this command with a wave of her weapon and the indian obeyed with alacrity now then mr royal not one pound of sam kirbys freight will these people carry until mine is over the pass i dont recognize you in this deal in any way i made a bargain with the chief and ill settle it with him you keep out if you dont my men will attend to you it was surprising what a potent effect a firearm had upon the aged shaman his mask fell off and his knowledge of the english language was magically refreshed he began a perfectly intelligible protest against the promiscuous display of loaded weapons particularly in crowded localities he was a peaceful man the head of a peaceful people and violence of any sort was contrary to his and their code this was no way in which to settle a dispute you think not eh well its my way stormed the countess ill drop the first man who tries to pass if you think i wont try me go ahead try me mr royal undertook to say something more but without turning her head the woman told phillips knock him down if he opens his mouth will i pierce edged closer to his man and in his face there was a hunger for combat which did not look promising to the object of his attentions lucky broad likewise discouraged the exjockey by saying if you call her hand danny ill bust you where youre biggest the countess still held the muzzle of her revolver close to the chiefs body now she said peremptorily youre going to end this joke right now order their packs off quick this colloquy had been short but brief as the delay had been it had afforded time for newcomers to arrive amazed at the sight of a raging woman holding an army of red men at bay several mushers dropped their burdens and came running forward to learn the meaning of it the countess explained rapidly whereupon one exclaimed go to it sister another agreed heartily when you shoot shoot low well see you through i dont need any assistance she told them theyll keep their agreement or theyll lose their head man give the word chief the old redskin raised his voice in expostulation but one of the latecomers broke in upon him aw shut up you robber youre gettin what you need im going to count three the woman said inflexibly her face had grown very white her eyes were shining dangerously at four i shoot one two the wrinkled indian gave a sign his tribesmen began to divest themselves of their loads pile it all up beside the trail now get under my stuff and dont lets have any more nonsense the old price goes and i shant raise it a penny turning to danny royal she told him you could have put this over on a man but women havent any sense i havent a bit every cent i own is tied up in this freight and its going through on time i think a lot of it and if you try to delay it again im just foolish enough to blow a hole in this savage and you too yes and a miners meeting would cheer me for doing it there was a silence then mr royal inquired are you waiting for me to speak well all ive got to say is if the james boys had had a sister theyd of been at work yet i dont know how to tackle a woman are you going to keep hands off sure im licked you went about it in the right way you got me tied i dont know whether youre lying or not but just to make sure im going to have lucky walk back to town with you to see that you dont get turned around danny removed his hat and made a sweeping bow then he departed in company with his escort the indians took up those burdens which they had originally shouldered and the march to the chilkoot was resumed now however the countess courteau brought up the rear of the procession and immediately in advance of her walked the head man of the dyea tribe chapter viii it was a still clear morning but autumn was in the air and a pale sun lacked the necessary heat to melt a skin of ice which during the night had covered stagnant pools the damp moss which carpets northern forests was hoary with frost and it crackled underfoot winter was near and its unmistakable approach could be plainly felt a sawpit had been rigged upon a sloping hillside it consisted of four posts about six feet long upon which had been laid four stringers like the sills of a house up to this scaffold led a pair of inclined skids resting upon the stringers was a sizable spruce log which had been squared and marked with parallel chalklines and into which a whipsaw had eaten for several feet balanced upon this log was tom linton in the sawdust directly under him stood jerry quirk mr linton glared downward mr quirk squinted fiercely upward mr linton showed his teeth in an ugly grin and his voice was hoarse with fury mr quirks gray mustache bristled with rage and anger had raised his conversational tone to a high pitch both men were perspiring both were shaken to the core dont shove mr quirk exclaimed in shrill irritation how many times dyou want me to tell you not to shove you bend the infernal thing i never shoved linton said thickly maybe wed do better if youd quit hanging your weight on those handles every time i lift if youve got to chin yourself take a limb or ill build you a trapeze you pull down then lemme lift mr quirk danced with fury chin myself shucks youre petered out thats what ails you you aint got the grit and youve throwed up your tail lift her clean dont try to saw goin up the teeth aint set that way lift take a bite then leggo lift bite leggo lift bite dont say that again shouted linton im a patient man but he swallowed hard then with difficulty voiced a solemn vibrant warning dont say it again thats all defiance instantly flamed in jerrys watery eyes ill say it if i want to he yelled ill say anything i feel like sayin some folks cant understand english some folks have got lignumvity heads and you have to tell em you couldnt tell me anything sure thats just the trouble with you nobody can tell you anything i whipsawed before you was born astonishment momentarily robbed mr quirk of speech then he broke out more indignantly than ever why you lyin horsethief you never heard of a whipsaw till we bought our outfit you was for tying one end to a limb and the other end to a root and then rubbin the log up and down it i never meant that i was fooling and you know it thats just like you to say if youd ever had holt of a whipsaw in all your useless life the man on the other end of it would have belted you with the handle and buried you in the sawdust id ought to but i aint got the heart the speaker spat on his hands and in a calmer more businesslike tone said well come on lets go this is our last board tom linton checked an insulting remark that had just occurred to him it had nothing whatever to do with the subject under dispute but it would have goaded jerry to insanity therefore it clamored for expression and the temptation to hurl it forth was almost irresistible linton however prided himself upon his selfrestraint and accordingly he swallowed his words he clicked his teeth he gritted them he would have enjoyed sinking them into his partners throat as a matter of fact then he growled let her whiz in unison the men resumed their interrupted labors slowly rhythmically their arms moved up and down monotonously their aching backs bent and straightened inch by inch the saw blade ate along the penciled line it was killing work for it called into play unused underdeveloped muscles yes muscles which did not and never would or could exist each time linton lifted the saw it grew heavier by the fraction of a pound whenever quirk looked up to note progress his eyes were filled with stinging particles of sawdust his was a tearful job sawdust was in his hair his beard it had sifted down inside his neckband and it itched his moist body it had worked into his underclothes and he could not escape it even at night in his bed he had of late acquired the habit of repeating over and over with a pertinacity intensely irritating to his partner that he could taste sawdust in his food a statement manifestly false and well calculated to offend a camp cook after they had sawed for a while jerry cried hey shes runnin out again he accompanied this remark by an abrupt cessation of effort as a result the saw stopped in its downward course and toms chin came into violent contact with the upper handle the man above uttered a cry of pain and fury he clapped a hand to his face as if to catch and save his teeth jerry giggled with a shameless lack of feeling spit em out he cackled they aint no more good to you than a mouthful of popcorn he was not really amused at his partners mishap on the contrary he was more than a little concerned by it but fatigue had rendered him absurdly hysterical and the constant friction of mental spiritual and physical contact with tom had fretted his soul as that sawdust inside his clothes had fretted his body he he ho ho he chortled you dont shove oh no all the same whenever i stop pullin you butt your brains out i didnt shove the ferocity of this denial was modified and muffled by reason of the fact that a greater part of the speakers hand was inside his mouth and his fingers were taking stock of its contents all right you didnt shove have it your own way i said she was runnin out again we aint cuttin wedges were cuttin boatseats well why dont you pull straight i cant follow a line with you skinning the cat on your end my fault again eh mr quirk showed the whites of his eyes and his face grew purple lemme tell you something tom ive studied you careful as man and boy for a matter of thirty years but i never seen you in all your hideousness till this trip i got you now though i got you all added up and subtracted and ill tell you the answer its my opinion backed by figgers that youre a dam he hesitated then with a herculean effort be managed to gulp the remainder of his sentence in a changed voice he said oh whats the use i spose youve got feelins come on lets get through linton peered down over the edge of the log its your opinion im a what he inquired with vicious calmness nothing its no use to tell you now then lift bite leg why dont you lift i am lifting leggo your end mr linton tugged violently but the saw came up slowly it rose and fell several times but with the same feeling of dead weight attached to it tom wiped the sweat out of his eyes and once again in a stormy voice he addressed his partner if you dont get off them handles ill take a stick and knock you off what you grinnin at why shes stuck thats all drive your wedge jerrys words ended in an agonized yelp he began to paw blindly you did that apurpose did what kicked sawdust in my eyes i saw you mr lintons voice when he spoke held that same sinister note of restrained ferocity which had characterized it heretofore when i start kicking i wont kick sawdust into your eyes ill kick your eyes into that sawdust thats what ill do ill stomp em out like a pair of grapes you try it you try anything with me jerry chattered in a simian frenzy youve got a bad reputation at home youre a malo hombre a sidewinder you are and your bite is certain death thats what they say well ever see a mexican hog eat a rattler thats me wild hog wild hog whats wild about you sneered the other you picked the right animal but the wrong variety any kind of a hog makes a bad partner for a time the work proceeded in silence then the latter speaker resumed you said i was a dam something or other what was it the object of this inquiry maintained an offensive nay an insulting silence a what linton persisted quirk looked up through his mask of sawdust if youre gettin tired again why dont you say so ill wait while you rest he opened his eyes in apparent astonishment then he cried hello why its rainin it aint raining tom declared must be your face is wet once more the speaker cackled shrilly in a manner intended to be mirthful but which was in reality insulting beyond human endurance i never saw moisture on your brow tom except when it rained or when you set too close to a fire what was it you wanted to call me and was scared to mr linton urged venomously a dam what oh i forget the precise epithet i had in mind but a new one rises to my lips most every minute i think i aimed to call you a dam old fool something like that slowly carefully mr linton descended from the scaffold leaving the whipsaw in its place he was shaking with rage with weakness and with fatigue old me old im a fool i admit or i wouldnt have lugged your loads and done your work the way i have but you see im strong and vigorous and i felt sorry for a tottering wreck like you lugged my loads snorted the smaller man me a wreck my gawd i did your packing and your washing and your cooking and mine too just because you was feeble and because ive got consideration for my seniors i was raised that way i honored your age jerry i knew you was about all in but i never called you old i wouldnt hurt your feelings what did you do you set around on your bony hips and criticized and picked at me but youve picked my last feather off and im plumb raw right here we split jerry quirk staggered slightly and leaned against a post for support his knees were wobbly he too ached in every bone and muscle he too had been goaded into an insane temper but that which maddened him beyond expression was this unwarranted charge of incompetency split it is he agreed thatll take a load off my shoulders well cut our grub fiftyfifty then ill hit you a clout with the traces and turn you aloose jerry was still dazed for his world had come to an end but he pretended to an extravagant joy and managed to chirp good news the first ive had since we went pardners ill sure kick up my heels whatll we do with the boat cut her in two right well toss up for ends well divide everything the same way down to the skillet every blame thing linton agreed side by side they set off heavily through the woods quarrels similar to this were of daily occurrence on the trail but especially common were they here at linderman for of all the devices of the devil the one most trying to human patience is a whipsaw it is a saying in the north that to know a man one must eat a sack of flour with him it is also generally recognized that a partnership which survives the vexations of a sawpit is time and weather proof a predestined union more sacred and more perfect even than that of matrimony few indeed have stood the test it was in this loosening of sentimental ties in the breach of friendships and the birth of bitter enmities where lay the deepest tragedy of the chilkoot and the chilkat trails under ordinary normal circumstances men of opposite temperaments may live with each other in harmony and die in mutual accord but circumstances here were extraordinary abnormal hardship monotony fatigue score the very soul constant close association renders men absurdly petulant and childishly quarrelsome many are the heartaches charged against those early days and those early trails of course there was much less internal friction in outfits like kirbys or the countess courteaus where the men worked under orders but even there relations were often strained both danny royal and pierce phillips had had their troubles their problems nobody could escape them but i on the whole they had held their men together pretty well and had made fast progress all things considered royal had experience to draw upon while phillips had none nevertheless the countess was a good counselor and this brief training in authority was of extreme value to the younger man who developed some of the qualities of leadership as a result of their frequent conferences a frank free intimacy had sprung up between pierce and his employer an intimacy both gratifying and disappointing to him just how it affected the woman he could not tell as a matter of fact he made little effort to learn being for the moment too deeply concerned in the great change that had come over him pierce phillips made no effort to deceive himself he was in love yes desperately in love and his infatuation grew with every hour it was his first serious affair and quite naturally its newness took his breath he had heard of puppy love and he scorned it but this was not that kind he told himself his was an epic adoration a fullgrown deathless mans affection such as comes to none but the favored of the gods and then but once in a lifetime the reason was patent it lay in the fact that the object of his soulconsuming worship was not an ordinary woman no the countess was cast in heroic mold and she inspired love of a character to match her individuality she was one of those rare flaming creatures the like of whom illuminate the pages of history she was another cleopatra a regal matchless creature to be sure she was not at all the sort of woman he had expected to love therefore he loved her the more nor was she the sort he had chosen as his ideal but it is this abandonment of old ideals and acceptance of new ones which marks development which signalizes youths evolution into maturity she was a neverending surprise to pierce and the fact that she remained a well of mystery an unsounded deep that defied his attempts at exploration excited his imagination and led him to clothe her with every admirable trait in no few of which she was of course entirely lacking he was very boyish about this love of his lacking confidence to make known his feelings he undertook to conceal them and believed he had succeeded no doubt he had so far as the men in his party were concerned they were far too busy to give thought to affairs other than their own but the woman had marked his very first surrender and now read him like an open page from day to day his blind unreasoning loyalty his complete acquiescence to her desires his extravagant joy in doing her will would have told her the truth even without the aid of those numerous little things which every woman understands now oddly enough the effect upon her was only a little less disturbing than upon him for this first boylove was a thing which no good woman could have treated lightly its simplicity its purity its unselfishness were different to anything she had known so different for instance to that affection which count courteau had bestowed upon her as to seem almost sacred therefore she watched its growth with gratification not unmixed with apprehension it was flattering and yet it gave her cause for some uneasiness as a matter of fact phillips was boyish only in this one regard in other things he was very much of a man more of a man than any one the countess had met in a long time and she derived unusual satisfaction from the mere privilege of depending upon him this pleasure was so keen at times that she allowed her thoughts to take strange shape and was stirred by yearnings by impulses by foolish fancies that reminded her of her girlhood days the boatbuilding had proceeded with such despatch thanks largely to phillips that the time for departure was close at hand and inasmuch as there still remained a reasonable margin of safety the countess began to feel the first certainty of success while she was not disposed to quarrel with such a happy state of affairs nevertheless one thing continued to bother her she could not understand why interference had failed to come from the kirby crowd she had expected it for sam kirby had the name of being a hard conscienceless man and danny royal had given proof that he was not above resorting to desperate means to gain time why therefore they had made no effort to hire her men away from her especially as men were almost unobtainable here at linderman was something that baffled her she had learned by bitter experience to put trust in no man and this coupled perhaps with the natural suspicion of her sex combined to excite her liveliest curiosity and her deepest concern she could not overcome the fear that this unspoken truce concealed some sinister design feeling this afternoon a strong desire to see with her own eyes just what progress her rivals were making she called pierce away from his work and took him with her around the shore of the lake our last boat will be in the water tomorrow he told her kirby cant hold us up now if he tries i dont know she said doubtfully he is as shorthanded as we are i cant understand why he has left us alone so long phillips laughed he probably knows it isnt safe to trifle with you the countess shook her head i couldnt bluff him he wouldnt care whether im a woman or not were you bluffing when you held up royal i didnt think so i dont think so either theres no telling what i might have done i have a furious temper thats nothing to apologize for the young man declared warmly its a sign of character force i hope i never have reason to feel it you how absurd youve been perfectly dear you couldnt be otherwise do you think so really im awfully glad the countess was impelled to answer this boys eagerness by telling him frankly just how well she thought of him just how grateful she was for all that he had done but she restrained herself all the fellows have been splendid especially those two gamblers she said coolly after a moment she continued dont stop when we get to kirbys camp i dont want him to think were curious neither father nor daughter was in evidence when the visitors arrived at their destination but danny royal was superintending the final work upon a stout scow the seams of which were being calked and daubed with tar mast and sweeps were being rigged royal himself was painting a name on the stern at sight of the countess the exhorseman dropped his brush and thrust his hands aloft exclaiming dont shoot maam his grin was friendly there was no rancor in his voice how you gettin along down at your house he inquired very well the countess told him well get loaded tomorrow said pierce same here royal advised better come to the launching aint she a bear he gazed fondly at the bluffbowed ungainly barge im goin to bust a bottle of wine on her nose when she wets her feet first rainyweather hack we ever had in the family her names rouletta i hope she has a safe voyage royal eyed the speaker meditatively this trip has got my goat he acknowledged waters all right when its cracked up and put in a glass but it aint meant to build roads with ive heard a lot about this canon and them white horse rapids are they bad when the countess nodded his weazened face darkened visibly gimme a horse and im all right but water scares me well the roulettas good and strong and im goin to christen her with a bottle of real champagne if theres anything in good liquor and a good name shell be a lucky ship when they were out of hearing the countess courteau repeated i dont understand it they could have gained a week we could too if wed built one scow instead of those small boats pierce declared kirby is used to taking chances he can risk all his eggs in one basket if he wants to but not i a moment later the speaker paused to stare at a curious sight on the beach ahead of her stood a brandnew rowboat ready for launching near it was assembled an outfit of gear and provisions divided into two equal piles two old men armed each with a handsaw were silently at work upon the skiff they were sawing it in two exactly in the middle and they did not look up until the countess greeted them hello changing the model of your boat she inquired the partners straightened themselves stiffly and removed their caps yep said quirk avoiding his partners eyes changing her model mr linton agreed with a hangdog expression but why what for weve split mr quirk explained then he heaved a sigh its made a new man of me aready my end will look all right when i get her boarded up linton vouchsafed but old jerry drew the hind quarters his shoulders heaved in silent amusement old jerry snapped the smaller man whered you get the old at ive acted like a feebleminded idiot ill admit bein imposed on so regular but thats over and im breathin free wait till you shove off in that front end it aint got the beam and youll upset ha he uttered a malicious bark youll drownd mr quirk turned indignant eyes upon the visitors the idea of him callin me old can you beat that maybe i will drown linton agreed but drowning aint so bad its better than being picked and pecked to death by a bluntbilled buzzard id look on it as a kind of relief anyhow you wont be there to see it youll be dead of rheumatism ive got the tent huh the stoves mine ill make out have you men quarreled after all these years the countess made bold to inquire jerry answered and it was plain that all sentiment had been consumed in the fires of his present wrath i dont quarrel with a dam old fool i give him his way lintons smoky eyes were blazing when he cried furiously cut that old out or ill show you something your minds gone senile decay they call it but ill quirk flung down his saw and advanced belligerently around the hull of the boat he was bristling with the desire for combat whatll you show me he shrilly challenged youre bigger than me but ill cut you down ill the countess stepped between the two men crying impatiently dont be silly youre worn out and irritable both of you and youre acting like perfect idiots youll have everybody laughing at you jerry diverted his fury to this intermediary is that so he mocked well let em laugh itll do em good youre a nice woman but this aint ladies day at our club and we dont need no outside advice on how to run our party oh very well the countess shrugged and turned away motioning pierce to follow her fight it out to suit yourselves quirk muttered something about the insolence of strangers then he picked up his saw in silence the work was resumed and later when the boat had been divided each man set about boarding up and calking the open end of his respective half neither of them was expert in the use of carpenters tools therefore it was suppertime before they finished and the result of their labor was nothing to be proud of each now possessed a craft that would float no doubt but which in few other respects resembled a boat lintons was a slim squareended wedge while quirks was a blunt barge fashioned on the lines of a wateringtrough they eyed the freaks with some dismay but neither voiced the slightest regret nor acknowledged anything but supreme satisfaction without a word they gathered up their tools and separated to prepare their evening meals linton entered his tent now empty cold and cheerless quirk set up his stove in the open and rigged a clumsy shelter out of a small tarpaulin under this he spread his share of the bedding engaged in this he realized that his two blankets promised to be woefully inadequate to the weather and he cocked an apprehensive eye heavenward what he saw did not reassure him for the evening sky was overcast and a cold fitful wind blew from off the lake there was no doubt about it it looked like rain or snow perhaps a combination of both mr quirk felt a shiver of dread run through him and his heart sank at the prospect of many nights like this to come he derived some scanty comfort from the sight of old tom puttering wearily around a campfire the smoke from which followed him persistently bringing tears to his smarting eyes and strangling complaints from his lungs hes tryin to burn green wood jerry said aloud the old fool a similar epithet was upon his former partners tongue linton was saying to himself old jerrys enjoying life now but wait till his fire goes out and it starts to rain he chuckled maliciously and then rehearsed a speech of curt refusal for use when quirk came to the tent and begged shelter from the weather there would be nothing doing tom made up his mind to that he tried several insults under his breath then he offered up a vindictive prayer for rain hail sleet and snow a howling dakota blizzard he decided would exactly suit him he was a bit rusty on prayers but whatever his appeal may have lacked in polish it made up in earnestness for never did petition carry aloft a greater weight of yearning than did his tom fried his bacon in a stewpan for the skillet had been divided with a cold chisel and neither half was of the slightest use to anybody after he had eaten his pilotbread after he had drunk his cup of bitter tea and crept into bed he was prompted to amend his prayer for he discovered that two blankers were not going to be enough for him even the satisfaction of knowing that jerry must feel the want even more keenly than did he failed to warm him sufficiently for thorough comfort tom was tired enough to swoon but he refused to close his eyes before the rain came what purpose was served by retributive justice unless a fellow stayed on the job to enjoy it truth to say this selfdenial cost him little for the night had brought a chill with it and the tent was damp linton became aware ere long that he couldnt go to sleep no matter how he tried so he rose and put on extra clothes but even then he shivered and thereafter of course his blankets served no purpose whatever he and old jerry were accustomed to sleeping spoon fashion and not only did tom miss those other blankets but also his expartners bodily heat he would have risen and rekindled his campfire had it not been for his reluctance to afford quirk the gratification of knowing that he was uncomfortable some people were just malicious enough to enjoy a mans sufferings well if he were cold here in this snug shelter jerry must be about frozen under his flapping fly probably the old fool was too stubborn to whimper no doubt hed pretend to be enjoying himself and would die sooner than acknowledge himself in the wrong jerry had courage that way but this would serve him right this would cure him linton was not a little disappointed when the rain continued to hold off chapter ix the change in the weather had not escaped pierce phillips notice and before going to bed he stepped out of his tent to study the sky it was threatening recalling extravagant stories of the violence attained by storms in this mountainlake country he decided to make sure that his boats and cargo were out of reach of any possible danger and so walked down to the shore a boisterous wind had roused lake linderman and out of the inky blackness came the sound of its anger as pierce groped his way up to the nearest skiff he was startled by receiving a sharp challenge in the countess courteaus voice who is that she cried its i pierce he answered quickly he discovered the woman finally and approaching closer he saw that she was sitting on a pile of freight her heels drawn up beneath her and her arms clasped around her knees i came down to make sure everything was snug but what are you doing here she looked down into his upturned face and her white teeth showed in a smile i came for the same purpose now im waiting for the storm to break you can make out the clouds when your eyes grow accustomed its too windy youll catch cold he declared oh im warm and i love storms she stared out into the night then added im a stormy creature again he urged her to return to her tent and in his voice was such genuine concern that she laid her hand upon his shoulder it was a warm impulsive gesture and it betrayed a grateful appreciation of his solicitude it was the first familiarity she had ever permitted herself to indulge in and when she spoke it was in an unusually intimate tone youre a good friend pierce i dont know what id do without you phillips surprise robbed him momentarily of speech this woman possessed a hundred moods a few hours before she had treated him with a cool indifference that was almost studied now without apparent reason she had turned almost affectionate perhaps it was the night or the solitude that drew them together whatever the reason those first few words that one impulsive gesture assured pierce that they were very close to each other for the moment at least im glad he said finally i wish i were more i wish what she queried when he hesitated i wish you couldnt do without me it was out he realized in a panic that his whole secret was hers with no faintest intention of speaking even of hinting at the truth he had blurted forth a full confession she had caught him off guard and like a perfect ass he had betrayed himself what would she think how would she take his audacity his presumption he was surprised to feel her fingers tighten briefly before her hand was withdrawn the countess courteau was not offended had it not been for that pressure upon his shoulder phillips would have believed that his words had gone unheard for she entirely ignored them night wind storm she said in a queer meditative tone they stir the blood dont they not yours perhaps but mine i was always restless you see i was born on the ocean on the way over here my father was a sailor he was a stormyweather man at a time like this everything in me quickens im aware of impulses i never feel at other times desires i darent yield to it was on a stormy night that the count proposed to me she laughed shortly bitterly i believed him id believe anything id do id dare anything when the winds are reckless she turned abruptly to her listener and it seemed to him that her eyes were strangely luminous have you ever felt that way he shook his head lucky for you it would be a mans undoing tell me what am i what do you make of me while the young man felt for an answer she ran on id like to know what sort of woman do you consider me how have i impressed you speak plainly no sentiment youre a cleanminded unsophisticated boy im curious to hear i cant speak like a boy he said gravely but with more than a hint of resentment in his tone for im not a boy not any longer oh yes you are youre fresh and wholesome and honorable and well only boys are that what do i seem to you youre a chameleon theres nobody in the world quite like you why at this minute youre different even to yourself you take my breath do you consider me harsh masculine oh no im glad of that im not really ive had a hard experience and my eyes were opened early i know poverty disappointment misery everything unpleasant but im smart and i know how to get ahead ive never stood still ive learned how to fight too for ive had to make my own way why pierce youre the one man who ever did me an unselfish favor or a real disinterested courtesy do you wonder that i want to know what kind of a creature you consider me perhaps im not altogether unselfish he told her sullenly the countess did not heed this remark she did not seem to read the least significance into it her chin was upon her knees her face was turned again to the darkness whence came the rising voice of stormy waters the wind whipped a strand of her hair into phillips face it is hard work fighting men and women too and im awfully tired tired inside you understand one gets tired fighting alone always alone one has dreams of well dreams its a pity they never come true what are some of them he inquired the woman still under the spell of her hour made as if to answer then she stirred and raised her head this isnt a safe night to talk about them i think i shall go to bed she extended her hand to phillips but instead of taking it he reached forth and lifted her bodily down out of the wind she gasped as she felt his strong hands under her arms for a moment her face brushed his and her fragrant breath was warm against his cheek philips lowered her gently slowly until her feet were on the ground but even then his grasp lingered and he held her close to him they stood breast to breast for a moment and pierce saw that in this womans expression was neither fear nor resentment but some strange emotion newborn of the night an emotion which his act had started into life and which as yet she did not fully understand her eyes were wide and wondering they remained fixed upon his and that very fixity suggested a meaning so surprising so significant that he felt the world spin dizzily under him she was astonished yet expectant she was stunned but ready he experienced a fierce desire to hold her closer closer to crush her in his arms and although she resisted faintly unconsciously she yielded her inner being answered his without reserve she did not turn her face away when his came closer even when his lips covered hers after a long moment she surrendered wholly she snuggled closer and bowed her head upon his shoulder her cheek against his was very cold from the wind and pierce discovered that it was wet with tears it has been a long fight she sighed in a voice that he could scarcely hear i didnt know how tired i was phillips groped for words but he could find nothing to say his ordered thoughts having fled before this sudden gust of ardor as leaves are whirled away before a tempest all he knew was that in his arms lay a woman he had knelt to a worshipful goddess of snow and gold before whom he had abased himself but who had turned to flesh at his first touch he kissed her again and again warmly tenderly and yet with a ruthless fervor that grew after each caress and she submitted passively the while those tears stole down her cheeks in reality she was neither passive nor passionless for her body quivered and phillips knew that his touch had set her afire but rather she seemed to be exhausted and at the same time enthralled as by some dream from which she was loath to rouse herself after a while her hand rose to his face and stroked it softly then she drew herself away from him and with a wan smile upon her lips said the wind has made a fool of me no no he cried forcefully you asked me what i think of youwell now you know still smiling she shook her head slowly then she told him come i hear the rain but i want to talk to you i have so much to say what is there to talk about tonight hark they could feel rather than hear the first warnings of the coming downpour so hand in hand they walked up the gravelly beach and into the fringe of the forest where glowed the dull illumination from lamplit canvas walls when they paused before the countess tent pierce once more enfolded her in his arms and sheltered her from the boisterous breath of the night his emotions were in a similar tumult but as yet he could not voice them he could merely stammer you have never told me your name hilda may i call you that she nodded yes when we are alone hilda halberg that was my name hilda hilda phillips pierce tried the sound curiously the countess drew back abruptly with a shiver then in answer to his quick concern said i i think im cold he undertook to clasp her closer but she held him off murmuring let it be hilda halberg for tonight lets not think of lets not think at all hilda bride of the storm theres a tempest in my blood and who can think with a tempest raging she raised her face and kissed him upon the lips then disengaging herself once more from his hungry arms she stepped inside her shelter the last he saw of her was her luminous smile framed against the black background then she let the tentfly fall as phillips turned away big raindrops began to drum upon the nearby tent roofs the sprucetops overhead bent low limbs threshed as the gusty night wind beat upon them but he heard none of it felt none of it for in his ears rang the music of the spheres and on his face lingered the warmth of a womans lips the first love kiss that he had ever known tom linton roused himself from a chilly doze to find that the rain had come at last it was a roaring night his tent was bellied in by the force of the wind and the raindrops beat upon it with the force of buckshot through the entrance slit through the open stovepipe hole the gale poured bringing dampness with it and rendering the interior as draughty as a corncrib rolling himself more tightly in his blankets linton addressed the darkness through chattering teeth darned old fool thisll teach him he strained his ears for sounds of jerry but could hear nothing above the slatting of wet canvas the tattoo of drops and the roar of wind in the treetops after the first violence of the squall had passed he fancied he could hear his former partner stirring so he arose and peered out into the night at first he could see nothing but in time he dimly made out jerry struggling with his tarpaulin evidently the fly had blown down or up and its owner was restretching it linton grinned that would drench the old dodo to the skin and hed soon be around begging shelter but i wont let him in not if he drowns tom muttered harshly he recalled one of jerrys gibes at the sawpit a particularly unfeeling nay a downright venomous insult which had rankled steadily ever since his former friend had seen fit to ridicule honest perspiration and to pretend to mistake it for raindrops that remark had been utterly uncalled for and it had betrayed a wanton malice a malevolent desire to wound well here was a chance to even the score when jerry came dripping to the tent door tom decided he would poke his head out into the deluge and then cry in evident astonishment why jerry youve been working havent you youre all sweaty mr linton giggled out loud that would be a refinement of sarcasm that would be a getback of the finest if jerry insisted upon coming in out of the wet hed tell him gruffly to get out of there and try the lake for a change but mr quirk made no move in the direction of the tent instead he built a fire in his stove and crouched over it endeavoring vainly to shelter himself from the driving rain linton watched him with mingled impatience and resentment would the old fool never get enough jerry was the most unreasonable the most tantalizing person in the world after a time mr linton found that his teeth were chattering and that his frame had been smitten as by an ague reluctantly he crept back into bed he determined to buy beg borrow or steal some more bedding on the morrow early on the morrow in order to forestall jerry jerry would have to find a tent somewhere and inasmuch as there were none to be had here at linderman he would probably have to return to dyea that would delay him seriously enough perhaps so that the jaws of winter would close down upon him through the drone of pattering drops there came the faint sound of a cough mr linton sat up in bed pneumonia he exclaimed well jerry was getting exactly what he deserved he had called him tom an old fool a dam old fool to be precise the epithet in itself meant nothing it was in fact a fatuous and feeble term of abuse as compared to the opprobrious titles which he and jerry were in the habit of exchanging it was that abominable adjective which hurt jerry and he had called each other many names at times they had exchanged numerous gibes and insults but nothing like that hateful word old had ever passed between them until this fatal morning jerry quirk himself was old the oldest man in the world perhaps but tom had exercised an admirable regard for his partners feelings and had never cast it up to him thus had his consideration been repaid however the poor fellows race was about run for he couldnt stand cold or exposure why a wet foot sent him to bed how then could a rickety ruin of his antiquity withstand the ravages of pneumonia galloping pneumonia at that linton reflected that common decency would demand that he wait over a day or two and help bury the old man people would expect that much of him hed do it hed speak kindly of the departed hed even erect a cross and write an epitaph upon it a kindly lying epitaph extolling the dead mans virtues and omitting all mention of his faults once more that hacking cough sounded and the listener stirred uneasily jerry had some virtues a few of the common elemental sort he was honest and he was brave but for that matter so were most people yes the old scoundrel had nerve enough linton recalled a certain day long past when he and quirk had been sent out to round up some cattlerustlers being the youngest deputies in the sheriffs office the toughest jobs invariably fell to them those were the good glad days tom reflected jerry had made a reputation on that trip and he had saved his companions life linton flopped nervously in his bed at the memory why think of days dead and gone jerry was an altogether different man in those times he neither criticized nor permitted others to criticize his teammate and so far as that particular obligation went linton had repaid it with compound interest if anything the debt now lay on jerrys side tom tried to close the book of memory and to consider nothing whatever except the rankling present but now that his thoughts had begun to run backward he could not head them off he wished jerry wouldnt cough it was a distressing sound and it disturbed his rest nevertheless that hollow hacking complaint continued and finally the listener arose lit a lantern put on a slicker and untied his tent flaps jerrys stove was sizzling in the partial shelter of the canvas sheet over it the owner crouched in an attitude of cheerless dejection how you making out tom inquired gruffly his voice was cold his manner was both repellent and hostile who me jerry peered up from under his glistening souwester oh im doin fine linton remained silent ill at ease water drained off his coat his lantern flared smokily in the wind after a time he cleared his throat and inquired wet naw there was a long pause then the visitor inquired are you lying unhhunh again silence claimed both men until tom broke out irritably well you aim to set here all night sure i aint sleepy i dont mind a little mist and im plenty warm this cheerful assertion was belied by the miserable quaver in which it was voiced why dont youerrun over to my tent linton gasped and swallowed hard the invitation was out the damage was done theres lots of room mr quirk spared his callers further feelings by betraying no triumph whatever rather plaintively he declared i got room enough here it aint exactly room i need again he coughed here get a move on you quick linton ordered forcefully the idea of you setting around hatching out a lungful of pneumonia bugs git ill bring your bedding mr quirk rose with alacrity say lets take my stove over to your tent and warm her up i bet youre cold nno im comfortable enough the speakers teeth played an accompaniment to this mendacious denial of course im not sweating any but i spose the stove would cheer things up eh rotten night aint it worst i ever saw rotten country for that matter you said something mr linton chattered he nodded his head with vigor it was wet work moving jerrys belongings but the transfer was finally effected the stove was set up and a new fire started this done tom brought forth a bottle of whisky here said he take a snifter itll do you good jerry eyed the bottle with frank astonishment before he exclaimed why i didnt know you was a drinkin man you been hidin a secret vice from me no and im not a drinking man i brought it along for you i er that cough of yours used to worry me so pshaw i cough easy you know that you take a jolt and linton flushed with embarrassment and ill have one with you i was lying just now im colder n a frogs belly happy days said quirk as he tipped the bottle a long life and a wicked one linton drank in his turn now then get out of those cold compresses heres some dry underclothes thick too well double up those henskin blankets for tonight and ill keep the fire agoing ill cure that cough if i sweat you as white as a washwomans thumb youll do nothing of the sort jerry declared as he removed his sodden garments and hung them up youll crawl right into bed with me and well have a good sleep youre near dead but linton was by no means reassured his tone was querulous when he cried why didnt you come in before you caught cold spose you get sick on me now but you wont i wont let you in a panic of apprehension he dug out his half of the contents of the medicinekit and began to paw through them who got the cough syrup jerry you or me the speakers voice broke miserably mr quirk laid a trembling hand upon his expartners shoulder his voice too was shaky when he said youre awful good to me tom the other shook off the grasp and undertook to read the labels on the bottles but they had become unaccountably blurred and there was a painful lump in his throat it seemed to him that old jerrys bare legs looked pitifully thin and spidery and that his bony knees had a rheumatic appearance hell i treated you mighty mean said he but imost died when you began to cough i thought sure tom choked and shook his gray head then with the heel of his harsh palm he wiped a drop of moisture from his cheek look at me cryin he tried to laugh and failed jerry likewise struggled with his tears you you dam old fool he cried affectionately linton smiled with delight give it to me he urged lam into me jerry i deserve it gosh i was lonesome a halfhour later the two friends were lying side by side in their bed and the stove was glowing comfortably they had ceased shivering old jerry had spooned up close to old tom and his bodily heat was grateful linton eyed the fire with tender yearning thats a good stove you got shes a corker aint she i been thinking about trading you a half interest in my tent for a half interest in her the trades made there was a moment of silence what dyou say we hook up together sort of go pardners for a while i got a long outfit and a short boat ill put em in against yours i bet wed get along all right im onnery but i got good points mr linton smiled dreamily its a go i need a good partner ill buy a new fryinpan out of my money mine got split somehow tom chuckled you darned old fool said he jerry heaved a long sigh and snuggled closer soon he began to snore he snored in a low and confidential tone at first but gradually the sound increased in volume and rose in pitch linton listened to it with a thrill and he assured himself that he had never heard music of such soulsatisfying sweetness as issued from the nostrils of his new partner chapter x to the early klondikers chilkoot pass was a personality a presence at once sinister cruel and forbidding so too only in greater measure was miles canon the chilkoot toyed with men it wore them out it stripped them of their strength and their manhood it wrecked their courage and it broke their hearts the canon sucked them in and swallowed them this canon is nothing more nor less than a rift in a great basaltic barrier which lies athwart the rivers course the entrance to it being much like the door in a wall above it the waters are dammed and into it they pour as into a flume down it they rage in swiftly increasing fury for it is steeply pitched and although the gorge itself is not long immediately below it are other turbulent stretches equally treacherous it seems as if here within the space of some four miles nature had exhausted her ingenuity in inventing terrors to frighten invaders as if here she had combined every possible peril of river travel the result of her labors is a series of cataclysms immediately below miles canon itself are the squaw rapids where the torrent spills itself over a confusion of boulders bursting into foam and gyrating in dizzy whirlpools its surface broken by explosions of spray or pitted by devouring vortices resembling the oily mouths of marine monsters below this in turn is the white horse worst of all here the flood somersaults over a tremendous reef flinging on high a gleaming curtain of spray these rapids are well named for the tossing waves resemble nothing more than runaway white horses with streaming manes and tails these are by no means all the dangers that confronted the first yukon stampeders there are other troublesome waters below for instance rink rapids where the river boils and bubbles like a kettle over an open fire and five fingers socalled by reason of a row of knobby knuckled pinnacles that reach up like the stiff digits of a drowning hand and split the stream into divergent channels but those three miles canon the squaw and white horse were the worst and together they constituted a menace that tried the courage of the bravest men in the canon where the waters are most narrowly constricted they heap themselves up into a longitudinal ridge or bore a comb perhaps four feet higher than the general level to ride this crest and to avoid the destroying fangs that lie in wait on either side is a feat that calls for nerve and skill and endurance on the part of boatmen the whole four miles is a place of many voices a thundering place that numbs the senses and destroys all hearing its tumult is heard afar and it covers the entire region like a blanket the weight of that sound is oppressive winter was at the heels of the courteau party when it arrived at this point in its journey it brought up the very tail of the autumn rush and the ice was close behind the countess and her companions had the uncomfortable feeling that they were inside the jaws of a trap which might be sprung at any moment for already the hills were dusted with gray and white creeks and rivulets were steadily dwindling and shelf ice was forming on the larger streams the skies were low and overcast and there was a vicious tingle to the air delays had slowed them up as for instance at windy arm where a gale had held them in camp for several days then too their boats were built of poorly seasoned lumber and in consequence were in need of frequent attention eventually however they came within hearing of a faint whisper as of wind among pine branches then of a muffled murmur that grew to a sullen diapason the current quickened beneath them the riverbanks closed in and finally beetling cliffs arose between which was a cleft that swallowed the stream just above the opening was a landingplace where boats lay gunwale to gunwale and here the courteau skiffs were grounded a number of weatherbeaten tents were stretched among the trees most of them were the homes of pilots but others were occupied by voyagers who preferred to chance a winters delay as the price of portaging their goods around rather than risk their all upon one throw of fortune the great majority of the arrivals however were restowing their outfits lashing them down and covering them preparatory to a dash through the shouting chasm there was an atmosphere of excitement and apprehension about the place every face was strained and expectant fear lurked in many an eye on a tree near the landing were two placards one bore a finger pointing up the steep trail to the top of the ridge and it was marked this way two weeks the other pointed down directly into the throat of the roaring gorge it read this way two minutes pierce phillips smiled as he perused these signs then he turned up the trail for in his soul was a consuming curiosity to see the place of which he had heard so much near the top of the slope he met a familiar figure coming down a tall upstanding frenchcanadian who gazed out at the world through friendly eyes poleon doret recognized the newcomer and burst into a boisterous greeting wal wal he cried you aint live to be hung yet eh now you come lookin for me i bet yes youre the very man i want to see good i tak you trough phillips smiled frankly im not sure i want to go through im in charge of a big outfit and im looking for a pilot and a professional crew im a perfect dub at this sort of thing poleon nodded deres no use risk it if you aint got to dats fac i don lost no boats yet but sometams i bus em up pretty bad he grinned cheerily dese newcomer get scare easy an forget to row den dey say poleon shes bum pilot you seen de canon yet when pierce shook his head the speaker turned back and led the way out to the rim it was an impressive spectacle that phillips beheld perhaps a hundred feet directly beneath him the river whirled and leaped crosscurrents boiled out from projecting irregularities in the walls here and there the waters tumbled madly and flung wet arms aloft while up out of the gorge came a mighty murmur redoubled by the echoing cliffs a log came plunging through and it moved with the speed of a torpedo phillips watched it fascinated look deres a boat poleon cried in between the basalt jaws appeared a skiff with two rowers and a man in the stern the latter was braced on widespread legs and he held his weight upon a steeringsweep down the boat came at a galloping gait threshing over waves and flinging spray headhigh it bucked and it dove it buried its nose and then lifted it but the oarsman continued to maintain it on a steady course bravo doret shouted waving his cap to pierce he said dats good pilot an he knows swif water but deres lot of feller here who aint so good dey tak chance for beeg money wal wat you tink of her shes dandy eh its an inferno phillips acknowledged you earn all the money you get for running it you don care for im wat i do not i dont mind taking a chance but what chance would a fellow have in there why hed never come up dats right phillips stared at his companion curiously you must need money pretty badly the giant shook his head in vigorous denial no money pouf she come she go but you see plenty people drowned if somebody don tak dem trough so i stay dis winter i build mysef nice cabin an do lil trappin nex summer i pilot again arent you going to dawson pierce was incredulous he could not understand this fellow dorets expression changed a fleeting sadness settled in his eyes i been dere said he i aint care much for seein beeg city im lonesome feller after a moment he exclaimed more brightly now we go i see if i can hire crew to row your boats how does she look to you lucky broad inquired when pierce and his companion appeared he and bridges had not taken the trouble to acquaint themselves with the canon but immediately upon landing had begun to stow away their freight and to lash a tarpaulin over it better go up and see for yourself the young man suggested lucky shook his head not me he declared i can hear all i want to listen to it i got a long life ahead of me and im going to nurse it kid bridges was of like mind for he said sure we was a coupla brave guys in dyea but whats the good of runnin up to an undertaker and giving him your measurements hell get a tapeline on you soon enough then you dont intend to chance it pierce inquired broad scowled at the questioner say i wouldnt walk down that place if it was froze nor me the other gambler seconded not for a million dollars would i tease the embalmer that way not for a million would you lucky broad appeared to weigh the figures carefully then he said doubtfully im a cheap guy i might risk it once for five hundred thousand cash but thats rock bottom i wouldnt take a nickel less doret had been listening with some amusement now he said you boys got wide paystreak eh bridges nodded without shame widern a swamp and yellern butter wal i see wat i can do the pilot walked up the bank in search of a crew in the course of a halfhour he was back again and with him came the countess courteau calling pierce aside the woman said swiftly we cant get a soul to help us everybodys in a rush well have to use our own men broad and bridges are the best we have he told her but they refuse youre not afraid are you now pierce was afraid and he longed mightily to admit that he was but he lacked the courage to do so he smiled feebly and shrugged whereupon the former speaker misread his apparent indifference and flashed him a smile forgive me she said in a low voice i know youre not she hurried down to the waters edge and addressed the two gamblers in a businesslike tone weve no time to lose which one of you wants to lead off with doret and pierce the men exchanged glances it was broad who finally spoke we been figuring it would please us better to walk he said mildly suit yourselves the countess told them coolly but its a long walk from here to dawson she turned back to pierce and said youve seen the canon theres nothing so terrible about it is there phillips was conscious that poleon dorets eyes were dancing with laughter and anger at his own weakness flared up in him why no he lied bravely it will be a lot of fun kid bridges leveled a sour look at the speaker some folks have got low ideas of entertainment said he some folks is absolutely depraved that way youd probably enjoy a broken arm it would feel so good when it got well the countess courteaus lip was curled contemptuously when she said listen im not going to be held up theres a chance of course but hundreds have gone through i can pull an oar pierce and i will row the first boat doret opened his lips to protest but broad obviated the necessity of speech by rising from his seat and announcing deal the cards i came in on no pair i dont aim to be raised out ahead of the drawnot by a woman mr bridges was both shocked and aggrieved by his companions words you going to tackle it he asked incredulously lucky made a grimace of intense abhorrence in pierces direction sure i dont want to miss all this fun i hear about when you get through if you do which you probably wont bridges told him with a bleak and cheerless expression set a gillnet to catch me ill be down on the next trip good for you cried the countess it aint good for me the man exclaimed angrily its the worst thing in the world for me im grandstanding and you know it sos lucky but there wouldnt be any living with him if he pulled it off and i didnt doret chuckled to pierce he said in a low voice plenty feller mak fool of demsef on dat woman i know all bout it but she aint mak fool of hersef you bet how do you mean pierce inquired quickly poleon eyed him shrewdly wal tak you youre scare aint you but you sooner die so long she dont know it plenty oder feller jus lak dat he walked to the nearest skiff removed his coat and began to untie his boots lucky broad joined the pilot then looked on uneasily at these preparations whats the idea he inquired are you too hot poleon grinned at him and nodded very reluctantly broad stripped off his mackinaw then seated himself and tugged at his footgear he paused after a moment and addressed himself to bridges its no use kid i squawk he said beginning to weaken eh sure i got a hole in my socklook somebody ll find me after ive been drowned a week or two and whatll they say pshaw you wont come up till you get to st michaels and youll be spoiled by that time kid bridges tried to smile but the result was a failure youll be swelled up like a dead horse and soll i they wont know us apart when pierce had likewise stripped down and taken his place at the oars broad grumbled the idea of calling me lucky it aint in the cards he spat on his hands and settled himself in his seat then cried well lead your ace as the little craft moved out into the stream pierce phillips noticed that the kirby scow which had run the courteau boats a close race all the way from linderman was just pulling into the bank lines had been passed ashore and standing on the top of the cargo he could make out the figure of rouletta kirby in spite of a strong steady stroke the rowboat seemed to move sluggishly foam and debris bobbed alongside and progress appeared to be slow but when the oarsmen lifted their eyes they discovered that the shores were running past with amazing swiftness even as they looked those shores rose abruptly and closed in there came a mounting roar then the skiff was sucked in between high rugged walls unseen hands reached forth and seized it unseen forces laid hold of it and impelled it forward it began to plunge and to wallow spray flew and wavecrests climbed over the gunwales above the tumult poleon was urging his crew to greater efforts pull hard he shouted hi hi hi he swayed in unison to their straining bodies mak dose oar crack he yelled by gar dats goin some the fellows teeth were gleaming his face was alight with an exultant recklessness he cast defiance at the approaching terrors he was alert watchful under his hands the stout ash steeringoar bent like a bow he flung his whole strength into the battle with the waters soon the roar increased until it drowned his shouts and forced him to pantomime his orders the boat was galloping through a wild smother of icecold spray and the reverberating cliffs were streaming past like the unrolling scenery on a painted canvas panorama it was a hellish place it echoed to a demoniac din and it was a tremendous sensation to brave it for the boat did not glide nor slip down the descent it went in a succession of jarring leaps it lurched and twisted it rolled and plunged as if in a demented effort to unseat its passengers and scatter its cargo to the occupants it seemed as if its joints were opening as if the boards themselves were being wrenched loose from the ribs to which they were nailed the men were drenched of course for they traveled in a cloud of spume their feet were ankledeep in cold water and every new deluge caused them to gasp how long it lasted pierce phillips never knew the experience was too terrific to be long lived it was a nightmare a hideous phantasmagoria of frightful sensations a dissolving stereopticon of bleak scudding walls of hydrophobic boulders frothing madly as the flood crashed over them of treacherous whirlpools and of pursuing breakers that reached forth licking tongues of destruction then the river opened the cliffs fell away and the torrent spewed itself out into an expanse of whirlpools a lake of gyrating funnels that warred with one another and threatened to twist the keel from under the boat poleon swung close in to the right bank where an eddy raced up against the flood some one flung a rope from the shore and drew the boat in wal i never had no better crew cried the pilot wat you tink of im eh he smiled down at the whitelipped oarsmen who leaned forward panting and dripping is that all of it lucky broad inquired weakly mais non look deres wite orse doret indicated a wall of foam and spray farther down the river directly across the expanse of whirlpools stood a village named after the rapids you get plenty more bimeby youre wrong i got plenty right now broad declared im glad the countess didnt come said phillips when the men had wrung out their clothes and put on their boots they set out along the back trail over the bluffs danny royal was not an imaginative person he possessed to be sure the superstitions of the average horseman and gambler and he believed strongly in hunches but he was not fanciful and he put no faith in dreams and portents it bothered him exceedingly therefore to discover that he was weighed down by an unaccountable but extremely oppressive sense of apprehension how or why it had come to obsess him he could not imagine but for some reason miles canon and the stormy waters below it had assumed terrible potentialities and he could not shake off the conviction that they were destined to prove his undoing this feeling he had allowed to grow until now a fatalistic apathy had settled upon him and his usual cheerfulness was replaced by a senseless irritability he suffered explosions of temper quite as surprising to the kirbys father and daughter as to himself on the day of his arrival he was particularly ugly wherefore rouletta was impelled to remonstrate with him what ails you danny she inquired youll have our men quitting i wish they would he cried boatmen they dont know as much about boats as me and sam they do whatever theyre told royal acknowledged this fact ungraciously trouble is we dont know what to tell em to do all sam knows is gee and haw and i cant steer anything that dont wear a bridle why if this river wasnt fenced in with trees wed have taken the wrong road and been lost long ago rouletta nodded thoughtfully father is just as afraid of water as you are he wont admit it but i can tell it has gotten on his nerves and ive had hard work to keep him from drinking say dont let him get started on that danny exclaimed earnestly that would be the last touch trust me i but kirby himself appeared at that moment having returned from a voyage of exploration said he theres a good town below i had a chance to sell the outfit going to do it danny could not conceal his eagerness the elder man shook his gray head hardly im no piker i wish you and danny would take the portage and trust the pilot to run the rapids rouletta said kirby turned his expressionless face upon first one then the other of his companions nervous he inquired of royal the latter silently admitted that he was go ahead you and letty cross afoot and you oh im going to stick father the girl began but old sam shook his head no this is my case bet and im going to watch it royals weazened face puckered until it resembled more than ever a withered apple then ill stick too he declared i never laid down on you yet sam how about you letty the girl smiled why i wouldnt trust you boys out of my sight for a minute something would surely happen kirby stooped and kissed his daughters cheek youve always been our mascot and youve always brought us luck id go to hell in a paper suit if you were along youre a game kid too and i want you to be like that always be a thoroughbred dont weaken no matter how bad things break for you this cargo of rum is worth the best claim in dawson and itll put us on our feet again all i want is one more chance double and quit thats us this was an extraordinarily long speech for onearmed kirby it showed that he was deeply in earnest double and quit breathed the girl do you mean it dad he nodded im going to leave you heeled i dont aim to take my eyes off this barge again till shes in dawson roulettas face was transformed there was a great gladness in her eyes a gladness half obscured by tears double and quit oh ive dreamed of quitting so often youve made me very happy dad royal who knew this girls dreams as well as he knew his own felt a lump in his throat he was a godless little man but rouletta kirbys joys were holy things to him her tears distressed him deeply therefore he walked away to avoid the sight of them her slightest wish had been his law ever since she had mastered words enough to voice a request and now he too was happy to learn that sam kirby was at last ready to mold his future in accordance with her desires letty had never liked their mode of life she had accepted it under protest and with the passing years her unspoken disapproval had assumed the proportions of a great reproach she had never put that disapproval into words she was far too loyal for that but danny had known he knew her ambitions and her possibilities and he had sufficient vision to realize something of the injustice she suffered at her fathers hands sam loved his daughter as few parents love a child but he was a strange man and he showed his affection in characteristic ways it pleased royal greatly to learn that the old man had awakened to the wrong he did and that this adventure would serve to close the story as all good stories close with a happy ending in spite of these cheering thoughts danny was unable wholly to shake off his oppressive forebodings and as he paused on the riverbank to stare with gloomy fascination at the jaws of the gorge they returned to plague him the sound that issued out of that place was terrifying the knowledge that it frightened him enraged the little man it was an unpropitious moment for any one to address royal therefore when he heard himself spoken to he whirled with a scowl upon his face a tall frenchcanadian just back from the portage was saying msieu i aint good hand at mix in noder fellers bizneses but dat pilot you got shes no good royal looked the stranger over from head to foot how dyou know he inquired sharply biccause im pilot mysef oh i see youre one of the good ones dannys air was surly his tone forbidding yes hate yourself dont you i spose you want his job is that it no wonder five hundred seeds for fifteen minutes work soft graft i call it the speaker laughed unpleasantly well what does a good pilot charge me the canadian shrugged indifferently i charge you one tousan dollar royals jaw dropped the devil you say he exclaimed i dont want de job your scows no good but i toss a coin wit you one tousan dollar or free trip nothing doing snapped the exhorseman bien now i give you lil advice hol hard to de right in lower end dis canon deres beeg rock dere dont touch im or you goin spin lak top an mebbe you go over wite orse sideways dats goin smash you sure royal broke out peevishly another hot tip eh everybodys got some feedbox information especially the ones you dont hire well i aint scared oh yes you are said the other man everybody is scare of dis place anyhow i aint scared a thousand dollars worth takes a lot to scare me that much i bet this place is as safe as a chapel and i bet our scow goes through with her tail up let her bump shell finish with me on her back and all her weights i built her and i named her danny watched the pilot as he swung down to the stony shore and rejoined pierce phillips then he looked on in fascination while they removed their outer garments stepped into a boat with kid bridges and rowed away into the gorge its got my goat muttered the little jockey chapter xi although scows larger than the rouletta had run miles canon and the rapids below in safety perhaps none more unwieldy had ever done so royal had built his barge stoutly to be sure but of other virtues the craft had none when loaded she was so clumsy so obstinate so headstrong that it required unceasing effort to hold her on a course as for rowing her it was almost impossible she took the first swooping rush into the canon strange to say in very good form and thereafter by dint of herculean efforts royal and his three men managed to hold her head downstream sweeping between the palisades she galloped clumsily onward wallowing like a hippopotamus her long pine sweeps balanced and bored to receive thick tholepins rose and fell like the stiff legs of some fat squarebodied spider she reared her bluff bow then she dove shrouding herself in spray it was a journey to terrify experienced rivermen doubly terrifying was it to royal and kirby who knew nothing whatever of swift water and to whom its perils were magnified a thousandfold in spite of his apprehension which by now had quickened into panic danny rose to the occasion with real credit his face was like paper his eyes were wide and strained nevertheless he kept his gaze fixed upon the pilot and strove to obey the latters directions implicitly now with all his strength he heaved upon his sweep now he backed water violently at no time did he trust himself to look at the cliffs which were scudding past nor to contemplate the tortuous turns in the gorge ahead that would have been too much for him even when his clumsy oar all but grazed a bastion or when a jagged promontory seemed about to smash his craft he refused to cease his frantic labors or to more than lift his eyes he saw that rouletta kirby was very pale and he tried to shout a word of encouragement to her but his cry was thin and feeble and it failed to pierce the thunder of the waters danny hoped the girl was not as frightened as he nor as old sam the little man would not have wished such a punishment upon his worst enemy kirby by reason of his disability of course was prevented from lending any active help with the boat and was forced to play a purely passive part that it was not to his liking any one could have seen for once the moorings were slipped he did not open his lips he merely stood beside rouletta with the fingers of his right hand sunk into her shoulder his gray face grayer than ever together they swayed as the deck beneath them reeled and pitched look were nearly through the girl cried in his ear after what seemed an interminable time kirby nodded ahead he could see the end of the canon and what appeared to be freer water out into this open space the torrent flung itself the scow was riding the bore that ridge of water upthrust by reason of the pressure from above between it and the exit from the chute was a rapidly dwindling expanse of tossing waves kirby was greatly relieved but he could not understand why those rollers at the mouth of the gorge should rear themselves so high and should foam so savagely the bluffs ended the narrow throat vomited the river out and the scow galloped from shadow into pale sunlight the owner of the outfit drew a deep breath his clutching fingers relaxed their nervous hold he saw that danny was trying to make himself heard and he leaned forward to catch the fellows words when suddenly the impossible happened the deck beneath his feet was jerked backward and he was flung to his knees simultaneously there came a crash the sound of rending splintering wood and over the stern of the barge poured an icy deluge that all but swept father and daughter away rouletta screamed then she called the name of royal danny danny she cried for both she and old sam had seen a terrible thing the blade of royals sweep had been submerged at the instant of the collision and as a consequence the force of that rushing current had borne it forward catapulting the man on the other end overboard as cleanly as easily as a schoolboy snaps a paper pellet from the end of a pencil before their very eyes the kirbys saw their lieutenant their lifelong friend and servitor picked up and hurled into the flood danny shrieked the girl the voice of the rapids had changed its tone now for a cataract was drumming upon the afterdeck and there was a crashing and a smashing as the piles of boxes came tumbling down the scow drove higher upon the reef its bow rose until it stood at a sharp incline and meanwhile wave after wave cut like a broach over the stern which steadily sank deeper then the deck tilted drunkenly and an avalanche of casegoods was spilled over the side sam kirby found himself kneedeep in ice water a roller came curling down upon him but with a frantic clutch he laid hold of his daughter he sank the steel hook that did service as a left hand into a pile of freight and hung on battling to maintain his footing with a great jarring and jolting the rouletta rose from the deluge hung balanced for a moment or two and then relieved of a portion of her cargo righted herself and swung broadside to the stream as if upon a pivot finally she was carried free onward she swept turning end for end pounding staggering as other rocks from below bit into her bottom the river was very low at this season and the rouletta riding deep because half filled found obstacles she would otherwise have cleared she was out of the crooked channel now and it was impossible to manage her so in a crazy succession of loops and swoops she gyrated down toward that tossing mane of spray that marked the white horse with eyes of terror sam kirby scanned the boiling expanse through which the barge was drifting but nowhere could he catch sight of danny royal he turned to shout to his pilot only to discover that he also was missing and that the steeringsweep was smashed god hes gone cried the old man it was true that inundation succeeding the mishap had swept the afterdeck clean and now the scow was not only rudderless but it lacked a man of experience to direct its course rouletta kirby was tugging at her fathers arm she lifted a white horrified face to his and exclaimed danny i saw him go her fathers dead face was twitching he nodded silently then he pointed at the cataract toward which they were being carried he opened his lips to say something but one of the crew came running back shouting hoarsely and waving his arms were going over the fellow clamored well all be drowned kirby felled him with a blow from his artificial hand then when the man scrambled to his feet his employer ordered get busy do what you can for himself he took royals sweep and struggled with it but he was woefully ignorant of how to apply his strength and had only the faintest idea what he ought to do meanwhile the thunder of the white horse steadily increased having brought the last of the courteau boats through the canon poleon doret piloted the little flotilla across to the town of white horse and there collected his money while pierce phillips and the other men pitched camp the labor of making things comfortable for the night did not prevent lucky broad from discussing at some length the exciting incidents of the afternoon i hope her highness got an eyeful of me shooting the chutes said he for thats my farewell trip positively my last appearance in any water act mighty decent of you and the kid to volunteer pierce told him it sure was the other agreed takes a coupla daredevils like him and me to pull that kind of a bonehead play mr bridges who was within hearing distance shrugged with an assumption of careless indifference it takes more n a little lather to scare me he boasted im a divin venus and i ate it up you liar lucky cried why every quill on your head was standing up and you look five years older n you did this morning you heard the undertaker shaking out your shroud all the way downyou know you did i never seen a man as scared as you was when bridges accepted the accusation with a grin the speaker ran on in a less resentful tone i dont mind saying it hardened my arteries some it made me think of all my sins and follies i remembered all the bets id overlooked recollect that pioneer we laid for four hundred at dyea the kid nodded sure i remember him easy he squawked so loud you gave him back half of it and all the time he had a thousand sewed in his shirt wasted opportunities like that lay heavy on a man when he hears the angels tuning up and smells the callalilies bridges agreed in all seriousness and went on to say lucky if i gotta get out of this country the way i got into it im going to let you bury me in dawson look at them rapids ahead of us why the guy that laid out this river was off his nut youre talking sense well stick till they build a railroad up to us or else well let em pin a pair of softpine overcoats on the two of us the idea of us calling ourselves wiseacres and doing circus stunts like this were suckers well be working in the mines next i bet ill see you poulticed onto a pickhandle before we get out not me ive raised my last blister and if ever i get another callous itll be from layin abed safe and sane thats me i bridges words were cut short by an exclamation from doret who had approached in company with the countess courteau hallo the french canadian broke in dere comes dat beeg barge out from the lower end of the gorge the kirby craft had emerged it was plunging along with explosions of white foam from beneath its bow and with its sweeps rising and falling rhythmically to dorets companions it seemed that the scow had come through handily enough and was in little further danger but poleon for some reason or other had blazed into excitement down the bank he leaped then he raised his voice and sent forth a loud cry it was wasted effort for it failed to carry nevertheless the warning note in his voice brought his hearers running after him whats the matter pierce inquired the pilot paid no heed he began waving his cap in long sweeps cursing meanwhile in a patois which the others could not understand even while they stared at the rouletta she drove head on into an expanse of tumbling breakers then the onlookers could not believe their eyes she stopped dead still as if she had come to the end of a steel cable or as if she had collided with an invisible wall instantly her entire after part was smothered in white slowly her bow rose out of the chaos until perhaps ten feet of her bottom was exposed then she assumed a list the countess uttered a strangled exclamation oh h did you see theres a man overboard her eyes were quick but others too had beheld a dark bundle picked up by some mysterious agency and flung end over end into the waves the roulettas deckload was dissolving a moment or two and she turned completely around then drifted free why they brought the girl along cried the countess in growing dismay sam kirby should have had better sense he ought to be hung from the tents and boats along the bank from the village above people were assembling hurriedly a babel of oaths of shouts arose poleon found his recent employer plucking at his sleeve theres a woman out there kirbys girl she was crying cant you do something wait he flung off her grasp and watched intently soon the helpless scow was abreast of the encampment and in spite of the frantic efforts of her crew to propel her shoreward she drifted momentarily closer to the cataract below manifestly it was impossible to row out and intercept the derelict before she took the plunge and so helpless in this extremity the audience began to stream down over the rounded boulders which formed the margin of the river on the opposite bank another crowd was keeping pace with the wreck as they ran these people shouted at one another and gesticulated wildly their faces were white their words were meaningless for it was a spectacle tense with imminent disaster that they beheld it turned them sick with apprehension immediately above white horse the current gathers itself for the final plunge and although at the last moment the rouletta seemed about to straighten herself out and take the rapids head on some malign influence checked her swing and she lunged over quarteringly to the torrent a roar issued from the throats of the beholders the craft reappeared and then a moment later was half hidden again in the smother it could be seen that she was completely awash and that those galloping whitemaned horses were charging over her she was buffeted about as by batteringrams the remainder of her cargo was being rapidly torn from her deck soon another shout arose for human figures could be seen still clinging to her onward the scow went until once again she fetched up on a reef or a rock which the low stage of the river had brought close to the surface there she hung poleon doret had gone into action ere this having satisfied himself that some of the roulettas crew remained alive he cast loose the painter of the nearest skiff and called to phillips who was standing close by come on we goin get dose people now pierce had had enough rough water for one day it seemed to him that there must be other men in this crowd better qualified by training than he to undertake this rescue but no one stepped forward and so he obeyed dorets order as he slipped out of his coat and kicked off his boots he reflected with a sinking feeling of disappointment that his emotions were not by any means such as a really courageous man would experience he was completely lacking in enthusiasm for this enterprise for it struck him as risky nay foolhardy insane to take a boat over that cataract in an attempt to snatch human beings out from the very midst of those threshing breakers it seemed more than likely that all hands would be drowned in the undertaking and he could not summon the reckless abandon necessary to face that likelihood with anything except the frankest apprehension he was surprised at himself for he had imagined that when his moment came if ever it did that he phillips would prove to be a rather exceptional person instead he discovered that he was something of a coward the unexpectedness of this discovery astonished the young man being deeply and thoroughly frightened it was nothing less than the abhorrence at allowing that fright to become known which stiffened his determination in his own sight he dwindled to very small proportions then came the realization that doret was having difficulty in securing volunteers to go with them and he was considerably heartened at finding he was not greatly different from the rest of these people whos goin hep us the frenchman was shouting come now you stout fellers deres lady on dat scow aint nobody got nerve it was a tribute to the manhood of the north that after a brief hesitation several men offered themselves at the last moment however broad and bridges elbowed the others aside saying here you thats our boat and we know how she handles into the skiff they piled and hurriedly stripped down then in obedience to dorets command they settled themselves at the forward oars leaving pierce to set the stroke poleon stood braced in the stern like a gondolier and when willing hands had shot the boat out into the current he leaned his weight upon the after oars beneath his and pierces efforts the ash blades bent out into the hurrying flood the four men sent their craft then with a mighty heave the pilot swung its bow downstream and helped to drive it directly at the throat of the cataract there came a breathtaking plunge during which the rescuing skiff and its crew were hidden from the view of those on shore out into sight they lunged again and in a cloud of spray went galloping through the stampeding waves at risk of capsizing they turned around and battling furiously against the current were swept down stern first upon the stranded barge dorets face was turned back over his shoulder he was measuring distance gauging with practised eye the whims and vagaries of the tumbling torrent when he flung himself upon the oars pierce phillips felt his own strength completely dwarfed by that of the big pilot poleons hands inclosed his in a viselike grasp he wielded the sweeps as if they were reeds and with them he wielded phillips two people only were left upon the rouletta that sidewise plunge having carried the crew away once again sam kirbys artificial hand had proved its usefulness and without its aid it is doubtful if either he or his daughter could have withstood the deluge for a second time he had sunk that sharp steel hook into the solid wood and had managed by virtue of that advantage to save himself and his girl both of them were half drowned they were wellnigh frozen too now however finding themselves in temporary security kirby had broached one of the few remaining cases of bottled goods as the rowboat came close its occupants saw him press a drink upon his daughter then gulp one for himself it was impossible either to lay the skiff alongside the wreck with any degree of care or to hold her there as a matter of fact the two hulls collided with a crash kid bridges oar snapped off short and the side of the lighter boat was smashed in water poured over the rescuers for an instant it seemed that they were doomed but clawing fiercely at whatever they could lay hands upon they checked their progress long enough for the castaways to obey dorets shout of command the girl flung herself into pierces arms her father followed landing in a heap amidships even as they jumped the skiff was torn away and hurried onward by the flood sam kirby raised himself to his knees and turned his ashen face to rouletta hurt you any kid he inquired the girl shook her head she was very white her teeth were chattering her wet dress clung tightly to her figure staring fixedly at the retreating barge the old man cried all gone all gone then bracing himself with his good hand he brandished his steel hook at the rapids and heaped curses upon them a halfmile below the wreck poleon doret brought his crippled skiff into an eddy and there the crowd which had kept pace with it down the riverbank lent willing assistance in effecting a landing as kirby stepped ashore he shook hands with the men who had jeopardized their lives for him and his daughter hi a cheerless colorless voice he said it looks to me like you boys had a drink coming from his coat pocket he drew a bottle of whisky with a blow of that artificial hand he struck off its neck and then proffered it to doret drink hearty said he its all thats left of a good outfit chapter xii a chilly twilight had fallen by the time the castaways arrived at the encampment above the rapids kirby and his daughter were shaking from the cold the countess courteau hurried on ahead to start a fire in her tent and thither she insisted upon taking rouletta while her men attended to the fathers comfort on the way up there had been considerable speculation among those who knew sam kirby best for none of them had ever seen the old fellow in quite such a frame of mind as now his misfortune had crushed him he appeared to be numbed by the realization of his overwhelming loss gone entirely was that gamblers nonchalance for which he was famous the winning or the losing of large sums of money had never deeply stirred the old sportingman the turn of a card the swift tattoo of horses hoofs often had meant far more to him in dollars and cents than the destruction of that bargeload of liquor he had seen sizable fortunes come and go without a sign of emotion and yet tonight he was utterly unnerved with a man of less physical courage such an ordeal as he had undergone might well have excused a nervous collapse but kirby had no nerves he had times without number proved himself to be a man of steel and so it greatly puzzled his friends to see him shaken and broken he referred often to danny royals fate speaking in a dazed and disbelieving manner but through that daze ran lightningbolts of blind ferocious rage rage at the river rage at this hostile sinister country and at the curse it had put upon him over and over through blue lips and chattering teeth he reviled the rapids more than once he lifted the brokennecked bottle to his lips of thanksgiving of gratitude at his own and his daughters deliverance he appeared to have none at least for the time being roulettas condition was pitiable enough but she was concerned less with it than with her fathers extraordinary behavior and when the countess undertook to procure for her dry clothing she protested please dont trouble ill warm up a bit then i must go back to dad my dear youre chilled through youll die in those wet things the older woman told her miss kirby shook her head and in a queer strained apprehensive voice said you dont understand hes had a drink if he gets started she shivered wretchedly and hid her white face in her hands then moaned oh what a day dannys gone i saw him drown there there the countess comforted her as best she could youve had a terrible experience but you mustnt think of it just yet now let me help you finding that the girls fingers were stiff and useless the countess removed the wet skirt and jacket wrung them out and hung them up then she produced some dry undergarments but miss kirby refused to put them on youll need what few things you have said she and ill soon warm up theres no telling what dad will do i must keep an eye on him you give yourself too much concern hes chilled through and its natural that he should take a drink my men will give him something dry to wear and meanwhile rouletta interrupted with a shake of her head but the countess gently persisted dont take your misfortune too hard the loss of your outfit means nothing compared with your safety it was a great tragedy of course but you and your father were saved you still have him and he has you danny knew what was coming said the girl and tears welled into her eyes then slowly overflowed down her white cheeks but he faced it he was game he was a good man at heart he had his faults of course but he loved dad and he loved me why he used to carry me out to see the horses before i could walk he was my friend my playmate my pal hed have done murder for me through her tears rouletta looked up its hard for you to believe that i know after what he did to you but you know how men are on the trail nothing matters he was angry when you outwitted him and so was father for that matter but i told them it served us right and i forbade them to molest you further you did that then its you i have to thank the countess smiled gravely i could never understand why i came off so easily im glad i made them behave youve more than repaid rouletta paused she strained her ears to catch the sound of voices from the neighboring tents i dont hear father said she i wonder if he could have gone perhaps the men have put him to bed but miss kirby would not accept this explanation im afraid again she listened apprehensively once he gets a taste of liquor theres no handling him hes terrible even danny couldnt do anything with him sometimes even i have failed hurriedly she took down her sodden skirt and made as if to draw it on oh child you mustnt you simply must not go out this way wait here ill find him for you and make sure hes all right the halfclad girl smiled miserably thank you said she but when the countess had stepped out into the night she finished dressing herself her clothing of course was as wet as ever for the warmth of the tent in these few moments had not even heated it through nevertheless her apprehension was so keen that she was conscious of little bodily discomfort you were right the countess announced when she returned he slipped into some borrowed clothes and went uptown he told the boys he couldnt sit still but you mustnt follow at least in that dress did he drink any more im afraid he did heedless of the elder womans restraining hands rouletta kirby made for the tent opening please dont stop me she implored theres no time to lose and ill dry out in time let me go for you no no then may i go along again the girl shook her head i can handle him better alone hes a strange man a terrible man when hes this way i hope im not too late roulettas wet skirts slatted about her ankles as she ran it was a windy chilly night and in spite of the fact that it was a steep climb to the top of the low bluff she was chilled to the bone when she came panting into the sprawling cluster of habitations that formed the temporary town of white horse tents were scattered over a dim stumpy clearing lights shone through trees that were still standing a meandering trail led past a straggling row of canvastopped structures and from one of these issued the wavering metallic notes of a phonograph advertising the place as a house of entertainment sam kirby was at the bar when his daughter discovered him and her first searching look brought dismay to the girl pushing her way through the crowd she said quietly father hello he exclaimed in surprise what are you doing here i want to speak to you now letty he protested when she had drawn him aside havent you been through enough for one day run back to the countess camp where i left you dont drink any more she implored with an agony of dread in her face kirbys bleak countenance set itself in stony lines ive got to said he im cold frozen to the quick i need something to warm me up letty could smell the whisky on his breath she could see a new light in his eyes and already she sensed rather than observed a subtle change in his demeanor oh dad she quavered then she bowed her head weakly upon his arm and her shoulders shook kirby laid a gentle hand upon her then exclaimed in surprise why kid youre still wet got those same clothes on havent you he raised his voice to the men he had just left want to see the gamest girl in the world well here she is you saw how she took her medicine today now listen to this shes wet through but she came looking for her old dad afraid hed get into trouble disregarding the crowd and the appreciative murmur her fathers praise evoked rouletta begged in a low earnest voice please dear come away please you know why come away wont you for my sake kirby stirred uneasily i tell you im cold he muttered but stopped short staring yes and i see danny i see him as he went overboard drowned ill never get him out of my sight i cant seem to understand that hes gone but everythings gone for that matter everything oh no dad why youre here and im here weve been broke before kirby smiled again but cheerlessly oh we aint exactly broke ive got the bankroll on me and it ll pull us through weve had bad luck for a year or two but its bound to change you cheer up and come over to the stove what you need is to warm up while i get you a little drink rouletta gazed up into the gray face above her dad look at me she took his hand havent we had enough trouble for one day the gambler was irritated at this persistence and he showed it dont be foolish he cried shortly i know what i need and i know what i can stand these men are friends of mine and you neednt be uneasy now kid you let me find a place for you to spend the night not until youre ready to go along all right stick around for a little while i wont be long old sam drew a bench up beside the stove and seated the girl upon it im all broke up and ive just got to keep moving he explained more feelingly then he returned to the bar realizing that he was completely out of hand and that further argument was futile rouletta kirby settled herself to wait in spite of her misery it never occurred to her to abandon her father to his own devices even for an hour she knew him too well to run that risk but her very bones were frozen and she shivered wretchedly as she held her shoes up to the stove although the fire began slowly to dry her outer garments the clothes next to her flesh remained cold and clammy even so their chill was as nothing to the icy dread that paralyzed the very core of her being pierce phillips told himself that this had been a wonderful day an epochmaking day for him lately he had been conscious that the north was working a change in him but the precise extent of that change even the direction it was taking had not been altogether clear now however he thought he understood he had been quite right that first hour in dyea when he told himself that life lay just ahead of him just over the chilkoot such indeed had proved to be the case yes and it had welcomed him with open arms it had ushered him into a new and wondrous world his hands had fallen to mens tasks experience had come to him by leaps and bounds in a rush he had emerged from groping boyhood into full maturity physically mentally morally he had grown strong and broad and brown having abandoned himself to the tides of circumstance he had been swept into a new existence where adventure had rubbed shoulders with him where love had smiled into his eyes danger had tested his mettle too and today the final climax had come what roused his deepest satisfaction now was the knowledge that he had met that climax with credit tonight it seemed to him that he had reached full manhood and in the first flush of realization he assured himself that he could no longer drift with the aimless current of events but must begin to shape affairs to his own ends more than once of late he had pondered a certain thought and now having arrived at a decision he determined to act upon it ever since that stormy evening at linderman his infatuation for hilda had increased but owing to circumstances he had been thwarted in enjoying its full delights during the daylight hours of their trip as matter of fact the two had never been alone together even for a quarter of an hour they had scarcely had a word in confidence and in consequence he had been forced to derive what comfort he could from a chance look a smile some inflection of her voice even at night after camp was pitched it had been little better for the thin walls of her canvas shelter afforded little privacy and being mindful of appearances he had never permitted himself to be alone with her very long at a time only long enough in fact to make sure that his happiness was not all a dream a vibrant protestation now and then a secret kiss or two a few stolen moments of delirium that was as far as his loveaffair had progressed not yet had he and hilda arrived at a definite understanding never had they thoroughly talked out the subject that engrossed them both never had they found either time or opportunity in which to do more than sigh and whisper and hold hands and as a result the woman remained almost as much of a mystery to pierce as she had been at the moment of her first surrender it was an intolerable situation and so under the spell of his buoyant spirits he determined to make an end of it once for all the countess recognized his step when he came to her tent and she spoke to him mistaking her greeting for permission to enter he untied the strings and stepped inside only to find her unprepared for his reception she had made her shelter snug a lively fire was burning the place was fragrant of pine boughs and a few deft feminine touches here and there had transformed it into a boudoir hilda had removed her jacket and waist and was occupied in combing her hair but at pierces unexpected entrance she hurriedly gathered the golden shower about her bare shoulders and voiced a protest at his intrusion he stood smiling down at her and refused to withdraw never had phillips seen such an alluring picture now that her hair was undone its length and its profusion surprised him for it completely mantled her and through it the snowy whiteness of her bare arms folded protectingly across her rounded breasts was dazzling the sight put him in a conquering mood he strode forward lifted her into his embrace then smothered her gasping protest with his lips for a long moment they stood thus finally the woman freed herself then chided him breathlessly but the fragrance of her hair had gone to his brain he continued to hold her tight meanwhile burying his face in the golden cascade roughly masterfully he rained kisses upon her he devoured her with his caresses and the heat of his ardor melted her resistance until finally she surrendered abandoning herself wholly to his passion when after a time she flung back her head and pushed him away her face her neck her shoulders were suffused with a coral pinkness and her eyes were misty you must be careful she whispered in a tone that was less of a remonstrance than an invitation remember were making shadowgraphs for our neighbors thats the worst of a tent at night one silhouettes ones very thoughts then put out the light he muttered thickly but she slipped away and her moist lips mocked him in silent laughter the idea what in the world has come over you why youre the most impetuous boy boy pierce grimaced his dislike of the word dont be motherly dont treat me as if i had rompers on youre positively maddening tonight i never saw you like this why your hair he ran his hands through that silken shower once more and pressed it to his face its glorious the countess slipped into a combingjacket then she seated herself on the springy couch of pine branches over which her fur robe was spread and deftly caught up her long runaway tresses securing them in place with a few mysterious twists and expert manipulations boy indeed he scoffed flinging himself down beside her thats over with long ago oh i dont feel motherly she asserted still suffused with that telltale flush not in the way you mean but youll always be a boy to me and to every other woman who learns to care for you every other woman pierces eyes opened what a queer speech there arent going to be any other women he looked on while she lighted a cigarette then after a moment he inquired what do you mean she answered him with another question do you think im the only woman who will love you why i havent given it any thought whats the difference as long as youre the only one i care for and i do love you i worship but there will be others she persisted there are bound to be youre that kind really the countess nodded her head with emphasis i can read men i can see the color of their souls you have the call what call pierce was puzzled the well the sexcall the sex appeal indeed am i supposed to feel flattered at that by no means youre not a cad men who possess that attraction are spoiled sooner or later you dont realize that you have it and thats what makes you so nice but i felt it from the first and when you feel it youll probably become spoiled too like the others this amused phillips but the woman was in sober earnest i mean what i say youre the kind who cause women to make fools of themselves old or young married or single when a girl has it shes lost im not sure i understand at any rate you havent made a fool of yourself no the countess smiled vaguely questioningly she opened her lips to say more but changed her mind and in an altered tone declared my dear boy if you understood fully what im driving at youd be insufferable laying her warm hand over his she continued you resent what you call my motherly way but if i were sixteen and you were forty it would be just the same women who are afflicted with that sex appeal become mens playthings the man who possesses it always remains a boy to the woman who loves him a bad boy a dangerous boy perhaps but a boy nevertheless she may and probably will adore him fiercely passionately jealously but at the same time she will hover him as a hen hovers her chick he will be both son and lover to her he had listened closely but now he stirred uneasily i dont follow you he said and it isnt exactly pleasant for a fellow to be told that hes a baby don juan to be called a male vampire in kneepants especially by the woman hes going to marry disregarding her attempt to speak he went on what you said about other women the way you said it sounded almost as if well as if you expected there would be such and didnt greatly care you didnt mean it that way i hope you do care dont you dear you do love me the face phillips turned upon the countess courteau was earnest worried her fingers tightened over his hand when she spoke there was a certain listlessness a certain fatigue in her tone do you need to ask that after what happened just now of course i care i care altogether too much thats the whole trouble you see the thing has run away with me pierce it has carried me off my feet and thats precisely the point im trying to make he slipped an arm about her waist and drew her close i knew it wasnt merely an animal appeal that stirred you i knew it was something bigger and more lasting than that even yet you dont understand she declared the two may go together and but without allowing her to finish he said vibrantly whatever it is you seem to find it an obstacle an objection why struggle against the inevitable you are struggling ive seen you fighting something ever since that first night when truth came to us out of the storm but hilda dear i adore you youre the most wonderful creature in the world youre a goddess i feel unworthy to touch the hem of your garments but i know that you are mine nothing else matters think of the miracle the wonder of it its like a beautiful dream ive had doubts about myself and thats why ive let matters drift you see i was a sort of unknown quantity but now i know that ive found myself today i went through hell and i came out a man im going to play a mans part right along after this he urged her eagerly weve a hard trip ahead of us before we reach dawson winter may overtake us and delay us we cant continue in this way why wait any longer you mean the woman inquired faintly i mean this marry me here tomorrow no no please the countess freed herself from pierces embrace why not are you afraid of me she shook her head silently then why not tomorrow instead of next month are you afraid of yourself no im afraid ofwhat i must tell you phillips eyes were dim with desire he was ablaze with yearning in a voice that shook he said dont tell me anything i wont hear it then after a brief struggle with himself he continued more evenly that ought to prove to you that ive grown up i couldnt have said it three months ago but ive stepped out of of the nursery into a world of big things and big people and i want you i dare say youve lived a woman like you must have had many experiences many obstacles to overcome but i might not understand what they were even if you told me for im pretty green anyhow im sure youre good i wouldnt believe you if you told me you werent its no credit to me that i havent confessions of my own to make for im like other men and it merely so happens that ive had no chance tosoil myself the credit is due to circumstance everything is due to circumstance the woman said our lives are haphazard affairs were blown by chance well take a new start tomorrow and bury the past whatever it is you make it absolutely necessary for me to speak the countess told him her tone again had a touch of weariness in it but pierce did not see this i knew id have to sooner or later but it was nice to drift and to dream oh it was pleasant so i bit down on my tongue and i listened to nothing but the song in my heart she favored pierce with that shadowy luminous smile he had come to know it was a clean sweet song and it meant a great deal to me when he undertook to caress her she drew away then sat forward with her heels tucked close into the pine boughs her chin upon her knees it was her favorite attitude of meditation wrapped thus in the embrace of her own arms she appeared to gain the strength and the determination necessary to go on im not a weak woman she began staring at the naked candleflame which gave light to the tent it wasnt weakness that impelled me to marry a man i didnt love it was the determination to get ahead and the ambition to make something worth while out of myself a form of selfishness perhaps but i tell you all women are selfish anyhow he seemed to promise better things and to open a way whereby i could make something out of my life instead of that he opened my eyes and showed me the world as it is not as i had imagined it to be he was no good you may think i was unhappy over that but i wasnt really he didnt mean much to me what did grieve me though was the death of my illusions he was mercenary the fault of his training i dare say but he had that mancall i spoke about its really a womancall he was weak worthless full of faults mean in small things but he had an attraction and it was impossible to resist mothering him other women felt it and yielded to it so finally we went our separate ways ive seen nothing of him for some time now but he keeps in touch with me and ive sent him a good deal of money when he learns that i have prospered in a big way hell undoubtedly turn up again pierce weighed the significance of these words then he smiled dear its all the more reason why we should be married at once id dare him to annoy you then my boy dont you understand i cant marry you being still married to him phillips recoiled his face whitened dismay reproach a shocked surprise were in the look he turned upon his companion still married he gasped oh hilda she nodded and lowered her eyes i supposed you knew until i got to telling you and then it was too late pierce rose his lips now were as colorless as his cheeks im surprised hurt he managed to say how should i know why this is wretched rotten people will say that ive got in a mess with a married woman thats what it looks like too his voice broke huskily how could you do it when i meant my love to be clean honorable how could you let me put myself and you in such a position you see the woman continued to avoid his eye you havent grown up you havent the least understanding i understand this much he cried hotly that youve led me to make something worse than a cad of myself look here there are certain things which no decent fellow goes in for certain things he despises in other men and thats one of them he turned as if to leave then he halted at the tent door and battled with himself after a moment during which the countess courteau watched him fixedly he whirled crying well the damage is done i love you i cant go along without you divorce that man ill wait im not sure i have legal grounds for a divorce im not sure that i care to put the matter to a test as yet what pierce gazed at her trying to understand say that over again you think youve found yourself but have you i know men pretty well and i think i know you youve changed yes tremendously but what of a year two years from now youve barely tasted life and this is your first intoxication do you love me or do you not he demanded i love you as you are now i may hate you as you will be tomorrow ive had my growth ive been through what youre just beginning we cant change together then will you promise to marry me afterward the countess shook her head its a promise that would hold only me why ask it youre thinking of no one but yourself he protested furiously think of me ive given you all i have all thats best and finest in me i shall never love another woman not in quite the way you love me perhaps but the peach ripens even after its bloom has been rubbed off you have given me what is best and finest your first love and i shall cherish it will you marry me he cried hoarsely she made a silent refusal then i can put but one interpretation upon your actions dont be too hasty in your judgment cant you see i was weak i was tired then you came like a draught of wine and i lost my head but ive regained it i dreamed my dream but its daylight now and im awake i know that you believe me a heartless selfish woman maybe i am but ive tried to think for you and to act on that good impulse i tell you i would have been quite incapable of it before i knew you a day a month a year of happiness most women of my age and experience would snatch at it but im looking farther ahead than that i cant afford another mistake life fits me but you why youre bursting your seams youve puzzled me with a lot of words the young man said with evergrowing resentment but what do they all amount to you amused yourself with me and youre ready enough to continue so long as i pour my devotion at your feet well i wont do it if you loved me truly you wouldnt refuse to marry me isnt that so true love isnt afraid it doesnt quibble and temporize and split hairs the way you do no it steps out boldly and follows the light youve had your fun youve broken my heart phillips voice shook and he swallowed hard im through im done i shall never love another woman as i love you but if what you said about that sexcall is true i ill play the game as you played it he turned blindly and with lowered head plunged out of the tent into the night the countess listened to the sounds of his departing footsteps then when they had ceased she rose wearily and flung out her arms there was a real and poignant distress in her eyes boy boy she whispered it was sweet but there had to be an end for a long time she stood staring at nothing then she roused herself with a shiver refilled the stove and seated herself again dropping her chin upon her knees as she did instinctively when in deep thought if only i were sure she kept repeating to herself but he has the call and im too old chapter xiii rouletta kirby could not manage to get warm the longer she sat beside the stove the colder she became this was not strange for the room was draughty people were constantly coming in and going out and when the door was opened the wind caused the canvas walls of the saloon to bulge and its roof to slap upon the rafters the patrons were warmly clad in mackinaw flannel and fur to them the place was comfortable enough but to the girl who sat swathed in sodden undergarments it was like a refrigerator more than once she regretted her heedless refusal of the countess courteaus offer of a change several times in fact she was upon the point of returning to claim it but she shrank from facing that wintry wind so low had her vitality fallen then too she reasoned that it would be no easy task to find the countess at this hour of the night for the beach was lined with a mile of tents all more or less alike she pictured the search herself groping her way from one to another and mumbling excuses to surprised occupants no it was better to stay here beside the fire until her clothes dried out she would have reminded her father of her discomfort and claimed his assistance only for the certainty that he would send her off to bed which was precisely what she sought to prevent her presence irritated him nevertheless she knew that his safety lay in her remaining sam kirby sober was in many ways the best of fathers he was generous he was gentle he was considerate sam kirby drunk was another man entirely a thoughtless wilful cruel man subject to vagaries of temper that were as mysterious to the girl who knew him so well as they were dangerous to friend and foe alike he was drunk now or in that peculiar condition that passed with him for drunkenness intoxication in his case was less a condition of body than a frame of mind and it required no considerable amount of liquor to work the change whisky even in small quantities served to suspend certain of his mental functions it paralyzed one lobe of his brain as it were while it aroused other faculties to a preternatural activity and awoke sleeping devils in him the more he drank the more violent became his destructive mood the more firmly rooted became his tendencies and proclivities for evil the girl well knew that this was an hour when he needed careful watching and when to leave him unguarded even temporarily meant disaster rouletta clenched her chattering teeth and tried to ignore the chills that raced up and down her body white horse at this time was purely a makeshift camp hence it had no facilities for gambling the saloons themselves were little more than liquor caches which had been opened overnight for the purpose of reaping quick profits therefore such games of chance as went on were for the most part between professional gamblers who happened to be passing through and who chose to amuse themselves in that way after perhaps an hour during which a considerable crowd had come and gone sam kirby broke away from the group with which he had been drinking and made for the door as he passed rouletta he paused to say im going to drift around a bit kid and see if i cant stir up a little game where are we going to put up for the night his daughter inquired i dont know yet its early want to turn in rouletta shook her head ill find a place somewhere now you stick here where its nice and warm ill be back by and by with sinking heart the girl watched him go after a moment she rose and followed him out into the night she was surprised to discover that the mud under foot had frozen and that the north wind bore a burden of fine hard snow particles keeping well out of sight she stumbled to another saloon door and then after shivering wretchedly outside for a while she stole in and crept up behind the stove she was very miserable indeed by this time and as the evening wore slowly on her misery increased after a while her father began shaking dice with some strangers and the size of their wagers drew an audience of interested bystanders rouletta realized that she should not have exposed herself anew to the cold for now her sensations had become vaguely alarming she could not even begin to get warm except now and then when a burning fever replaced her chill she felt weak and ill inside the fingers she pressed to her aching temples were like icicles eventually she had lost all track of time her condition became intolerable and she decided to risk her fathers displeasure by interrupting him and demanding that he secure for both of them a lodgingplace at once there were several banknotes of large denomination on the plank bartop and sam kirby was watching a cast of dice when his daughter approached therefore he did not see her nor did he turn his head when she laid a hand upon his arm now women especially pretty women were common enough sights in alaskan drinkingplaces so it was not strange that roulettas presence had occasioned neither comment nor curiosity more than once during the last hour or two men had spoken to her with easy familiarity but they had taken no offense when she had turned her back it was quite natural therefore that the fellow with whom kirby was gambling should interpret her effort to claim attention as an attempt to interrupt the game and that he should misread the meaning of her imploring look there being considerable money at stake he frowned down at her then with an impatient gesture he brushed her aside none of that sister he warned her you get out of here sam kirby was in the midst of a discussion with the proprietor across the bar and because there was a deal of noise in the place he did not hear his daughters lowspoken protest oh i mean it the former speaker scowled at rouletta you dolls make me sick grabbing at every nickel you see beat it now theres plenty of young suckers for you to trim if you cant respect an old man with gray hair why the rest of his remark caused the girls eyes to widen and the chattering voices to fall silent sam kirby turned the dicebox poised in his right hand eh whats that he queried vaguely im talking to this pinkfaced golddigger father rouletta exclaimed im just telling her the fellow repeated his remark whereupon understanding came to kirby and his expression slowly altered surprise incredulity gave place to rage his eyes began to blaze you said that to her he gasped in amazement to my kid there was a moment of tense silence during which the speaker appeared to be numbed by the insult then by god sam placed the dicebox carefully upon the bar his movement was deliberate but he kept his flaming gaze fixed upon the object of his wrath and into his lean ashen countenance came such demoniac fury as to appal those who saw it rouletta uttered a faint moan and flung herself at her father with a strength born of terror she clung to his right wrist in this she was successful despite old sams effort to shake her off but she could not imprison both his arms kirby stepped forward dragging the girl with him he raised that wicked artificial left hand and brought it sweeping downward and for a second time that day the steel shaft met flesh and bone his victim spun upon his heels then with outflung arms and an expression of shocked amazement still upon his face he crashed backward to the floor kirby strode to him before other hands could come to roulettas assistance and bear him out of reach he twice buried his heavy hobnailed boot in the prostrate figure he presented a terrible exhibition of animal ferocity for he was growling oaths deep in his throat and in his eyes was the light of murder he fought for liberty with which to finish his task and those who restrained him found that somehow he had managed to draw an ivoryhandled sixshooter from some place of concealment nor could they wrench the weapon away from him he insulted my kid my girl letty kirby muttered hoarsely when the fallen man had been lifted to his feet and hurried out of the saloon old sam tried his best to follow but his captors held him fast they pleaded with him they argued they pacified him as well as they could it was a long time however before they dared trust him alone with rouletta and even then they turned watchful eyes in his direction i didnt want anything to happen the girl spoke listlessly kirby began to rumble again but she interrupted him it wasnt the mans fault it was a perfectly natural mistake on his part and ive learned to expect such things i im sick dad you must find a place for me quick sam agreed readily enough the biting cold of the wind met them at the door rouletta summoning what strength she could trudged along at his side it did not take them long to canvass the town and to discover that there were no lodgings to be had rouletta halted finally explaining through teeth that chattered i im frozen take me back where theres a stove back to the saloon anywhere only do it quickly pshaw it isnt cold kirby protested mildly the nature of this remark showed more plainly than anything he had said or done during the evening that the speaker was not himself it signified such a dreadful change in him it marked so surely the extent of his metamorphosis that roulettas tears came looks like wed have to make the best of it and stay awake till morning the father went on dully no no im too sick the girl sobbed and too cold leave me where i can keep warm then go find the countess and ask her to put me up returning to their startingpoint kirby saw to his daughters comfort as best he could after which he wandered out into the night once more his intentions were good but he was not a little out of patience with letty and still very angry with the man who had affronted her rage at the insult glowed within his disordered brain and he determined before he had gone very far that his first duty was to right that wrong probably the miscreant was somewhere around or if not he would soon make his appearance sam decided to postpone his errand long enough to look through the other drinkingplaces and to settle the score no one on seeing him thus would have suspected that he was drunk he walked straight his tongue was obedient and he was master of his physical powers to a deceptive degree only in his abnormally alert and feverish eyes was there a sign that his brain was completely crazed rouletta waited for a long while and steadily her condition grew worse she became lightheaded and frequently lost herself in a sort of painful doze she did not really sleep however for her eyes were open and staring her wits wandered away on nightmare journeys returning only when the pains became keener her fever was high now she was nauseated listless her chest ached and her breathing troubled her when she was conscious enough to think her surroundings became unreal too the faces that appeared and disappeared before her were the faces of dream figures unmindful of his daughters need heedless of the passage of time sam kirby loitered about the saloons and waited patiently for the coming of a certain man after a time he bought some chips and sat in a poker game but he paid less attention to the spots on his cards than to the door through which men came and went these latter he eyed with the unblinking stare of a serpent pierce phillips life was ruined he was sure of it precisely what constituted a ruined life just how much such a one differed from a successful life he had only the vaguest idea but his own at the moment was tasteless spoiled dire consequences were bound to follow such a tragedy as this so he told himself and he looked forward with gloomy satisfaction to their realization whatever they should prove to be however terrible the fate that was to overtake him the guilt the responsibility therefor lay entirely upon the heartless woman who had worked the evil and he earnestly hoped they would be brought home to her yes the countess courteau was heartless wicked cruel her unsuspected selfishness her lack of genuine sentiment her cool calculating caution were shocking pierce had utterly misread her at first that was plain that he was really hurt deeply distressed sorely aggrieved was true enough for his love infatuation if you will was perfectly genuine and exceedingly vital nothing is more real more vital than a normal boys first infatuation unless it be the first infatuation of a girl precisely wherein it differs from the riper less demonstrative affection that comes with later years and wider experience is not altogether plain certainly it is more spontaneous more poignant certainly it has in it equal possibilities for good or evil how deep or how disfiguring the scar it leaves depends entirely upon the healing process but for that matter the same applies to every heart affair had phillips been older and wiser he would not have yielded so readily to despair experience would have taught him that a womans no is not a refusal wisdom would have told him that the absolute does not exist but being neither experienced nor wise he mistook the downfall of his castle for the wreck of the universe and it never occurred to him that he could salvage something or if need be rebuild upon the same foundations what he could neither forget nor forgive at this moment was the fact that hilda had not only led him to sacrifice his honor or its appearance but also that when he had managed to reconcile himself to that wrong she had lacked the courage to meet him halfway there were but two explanations of her action either she was weak and cowardly or else she did not love him neither afforded much consolation in choosing a course of conduct no man is strong enough to divorce himself entirely from his desires to follow the light of pure reason for memories impulses yearnings are bound to bring confusion although pierce told himself that he must renounce this woman that he had renounced her nevertheless he recalled with a thrill the touch of her bare arms and the perfume of her streaming golden hair as he had buried his face in it and the keenness of those memories caused him to cry out the sexcall had been stronger than he had realized therefore to his present grief was added an inescapable almost irresistible feeling of physical distress a frenzy of balked desire which caused him to waver irresolutely confusing the issue dreadfully for a long time he wandered through the night fighting his animal and his spiritual longings battling with irresolution striving to reconcile himself to the crash that had overwhelmed him more than once he was upon the point of rushing back to the woman and pouring out the full tide of his passion in a desperate attempt to sweep away her doubts and her apprehensions what if she should refuse to respond he would merely succeed in making himself ridiculous and in sacrificing what little appearance of dignity he retained thus pride prevented uncertainty paralyzed him some women it seemed to him not bad in themselves were born to work evil and evidently hilda was one of them she had done her task well in this instance for she had thoroughly blasted his life he would pretend to forget but nevertheless he would see to it that she was undeceived and that the injury she had done him remained an everpresent reproach to her that would be his revenge real forgetfulness of course was out of the question how could he assume such an attitude as he pondered the question he remembered that there were artificial aids to oblivion ruined men invariably took to drink why shouldnt he attempt to drown his sorrows after all might there not be real and actual relief in liquor after consideration he decided to try it from a tent saloon near by came the sounds of singing and of laughter and thither he turned his steps when he entered the place a lively scene greeted him somehow or other a small portable organ had been secured and at this a bearded fellow in a mackinaw coat was seated he was playing a spirited accompaniment for two women sisters evidently who sang with the loud abandon of professional coon shouters other women were present and phillips recognized them as members of that theatrical troupe he had seen at sheep camp as those actresses to whom tom linton had referred with such elaborate sarcasm all of them it appeared were out for a good time and in consequence white horse was being treated to a free concert the song ended in a burst of laughter and applause the men at the bar pounded with their glasses and there was a general exodus in that direction one of the sisters flung herself enthusiastically upon the volunteer organist and dragged him with her there was much hilarity and a general atmosphere of license and unrestraint phillips looked on moodily he frowned his lip curled all the world was happy it seemed while he nursed a broken heart well that was in accord with the scheme of things life was a mad topsyturvy affair at best and there was nothing stable about any part of it he felt very grim very desperate very much abused and very much outside of all this merriment men were playing cards at the rear of the saloon and among the number was sam kirby the old gambler showed no signs of his trying experience of the afternoon in fact it appeared to have been banished utterly from his mind he was drinking and even while pierce looked on he rapped sharply with his iron hand to call the bartenders attention meanwhile he scanned intently the faces of all newcomers when the crowd had surged back to the organ pierce found a place at the bar and called for a drink of whisky the first he had ever ordered this was the end he told himself he poured the glass nearly full then he gulped the liquor down it tasted much as it smelled hence he derived little enjoyment from the experience as he stripped a bill from his sizable roll of banknotes the bartender eyed him curiously and seemed upon the point of speaking but pierce turned his shoulder after perhaps five minutes the young man acknowledged a vague disappointment if this was intoxication there was mighty little satisfaction in it he decided and no forgetfulness whatever he was growing dizzy to be sure but aside from that and from the fact that his eyesight was somewhat uncertain he could feel no unusual effect perhaps he expected too much perhaps also he had drunk too sparingly again he called for the bottle again he filled his glass again he carelessly displayed his handful of paper currency engaged thus he heard a voice close to his ear it said hello man pierce turned to discover that a girl was leaning with elbows upon the plank counter at his side and looking at him her chin was supported upon her clasped fingers she was staring into his face she eyed him silently for a moment during which he returned her unsmiling gaze she dropped her eyes to the whiskyglass then raised them again to his can you take a drink like that and not feel it she inquired no i want to feel it thats why i take it he said gruffly whats the idea idea well its my own idea my own business the girl took no offense she maintained her curious observation of him she appeared genuinely interested in acquainting herself with a man who could master such a phenomenal quantity of liquor there was mystification in her tone when she said but i saw you come in alone and now youre drinking alone is that a reproach i beg your pardon pierce swept her a mocking bow what will you have without removing her chin from its restingplace the stranger shook her head shortly so he downed his beverage as before the girl watched him interestedly as he paid for it thats more money than ive seen in a month said she i wouldnt be so free and easy with it if i were you no why not she merely shrugged and continued to study him with that same disconcerting intentness she reminded him of a frank and curious child pierce noticed now that she was a very pretty girl and quite appropriately dressed under the circumstances she wore a boys suit with a short skirt over her knickerbockers and since she was slim the garments added to her appearance of immaturity her face was oval in outline and it was of a perfectly uniform olive tint her eyes were large and black and velvety their lashes were long their lids were faintly smudged with a shadowy undercoloring that magnified their size and intensified their brilliance her hair was almost black nevertheless it was of fine texture a few unruly strands had escaped from beneath her fur cap and they clouded her brow and temples at first sight she appeared to be foreign and of that smoky type commonly associated with the russian idea of beauty but she was not foreign not russian nor were her features predominantly racial whats your name she asked suddenly pierce told her and yours he inquired laure laure what just laure for the present humph youre one of this theatrical company i presume he indicated the singers across the room yes morris best hired us to work in his place at dawson i remember your outfit at sheep camp best was nearly crazy hes crazier now than ever laure smiled for the first time and her face lit up with mischief poor morris we lead him around by his big nose hes deathly afraid hell lose us and we know it so we make his life miserable she turned serious abruptly and with a candor quite startling said i like you indeed pierce was nonplussed the girl nodded you looked good to me when you came in are you going to dawson of course everybody is going to dawson i suppose you have partners no pierces face darkened im alone very much alone he undertook to speak in a hollow hopeless tone big outfit none at all but i have enough money for my needs and ill probably hook up with somebody now there was a brave but cheerless resignation in his words laure pondered for a moment even more carefully than before she studied her companion that the result satisfied her she made plain by saying morris wants men i can get him to hire you would you like to hook up with us i dont know it doesnt much matter will you have something to drink now why should i they dont give any percentage here wait ill see morris and tell you what he says leaving pierce the speaker hurried to a harassed little man of hebraic countenance who was engaged in the difficult task of chaperoning this unruly aggregation of talent to him she said ive found a man for you morris man to go to dawson with us that tall goodlooking fellow at the bar mr best was bewildered what ails you he queried i dont want any men and you know it you want this fellow and youre going to hire him am i what makes you think so because its him or me laure said calmly mr best was both surprised and angered at this cool announcement you mean i spose that youll quit he said belligerently i mean that very thing the man has money bests anger disappeared as if by magic his tone became apologetic oh why didnt you say so if hell pay enough and if you want him why of course laure interrupted with an unexpected dash of temper he isnt going to pay you anything youre going to pay him top wages too understand the unhappy recipient of this ultimatum raised his hands in a gesture of despair himmel theres no understanding you girls theres no getting along with you either whats on your mind eh are you after him or his coin i dont know laure was gazing at phillips with a peculiar expression im not sure maybe im after both will you be good and hire him or oh youve got me best declared with frank resentment if you want him i spose ill have to get him for you but he muttered an oath under his breath youll ruin me oy oy ill be glad when youre all in dawson and at work after some further talk the manager approached phillips and made himself known laure tells me you want to join our troupe he began ill see that he pays you well the girl urged come on phillips thoughts were not quite clear but even so the situation struck him as grotesquely amusing im no songanddance man he said with a smile what would you expect me to do play a mandolin i dont know exactly best replied maybe you could help me ride herd on these bernhardts he ran a hand through his thin black hair thinner now by half than when he left the states if you could do that why you could save my reason he wants you to be a simon legree laure explained the manager seconded this statement by a nod of his head sure crack the whip over em keep em in line dont let em get married i thought i was wise to hire goodlookers but i was crazy they smile and they make eyes and the men fight for em they steal em away ive had a dozen battles and every time ive been licked already four of my girls are gone if i lose four more i cant open ill be ruined oy such a country every day a new loveaffair every day more trouble laure threw back her dark head and laughed in mischievous delight its a fact she told pierce the best best gets is the worst of it hes not our manager hes our slave we have lots of fun with him stepping closer to the young man she slipped her arm within his and looking up into his face said in a low voice i knew i could fix it for i always have my way will you go when he hesitated she repeated will you go with me or shall i go with you phillips started his brain was fogged and he had difficulty in focusing his gaze upon the eager upturned face of the girl nevertheless he appreciated the significance of this audacious inquiry and there came to him the memory of his recent conversation with the countess courteau why do you say that he queried after a moment why do you want me to go laures eyes searched his there was an odd light in them and a peculiar intensity which he dimly felt but scarcely understood i dont know she confessed she was no longer smiling and although her gaze remained hypnotically fixed upon his she seemed to be searching her own soul i dont know she said again but you have a call in spite of this young womans charms and they were numerous enough phillips was not strongly drawn to her resentment anger his rankling sense of injury all these left no room for other emotions that she was interested in him he still had sense enough to perceive her amazing proposal her unmistakable air of proprietorship showed that much and in consequence a sort of malicious triumph arose within him here right at hand was an agency of forgetfulness more potent by far than the one to which he had first turned dangerous yes but his life was ruined what difference then whether oblivion came from alcohol or from the drug of the poppy deliberately he shut his ears to inner warnings he raised his head defiantly ill go said he we leave at daylight best told him chapter xiv with poleon doret to be busy was to be contented and these were busy times for him his daily routine with trap and gun had made of him an early riser and had bred in him a habit of greeting the sun with a song it was no hardship for him therefore to cook his breakfast by candlelight especially now that the days were growing short on the morning after his rescue of sam kirby and his daughter poleon washed his dishes and cut his wood then finding that there was still an hour to spare before the light would be sufficient to run miles canon he lit his pipe and strolled up to the village the ground was now white for considerable snow had fallen during the night the day promised to be extremely short and uncomfortable poleon however was impervious to weather of any sort his good humor was not dampened in the least even at this hour the saloons were well patronized for not only was the camp astir but also the usual stale crowd of allnight loiterers was not yet sufficiently intoxicated to go to bed as poleon neared the first resort the door opened and a woman emerged she was silhouetted briefly against the illumination from within and the pilot was surprised to recognize her as rouletta kirby he was upon the point of speaking to her when she collided blindly with a man who had preceded him by a step or two the fellow held the girl for an instant and helped her to regain her equilibrium exclaiming with a laugh say whats the matter with you sister cant you see where youre going when rouletta made no response the man continued in an even friendlier tone well i can see my eyesights good and it tells me youre about the bestlooking dame ive run into tonight still laughing he bent his head as if to catch the girls answer eh i dont get you who dyou say youre looking for poleon was frankly puzzled he resented this mans tone of easy familiarity and about to interfere he was restrained by roulettas apparent indifference what ailed the girl it was too dark to make out her face but her voice oddly changed and unnatural gave him cause for wonderment could it be poleons halfformed question was answered by the stranger who cried in mock reproach naughty naughty youve had a little too much thats whats the matter with you why you need a guardeen taking rouletta by the shoulders the speaker turned her about so that the dim halflight that filtered through the canvas wall of the tent saloon shone full upon her face poleon saw now that the girl was indeed not herself there was a childish vacuous expression upon her face she appeared to be dazed and to comprehend little of what the man was saying this was proved by her blank acceptance of his next insinuating words say its lucky i stumbled on to you i been up all night and so have you spose we get better acquainted what rouletta offered no objection to this proposal the fellow slipped an arm about her and led her away meanwhile pouring a confidential murmur into her ear they had proceeded but a few steps when poleon doret strode out of the gloom and laid a heavy hand upon the man my frien he demanded brusquely were you takin dis lady eh the fellow wheeled sharply whats the idea what is she to you she aint notin to me but i seen you plenty tams an you aint no good rouletta spoke intelligibly for the first time ive no place to go no place to sleep im very tired there youve got it the girls selfappointed protector grinned well i happen to have room for her in my tent as dorets fingers sank deeper into his flesh the mans anger rose he undertook to shake off the unwelcome grasp you leggo you mind your own business dis goin be my biznesse poleon announced deres someting fonny bout dis dont get funny with me i got as much right to her as you have poleon jerked the man off his feet then flung him aside as if he were unclean his voice was hoarse with disgust when he cried get out beat it by gar you aint fit for touch decent gal you spik wit her again i tear you in two piece turning to rouletta he said mamselle you lookin for your papa eh miss kirby was clasping and unclasping her fingers her face was strained her response came in a mutter so low that poleon barely caught it dannys gone gone dad hes no use fighting it its the drink and theres nothing i can do it was poleons turn to take the girl by the shoulders and wheel her about for a better look at her face a moment later he led her back into the saloon she was so oddly obedient so docile so unquestioning that he realized something was greatly amiss he laid his hand against her flushed cheek and found it to be burning hot whereupon he hastily consulted the nearest bystanders they agreed with him that the girl was indeed ill more than that she was half delirious sacre wats she doin roun a saloon lak dis he indignantly demanded how come shes gettin up biffore daylight eh it was the bartender who made plain the facts she aint been to bed at all frenchy shes been up all night ridin herd on old sam kirby hes drinkin understand he tried to get some place for her to stay along about midnight but there wasnt any shes been settin there alongside of the stove for the last few hours and i been sort of keepin an eye on her for sams sake doret breathed an oath dats nice fader shes got i wish i let im drown oh he aint exactly to blame hes on a bender like to of killed a feller in here somebodyd ought to take care of this girl till he sobers up during this conference rouletta stood quivering her face a blank completely indifferent to her surroundings poleon made her sit down and but for her ceaseless whispering she might have been in a trance dorets indignation mounted as the situation became plain to him fine ting he angrily declared wat for you fellers leave dis seeck gal settin up eh me i come jus in tam for catch a loafer makin off wit her again he swore savagely deres some feller aint wort killin wal i got good warm camp i tak her dere den i fin dis fader sam wont be no good to you what she needs is a doctor and she needs him quick the bartender averred eh bien i fin him too mamselle poleon turned to the girlyoure bad seeck dats fac you care for stop in my tent the girl stared up at him blankly uncomprehendingly then drawn doubtless by the genuine concern in his troubled gaze she raised her hand and placed it in his she left it there the small fingers curling about his big thumb like those of a child poor lil bird the woodsmans brow puckered a moisture gathered in his eyes dis is hell for sure come den ma petite i fin a nes for you he raised her to her feet then removing his heavy woolen coat he placed it about her frail shoulders when she was snugly buttoned inside of it he led her out into the dim gray dawn she went with him obediently as they breasted the swirling snowflakes doret told himself that pending sam kirbys return to sanity this sick girl needed a womans care quite as much as a doctors naturally his thoughts turned to the countess courteau of all the women in white horse the countess alone was qualified to assume charge of an innocent child like this and he determined to call upon her as soon as he had summoned medical assistance when without protest rouletta followed him into his snug livingquarters doret thought again of the ruffian from whom he had rescued her and again he breathed a malediction the more fully he became aware of the girls utter helplessness the angrier he grew and the more criminal appeared her fathers conduct white horse made no pretense at morality it was but a relay station a breathingpoint where the mad rush to the klondike paused there was neither law nor order here the women who passed through were for the most part shameless creatures the majority of the men were unruly unresponsive to anything except an appeal to their animal appetites sympathy consideration chivalry had all but vanished in the heat of the great stampede that sam kirby should have abandoned his daughter to such as these was incredible criminal mere intoxication did not excuse it and poleon vowed he would give the old man a piece of his mind at the first opportunity his tent was still warm a few sticks of dry spruce caused the little stove to grow red he helped rouletta to lie down upon his bed then he drew his blankets over her you stay here lil while eh he rested a comforting hand upon her shoulder poleon goin find your papa now bimeby you goin feel better he was not sure that she understood him for she continued to mutter under her breath and began to roll her head as if in pain then he summoned all the persuasiveness he could dere now youre safe in poleons house he mak you well dam queeck a good many people were stirring when the pilot climbed once more to the stumpy clearing where the village stood and whomsoever he met he questioned regarding sam kirby it did not take him long to discover the latters whereabouts but poleons delay brief as it had been bore tragic consequences had he been a moment or two earlier he might have averted a catastrophe of farreaching effect one that had a bearing upon many lives the gold belt saloon had enjoyed a profitable allnight patronage less than an hour previously morris best had rounded up the last of his gay songbirds and put an end to their carnival the poker game however was still in progress at the big round table already numerous early risers were hurrying in to fortify themselves against the raw day just breaking and among these lastnamed by some evil whim of fate chanced to be the man for whom sam kirby had so patiently waited the fellow had not come seeking trouble no one who knew the onearmed gamblers reputation sought trouble with him but learning that kirby was still awake and in a dangerous mood he had entered the gold belt determined to protect himself in case of eventualities doret was but a few seconds behind the man but those few seconds were fateful as the pilot stepped into the saloon he beheld a sight that was enough to freeze him motionless the big kerosene lamps swung from the rafter braces above shed over the interior a peculiar sickly radiance yellowed now by reason of the pale morning light outside beneath one of the lamps a tableau was set sam kirby and the man he had struck the night before were facing each other in the center of the room and doret heard the gambler cry ive been laying for you kirbys usually impassive face was a sight it was fearfully contorted it was the countenance of a maniac his words were loud and uncannily distinct and the sound of them had brought a breathless hush over the place at the moment of dorets entrance the occupants of the saloon seemed petrified they stood rooted in their tracks as if the anger in that menacing voice had halted them in midaction poleon too turned cold for it seemed to him that he had opened the door upon a roomful of wax figures posed in theatric postures then in the flash of an eye the scene dissolved into action swift and terrifying what happened was so unexpected it came with such a lack of warning that few of the witnesses even though they beheld every move were able later to agree fully upon details whether kirby actually fired the first shot or whether his attempt to do so spurred his antagonist to lightning quickness was long a matter of dispute in a flash the room became a place of deafening echoes shouts of protest yells of fright the crash of overturning furniture the stamp of fleeing feet mingled with the loud explosion of gunshots pandemonium fortunately the troupe of women who had been here earlier were gone and the tent was by no means crowded even so there were enough men present to raise a mighty turmoil some of them took shelter behind the bar others behind the stove and the tables some bolted headlong for the door still others hurled themselves bodily against the canvas walls and ripped their way out the duel was over almost as quickly as it had begun sam kirbys opponent reeled backward and fetched up against the bar above the din his hoarse voice rose he started it you saw him tried to kill me he waved a smoking pistolbarrel at the gambler who had sunk to his knees even while he was shouting out his plea for justification kirby slid forward upon his face and the fingers of his outstretched hand slowly unloosed themselves from his gun it had been a shocking a sickening affair the effect of it had been intensified by reason of its unexpectedness and now although it was over excitement gathered fury men burst forth from their places of concealment and made for the open air the structure vomited its occupants out into the snow poleon doret had been swept aside then borne backward ahead of that stampede and at length found himself wedged into a corner he heard the victor repeating you saw him tried to kill me the speaker turned a blanched face and glaring eyes upon those witnesses who still remained hes sam kirby i had to get him or hed have got me he pressed a hand to his side then raised it it was smeared with blood in blank stupefaction the man stared at this phenomenon doret was the first to reach that motionless figure sprawled face down upon the floor it was he who lifted the gray head and spoke kirbys name a swift examination was enough to make quite sure that the old man was beyond all help outside curiosity had done its work and the human tide was setting back into the wrecked saloon when poleon rose with the body in his arms he was surrounded by a clamorous crowd through it he bore the limp figure to the clothcovered cardtable and there among the scattered emblems of sam kirbys calling poleon deposited his burden by those cards and those celluloid disks the old gambler had made his living grim fitness was in the fact that they should carpet his bier when poleon doret had forced his way by main strength out of the gold belt saloon he removed his cap and turning his face to the wind he breathed deeply of the cool clean air his brow was moist he let the snowflakes fall upon it the while he shut his eyes and strove to think engaged thus he heard lucky broad address him with the speaker was kid bridges that they had come thither on the run was plain for they were panting whats this about kirby lucky gasped we heard hes just been croaked the kid exclaimed poleon nodded i seen it all he had it comin to him and with a gesture he seemed to brush a hideous picture from before his eyes old sam dead broad it seemed was incredulous he undertook to bore his way into the crowd that was pressing through the saloon door but doret seized him wait cried the latter dat aint all dat aint de worst say wheres letty bridges inquired was she with him when it happened does she know dats wat im goin tell you in a few words poleon made known the girls condition how he had happened to encounter her and how he had been looking for her father when the tragedy occurred his listeners showed their amazement and their concern gosh thats tough it was broad speaking me n the kid had struck camp and was on our way down to fix up our boat when we heard about the killin we couldnt believe it for sam seems like it was a waste of effort to save that outfit bridges broke in sam dead and letty dyin all in this length of time shes a good kid shes goin to feel awful whos goin to

the physician announced now about kirbys daughter you say shes delirious the pilot nodded he told of roulettas drenching on the afternoon previous and of the state in which he had just found her jove pneumonia most likely it sounds serious and im afraid i cant do much you see im all ready to go but of course ill do what i can whos goin nurse her poleon demanded for a second time dere aint no women

five tousan dollar playin card las night less n eighty dollar dey lef him eighty dollar an dis from the pocket of his mackinaw poleon drew kirbys revolver that famous singleaction sixshooter the elaborate ivory grip of which was notched in several places broad and his partner eyed the weapon with intense interest thats agnes all right the former declared and thats where old sam kept his books he ran his thumbnail over the significant filemarks on the handle looks like an alligator had bit it bridges was even more deeply impressed by the announcement of kirbys losses than was his partner sam must of been easy pickin drunk like that he was a gamblin fool when he was right but i spose he couldnt think of nothin except fresh meat for agnes letty had him tagged proper and i bet shed of

curiously there was a peculiar hostile gleam in his small colorless eyes medicine every hour and a steady fire you say you dont figger to get much sleep do you non no but me im strong feller i can sleep hangin up by de ear if i got to whats the big idea eh doret was frankly puzzled wat you mean beeg idea what dyou expect to get out of all this msieu the french canadians face flushed he raised his head and met the gaze of the two men there was an air of dignity about him as he said deres plenty ting in dis worl we don get pay for you didnt spect no pay yesterday when you run de wite orse for save dis gal an her papa did you no wal im woodsman riverman i aint dam stampeder dis is my countree were friens together long tam i love it an it loves me i love de birds and hanimals an deyre

soaring as only his free soul could soar he indicated the tent at his back whence issued the sound of rouletta kirbys ceaseless murmurings dis gal shes tiny snowbird wit broken wing bien i fix her wing de bes i can i mak her well an i teach her to fly again dats all broad and bridges had listened attentively their faces impassive lucky was the first to speak lettys a good girl yunderstand shes different to these others poleon interrupted with a gesture of impatience it aint mak no difference if shes good or bad shes seeck me n the kid have done some heavy thinkin an wed about decided to get a high stool and take turns lookin out lettys game just to see that her bets went as they laid but i got a hunch youre a square guy what dyou think kid mr bridges nodded his head slowly i got the same hunch the point is this he explained we cant very well throw the countess we got some of her outfit and anyhow wed be about as handy around an invalid as a coupla cub bears i think well bow out but frenchy the gambler spoke with intense earnestness if ever we hear a kick from that gal well well foller you like a track wont we lucky well foller him to hell mr broad feelingly declared gravely ceremoniously the callers shook hands with doret then they returned whence they had come they went their way roulettas delirium continued poleons problem increased daily meanwhile however the life of the north did not slacken a single pulsebeat never since their earliest associations had tom linton and jerry quirk found themselves in such absolute accord in such complete harmony of understanding as during the days that immediately followed their reconciliation each man undertook to outdo the other in politeness each man forced himself to be considerate and strove at whatever expense to himself to lighten the others burdens all of their relations were characterized by an elaborate an almost midvictorian courtesy a friendly rivalry in selfsacrifice existed between them they quarreled goodnaturedly over the dishwashing that disgusting rite which tries the patience of every grown man when there was wood to be cut they battled with each other for the ax but there is a limit to politeness unfailing sunshine grows tedious and so does a monotonous exercise of magnanimity while it had been an easy matter to cut their rowboat in two the process of splicing it together again had required patience and ingenuity and it had resulted in delay by the time they arrived at miles canon therefore the season was far advanced and both men without knowing it were in a condition of mind to welcome any sort of a squall that would serve to freshen the unbearably stagnant atmosphere of amiability in which they were slowly suffocating here for the first time the results of their quarrel arose to embarrass them they could find no pilot who would risk his life in a craft so badly put together as theirs after repeated discouragements the partners took counsel with each other reluctantly they agreed that they were up against it seems like ive about ruined us mr quirk acknowledged ruefully you why jerry it was my fault we cut the old ship in two mr linton declared the former speaker remonstrated gently now tom its just like you to take the blame but it was my doins i instigated that fratricidal strife sweetly but firmly linton differed with his partner it aint often that youre wrong jerry old boy it aint more than once or twice in a lifetime but youre wrong now im the guilty wretch and id ought to hang for it my rotten temper pshaw you got one of the nicest dispositions i ever see in a man youre sweeter n a persimmon i pecked at you till your core was exposed im a thorn in the flesh tom and folks wouldnt criticize you none for doin away with me youre way off i climbed you with my spurs now tom sadly mr quirk wagged his gray head i dont often argue with anybody especially with you but the damnable idea of dividin our spoils originated in my evil mind and im goin to pay the penalty ill ride this whitepine outlaw through by myself you ear him down till i get both feet in the stirrups then turn him aloose ill finish settin up and i wont pull leather how you talk boats aint like horses itll take a good oarsman to navigate these rapids well quirk looked up quickly im a good oarsman there was a momentary pause aint i mr linton hastily remedied his slip of the tongue youre a bear he asserted with feeling i dont know as i ever saw a better boatman than you for your weight and experience but theres a few things about boats that you never had the chance to pick up you being sort of a cactus and alkali sailor for instance when you want a boat to go gee you have to pull on the off oar its plumb opposite to the way you steer a horse sure didnt i figger that out for the both of us we most had a runaway till i doped it out now this was a plain perversion of fact for it was tom who had made the discovery mr linton was about to so state the matter when he reflected that doubtless jerrys intentions were honest and that his failing memory was to blame for the misstatement it was annoying to be robbed of the credit for an important discovery of course but tom swallowed his resentment the point is this he said with a resumption of geniality youd get all wet in them rapids jerry and you know what that means id rather take a chance on drowning myself than to nurse you through another bad cold it was a perfectly sincere speech an indirect expression of deep concern that reflected no little credit upon the speakers generosity tom was exasperated therefore when jerry by some characteristic process of crooked reasoning managed to misinterpret it plaintively the latter said i spose i am a handicap to you tom youre mighty considrate of my feelins not to throw it up to me any oftener than you do i dont throw it up to you none i never did no jerry ill row the boat you go overland and keep your feet dry a lot of good that would do mr quirk spoke morosely id starve to death walkin around if you lost the grub this struck tom linton as a very narrow a very selfish way of looking at the matter he had taken no such view of jerrys offer he had thought less about the grub than about his partners safety it was an inconsiderate and unfeeling remark after a moment he said you know i dont throw things up to you jerry i aint that kind mr quirk stirred uneasily you didnt mean to say that did you what jerry would have answered is uncertain for his attention at the moment was attracted by a stranger who strode down the bank and now accosted him and his partner jointly bonjour msieus said the newcomer im lookin for buy some lemon you got some no mr quirk spoke irritably sure weve got a few but they aint for sale the stranger quirk remembered him as the frenchman doret whom he had seen at sheep camp smiled confidently oh yes everyting is for sale if you pay nough for him said he now this fellow had broken the thread of a conversation into which a vague undertone of acrimony was creeping a conversation that gave every indication of developing into an agreeable and soulsatisfying difference of opinion if not even into a loud and freespoken argument of the old familiar sort to have the promise of an invigorating quarrel frustrated by an idiotic diversion concerning lemons caused both old men to turn their pentup exasperation upon the speaker weve got use for our lemons and were going to keep them said tom were lemoneaters full of acid thats us we wouldnt give lemon aid to nobody jerry grinned in malicious enjoyment of his own wit you got how many poleon persisted oh bout enough mebbe a dozen or two i buy em deres poor seeck lady tom cut in brusquely you wont buy anything here dont tell us your troubles weve got enough of our own and poverty aint among the number wat trouble you got eh me im de trouble man mebbe i fix em sourly the partners explained their difficulty when poleon understood he smiled again more widely good i mak bargain wit you queeck me im pilot of de bes an i tak your boat trough for dose lemon the elderly men sat up they exchanged startled glances dyou mean it im goin have dose lemon cant you buy any in the saloons no wal wat you say tom inquired of his partner reckon you can get along without em jerry why i been savin em for you then its a go one ting you do for me eh poleon hesitated momentarily its goin tak tam for fin dam fool to hep me row dat bateau but i fin him mebbe you set up wit lil seeck gal while im gone what in a few words he made known the condition of affairs at his camp and the old men agreed readily enough with undisguised relief they clambered stiffly out of their boat and followed the french canadian up the trail as they toiled up the slope poleon explained de doctor hes go to dawson an tree day dis gal been layin seeck crazee in de head every hour medicine all de tam fire in de stove sapre im half sleep well set up with her as long as you want tom volunteered being a family man myself im a regular nurse me too jerry exclaimed i never had no family but i allus been handy around hosses and hosses is the same as people only bigger mr linton stifled a laugh at this remark thatll show you said he you leave it to me jerry well aint they no they are too plumb different the argument waxed hot it had reached its height when poleon laid a finger upon his lips commanding silence on tiptoe he led the two men into his tent when he had issued instructions and left in search of a boatman the partners seated themselves awkwardly their caps in their hands curiously apprehensively they studied the feverflushed face of the delirious girl purty aint she jerry whispered tom nodded shes sick all right too he said in a similar tone then after a moment ive been thinking about them lemons were getting about a hundred dollars a dozen for em kind of a rotten trick under the circumstances im sorry you put it up to that feller the way you did mr quirk stiffened his eyes widened in astonishment me i didnt put it up to him you done it theyre your lemons how dyou figure theyre mine you bought em didnt you i paid for em if thats what you mean but i bought em for you same as i bought that liquor youve et most of em and youve drank most of the whisky you needed it worse than i did jerry and ive always considered now any reference any reflection upon his physical limitations however remote or indirect aroused jerrys instant ire at it again aint you he cried testily i spose youll forget about that whisky in four or five years i hope so shh tom made a gesture commanding silence for jerry had unconsciously raised his voice what ails you he inquired sweetly nothin ails me jerry muttered under his breath thats the trouble youre allus talkin like it did like i had one foot in the grave and was gaspin my last im hard as a hickorynut i could throw you down and set on you mr linton opened hia bearded lips then closed them again he withdrew behind an air of wounded dignity this he reflected was his reward for days of kindness for weeks of uncomplaining sacrifice jerry was the most unreasonable the most difficult person he had ever met the more one did for him the crankier he became there was no gratitude in the man his skin wouldnt hold it take the matter of their tent for instance how would the old fellow have managed if he tom had not out of pure compassion taken pity on him and rescued him from the rain back there at linderman had jerry remembered that act of kindness he had not on the contrary he had assumed and maintained an attitude of indulgence that was in itself an offense yes more than an offense tom tried to center his mind upon his partners virtues but it was a difficult task for honesty compelled him to admit that jerry assayed mighty low when you analyzed him with care mr linton gave up the effort finally with a shake of his head what you wigwaggin about jerry inquired curiously tom made no answer after a moment the former speaker whispered meditatively id have give him the lemons if hed asked me for em sick people need lemons sometimes they do and sometimes they dont mr linton whispered shortly lemons is acid and acid cuts phlegm lemons aint acid theyre alkali this statement excited a derisive snort from mr quirk alkali my god ever taste alkali jerry had an irritating way of asserting himself in regard to matters of which he knew less than nothing his was the scornful certainty of abysmal ignorance did you ever give lemons to sick folks tom inquired in his turn sure thousands now this was such an outrageous exaggeration that linton was impelled to exclaim rats you never saw a thousand sick folks i didnt say so i said id given thousands of lemons oh tom filled his pipe and lit it whereupon his partner breathed a sibilant warning put out that smudge dyou aim to strangle the girl with a guilty start the offender quenched the fire with his thumb the idea of lightin sheepdip in a sickroom mr quirk went on with his cap he fanned violently at the fumes you dont have to blow her out of bed tom growled clumsily he drew the blankets closer beneath the sick girls chin but in so doing he again excited his companions opposition here jerry protested shes burnin up with fever you blanket em when theyve got chills gently he removed the covers from roulettas throat linton showed his contempt for this ridiculous assertion by silently pulling the bedding higher and snugly tucking it in jerry promptly elbowed him aside and pulled it lower tom made an angry gesture and for a third time adjusted the covers to suit himself whereupon jerry immediately changed them to accord with his ideas aggressively violently but without words this time the partners argued the matter they were glaring at each other they had almost come to blows when with a start jerry looked at his watch swiftly he possessed himself of the medicineglass and spoon to tom he whispered quick lift her up linton refused dont you know anything he queried never move a sick person unless you have to give it to her as she lays how you goin to feed medicine out of a spoon to anybody layin down the other demanded easy tom took the glass and the teaspoon together the two men bent over the bed but lintons hands were shaky when he pressed the spoon to roulettas lips he spilled its contents the girl rolled her head restlessly pshaw she moved she never moved jerry contradicted you missed her from his nostrils issued that annoying that insulting snort of derision which so sorely tried his partners patience you had a fair shot at her layin down tom and you never touched her maybe id have had better luck if you hadnt jiggled me hell who jiggled sh h once more mr quirk had spoken aloud if youve got to holler go down by the rapids after several clumsy attempts both men agreed that their patient had doubtless received the equivalent of a full dose of medicine so tom replaced the glass and spoon im a little out of practice he explained i thought you done fine jerry spoke with what seemed to be genuine commendation you got it into her nose every time tom exploded with wrath and it was jerrys turn to command silence why dont you hire a hall the latter inquired or mebbe i better tree a coon for you so you can bark as loud as you want to family man huh linton bristled aggressively but the whisperer continued one head of children dont make a family any more n one head of heifers makes a herd tom paled he showed his teeth beneath his gray mustache leaning forward he thrust his quivering bearded face close to the hateful countenance opposite him dyou mean to call my daughter a heifer he demanded in restrained fury keep them whiskers to yourself jerry snapped you cant pick a row with me tom i dont quarrel with nobody i didnt call your daughter a heifer and you know i didnt no doubt she would of made a fine woman if shed of grown up but say i bet i know why you lost her i bet you poured so much medicine in her crib that she drownded jerry giggled at this thought that aint funny the other rumbled if i thought you meant to call a member of my family a heifer youve called your wife worse n that ive heard you i meant everything i said she was an old catamount and probbly she was a fine woman jerry had a discourteous habit of interrupting no wonder she walked out and left you flat she was human no doubt she had a fine character to start with so did i for that matter but theres a limit to human endurance you dont have to put up with me any longer than you want to linton stormed under his breath we can get a divorce easy all it takes is a saw you made that crack once before and i called your bluff jerrys angry face was now outthrust only with difficulty did he maintain a tone inaudible to the sick girl out of pity i helped you up and handed you back your crutches but this time ill let you lay where you fall a hundred dollars a dozen for lemons for a poor little sick girl you aint got the bowels of a shark it was your proposition it wasnt it was some folks lie faster n a goat can gallop meaning me who else would i mean why dont you call me a liar and be done with it i do it aint news to anybody but you having safely landed his craft below the rapids poleon doret hurried back to his tent to find the partners sitting knee to knee face to face and hurling whispered incoherencies at each other both men were in a poisonous mood both were ripe for violence they overflowed with wrath they were glaring they shook their fists they were racked with fury insult followed abuse and the sounds that issued from their throats were like the rustlings of a cornfield in an autumn gale nor did inquiry elicit a sensible explanation from either heifer eh drowned my own child did i tom ground his teeth in a ferocious manner dont file your tusks for me jerry chattered file the saw were goin to need it you men goin cut dat boat in two again poleon inquired with astonishment sure and everything weve got it was linton who spoke there was a light of triumph in his eyes his face was ablaze with an unholy satisfaction weve been drawing lots for twenty minutes and this time i got the stove chapter xvi once again tom and jerrys skiff had been halved once again its owners smarted under the memory of insults unwarranted of gibes that no apology could atone for this time it had been old jerry who cooked his supper over an open fire and old tom who stretched the tarpaulin over his stove neither spoke both were sulky avoiding each others eye there was an air of bitter implacable hostility into this atmosphere of constraint came poleon doret and had it not been for his own anxieties he would have derived much amusement from the situation as it was however he was quite blind to it showing nothing save his own deep feeling of concern msieus he began hurriedly dat gal shes gettin more seeck im scare shes goin die tonight mebbe you set up wit me eh tom quickly volunteered why sure im a family man i family man jerry snorted derisively he had one head mister and he lost it inside of a month im a better nurse than him bien i tak you both said poleon but jerry emphatically declined the invitation cut me out if you aim to make it threehanded id jim the deck sure no ill set around and watch my grubpile tom addressed himself to poleon but his words were for his late partner that settles me said he ill have to stick close to home for theres people i wouldnt trust near a loose outfit this was of course a gratuitous affront it was fathered in malice it had its intended effect old jerry hopped as if springs in his rheumatic legs had suddenly let go he uttered a shrill warwhoop a wordless battlecry in which rage and indignation were blended if a certain old buzzardbait sets up with you frenchy count your spoons thats all i know him a hundred dollars a dozen for lemons hed rob a childs bank hed steal milk out of a sick babys bottle the pilot frowned dis aint no tam for callin names said he tonight dat gal goin die or shes goin begin get well me im mos dead now mebbe you fellers forget yoursef lil while an hep me out tom stirred uneasily with apparent firmness he undertook to evade the issue but in his eyes was an expression of uncertainty jerry too was less obdurate than he had pretended after some further argument he avoided a weak surrender by muttering all right take him along so ill know my grubs safe and ill help you out im a good hand with hosses and hosses are like humans only bigger they got more sense and more affection too they know when theyre well off now if a hoss gets down you got to get him up and walk him around my idea about this girl mr linton groaned loudly then to poleon he cried lead the way you watch the girl and ill watch this vetrinary that was an anxious and a trying night for the three men they were unskilled in the care of the sick nevertheless they realized that the girls illness had reached its crisis and that once the crisis had passed she would be more than likely to recover hour after hour they sat beside her administering her medicine regularly maintaining an even temperature in the tent and striving as best they could to ease her suffering this done they could only watch and wait putting what trust they had in her youth and her vitality their sense of helplessness oppressed the men heavily their concern increased as the hours dragged along and the life within the girl flared up to a blaze or flickered down to a mere spark doret was in a pitiable state on the verge of exhaustion for his vigil had been long and faithful it was a nightmare period of suspense for him occasionally he dozed but only to start into wakefulness and to experience apprehensions keener than before the man was beside himself and his anxiety had its effect upon tom and jerry their compassion increased when they learned how sam kirby had been taken off and how rouletta had been brought to this desperate pass the story of her devotion her sacrifice roused their deepest pity and in the heat of that emotion they grew soft this mellowing process was not sudden no spirit of forgiveness was apparent in either of the pair far from it both remained sullen unrelenting both maintained the same icy front they continued to ignore each others presence and they exchanged speech only with doret nevertheless their sympathy had been stirred and a subtle change had come over them this change was most noticeable in linton as the night wore on distressing memories memories he considered long dead and gone arose to harass him it was true that he had been unhappily married but tune had cured the sting of that experience or so he had believed he discovered now that such was not the case certain incidents of those forgotten days recurred with poignant effect he had experienced the dawn of a fathers love a fathers pride he lost himself in a melancholy consideration of what might have been had not that dawn been darkened how different how full how satisfying if as he looked down upon the fair feverflushed face of this girl he felt an unaccustomed heartache a throbbing pity and a yearning tenderness the hand with which he stroked the hair back from her brow and rearranged her pillow was as gentle as a womans jerry too altered in his peculiar way as the hours lengthened his wrinkled face became less vinegary between his eyes there appeared a deepening frown of apprehension more than once he opened his lips to ask toms opinion of how the fight progressed but managed in time to restrain himself finally he could maintain silence no longer so he spoke to doret mister it looks to me like she aint doin well poleon rose from his position beside the stove he bent over the sickbed and touched roulettas brow with his great hand in a low voice he addressed her ma soeur ma petite soeur its poleon spik to you roulettas eyes remained vacant her ceaseless whispering continued and the man straightened himself turning upon his elderly companions alarm was in his face his voice shook msieus wat shall we do queeck tell me but tom and jerry were helpless hopeless doret stared at them his hands came slowly together over his breast his groping fingers interlocked he closed his eyes and for a moment he stood swaying then he spoke again as a man speaks who suffers mortal anguish she mus not die she mus not die i tell you someting now dis lil gal shes come to mean whole lot for me at firs im sorry de same lak you feel sure but bimeby i get to know her for she talk talk all tam she talk lak crazee person an i learn to know her soul her life her soul is wite msieus its wite an beautiful her life i lit im together in

hes goin mak you well an every tam she onderstan but now a sob choked the speaker he opened his tightshut eyes and stared miserably at the two old men i call to her an she don hear wat im goin do eh neither linton nor quirk made reply poleon leaned forward fiercely he inquired which one of you feller is de bes man which one is go to church de mos tom and jerry exchanged glances it was the latter who spoke tom this gentlemanknows more about churches than i do he was married in one mr linton nodded but that was thirty years ago so i aint what youd call a regular attendant i used to carry my religion in my wifes name when i had a wife you can pray tom shook his head doubtfully id be sure to make a mess of it doret sank to a seat he lowered his head upon his hands me too he confessed every hour i mak prayer in my heart but i cant spik him out if i was a good talker id take a crack at it jerry ventured but id have to be alone dorets lips had begun to move his companions knew that he was voicing a silent appeal so they lowered their eyes for some moments the only sound in the tent was the muttering of the delirious girl linton spoke finally his voice was low it was husky with emotion ive been getting acquainted with myself tonight first time in a long while things look different than they did whats the good of fighting whats the use of hurrying and trampling on each other when this is the end gold it wont buy anything worth having youre right doret somebody to love and to care for somebody that cares for you thats all there is in the game i had dreams too when i was a lot younger but they didnt last its bad for a man to quit dreaming he gets mean and selfish and onnery take me i aint worth skinning i had a kid little girli used to tote her around in my arms funny how it makes you feel to tote a baby that belongs to you seems like all youve got is wrapped up in it you live two lives my daughter didnt stay long i just got started loving her when she went away she was awful nice the speaker blinked for his eyes were smarting i feel somehow as if she was here tonight as if this girl was her and i was her daddy she might have looked something like this young lady if she had lived she would have made a big difference in me tom felt a hand seek his it was a bony bigknuckled hand not at all like poleon dorets when it gave his fingers a strong firm friendly pressure his throat contracted painfully he raised his eyes but they were blurred he could distinguish nothing except that jerry quirk had sidled closer and that their shoulders all but touched now jerry for all of his crabbedness was a sentimentalist he also was blind and his voice was equally husky when he spoke id of been her daddy too wouldnt i tom wed of shared her fiftyfifty ive been mean to you but id of treated her all right if youll forgive me for the things ive said to you maybe the lord will forgive me for a lot of other things anyhow im goin to do a little rough prayin for this kid im goin to ask him to give her a chance mr quirk did pray and if he made a bad job of it as he more than suspected neither of his earthly hearers noticed the fact for his words were honest earnest when he had finished tom lintons arm was around his shoulders side by side the old men sat for a long time their heads were bowed they kept their eyes upon rouletta kirbys face doret stood over them motionless and intense they could hear him sigh and they could sense his suffering when the girls pain caused her to cry out weakly he knelt and whispered words of comfort to her thus the night wore on the change came an hour or two before dawn and the three men watched it with their hearts in their throats mutely they questioned one another deriving deep comfort from each confirmatory nod and gesture but for some time they dared not voice their growing hope roulettas fever was breaking they felt sure she breathed more deeply more easily and she coughed less her discomfort lessened too and finally when the candlelight grew feeble before the signs of coming day she fell asleep later the men rose and stole out of the tent into the cold doret was broken he was limp almost lifeless there were deep lines about his eyes but nevertheless they sparkled shes goin get well he said uncertainly im goin teach dat lil bird to fly again the partners nodded sure as shootin jerry declared righto linton agreed now then he spoke in an energetic purposeful tone im going to put jerry to bed while i nail that infernal boat together again not much you aint jerry exclaimed you know i couldnt sleep a wink without you tom whats more ill never try arm in arm the two partners set off down the riverbank poleon smiled after them when they were out of sight he turned his face up to the brightening sky and said aloud bon dieu i tank you for my sisters life pierce phillips awoke from a cramped and troubled slumber to find himself lying upon a pile of baggage in the stern of a skiff for a moment he remained dazed then he was surprised to hear the monotonous creak of oars and to feel that he was in motion a fur robe had been thrown over him it was powdered with snowflakes but it had kept him warm he sat up to discover laure facing him hello said he you here the girl smiled wearily where did you think id be have a good sleep he shrugged and nodded and turning his eyes shoreward saw that the forest was flowing slowly past the boat in which he found himself was stowed full of impedimenta forward of laure a man was rowing listlessly and on the seat beyond him were two female figures bundled to the ears in heavy wraps they were the coonshouting sisters whose song had drawn pierce into the gold belt saloon the evening before in the distance were several other boats you feel tough ill bet laures voice was sympathetic after a moment of consideration pierce shook his head no said he i feel fine except that im hungry i could eat a logchain no headache none why laures brown eyes widened in admiration and astonishment jimminy youre a hound for punishment you must have oak ribs were you weaned on rum i never took a drink until last night im a rank amateur really the girl studied him with renewed interest what set you off pierce made no answer his face seemed fixed in a frown his was a tragic past he could not bear to think of it much less could he speak of it noting that the oarsman appeared to be weary pierce volunteered to relieve him an offer which was quickly accepted as he seated himself and prepared to fall to work laure advised him better count your money and see if its all there he did as directed its all here he assured her she flashed him a smile then crept into the place he had vacated and drew up the robe snugly pierce wondered why she eyed him with that peculiar intentness not until she had fallen asleep did he suspect with a guilty start that the robe was hers and that she had patiently waited for him to finish his sleep while she herself was drooping with fatigue this suspicion gave him a disagreeable shock he began to give some thought to the nature of his new surroundings they were of a sort to warrant consideration for a long time he rowed mechanically a frown upon his brow in the first place he was amazed to find how bravely he bore the anguish of a breaking heart and how little he desired to do away with himself the world strangely enough still remained a pleasant place and already the fret for new adventure was stirring in him he was not happy thoughts of hilda awoke real pain and his sense of injury burned him like a brand nevertheless he could not make himself feel so utterly hopeless so blackly despondent as the circumstances plainly warranted he was on the whole agreeably surprised at his powers of resistance and of recuperation both physical and emotional for instance he should by all means experience a wretched reaction from his inebriety as a matter of fact he had never felt better in his life his head was clear he was ravenously hungry then too he was not altogether hopeless it seemed quite probable that he and hilda would again meet in which event there was no telling what might happen evidently liquor agreed with him in his case it was not only an anodyne but also a stimulus spurring him to optimistic thought and independent action yes whisky roused a fellows manhood it must be so otherwise he would never have summoned the strength to snap those chains which bound him to the countess courteau or the reckless courage to embark upon an enterprise so foreign to his tastes and to his training as this one his memory of the later incidents of the night before was somewhat indistinct as was his recollection of the scene when he had served his notice upon the countess of this much he felt certain however he had done the right thing in freeing himself from a situation that reflected discredit upon his manhood whether he had acted wisely by casting in his lot with morris bests outfit was another matter altogether he was quite sure he had not acted wisely but there is a satisfaction at certain times in doing what we know to be the wrong thing pierce was no fool even his limited experience in the north had taught him a good deal about the character of dancehall women and of the men who handled them he was in no wise deceived therefore by the respectability with which the word theatrical cloaked this troupe of wanderers it gave him a feeling of extreme selfconsciousness to find himself associated with such folk he felt decidedly out of place what would his people think and the countess courteau well it would teach her that a mans heart was not a football that a mans love was not to be juggled with he had made a gesture of splendid recklessness he would take the consequences in justice to the young man be it said he had ample cause for resentment and whatever of childishness he displayed was but natural for true balance of character is the result of experience and as yet he had barely tasted life as for the girl laure she awoke no real interest in him now that he saw her in the light of day he included her in his general vague contempt for all women of her type there was in fact a certain contamination in her touch true she was a little different from the other members of the partygreatly different from pierces preconceived ideas of the other sort but not sufficiently different to matter it is the privilege of arrogant youth to render stern and conclusive judgment best waved his party toward the shore shortly before dusk a landingplace was selected tents bedding and paraphernalia were unloaded then while the women looked on the boatmen began pitching camp the work had not gone far before phillips recognized extreme inefficiency in it confusion grew progress was slow best became more and more excited irritated at the general ineptitude pierce finally took hold of things and in a short time had made all snug for the night lights were glowing in the tents when he found his way through the gloom to the landing in search of his own belongings seated on the gunwale of a skiff he discovered laure ive been watching you she said youre a handy man he nodded is this the way best usually makes camp sure only it usually takes him much longer ill bet hes glad he hired you pierce murmured something are you glad he did why yes of course what do you think of the other girls i havent paid much attention to them he told her frankly there was a moments pause then laure said dont eh i say dont phillips shrugged in a worldweary cynical tone he asserted women dont interest me what ails you today laure inquired curiously nothing im not much of a ladies man thats all yes you are anyhow you were last night i was all tuned up then he explained thats not my normal pitch dont you like me as well as you did why certainly is there another woman another pierce straightened himself theres not even one what difference would it make if there were oh none laures teeth flashed through the gloom i was just curious curiosity killed a cat didnt it will you help me up the bank pierce took the speakers arm together they climbed the gravelly incline toward the illumination from the cook fire in the edge of the shadows laure halted and her hand slipped down over pierces remember she said meaningly dont or youll hear from me chapter xvii laure had no cause to repeat her admonition for in the days that followed pierce phillips maintained toward the women members of the party an admirable attitude of aloofness he was not rude neither was he discourteous he merely isolated himself from them and discouraged their somewhat timid advances toward friendship this doubtless would have met with laures wholehearted approval had he not treated her in precisely the same way she had at first assumed a somewhat triumphant air of proprietorship toward him but this quickly gave way to something entirely different they began to know each other to be sure for hours upon end they were together which could have resulted in nothing less than a thorough acquaintance notwithstanding this there lurked behind phillips friendly interest an emotional apathy that piqued the girl and put her on her mettle she hid her chagrin under an assumption of carelessness but furtively she studied him for every hour he bulked bigger to her he exercised a pronounced effect upon her his voice his laughter brought a light and a sparkle to her eyes she could not rest when he was out of her sight his appeal unconscious on his part struck to the very core of her being to discover that she lacked a similar appeal for him roused the girl to desperation she lay awake nights trying to puzzle out the reason for this was a new experience to her recalling their meeting and the incidents of that first night at white horse she realized that here was a baffling secret and that she did not possess the key to it one night the truth came home to her best had made camp later than usual and as a result had selected a particularly bad spot for it a brushy flat running back from a high overhanging bank beneath which ran a swirling eddy the tents were up a big campfire was blazing brightly when pierce phillips burdened with a huge armful of spruce boughs and blinded by the illumination stepped too close to the rivers rim and felt the soil beneath him crumble away down he plunged amid an avalanche of earth and gravel the last sound he heard before the icy waters received him was laures affrighted scream an instant later he had seized a sweeper to which he clung until help arrived he was wet to the skin of course his teeth were chattering by the time he had regained the campfire of the entire party laure alone had no comment to make upon the accident she stood motionless leaning for support against a tentpole her face hidden in her hands bests songbirds were noisily twittering about pierce best himself was congratulating the young man upon his ability to swim when laure spoke sharply imperiously somebody find his dry things quickly and you morris get your whisky while one of the men ran for pierces dufflebag best came hurrying with a bottle which he proffered to pierce the latter refused it asserting that he was quite all right but laure exclaimed drink take a good one then go into our tent and change as fast as you can sure the manager urged dont be afraid of good liquor there isnt much left drink it all a short time later when pierce reappeared clad in dry garments he felt none the worse for his mishap but when he undertook to aid in the preparations for the night he suspected that he had taken his employers orders too literally for his brain was whirling soon he discovered that his movements were awkward and his hands uncertain and when his campmates began to joke he desisted with a laughing confession that he had imbibed too much laure drew him out of hearing then inquired anxiously are you all right again sure i feel great i i thought id die when i saw you disappear she shuddered and hid her face in her hands for a second time it was quite dark where they stood they were sheltered from observation served me right he declared next time ill look where he halted in amazement why laure i believe youre crying she lifted her face and nodded im frightened yet she laid trembling exploratory hands upon him as if to reassure herself of his safety pierce pierce she exclaimed brokenly suddenly phillips discovered that this girls concern affected him deeply for it was genuine it was not in the least put on all at once she seemed very near to him very much a part of himself his head was spinning now and something within him had quickened magically there was a new note in his voice when he undertook to reassure his companion at his first word laure looked up startled into her dark eyes still misty with tears there flamed a light of wonder and of gladness she swayed closer she took the lapels of his coat between her gloved fingers and drew his head down to hers then she kissed him full upon the lips slowly resolutely his arms encircled her on the following morning laure asked morris best for a bottle of whisky the evenings were growing cold and some of the girls needed a stimulant while camp was being pitched she explained the bottle she gave to pierce with a request to stow it in his baggage for safekeeping and that night when they landed cramped and chilly she prevailed upon him to open it and to drink the experiment worked laure began to understand that when pierce phillips blood flowed warmly when he was artificially exhilarated then he saw her with the eyes of a lover it was not a flattering discovery but the girl contented herself for by now she was desperate enough to snatch at straws thenceforth she counted upon strong drink as her ally the closing scenes of the great autumn stampede to dawson were picturesque for the rushing river was crowded with boats all racing with one another neath lowering skies past ghostly shores seen dimly through a tenuous curtain of sifting snowflakes swept these craft they went by ones and by twos in groups and in flotillas hourly the swirling current bore them along and as the miles grew steadily less the spirits of the crews mounted loud laughter songs yells of greeting and encouragement ran back and forth a triumphant joyfulness a jovian mirth animated these men of brawn for they had met the north and they had bested her restraint had dropped away by now and they reveled in a newfound freedom there was license in the air for adventure was afoot and the unknown beckoned urged on by oar and sweep propelled by favoring breezes the argonauts pressed forward exultantly at night their roaring campfires winked at one another like beacon lights along some friendly channel unrolling before them was an endless panorama of spruce and birch and cottonwood of high hills white with snow of unexplored valleys dark with promise as the yukon increased in volume it became muddy singing a low hissing song as if the falling particles of snow melted on its surface and turned to steam out of all the traffic that flowed past the dancehall party among all the boats they overhauled and left behind pierce phillips nowhere recognized the countess courteaus outfit whether she was ahead or whether they had outdistanced her he did not know and inquiry rewarded him with no hint during this journey a significant change gradually came over the young man familiarity a certain intimacy with his companions taught him much and in time he forgot to look upon them as pariahs best for instance proved to be an irritable but goodhearted little hebrew he developed a genuine fondness for pierce which he took every occasion to show and pierce grew to like him the girls too opened their hearts and made him feel their friendship for the most part they were warm impulsive creatures and pierce was amazed to discover how little they differed from the girls he had known at home among their faults he discovered unusual traits of character there was not a little kindliness generosity and of course much cheerfulness they were freehanded with what they had they were ready with a smile a word of encouragement or of sympathy they were absurdly grateful too for the smallest favor or the least act of kindness moreover they behaved themselves extremely well they were an education to phillips he acknowledged that he had gravely misjudged them and he began to suspect that they had taught him something of charity as for laure he knew her very well by now and she knew him even better this knowledge had come to them not without cost wisdom is never cheap but precisely what each of them had paid or was destined to pay for their better understanding of each other they had not the slightest idea one thing the girl by this time had made sure of viz when pierce was his natural self he felt her appeal only faintly on the other hand the moment he was not his natural self the moment his pitch was raised he saw allurements in her and at such times they met on common ground she made the most of this fact dawson city burst into view of the party without warning and no el dorado could have looked more promising hounding a bend of the river they beheld a city of logs and canvas sprawled between the stream and a curving mountainside the day was still and clear hence vertical pencilmarkings of blue smoke hung over the roofs against the white background squat dwellings stood out distinctly like diminutive dolls houses upon closer approach the river shore was seen to be lined with scows and rowboats a sternwheeled river steamer lay moored abreast of the town above it a valley broke through from the north out of which poured a flood of clear dark water it was the valley of the klondike magic word the journey was ended bests boats were unloaded his men had been paid off and now his troupe had scattered seeking lodgings as in a dream pierce phillips joined the drifting current of humanity that flowed through the long front streets and eddied about the entrances of amusement places he asked himself if he were indeed awake if after all this was his ultima thule already the labor the hardship the adventure of the trip seemed imaginary even the town itself was unreal dawson was both a disappointment and a satisfaction to pierce it was not what he had expected and it by no means filled the splendid picture he had painted in his fancy crude raw unfinished small it was little more than dyea magnified but in enterprise it was tremendous hence it pleased and it thrilled the youth he breathed its breath he drank the wine of its intoxication he walked upon air with his head in the clouds pierce longed for some one to whom he could confide his feeling of triumph but nowhere did he recognize a face finally he strolled into one of the larger saloons and gamblinghouses and was contentedly eying the scene when he felt a gaze fixed upon him he turned his head opened his lips to speak then stiffened in his tracks he could not credit his senses for there lounging at ease against the bar his face distorted into an evil grin stood joe mccaskey pierce blinked he found that his jaw had dropped in amazement mccaskey enjoyed the sensation he had created he leered at his former campmate and in his expression was a hint of that same venom he had displayed when he had run the gauntlet at sheep camp after his flogging he broke the spell of pierces amazement and proved himself to be indeed a reality by uttering a greeting pierce was inclined to ignore the salutation but curiosity got the better of him and he answered well this is a surprise do you own a pair of sevenleague boots or what mccaskey bared his teeth further in triumph he said thought youd lost me didnt you but i fooled youfooled all of you i jumped out to the states and caught the last boat for st michael made connections there with the last upriver packet and here i am i dont quit im a finisher pierce noted the emphasis with which joes last words were delivered but as yet his curiosity was unsatisfied he wondered if the fellow was sufficiently calloused to disregard his humiliating experience or if he proposed in some way to conceal it certainly he had not evaded recognition nor had he made the slightest attempt to alter his appearance from his bold insouciance it seemed evident that he was totally indifferent as to who recognized him either the man possessed moral courage of the extremest sort or else an unbelievable effrontery as for pierce he was deeply resentful of joes false accusation the memory of that was ineradicable nevertheless in view of the outcome of that cowardly attempt he had no desire for further revenge it seemed to him that the fellow had been sufficiently punished for his misdeed in fact he could have found it easy to feel sorry for him had it not been for the illconcealed malice in joes present tone and attitude he was upon the point of answering joes indirect threat with a warning when his attention was attracted to a short thickset nervous man at his elbow the latter had edged close and was staring curiously at him he spoke now saying so youre phillips eh it was joe who replied sure this is him there was no need of an introduction pierce recognized the stranger as another mccaskey for the family likeness was stamped upon his features during an awkward moment the two men eyed each other and joe mccaskey appeared to gloat as their glances clashed this is frank the latter explained with a malicious grin he and jim was pals and say heres another guy you ought to meet he laid a hand upon still a second stranger a man leaning across the bar in conversation with a whiteaproned attendant count heres that fellow i told you about the man addressed turned exposing a handsome smiling blond face ornamented with a wellcaredfor mustache i beg pardon he exclaimed vacuously meet phillips he can give you some dope on your wife joe chuckled phillips flushed then he paled his face hardened ah to be sure count courteau bowed but he did not extend his hand phillips yes yes i remember you will understand that im distracted for news of hilda she is with you perhaps i left her employ at white horse if shes not here shell probably arrive soon excellent i shall surprise her pierce spoke dryly im afraid it wont be so much of a surprise as you think she rather expects you with a short nod and with what pretense of carelessness he could assume he moved on toward the rear of the building whence came the sounds of music and the voice of a dancehall caller for some time he looked on blindly at the whirling figures joe mccaskey here and count courteau what an astonishing coincidence and yet there was really nothing so remarkable about it doubtless the same ship had brought them north in which event they could not well have avoided a meeting pierce remembered hildas prophecy that her indigent husband would turn up like a bad penny his presence was agitating for that matter so was the presence of joe mccaskeys brother frank as yet an unknown quantity that he was an enemy was certain together he and joe made an evil team and pierce was at a loss just how to meet them later when he strolled out of the saloon he saw the three men still at the bar their heads were together they were talking earnestly chapter xviii rouletta kirby was awakened by the sound of chopping in the still frosty morning the blows of the ax rang out loudly for a moment she lay staring upward at the sloping tentroof over her bed studying with sleepy interest the frostfringe formed by her breath during the night this fringe was of intricate design it resembled tatters of filmy lace and certain fragments of it hung down at least a foot a warning that the day was to be extremely cold but rouletta needed no proof of that fact beyond the evidence of her nose the tip of which was like ice and so stiff that she could barely wrinkle it she covered it now with a warm palm and manipulated it gently solicitously there was a damp unpleasant rime of hoarfrost standing on the edge of her fur robe and this she gingerly turned back cautiously she freed one arm then raised herself upon her elbow reaching up she struck the taut canvas roof a sharp blow then with a squeak like the cry of a frightened marmot she dodged under cover just in time to avoid the frosty shower the chopping abruptly ceased poleons voice greeted her gaily bon jour ma soeur by golly you gettin be de mos lazy gal ispect you sleep all day only i mak beeg noise good morning roulettas voice was muffled as if repeating a lesson she ran on yes i feel fine i had a dandy sleep didnt cough and my lungs dont hurt and no bad dreams so i want to get up there im well you hongry too i bet eh oh im dying and my nose it wont work doret shouted his laughter you wait i mak fire queeck an cook de breakfas den you nose goin work all right i got beeg sprise for dat lil nose today the top of roulettas head her eyes then her mouth came cautiously out from hiding what is it poleon something to eat sapre what i tol you every minute eat eat you worse dan harmy of swede i aint goin tol you what is dis sprise bimeby you smell him cookin moose meat rouletta cried no poleon vigorously resumed his labor every stroke of the ax was accompanied by a loud huh i tol you notin he declared then after a moment he voiced one word caribou again rouletta uttered a famished cry soon the tent strings were drawn and the axman pushed through the door his arms full of dry spruce wood he stood smiling down at the face framed snugly in the fox fur then he dropped his burden and knelt before the stove in a moment there came a promising crackle followed quickly by an agreeable flutter which grew into a roar as the stove began to draw caribou roulettas eyes were bright with curiosity and an emotion far more material where in the world some hinjun hunter mak beeg kill i got more sprise as dat too by golly dis goin be regular chrismas for you rouletta stirred there was stubborn defiance in her tone when she said im going to get up and im going outdoors clothes or no clothes ill wrap the robe around me and play im a squaw she checked poleons protest oh im perfectly well and the clothes i have are thick enough look out you don froze yoursef dat pretty dress you got is give you chillsblain in haugust the speaker blew upon his fingers and sat back upon his heels his eyes twinkling his brown face wreathed in smiles then i can do it youll let me try rouletta was all eagerness well talk bout dat bimeby first ting we goin have beeg potlatch lak siwash weddin goody now run away while i get up but the man shook his head don be soch hurry dis tent warm slow las night de reever is froze solid so far you look pretty queeck people come do you think theyll have extra clothes something warm that i can wear sure i fix all dat still smiling poleon rose and went stooping out of the tent tying the flaps behind him a few rods distant was another shelter which he had pitched for himself in front of it on a pole provisioncache were two quarters of frozen caribou meat and seated comfortably in the snow beneath eyes fixed upon the prize were several husky dogs of unusual size at poleons appearance they began to caper and to fawn upon him ho you ole tiefs he cried sternly you lak steal dose meat i bet wal i eat you live stretching on tiptoe he removed one of the quarters and bore it into his tent the dogs gathered just outside the door cautiously they nosed the canvas aside and as poleon set to work with hatchet and huntingknife their bright eyes followed his every move non he exclaimed with a ferocious frown you dont get so much as lil smell you tink ma soeur goin hongry to feed loafer lak you bushy gray tails began to stir the heads came farther forward there was a most unmannerly licking of chops by gar you sound lak minerman eatin soup wat for youspect nice grub you don work none poleon removed a layer of fat divided it and tossed a portion to each animal the morsels vanished with a single gulp with one wolfish click of sharp white teeth no i give you notin for no reason whatever the speaker broke into loud laughter then to further relieve his bubbling joyousness he began to hum a song as he worked his song grew louder until its words were audible to the girl in the next tent oh la voix du beau nord qui mappelle pour benir avec lui le jour et desormais toute peine cruelle fuira devant mon chant damour damour damour oh the voice of the north is acalling me to join in the praise of the day so whatever the fate thats befalling me ill sing every sorrow away away away the yukon stove was redhot now and rouletta kirbys tent was warm she seated herself before a homely little dresser fashioned from two candleboxes and began to arrange her hair curiously she examined the comb and brush they were or had been poleons so was the pocketmirror hanging by a safetypin to the canvas wall above rouletta recalled with a smile the flourish of pride with which he had presented to her this ludicrous bureau and its fittings was there ever such a fellow as this doret was there ever a heart so big so kind a stranger it seemed to the girl that she had known him always there had been days days interminable when he had seemed to be some dream figure an indistinct unreal being at once familiar and unfamiliar friendly and forbidding then other days during which he had gradually assumed substance and actuality and during which she had come to know him following her return to sanity rouletta had experienced periods of uncertainty and of terror then hours of embarrassment the mere memory of which caused her to shrink and to hide her head those were times of which even yet she could not bear to think hers had been a slow recovery and a painful nay a tragic awakening but as she had gained the strength and the ability to understand and to suffer poleon with a tact and a thoughtfulness unexpected in one of his sort had dropped the character of nurse and assumed the role of friend and protector that had been roulettas most difficult ordeal the most trying time for both of them in fact not one man in ten thousand could have carried off such an awkward situation at a cost so low to a womans feelings it was of course the very awkwardness of that situation together with poleons calm courageous method of facing it that had given his patient the strength to meet him halfway and that had made her convalescence anything less than a torture and the manner in which he had allowed her to learn all the truth about herself bit by bit as her resistance grew his sympathy his repression his support he had to know just how far to go he had spared her every possible heartache he had never permitted her to suffer a moment of trepidation as to herself no her first conscious feeling now that she recalled it had been one of implicit unreasoning faith in him that confidence had increased with every hour dismay despair the wish to die had given place to resignation then to hope and now to a brave selfconfidence rouletta knew that her deliverance had been miraculous and that this man this total stranger out of the goodness of his heart had given her back her life she never ceased pondering over it she was now sitting motionless comb and brush in hand when poleon came into the tent for a second time and aroused her from her abstraction she hastily completed her toilette and was sitting curled up on her bed when the aroma of boiling coffee and the sound of frying steak brought her to her feet with a noisy clatter she enthusiastically arranged the breakfast dishes how wonderful it is to have an appetite in the morning said she then this is the last time youre going to cook you may chop the wood and build the fires but i shall attend to the rest im quite able bien the pilot smiled his agreement everybody mus work to be happy even dose dog wat you tink dey loaf so long dey begin fight jus lak people he chuckled pretty queeck we hitch her up de sled an go fly to dyea you goin henjoy dat ma soeur mebbe we meet dose cheechako comin in an dey holler hallo frenchy hows ting in dawson an we say pouf we don care bout dawson we goin home home rouletta paused momentarily in her task sure now voila breakfas shes serve in de baggagecar with a flourish he poured the coffee saying lets see if you so hongry lak you pretend or if im goin keep you in bed some more roulettas appetite was all yes more than she had declared it to be the liberality with which she helped herself to oatmeal her lavish use of the sugar spoon and her determined attack upon the can of carnation satisfied any lingering doubts in dorets mind her predatory interest in the appetizing contents of the fryingpan she eyed it with the greedy hopefulness of a healthy urchin also was eloquent of a complete recovery and brought a thrill of pride to her benefactor gosh i mak bad nurse for hospital he grinned you eat him out of house an lot he finished his meal then looked on until rouletta leaned back with regretful satisfaction thereupon he broke out wal i got more sprise for you you you cant surprise a toad and i feel just like one isnt food good now rouletta had learned much about this big woodsmans peculiarities among other things she had discovered that he took extravagant delight in his socalled sprises they were many and varied now a titbit to tempt her palate or again a native doll which needed a complete outfit of moccasins cap and parka and which he insisted he had met on the trail very numb from the cold again a pair of rabbitfur sleepingsocks for herself that crude dresser which he had completed without her suspecting him was another always he was making or doing something to amuse or to occupy her attention and although his gifts were poor sometimes absurdly simple he had nevertheless the power of investing them with importance being vitally interested in all things big or little he stimulated others to share in that interest life was an enjoyable game inanimate objects talked to him every enterprise was tinted imaginary colors and he delighted in pretense welcome traits to rouletta whose childhood had been starved what is my new sprise she queried but without answering poleon rose and left the tent he was back a moment later with a bundle in his hands this bundle he unrolled displaying a fine fur parka the hood of which was fringed with a deep foxtail facing the skirt and sleeves of an elaborate checkerboard pattern of multicolored skins gay squirreltail streamers depended from its shoulders as further ornamentation altogether it was a splendid specimen of indian needlework and rouletta gasped with delight how wonderful she cried is it for me the pilot nodded sure ting de purtiest one ever i see but look he called her attention to a beaver cap a pair of beaded moosehide mittens and a pair of small fur boots that went with the larger garments altogether a complete outfit for winter travel i buy him from dose hinjun hunter put him on queeck rouletta slipped into the parka she donned cap and mittens and poleon was in raptures by golly dats beautiful he declared now you fix for sure no matter how col she come your lil toes goin be warm you don froze your nose youre good and true and rouletta faltered then added fervently i shall always thank god for knowing you now above all things doret dreaded his sisters serious moods or any expression of her gratitude he waved her words aside with an airy gesture and began in a hearty tone we dont stop dis place no longer tomorrow we start for dyea wat you tink of dat eh pretty queeck you be home when his hearer displayed no great animation at the prospect he exclaimed in perplexity you fonny gal aint you care i have no home she gravely told him but your people dey goin be glad for see you i have no people either you see we lived a queer life father and i i was all he

peculiar indescribable especially noticeable was this atmosphere in the early arctic camps made up as they were of men who knew little about mining rather less about frontier ways and next to nothing about the country in which they found themselves these men had built fabulous hopes they dwelt in illusion they put faith in the thinnest of shadows now the most practical miner is not a conservative person he is erratic credulous and extravagant reasonless optimism is at once his blessing and his curse nevertheless the oldtimers of the yukon were moderate indeed as compared with the adventurous holidayseekers who swarmed in upon their tracks being none too well balanced themselves it was only natural that the exuberance of these new arrivals should prove infectious and that a sort of general autointoxication should result that is precisely what happened at dawson men lost all caution all common sense they lived in a land of rosy imaginings hardbought lessons of experience were forgotten reality disappeared fancy took wing and left fact behind expectations were capitalized and no exaggeration was too wild to challenge acceptance it became a city of frenzy it was all very fine for an ardent youth like pierce phillips it set him ablaze stirring a fever in his blood having won thus far he made the natural mistake of believing that the race was his so he wasted little time in the town but very soon took to the hills there to make his fortune and be done with it here came his awakening away from the delirium of the camp in contact with cold reality he began to learn something of the serious practical business of goldmining before he had been long on the creeks he found that it was no childs play to wrest treasure from the frozen bosom of a hostile wilderness and that no matter how rich or how plentiful the treasure mother earth guarded her secrets jealously he began to realize that the obstacles he had so blithely overcome in getting to the klondike were as nothing to those in the way of his further success of a sudden his triumphal progress slowed down and he came to a pause he began to mark time there was work in plenty to be had but like most of the newcomers he was not satisfied to take fixed wages they seemed paltry indeed compared with the drunken figures that were on every lip in the presence of the uncertain he could not content himself with a sure thing nevertheless he was soon forced to the necessity of resorting to it for through the fog of his misapprehensions beneath the obscurity of his ignorance he began to discover the true outline of things and to understand that his ideas were impractical to begin with every foot of ground in the proven districts was taken and even when he pushed out far afield he found that the whole country was plastered with locations rivers creeks and tributaries benches and hillsides had been staked for many miles in every direction blazed trees and pencil notices greeted him he found them in places where it seemed no foot but his had ever trod in dawson the gold commissioners office was besieged by daily crowds of claimants it would have taken years of work on the part of a hundred thousand men to even prospect the ground already recorded on the books back and forth phillips came and went he made trips with pack and handsled he slept out in spruce forests in prospectors tents in new cabins the sweaty green logs of which were still dripping and when he had finished he was poorer by a good many dollars and richer only in the possession of a few recorders receipts the value of which he had already begun to doubt disappointed he was but not discouraged it was all too new and exciting for that every visit to bonanza or el dorado inspired him it would have inspired a wooden man for miles those valleys were smoky from the sinking fires and their clean white carpets were spotted with piles of raw red dirt by day they echoed to blows of axes the crash of falling trees the plaint of windlasses the cries of freighters by night they became vast caldrons filled with flickering fires tremendous vats the vapors from which were illuminated by hidden furnaces one would have thought that here gold was being made not sought that this was a region of volcanic hot springs where every fissure and venthole spouted steam it was a strange a marvelous sight it stirred the imagination to know that underfoot locked in the flinty depths of the frozen gravel was wealth unmeasured and unearned rich hoards of yellow gold that yesterday were ownerless a month of stampeding dulled the keen edge of pierces enthusiasm so he took a breathingspell in which to get his bearings the yukon had closed and the human flotsam and jetsam it had borne thither was settling pierce could feel a metamorphic agency at work in the town already new habits of life were crystallizing among its citizens and beneath its whirlpool surface new forms were in the making it alarmed him to realize that as yet his own affairs were in suspense and he argued with all the hot impatience of youth that it was high time he came to rest opportunities were on every side of him but he knew not where or how to lay hold of them to his best advantage more than ever he felt himself to be the toy of circumstance more than ever he feared the fallibility of his judgment and the consequences of a mistake he was in a mood both dissatisfied and irresolute when he encountered his two trail friends tom linton and jerry quirk pierce had seen them last at linderman engaged in prosecuting a stampeders divorce he was surprised to find them reunited i never dreamed youd get through he told them when greetings had passed did you come in one boat or in two jerry grinned we sawed up that outlaw four times wed have split her end to end finally only we run out of pitch to cork her up that boat was about worn out with our bickerings tom declared she aint over half the length she was all the rest is sawdust if the nailholes in her was laid end to end theyd reach to forty mile we were the last outfit in as it was and wed of missed a landing if a feller hadnt run out on the shore ice and roped us first town i ever entered on the end of a lariat hope i dont leave it the same way guess who drug us in jerry urged ive no idea said pierce big lars anderson big lars of el dorado hes the party he was just drunk enough to risk breakin through when he found who we was well he gave us the town he made us a present of dawson and all points north together with the lands premises privileges and hereditaments appurtenant thereto i still got a kind of a hangover headache and have to take soda after my meals lars was a sheepman when we knew him tom explained jerry and i purloined him from some prominent cowgentlemen who had him all decorated up ready to hang and he hasnt forgotten it he got everybody full the night we landed and wound up by buying all the fresh eggs in camp forty dozen we had em fried hes a prince with his money he owns more property than anybody said pierce right and he gave us a lay phillips eyes opened a lay on el dorado he queried in frank amazement no hunker he says its a good creek were lookin for a pardner what kind of a partner it was linton who answered well some nice easygoing hardworking young feller jerry and i are pretty old to wind a windlass but we can work underground where its warm easygoin thats the word jerry nodded tom and me get along with each other like an order of buckwheat cakes but were set in our ways and we dont want anybody to come between us how would i do pierce inquired with a smile tom answered promptly if your name was put to a vote i know one of us that wouldnt blackball you sure cried his partner the ballotbox would look like a settin of pigeon eggs think it over and let us know were leavin tomorrow a lease on hunker creek sounded good to phillips big lars anderson had been one of the first arrivals from circle city already he was rated a millionaire for luck had smiled upon him his name was one to conjure with pierce was about to accept the offer made when jerry said who dyou spose got the lay below ours that feller mccaskey and his brother mccaskey hes an old pal of andersons does big lars know hes a thief jerry shrugged lars aint the kind that listens to scandal and we aint the kind that carries it pierce meditated briefly then he said slowly if your lay turns out good so will mccaskeys his frown deepened well if theres a law of compensation if theres such a thing as retributive justice you have a bad piece of ground but there aint any such thing tom quickly asserted anyhow it dont work in miningcamps if it did the saloons would be readingrooms and the gamblers would take in washing look at the lucky men in this camp bums most of em george carmack was a squawman and he made the strike pierce felt no fear of joe mccaskey only dislike and a desire to avoid further contact with him the prospect of a long winter in close proximity to a proven scoundrel was repugnant balanced against this was the magic of big lars name it was a problem again indecision rose to trouble him ill think it over he said finally farther down the street phillips attention was arrested by an announcement of the opening of the rialto saloon and theater miller best proprietors challenged by the name of his former employer and drawn by the sounds of merriment from within pierce entered he had seen little of laure since his arrival he had all but banished her from his thoughts in fact but he determined now to look her up the rialto was the newest and the most pretentious of dawsons amusement palaces it comprised a drinkingplace with a spacious gamblingroom adjoining in the rear of the latter was the theater a huge log annex especially designed as the home of bacchus and terpsichore the front room was crowded through an archway leading to the gamblinghall came the noise of many voices and over all the strains of an orchestra at the rear ben miller a famous sporting character was busy weighing gold dust at the massive scales near the door when pierce entered the theater too was packed here a second bar was doing a thriving business and every chair on the floor every box in the balcony overhanging three sides of it was occupied waiters were scurrying up and down the wide stairway the general hubbub was punctuated by the sound of exploding corks as the klondike spendthrifts advertised their prosperity in a hilarious contest of prodigality all dawson had turned out for the opening and pierce recognized several of the el dorado kings among them big lars anderson these newborn magnates were as thriftless as locusts and in the midst of their bacchanalian revels pierce felt very poor very obscure here was the roisterous spirit of the northland at full play it irked the young man intensely to feel that he could afford no part in it laure was not long in discovering him she sped to him with the swiftness of a swallow breathlessly she inquired where have you been so long why didnt you let me know you were back i just got in ive been everywhere he smiled down at her and she clutched the lapel of his coat then drew him out of the crowd i dropped in to see how you were getting along well what do you think of the place why it looks as if youd all get rich in a night and you have you done anything for yourself pierce shook his head in a few words he recounted his goings and his comings his efforts and his failures laure followed the recital with swift birdlike nods of understanding her dark ayes were warm with sympathy youre going at it the wrong way she asserted when he had finished you have brains make them work look at best look at miller his new partner they know better than to mine mining is a fools game play a sure thing pierce stay here in town and live like a human being heres where the money will be made do you think i want to go flying over hill and dale like a tumbleweed i havent had warm feet in a week and i weep salt tears when i see a bed but im no croesus ive got to hustle i think ive landed something finally he told of tom and jerrys offer but failed to impress his listener if you go out to hunker creek ill scarcely ever see you said she thats the first objection ive nearly died these last three weeks but there are other objections you couldnt get along with those old men why they cant get along with each other then theres joe mccaskey to think of why run into trouble ive thought of all that but big lars is on the crest of his wave he has the midas touch everything he lays his hands on turns to gold he believes in hunker ill find out if he does laure said quickly hes drinking hell tell me anything wait with a flashing smile she was off she returned with an air of triumph youll learn to listen to me she declared he says hunker is low grade thats why he lets lays on it instead of working it himself lars is a fox he said that the best there is in it is wages those were his very words would you put up with linton and quirk and the two mccaskeys for wages of course not ive something better fixed up for you without explaining she led pierce to the bar where morris best was standing best was genuinely glad to see his former employee he warmly shook pierces hand ive got em going havent i he chuckled laure broke out imperiously loosen up morris and lets all have a drink on the house you can afford it sure with a happy grin the proprietor ordered a quart bottle of wine i can afford more than that for a friend we put it over didnt we kid he linked arms with pierce and leaned upon him oy such trouble we had with these girls eh but we got em here and now i got dawson going ill be one of these rockyfeller magnets believe me pierce had not tasted liquor since his last farewell to laure three weeks of hard work in the open air had effected a chemical change in his makeup a purification of his tissues and as a result bests liquor mounted quickly to his head and warmed his blood when he had emptied his glass laure saw that it was promptly refilled so youve cut out the stampeding morris continued good youve got sense let the roughnecks do it this here front street is the best paystreak in the klondike and it wont pinch out why because every miner empties his poke into it the speaker nodded and leaned more intimately against phillips they bring in their bonanza dust and their el dorado nuggets and salt our sluices thats the system its simpler as falling down a log what come to the good news laure urged this little woman hates you dont she best winked just like she hates her right eye you got her going kid well you can start work tomorrow start work where pierce was bewildered millers looking for a goldweigher well put you out in the saloon proper saloon proper pierce shook his head in goodnatured refusal i dare say its the fault of my bringingup but i dont think theres any such thing im an outdoor person im one of the roughnecks who salts your sluiceboxes i think id better stick to the hills its mighty nice of you though and im much obliged are you going to take that other offer laure inquired when pierce hesitated she laid hold of his other arm i wont let you go she cried i want you here nonsense he protested i cant do anything for you i have nothing have i ever asked you for anything she blazed at him i can take care of myself but i want you i shant let you go better think it over best declared we need a good man yes laure clung to pierces hand dont be in a hurry anyhow stay and dance with me while we talk about it weve never had a dance together please the proprietor of the theater was in a genial mood stick around he seconded your credit is good and it wont worry me none if you never take up your tabs laure has got the right idea play em safe and sure and let the other feller do the work now well have another bottle the three of them were still standing at the bar when the curtain fell on the last vaudeville act and the audience swarmed out into the gamblingroom of the main saloon hastily noisily the chairs were removed from the dance floor then the orchestra began a spirited twostep and a raucousvoiced caller broke into loud exhortations in a twinkling the room had refilled this time with whirling couples laure raised her arms she swayed forward into pierces embrace and they melted into the throng the girl could dance she seemed to float in cadence with the music she became one with her partner and answered his every impulse never before had she seemed so utterly and so completely to embody the spirit of pleasure she was ardent alive she pulsated with enjoyment her breath was warm her dark fragrant hair brushed phillips cheek her olive face was slightly flushed and her eyes uplifted to his were glowing they voiced adoration abandon surrender the music ended with a crash a shout a storm of applause followed then the dancers swarmed to the bar bearing pierce and his companion with them laure was panting she clung fiercely jealously to phillips arm dance with me again again i never knew what it was she trembled with a vibrant ecstasy drinks were set before them the girl spurned hers but absentmindedly pocketed the pasteboard check that went with it while yet pierces throat was warm from the spirits there began the opening measures of a languorous waltz and the crowd swept into motion again there was no refusing the invitation of that music later in the evening phillips found tom and jerry his color was deeper than usual his eyes were unnaturally bright im obliged to you he told them but ive taken a job as weigher with miller best good luck and i hope you strike it rich when he had gone tom shook his head his face was clouded with regret and too with a vague expression of surprise too bad he said i didnt think he was that kind sure jerry agreed i thought hed make good chapter xx morris bests new partner was a square gambler so called people there were who sneered at this description and considered it a contradiction as absurd as a square circle or an elliptical cube an elementary knowledge of the principles of geometry and of the retail liquor business proved the nonexistence of such a thing as a straight crook so they maintained but be that as it may ben miller certainly differed from the usual run of sportingmen and he professed peculiar ideas regarding the conduct of his trade those ideas were almost puritanical in their nature proprietorship of recreation centers similar to the rialto had bred in mr miller a profound distrust of women as a sex and of his own ability successfully to deal with them in consequence he refused to tolerate their presence in his immediate vicinity that they were valuable nay necessary ingredients in the success of an enterprise such as the present one he well knew miller was above all a business man but in making his deal with best he had insisted positively that none of the latters songbirds were ever to enter the front saloon that room miller maintained was to be his own and he proposed to exercise dominion over it as for the gamblinghall that of necessity was neutral territory and be reluctantly consented to permit the girls to patronize it so long as they behaved themselves for his part he yielded all responsibility over the theater and what went on therein to best he agreed to stay out of it this division of power worked admirably and millers prohibitions were scrupulously observed he was angered therefore when one morning his rule was broken at the moment he was engaged in weighing checking up and sacking his previous nights receipts he looked up with a frown when a womans a girls voice interrupted him are you ben miller the trespasser inquired miller nodded shortly he could be colder than a frog when he chose im looking for work explained the visitor you got the wrong door he told her you want the dancehall we dont allow women in here so i understand millers frown deepened well then beat it saloons are masculine gender and im not a dancehall girl im a dealer the other broke in youre a what bens jaw dropped he stared curiously at the speaker she was pretty very pretty in a still dignified way she had a fine intelligent face and she possessed a poise a carriage that challenged attention a dealer what the deuce can you deal he managed to ask anything the bank the wheel the tub the cage disapproval returned to the mans countenance there was an admonitory sternness to his voice when he said it aint very nice to see a kid like you in a place like this i dont know where you learned that wise talk but cut it out go home and behave yourself sister if youre broke ill stake you soll anybody for that matter his visitor stirred impatiently lets stick to business i dont want a loan im a dealer and i want work morris best bustled out of the adjoining room at the moment and noting a feminine figure in this forbidden territory he exclaimed hey miss theaters in the rear miller summoned him with a backward jerk of his head morris this kids looking for a job as dealer said he dealer best halted abruptly thats funny what is funny about it demanded the girl my father was a gambler im rouletta kirby are you sam kirbys girl miller inquired when rouletta nodded he removed his hat then he extended his hand shake said he now ive got you youve had a hard time havent you we heard about sam and we thought you was dead step in here and set down he motioned to the tiny little office which was curtained off from general view rouletta declined with a smile i really want work as a dealer thats the only thing i can do well i came here first because you have a good reputation kirbys kid dont have to deal nothing shes good for any kind of a stake on his name dad would be glad to hear that he was a great man he ran straight roulettas eyes had become misty at millers indirect tribute to her father nevertheless she summoned a smile and went on he never borrowed and neither will i if you cant put me to work ill try somewhere else how did you get down from white horse miller inquired curiously poleon doret brought me i know doret hes aces can you really deal best broke in come ill prove that i can rouletta started for the gamblingroom and the two men followed best spoke to his partner in a low voice say ben if she can make a halfway bluff at it shell be a big card think of the play shell get but miller was dubious shes nothing but a kid he protested a dealer has got to have experience and besides she aint the kind that belongs in a dump somebodyd get fresh and id have to bust him there was little activity around the tables al this hour of the day the occupants of the gamblingroom were for the most part house employees who were waiting for business to begin the majority of these employees were gathered about the faro layout where the cards were being run in a perfunctory manner to an accompaniment of gossip and reminiscence the sight of ben miller in company with a girl evoked some wonder this wonder increased to amazement when miller ordered the dealer out of his seat it became openmouthed when the girl took his place then broke a new deck of cards deftly shuffled them and slipped them into the box at this procedure the languid lookout who had been comfortably resting upon his spine uncurled his legs hoisted himself into an attitude of attention and leaned forward with a startled expression upon his face the gamblers crowded closer exchanging expectant glances ben miller and morris best helped themselves to chips and began to play these were queer doings the casehardened onlookers prepared to enjoy a mildly entertaining treat soon grins began to appear the men murmured they nudged one another they slapped one another on the back for what they saw astonished and delighted them the girl dealt swiftly surely she handled the paraphernalia of the farotable with the careless familiarity of long practice but stranger still she maintained a poise a certain reserve and feminine dignity which were totally incongruous when during a pause she absentmindedly shuffled a stack of chips the mocha kid permitted his feelings to get the better of him hang me for a horsethief he snickered will you look at that now the mocha kid was a ribald character profanity was a part of him and blasphemy embellished his casual speech the mildness of his exclamation showed that he was deeply moved he continued in the same admiring undertone i seen a dame once that could deal a bank but she couldnt pay and take this gal can size up a stack with her eyes shut nothing could have more deeply intrigued the attention of these men than the sight of a modest quiet wellbehaved young woman exhibiting all the technic of a finished farodealer it was contrary to their experience to their ideas of fitness mastery of the gamingtable requires years of practice to acquire and not one of these professionals but was as proud of his own dexterity as a fine pianist to behold a mere girl possessed of all the knacks and tricks and mannerisms of the craft excited their keenest risibilities in order the more thoroughly to test her skill several of them bought stacks of chips and began to play in earnest they played their bets open they coppered they split they strung them and at the finish they called the turn rouletta paid and took she measured stacks of counters with unerring facility she overlooked no bets she ran out the cards upset the box and began to reshuffle the cards well im a son of a gun declared the lookout he doubled up in breathless merriment he rocked back and forth in his chair he stamped his feet a shout of laughter issued from the others ben miller closed the cases with a crash youll do he announced if theres anything you dont know i cant teach it to you then to the bystanders he said this is sam kirbys girl she wants work and if i thought you coyotes knew how to treat a lady id put her on say the mocha kid scowled darkly at his employer what kinda guys do you take us for what makes you think we dont know he was interrupted by an angry outburst by a chorus of resentful protests the indignant tone of which seemed to satisfy miller the latter shrugged his shoulders and rose rouletta stirred as if to follow suit but eager hands stayed her eager voices urged her to remain run em again miss begged tommy ryan the roulettedealer mr ryan was a palefaced person whose addiction to harmful drugs was notorious his extreme pallor and his nervous lack of repose had gained for him the title of snowbird tommys hollow eyes were glowing his colorless lips were parted in an engaging smile please run em once more i aint had so much fun since my wife eloped with a drummer in el paso rouletta agreed readily enough and her admiring audience crowded closer their interest was magnetic their absorption and their amusement were communicated to some newcomers who had dropped in before the girl had dealt half the cards these bonafide customers had found seats around the table and were likewise playing they too enjoyed the novel experience and the vehemence with which they insisted that rouletta retain her office proved beyond question the success of millers experiment it was not yet midday nevertheless the news spread quickly that a girl was dealing bank at the rialto and soon other curious visitors arrived among them was big lars anderson lars did not often gamble but when he did he made a considerable business of it and the sporting fraternity took him seriously anything in the nature of an innovation tickled the big magnate immensely and to evidence his interest in this one he purchased a stack of chips ere long he had lost several hundred dollars he sent for miller finally and made a goodnatured complaint that the game was too slow for him shall i raise the limit the proprietor asked of rouletta the girl shrugged indifferently whereupon the mocha kid and the snowbird embraced each other and exchanged admiring profanities in smothered tones big lars stubbornly backed his luck but the bank continued to win and meanwhile new arrivals dropped in two three hours the play went on by which time all dawson knew that a big game was running and that a girl was in the dealers chair few of the visitors got close enough to verify the intelligence without receiving a sotto voce warning that rough talk was taboo millers ungodly clan saw to that and on the whole the warning was respected only once was it disregarded then a heavy loser breathed a thoughtless oath disapproval was marked punishment was condign the lookout leisurely descended from his eyrie and floored the offender with a blow from his fist when the resulting disturbance had quieted down the defender of decorum announced with inflexible firmness but with a total lack of heat gents this is a sort of gospel game and its got a certain tone which were going to maintain the limit is off except on cussing but its mighty low on that them of you that are indisposed to swallow your cud of regrets will have it knocked out of you good shouted big lars he pounded the table with the flat of his huge palm by jingo ill make that unanimous if anybody has to cuss let him take ten paces to the rear and cuss the stove it was well along in the afternoon when rouletta kirby pushed back her chair and rose she was very white she passed an uncertain hand over her face then groped blindly at the table for support at these signs of distress a chorus of alarm arose its nothing she smiled im just hungry ive been pretty ill and im not very strong yet lars anderson was dumfounded appalled hungry my god to his companions he shouted dyou hear that boys shes starved out the boys had heard already they had begun to scramble some ran for the lunchcounter in the adjoining room others dashed out to the nearest restaurants the snowbird so far forgot his responsibilities as to abandon the roulettewheel and leave its bankroll unguarded while he scurried to the bar and demanded a drink a tray of assorted drinks fit for a fainting lady he came flying back yelling gangway and scattering the crowd ahead of him he offered brandy whisky creme de menthe hootch absinthe and bitters to rouletta all of which she declined he was still arguing the medicinal value of these beverages when the swinging doors from the street burst open and in rushed the mocha kid a pie in each hand other eatables and drinkables appeared as by magic the farotable was soon spread with the fruits of a halfdozen hasty and hysterical forays rouletta stared at the apprehensive faces about her and what she read therein caused her lips to quiver and her voice to break when she tried to express her thanks gosh dont cry begged the mocha kid with a counterfeit assumption of juvenile hilarity he exclaimed oh look at the pretty pies they got little christmastrees on their lids aint they umyum rich and juicy i stuck up the baker and stole his whole stock but i slipped and spilled em f o b flat on the boardwalk rouletta laughed lets end the game and all have lunch she suggested and her invitation was accepted big lars spoke up with his mouth full of pastry we dont allow anybody to go hungry in this camp said he were all your friends miss and if theres anything you want and cant afford charge it to me rouletta stopped to speak with miller on her way out do i get the position she inquired say you know you get it he told her you go on at eight and come off at midnight what is the pay i pay my dealers an ounce a shift but you can write your own ticket how is two ounces ill take regular wages rouletta smiled miller nodded his approval of this attitude then his face clouded ive been wondering how youre going to protect your bankroll things wont always be like they were today i spose ill have to put a man on ill protect it the girl asserted agnes and i will do that the proprietor was interested agnes holy moses is there two of you have you got a sister whos agnes shes an old friend of my fathers miller shrugged bring her along if you want to he said doubtfully but those old dames are troublemakers yes agnes is all of that but roulettas eyes were dancing she minds her own business and shell guard the bankroll lucky broad and kid bridges had found employment at the rialto soon after it opened as they passed the goldscales on their way to work pierce phillips halted them ive some good news for you lucky he announced youve lost your job who me broad was incredulous miller has hired a new farodealer and you dont go on until midnight briefly pierce retold the story that had come to his ears when he reported for duty that evening broad and bridges listened without comment but they exchanged glances they put their heads together and began a lowpitched conversation they were still murmuring when rouletta appeared in company with poleon doret poleons face lighted at sight of the two gamblers he strode forward crying hallo im glad for see you some more to the girl he said you member dese feller dey hep save you in de rapids rouletta impulsively extended her hands of course could i forget she saw pierce phillips behind the scales and nodded to him why were all here arent we im so glad everywhere i go i meet friends lucky and the kid inquired respectfully regarding her health her journey down the river her reasons for being here then when they had drawn her aside the former interrupted her flow of explanations to say listen letty we got just one real question to ask and wed like a straight answer have you got any kick against this frenchman any kick of any kind queried bridges were your friends you can tip us off the sudden change in the tone of their voices caused the girl to start and to stare at them she saw that both men were in sober earnest the reason behind their solicitude she apprehended she laid a hand upon the arm of each her eyes were very bright when she began poleon told me how you came to his tent that morning after you know and he told me what you said well it wasnt necessary hes the dearest thing that ever lived whyd he put you to work in a place like this bridges roughly demanded he didnt he begged me not to try it he offered me all he has his last dollar he swiftly earnestly rouletta told how the big woodsman had cared for her how tenderly faithfully he had nursed her back to health and strength how he had cast all his plans to the winds in order to bring her down the river hes the best the kindest the most generous man i ever knew she concluded his heart is clean and his soul is full of music sta bueno cried lucky broad in genuine relief we had a hunch he was right but you cant always trust those asiatic races ben miller appeared and warmly greeted his new employee rested up eh well its going to be a big night wheres agnes the other one has she got cold feet no just a cold nose here she is from a small bag on her arm rouletta drew sam kirbys sixshooter agnes was my fathers friend nobody ever ran out on her miller blinked he uttered a feeble exclamation then he burst into a mighty laugh he was still shaking his face was purple there were tears of mirth in his eyes when he followed broad bridges and rouletta into the gamblingroom there were several players at the farotable when the girl took her place removing her gloves she stowed them away in her bag from this bag she extracted the heavy colts revolver then opened the drawer before her and laid it inside she breathed upon her fingers rubbing the circulation back into them and began to shuffle the cards slipping them into the box the girl settled herself in her chair and looked up into a circle of grinning faces before her level gaze eyes that had been focused queerly upon her fell the casekeepers lips were twitching but he bit down upon them gravely he said well boys lets go chapter xxi in taking charge of a sick girl a helpless hopeless stranger poleon doret had assumed a responsibility far greater than he had anticipated and that responsibility had grown heavier every day having at last successfully discharged it he breathed freely his first relaxation in a long time he rejoiced in the consciousness of a difficult duty well performed so far as he could see there was nothing at all extraordinary nothing in the least improper about roulettas engagement at the rialto any suggestion of impropriety in fact would have greatly surprised him for saloons and gamblinghalls filled a recognized place in the everyday social life of the northland customs were free standards were liberal in the early days no one poleon least of all would have dreamed that they were destined to change in a night had he been told that soon the country would be dry and gamblinggames and dancehalls be prohibited by law he would have considered the idea too utterly fantastic for belief the mere contemplation of such a dreary prospect would have proved extremely dispiriting he and the other pioneers of his kind would have been tempted immediately to pack up and move on to some freer locality where a man could retain his personal liberty and pursue his happiness in a manner as noisy as intemperate and as undignified as suited his individual taste in justice to the saloons be it said they were more than mere drinkingplaces they were the pivots about which revolved the business life of the north country they were meetingplaces social centers marts of trade looked upon as evidences of enterprise and general prosperity they were considered desirable assets to any community everybody patronized them the men who ran them were on the whole as reputable as the men engaged in other pursuits no particular stigma attached either to the places themselves or to the people connected with them these goldcamps had a very simple code work of any sort was praiseworthy and honorable idleness or unproductivity was reprehensible mining storekeeping liquorselling gambling steamboating all were occupations which men followed as necessity or convenience prompted a citizen gained repute by the manner in which he deported himself not by reason of the nature of the commodity in which he dealt such at least was the attitude of the oldtimers roulettas instant success the fact that she had fallen among friends delighted a woodsman like poleon and now that he was his own master again he straightway surrendered himself to the selfish enjoyment of his surroundings his nature and his training prescribed the limits of those pleasures they were quite as simple as his everyday habits of life he danced he gambled and he drank tonight he did all three in the reverse order to him dawson was a dream city its lights were dazzling its music heavenly its games of chance enticing and its liquor was the finest the smoothest the most inspiriting his tongue had ever tested old friends were everywhere and new ones too for that matter among them were alluring women who smiled and sparkled each place poleon entered was the home of carnival by midnight he was gloriously drunk ere daylight came he had sung himself hoarse he had danced two holes in his moccasins and had conducted three fistfights to a satisfactory if not a successful conclusion it had been a celebration that was to live in his memory he strode blindly off to bed shouting his complete satisfaction with himself and with the world retired without undressing and then sang himself to sleep regardless of the protests of the other lodgers say that frenchman is a riot kid bridges declared while he and lucky broad were at breakfast hes old general roughhouser and he set an altogether new mark in disorderly conduct last night letty most cried about it yeah those yokels are all alike one drink and they declare a dividend lucky was only mildly concerned i spose the vultures picked him clean nothin like it bridges shook his head he gnawed em naked then done a wardance with their feathers in his hat he left em bruised an bleedin for a time the two friends ate in silence then broad mused aloud letty most cried eh say i wonder what she really thinks of him i dont know miller told me she was all broke up and i was goin to take her home and see if i could fathom her true feelins but phillips beat me to it phillips hell have to throw out the lifeline if laure gets onto that shell take to letty just like a lone timberwolf looks like shed been kiddin us dont it she calls him her brother and he says shes his masseur you heard him didnt you there was another pause whats a masseur anyhow a masseur said mr broad is one of those women in a barbershop that fixes your fingernails yes i heard him and im here to say that i didnt like the sound of it i dont yet he may mean all right but them foreigners have got queer ideas about their women lettys a swell kid and shes got a swell job whats more shes got a wise gang riding herd on her its just like she was in a church no danger no annoyance nothing if doret figures to start a barbershop with her for his masseur why well have to lay him low with one of his own razors mr bridges nodded his complete approval of this suggestion righto ill bust a mirror with him myself them barbershops is no place for good girls broad and bridges pondered the matter during the day and that evening they confided their apprehensions to their fellowworkers the other rialto employees agreed that things did not look right and after a consultation it was decided to keep a watch upon the girl this was done prompted by their pride in her and a genuinely unselfish interest in her future the boys made guarded attempts to discover the true state of her feelings for the french canadian but they learned little every indirect inquiry was met with a tribute to poleons character so frank so extravagant as to completely baffle them some of the investigators declared that rouletta was madly in love with him others were equally positive that this extreme frankness in itself proved that she was not all agreed however that poleon was not in love with her he was altogether too enthusiastic over her growing popularity for a lover had the gamblers been thoroughly assured of her desires in the matter doubtless they would have made some desperate effort to marry poleon to her regardless of his wishesthey were men who believed in direct action but under the circumstances they could only watch and wait until the uncertainty was cleared up meanwhile as poleon continued his celebration rouletta grew more and more miserable at last he sobered up sufficiently to realize he was hurting her he was frankly puzzled at this he met her reproaches with careless goodnature brushing aside the remonstrances of lucky broad and his fellows by declaring that he was having the time of his life and arguing that he injured nobody in the end the girl prevailed upon him to stop drinking and then bound him to further sobriety by means of a sacred pledge when perhaps a week later he disappeared into the hills rouletta and her corps of selfappointed guardians breathed easier but the boys did not relax their watchfulness rouletta was their charge and they took good care of her none of the rialtos patrons for instance was permitted to follow up his first acquaintance with the lady dealer some member of the clan was always on hand to frown down such an attempt broad or bridges usually brought her to work and took her home the snowbird and the mocha kid made it a practice to take her to supper and when she received invitations from other sources one or the other of them firmly declined in her name and treated the wouldbe host with such malevolent suspicion that the invitation was never repeated far from taking offense at this espionage rouletta rather enjoyed it she grew to like these ruffians and that liking became mutual soon most of them took her into their confidence with a completeness that threatened to embarrass her as for instance when they discussed in her hearing incidents in their colorful lives that the mounted police would have given much to know the mocha kid in particular was addicted to reminiscence of an incriminating sort and he totally ignored roulettas protests at sharing the secrets of his guilty past as for the snowbird he was fond of telling her fairystories they were queer fairystories all beginning in the same way once upon a time there was a beautiful princess and her name was rouletta all the familiar characters figured in these narratives the wicked witch the cruel king the handsome prince there were other characters too such as the wise guy the farmers son the boob detective the tough mary ann and the stonyhearted jailer the snowbird possessed a fertile fancy but it ran in crooked channels although he launched his stories according to grimm he sailed them through seas of crime of violence and of bloodshed too realistic to be the product of pure imagination the adventures of the beautiful princess rouletta were bloodcurdling in the extreme and the doings of her criminal associates were unmistakably autobiographic naturally rouletta never felt free to repeat these stories but it was not long before she began to look forward with avid interest to her nightly entertainment inasmuch as pierce phillips went off shift at the same time as did rouletta they met frequently and more than once he acted as her escort he offered such a marked contrast to the other employees of the rialto his treatment of her was at such total variance with theirs that he interested her in an altogether different way his was an engaging personality but just why she grew so fond of him she could not tell he was neither especially witty and accomplished nor did he lay himself out to be unusually agreeable he was quiet and reserved nevertheless he had the knack of making friends quickly rouletta had known men like broad and bridges and the mocha kid all her life but pierce was of a type quite new and diverting she speculated considerably regarding him their acquaintance while interesting had not progressed much beyond that point when rouletta experienced a disagreeable shock she had strolled into the theater one evening and was watching the performance when laure accosted her as rouletta had not come into close contact with any of the dancehall crowd she was surprised at the tone this girl assumed hello looking for new conquests laure began miss kirby shook her head in vague denial but the speaker eyed her with open hostility and there was an unmistakable sneer behind her next words whats the matter have you trimmed all the leading citizens ive finished my work if thats what you mean now youre going to try your hand at boxrustling eh roulettas expression altered she regarded her inquisitor more intently you know im not said she what are you driving at well why dont you are you too good yes the visitor spoke coldly she turned away but laure stepped close and cried in a low angry voice oh no youre not youve fooled the men but you cant fool us girls ive got your number i know your game my game then why dont you take a shift in the gamblingroom why work in here you understand me the other persisted too good for the dancehall eh too good to associate with us girls too good to live like us you stop at the courteau house the respectable hotel bah miller fell for you but youd better let well enough alone thats precisely what i do if there were a better hotel than the courteau house id stop there but there isnt now then suppose you tell me what really ails you laures dusky eyes were blazing her voice was hoarse when she answered all right ill tell you i want you to mind your own business yes and im going to see that you do you cant go home alone can you afraid of the dark i suppose or afraid some man will speak to you my goodness the airs you put on you sam kirbys girl the daughter of a gambler a leave my father out of this there was something of sam kirbys force in this sharp command something of his cold forbidding anger in his daughters face hes my religion so youd better lay off of him speak out where did i tread on your toes well you tread on them every time you stop at the goldscales if you want to know i have a religion too and its locked up in the cashiers cage there was a pause the girls appraised each other with mutual dislike you mean mr phillips i do see that you call him mister and learn to walk home alone dont order me i cant take orders laure was beside herself at this defiance she grew blind with rage so much so that she did not notice phillips himself he had approached within hearing distance youve got the boss hes crazy about you but pierce is mine whats that it was phillips who spoke what are you saying about me both girls started laure turned upon him furiously im serving notice on this farodealer thats all but it goes for you too phillips eyes opened his face whitened with an emotion neither girl had before seen to rouletta he said quietly the other boys are busy so i came to take you home laure cried wildly hysterically dont do it i warn you are you ready to go all ready rouletta agreed together they left the theater nothing was said as the two trod the snowbanked streets not until they halted at the door of the courteau house did rouletta speak then she said i wouldnt have let you do this only i have a temper so have i pierce said shortly its humiliating to own up i was wrong i have no right to hurt that girls feelings right he laughed angrily she had no right to make a scene why not shes fighting for her own isnt she shes honest about it at least noting pierces expression of surprise rouletta went on you expect me to be shocked but im not for ive known the truth in a general way you think im going to preach well im not going to do that either ive lived a queer life ive seen women like laure in fact i was raised among them and nothing they do surprises me very much but ive learned a good many lessons around saloons and gamblingplaces one is this never cheat father taught me that he gave everybody a square deal including himself its a good thing to think about a square deal all around even to yourself that sounds like an allopathic sermon of some sort said pierce but i cant see just how it applies to me however ill think it over youre a brick miss kirby and im sorry if you had an unpleasant moment he took roulettas hand and held it while he stared at her with a frank contemplative gaze youre an unusual person and youre about the nicest girl ive met i want you to like me as he walked back downtown pierce pondered roulettas words a square deal all around even to yourself they were a trifle puzzling whom had he cheated surely not laure from the very first he had protested his lack of serious interest in her and their subsequent relations were entirely the result of her unceasing efforts to appropriate him to herself he had resisted she had persisted nor could he see that he had cheated in other words injured himself this was a liberal country its code was free and it took little account of a mans private conduct nobody seriously blamed him for his affair with laure he had lost no standing by reason of it it was only a part of the big adventure a passing phase of his development an experience such as came to every man since it had left no mark upon him and had not seriously affected laure the score was even he dismissed roulettas words as of little consequence in order however to prevent any further unpleasant scenes he determined to put laure in her place once for all rouletta went to her room vaguely disturbed at her own emotions she could still feel the touch of phillips hand she could still feel his gaze fixed earnestly meditatively upon hers and she was amazed to discover the importance he had assumed in her thoughts importance that was the word he was a very real a very interesting person and there was some inexplicable attraction about him that offset his faults and his failings however grave for one thing he was not an automaton like the other men he was a living breathing problem and he absorbed roulettas attention she was sitting on the edge of her bed staring at the wall when the countess courteau knocked at her door and entered the women had become good friends frequently the elder one stopped to gossip the countess flung herself into a chair rolled and lit a cigarette then said well i see you and agnes saved the bankroll again rouletta nodded agnes is an awful bluff i never load her but of course nobody knows that youre a queer youngster ive never known a girl quite like you everybody is talking about you indeed not the nice people nice people the countess lifted her brows you mean those at the barracks and up on the hill yes theyre talking about you too i can imagine what they say rouletta drew her brows together in a frown no doubt they think im just like the dancehall girls ive seen a few of them at a distance they avoid me as if i had measles naturally do you care certainly i care id like to be one of them not a a specimen wouldnt you umm perhaps i dare say i could be one of them if it werent for courteau people forget things quickly in a new country why did you take him back im sure you dont care for him not in the least hes the sort of man you cant love or hate hes a ninespot just the same he protects me and i cant help being sorry for him rouletta smiled fancy you needing protection and him giving you dont understand he protects me from myself i mean it im as unruly as the average woman and i make a fool of myself on the slightest provocation henri is a loafer a goodfornothing to be sure but nevertheless i have resumed his support it was easier than refusing it i help broken miners i feed hungry dogs why shouldnt i clothe and feed a helpless husband its a perfectly feminine illogical thing to do other people dont share your opinion of him he can be very agreeable very charming when he tries of course thats his stock in trade thats his excuse for being women are crazy about him as you probably know but give me a man the men like there was a pause so you dont enjoy the thing youre doing i hate it i hate the whole atmosphere the whole underworld itsunhealthy stifling what has happened slowly hesitatingly rouletta told of her encounter with laure the countess listened silently it was an unpleasant shock the girl concluded for it brought me back to my surroundings it lifted the curtain and showed me whats really going on its a pity pierce phillips is entangled with that creature for hes a nice chap and hes got it in him to do big things but it wasnt much use my trying to tell him that he was cheating himself i dont think he understood i feel almost well motherly toward him hilda nodded gravely of course you do he has it has it what the call the appeal the same thing that lets henri get by oh hes nothing like the count rouletta protested quickly the elder woman did not argue the point pierce has more character than henri but a man can lose even that in a gamblinghouse i was very fond of him fonder than i knew yes its a fact im jealous of laure jealous of you jealous of me youre joking of course dont take me seriously nevertheless i mean it the countess smiled queerly and rose to her feet its improper for a married woman to joke about such things even a woman married to a nogood count isnt it and its foolish too well im going to do something even more foolish im going to give you some advice cut out that young man he hasnt found himself yet hes running wild hes light in ballast and hes rudderless if he straightens out hell make some woman very happy otherwise hell create a good deal of havoc believe me i know what im talking about for i collided with henri and look at the result chapter xxii pierce phillips possessed the average young americans capacities for good or evil had he fallen among healthy surroundings upon his arrival at dawson in all probability he would have experienced a healthy growth but blown by the winds of chance he took root where he dropped in the low grounds since he possessed the youthful power of quick and vigorous adaptation he assumed a color to match his environment of necessity this alteration was gradual nevertheless it was real without knowing it he suffered a steady deterioration of moral fiber and a progressive change in ideals his new life was easy hours at the rialto were short and the pay was high inasmuch as the place was a playground where cares were forgotten there was a wholly artificial atmosphere of gaiety and improvidence about it when patrons won at the gamblinggames they promptly squandered their winnings at the bar and in the theater when they lost they cheerfully ignored their illfortune even the gamblers themselves shared this recklessness this prodigality they made much money nevertheless they were usually broke most of them drank quite as freely as did the customers this was not a temperance country although alcohol was not considered a food it was none the less regarded as a prime essential of comfort and wellbeing it was inevitable therefore that pierce phillips a youth in his growing age should adopt a good deal the same habits as well as the same spirit and outlook as the people with whom he came in daily contact vice is erroneously considered hideous it is supposed to have a visage so repulsive that the simplest stranger will shudder at sight of it and turn of his own accord to more attractive virtue if that were only true more often than not it is the former that wears a smile and masquerades in agreeable forms while the latter repels this is true of the complex life of the city where a man has landmarks and guideposts of conduct to go by and it is equally true of the less complicated life of the far frontier where he must blaze his own trail along with the strength and vigor and independence derived from the great outdoors there comes also a freedom of individual conduct an impatience at irksome restraints that frequently offsets any benefits that accrue from such an environment so it was in pierces case he realized subconsciously that he was changing had changed on the whole he was glad of it it filled him with contemptuous amusement for instance to look back upon his old puritanical ideas they seemed now very narrow very immature very impractical and he was gratified at his broader vision the most significant alteration however entirely escaped his notice that alteration was one of outlook rather than of inlook bit by bit he had come to regard the general crowd the miners merchants townspeople as outsiders and him self as an insider one of the wise clever easeloving class which subsisted without toil and for whom a freer code of morals existed those outsiders were stupid hardworking they were somehow inferior he and his kind were of a higher more advanced order of intelligence moreover they were bound together by the ties of a common purpose and understanding and therefore enjoyed privileges denied their less efficient brethren if jackals were able to reason doubtless they would justify their existence and prove their superiority to the common herd by some such fatuous argument pierces complacency received its first jolt when he discovered that he had lost caste in the eyes of the better sort of people people such as he had been accustomed to associate with at home this discovery came as the result of a chance meeting with a stranger and but for it he probably would have remained unaware of the truth for his newly made friends had treated him with consideration and nothing had occurred to disturb his complacency he had acquired a speaking acquaintance with many of the best citizens including the mounted police and even the higher dominion officials all of whom came to the rialto these men professed a genuine liking for him and inasmuch as his time was pretty full and there was plenty of amusement close at hand he had never stopped to think that the side of dawson life which he saw was merely the under side that a real social community was forming with real homes on the back streets where already women of the better sort were living oblivious of these facts it never occurred to pierce to wonder why these men did not ask him to their cabins or why he did not meet their families he had long since become a nighthawk mainly through a growing fondness for gambling and he had arrived at the point where daylight impressed him as an artificial and unsatisfactory method of illumination recently too he had been drinking more than was good for him and he awoke finally to the unwelcome realization that he was badly in need of fresh air and outdoor exercise after numerous halfhearted attempts he arose one day about noon then having eaten a tasteless breakfast and strengthened his languid determination by a stiff glass of hootch he strolled out of town taking he first random trail that offered itself it was a wood trail leading nowhere in particular a fact which precisely suited his resentful mood his blood moved sluggishly he was short of breath the cold was bitter before long he decided that walking was a profitless and stultifying occupation a pastime for idiots and solitaireplayers nevertheless he continued in the hope of deriving some benefit however indirect or remote it was a still afternoon a silvery brightness beyond the mountain crests far to the southward showed where the low winter sun was sweeping past on its flat arc the sky to the north was empty colorless there had been no wind for some time and now the firs sagged beneath burdens of white even the bare birch branches carried evenly balanced inchdeep layers of snow underfoot the earth was smothered in a feathery shroud as light as clean as the purest swansdown and into it pierces moccasins sank to the ankles he walked as silently as a ghost through this queer breathless hush the sounds of chopping of distant voices of an occasional dog barking followed him as he went deeper into the woods time was when merely to be out in the forest on such a day would have pleased him but gone entirely was that pleasure and in its place there came now an irritation at the physical discomfort it entailed he soon began to perspire freely too freely nevertheless there was no glow to his body he could think only of easychairs and warm stoves he wondered what ailed him nothing could be more abhorrent than this he told himself health was a valuable thing no doubt and he agreed that no price was too high to pay for it no price perhaps except dull uninteresting exercise of this sort he was upon the point of turning back when the trail suddenly broke out into a natural clearing and he saw something which challenged his attention to the left of the path rose a steep bank and beyond that the bare sloping mountainside in the shelter of the bank the snow had drifted deep but oddly enough its placid surface was churned up as if from an explosion or some desperate conflict that had been lately waged it had been tossed up and thrown down what caused him to stare was the fact that no footprints were discernible nothing except queer wavering parallel streaks that led downward from the snowy turmoil to the level ground below they resembled the tracks of some oddly fashioned sled pierce halted and with bent head was studying the phenomenon when close above him he heard the rush of a swiftly approaching body he looked up just in time to behold an apparition utterly unexpected utterly astounding swooping directly down upon him with incredible velocity was what seemed at first glance to be a birdwoman a valkyr out of the pages of norse mythology wingless she was yet she came like the wind and at the very instant pierce raised his eyes she took the air almost over his head quite as if he had startled her into an upward flight upon her feet was a pair of long norwegian skees and upon these she had scudded down the mountainside where the bank dropped away she had leaped and now like a meteor she soared into space this amazing creature was clad in a blueandwhite toboggan suit short skirt sweater jacket and knitted cap as she hung outlined against the wintry sky pierce caught a snapshot glimpse of a fair flushed youthful face set in a ludicrous expression of openmouthed dismay at sight of him he heard too a highpitched cry half of warning half of fright the next instant there was a mighty upheaval of snow an explosion of feathery white as the human projectile landed then a blur of blueandwhite stripes as it went rolling down the declivity good lord pierce cried aghast then he sped after the apparition only for the evidence of that undignified tumble he would have doubted the reality of this flying venus and considered her some creature of his imagination there she lay however a thing of flesh and blood bruised broken helpless apprehensively he pictured himself staggering back to town with her in his arms he halted speechless when the girl sat up shook the snow out of her hair gingerly felt one elbow then the other and finally burst into a peal of ringing laughter the face she lifted to his now that it wore a normal expression was wholly charming it was in fact about the freshest the cleanest the healthiest and the frankest countenance he had ever looked into glory be he stammered i thought you were completely spoiled im badly twisted the girl managed to gasp but i guess im all here oh what a bump you scared me i never dreamed i didnt hear a thing until well i looked up and there you were the sky was full of you gee i thought id lost my mind are you quite sure youre all right oh ill be black and blue again but im used to that thats the funniest one ive had the very funniest why dont you laugh im too rattled i suppose im not accustomed to flying girls never had them rain down on me out of the heavens the girls face grew sober youre entirely to blame she cried angrily i was getting it beautifully until you showed up you popped right out of the ground what are you doing in the queens park anyhow youve no business at the royal sports i didnt mean to trespass i think ill call the guards call the court physician and make sure pshaw im not hurt ignoring his extended hand she scrambled to her feet and brushed herself again evidently the queenly anger was shortlived for she was beaming again and in a tone that was boyishly intimate she explained id made three dandy jumps and was going higher each time but the sight of you upset me think of being upset by a perfectly strange man shows lack of social training doesnt it its a wonder i didnt break a skee pierce glanced apprehensively at the bluff overhead hadnt we better move out of the way he inquired if the royal family comes dropping in well be ironed out like a couple of handkerchiefs i dont want to feel the divine right of the king or his left either there isnt any kingnor any royal family im just the queen of pretend youre skeejumping alone is that what you mean the girl nodded isnt that a dangerous way to amuse self i thought skees were tricky have you ever ridden them the girl inquired quickly never you dont know what fun is here the speaker stooped and detached her feet from the straps just have a go at it pierce protested but she insisted in a businesslike way theyre long ones too long for me theyll just suit you really i dont care to oh yes you do you must youll be sorry pierce solemnly warned her when my feet glance off and leave me sticking up in the snow to starve youllsay i can think of a lot of things i want to do but i dont seem to find skeejumping on the list you neednt jump right away determination was in the girls tone there was a dancing light of malice in her eyes you can practise a bit remember you laughed at me nothing of the sort i was amazed not amused i thought id flushed a very magnificent pheasant with blueandwhite stripes and i was afraid it was going to fly away before i got a good look at it now then he slowly finished buckling the runners to his feet and looked up interrogatively what are your majestys orders walk around slide down the hill what on the girl smothered a laugh and waved him away she looked on while he set off with more or less caution when he managed to maintain an upright position despite the antics of his skees her face expressed genuine disappointment its not so hard as i thought it would be he soon announced triumphantly a little awkward at first but he cast an eye up at the bank you never know what you can do until you try youve been skeeing before she accused him reproachfully never then you pick it up wonderfully try a jump her mocking invitation spurred him to make the effort so he removed the skees and waded a short distance up the hill when he had secured his feet in position for a second time he called down im going to let go and trust to providence look out the same to you she cried youre wonderful but men can do anything cant they there was nothing graceful nothing of the free abandon of the practised skeerunner in pierces attitude he crouched apelike with his muscles set to maintain an equilibrium and this much he succeeded in doing until he reached the jumping off place at that point however gravity which he had successfully defied wreaked vengeance upon him it suddenly reached forth and made him its vindictive toy he pawed he fought he appeared to be climbing an invisible rope with a mighty flop he landed flat upon his back uttering a loud and dismayed grunt as his breath left him when he had dug himself out he found that the girl too was breathless she was rocking in silent ecstasy she hugged herself gleefully and there were tears in her eyes im so sorry she exclaimed in a thin small voice did youtrip over something the young man grinned not at all i was afraid of a sprained ankle so i hit on my head we meet on common ground as it were once again he climbed the grade once again he skidded downward once again he went sprawling nor were his subsequent attempts more successful after a final ignominious failure he sat where he had fetched up and ruefully took stock of the damage he had done himself seriously he announced i was mistaken women are entitled to vote theyre entitled to anything ive learned something else too mr newtons interesting little theory is all wrong falling bodies travel sixteen miles not sixteen feet the first second the girl demanded her skees and without rising pierce surrendered them then he looked on admiringly while she attached them to her feet and went zigzagging up the hill to a point much higher than the one from which he had dared to venture she made a very pretty picture he acknowledged for she was vivid with youth and color she was lithe and strong and confident too she was vibrant with the healthy vigor of the outofdoors she descended with a terrific rush and this time she took the air with grace and certainty she cleared a very respectable distance and ricocheted safely down the landingslope pierce applauded her with enthusiasm beautiful my sincere congratulations o bounding fawn thats the best ive done she crowed you put me on my mettle now you try it again pierce did try again he tried manfully but with a humiliating lack of success he was puffing and blowing his face was wet with perspiration he had lost all count of time when his companion finally announced it was time for her to be going youre not very fit are you said she pierce colored uncomfortably not very he confessed he was relieved when she did not ask the reason for his lack of fitness just why he experienced such relief he hardly knew but suddenly he felt no great pride in himself nor in the life that had brought him to such a state of flabbiness nor did he care to have this girl know who or what he was plainly she was one of those nice people at whom laure and the other denizens of the rialto were wont to sneer with open contempt probably that was why he had never chanced to meet her he felt cheated because they had not met for she was the sort of girl he had known at home the sort who believed in things and in whom he believed despite all his recently acquired wisdom in this short hour she had made him over into a boy again and somehow or other the experience was agreeable never had he seen a girl so cool so candid so refreshingly unconscious and unaffected as this one she was as limpid as a pool of glacier water her placidity he imagined had never been stirred and in that fact lay much of her fascination with her skees slung over her shoulder the girl strode along beside phillips talking freely on various topics but with no disposition to chatter her mind was alert inquisitive and yet she had that thoughtful gravity of youth wisdom coming to life that pierce had made a good impression upon her she implied at parting by voicing a sincere hope that they would meet again very soon perhaps ill see you at the next dance she suggested dance the word struck pierce unpleasantly saturday night at the barracks id love to come he declared do theyre loads of fun all the nice people go with a nod and a smile she was gone leaving him to realize that he did not even know her name well that was of no moment dawson was a small place and saturday was not far off he had heard about those official parties at the barracks and he made up his mind to secure an invitation sufficiently formal to permit him to attend the very next one his opportunity came that night when one of the younger mounted police officers paused to exchange greetings with him lieutenant rock was a familiar figure on the streets of dawson and on the trails near by a tall upstanding canadian with a record for unfailing good humor and relentless efficiency he nodded at pierces casual reference to the coming dance at headquarters great sport said he its about the only chance we fellows have to play when no invitation to share in the treat was forthcoming pierce told of meeting a most attractive girl that afternoon and having obtained his hearers interest he described the youthful goddess of the snows with more than necessary enthusiasm he became aware of a peculiar expression upon rocks face yes i know her well the latter said quietly dyou mean to say she invited you to the ball it wasnt exactly an invitation oh i see well rock shook his head positively theres nothing doing old man it isnt your kind of a party understand i dont understand pierce confessed in genuine surprise the officer eyed him with a cool disconcerting directness we draw the lines pretty close have to in a camp like this no offense i trust with a smile and a careless wave of the hand he moved on leaving pierce to stare after him until he was swallowed up by the crowd in the gamblingroom a blow in the face would not have amazed pierce phillips more nor would it have more greatly angered him so he was ostracized these men who treated him with such apparent goodfellowship really despised him in their eyes he was a renegade they considered him unfit to know their women it was incredible this was the first deliberate slight the young man had ever received his face burned his pride withered under it he would have bitten out his tongue rather than subject himself to such a rebuff who was rock how dared he rock knew the girl oh yes but he refused to mention her name as if that name would be sullied by his pierces use of it that hurt most of all that was the bitterest pill society caste on the arctic circle it was to laugh but phillips could not laugh he could more easily have cried or cursed or raved even to pretend to laugh off such an affront was impossible it required no more than this show of opposition to fan the embers of his flickering desire into full flame and now that he was forbidden to meet that flying goddess it seemed to him that he must do so at whatever cost hed go to that dance he decided in spite of rock hed go unbidden hed force his way in if needs be this sudden ardor died however as quickly as it had been born leaving him cold with apprehension what would happen if he took the bit in his teeth rock knew about laure those detestable redcoats knew pretty much everything that went on beneath the surface of dawson life and if pierce ran counter to the fellows warning he would probably speak out rock was just that sort his methods were direct and forceful what then pierce cringed inwardly at the contemplation that snowgirl was so clean so decent so radically different from all that laure stood for that he shrank from associating them together even in his thoughts well he was paying the fiddler and the price was high even here on the fringe of the frontier society exacted penalty for the breach of its conventions pierces rebellion at this discovery his resentment at the whole situation prevented him from properly taking the lesson to heart the issue was clouded too by a wholly natural effort at selfjustification the more he tried this latter however the angrier he became and the more humiliating seemed his situation he was in no mood to calmly withstand another shock especially when that shock was administered by joe mccaskey of all persons nevertheless it came close upon the heels of rocks insult pierce had not seen either brother since their departure for hunker creek therefore joes black visage leering through the window of the cashiers cage was an unwelcome surprise hello phillips how are you making it the man inquired all right despite this gruffness joes grin widened there was nothing of pleasure at the meeting nor of friendliness behind it however on the contrary it masked both malice and triumph as was plain when he asked did you hear about our strike what strike why its all over town frank and i hit pay in our first shaft three feet of twentycent dirt really pierce could not restrain a movement of surprise joe nodded and chuckled meanwhile keeping his malignant gaze focused upon the younger mans face its big we came to town to buy grub and a dogteam and to hire a crew of hands weve got credit at the a c company up to fifty thousand dollars there was a brief pause which pierce broke by inquiring as casually as he could did tom and jerry have any luck sure thing theyve hit it the same as us you tossed off a homestake kid dont believe it eh well heres the proofcoarse gold from hunker with an ostentatious flourish the speaker flung down a halffilled poke together with a bar check cash me in and dont let any of it stick to your fingers pierce was impelled to hurl the gold sack at joes head but he restrained himself his hands were shaky however and when he untied the thongs he was mortified at spilling some of the precious yellow particles mortification changed to anger when the owner cried sharply hey got cashiers ague have you just cut out the sleightofhand pierce smothered a retort silently he brushed the dust back into the blower and set the weights upon his scales but mccaskey ran on with an insulting attempt at banter im onto you shortweighers take your bit out of the drunks im sober when pierce had retied the sack and returned it he looked up and into joes face his own was white his eyes were blazing dont pull any more comedy here he said quietly that shortweight joke doesnt go at the rialto oh it dont joke mccaskey snorted i spose its a joke to spill dust when you cant get away with it well ive spotted a lot of crooked cashiers in this town no doubt it takes a thief to catch a thief mccaskey started his sneer vanished thief say he blustered angrily dyou mean the clash brief as it had been had excited attention noting the fact that an audience was gathering the speaker lowered his voice and thrusting his black scowling countenance closer to the cage opening he said you neednt remind me of anything ive got a good memory damn good after a moment he turned his back and moved away when pierce went off shift he looked up lars anderson and received confirmation of the hunker strike lars was in a boisterous mood and eager to share his triumph i knew that was a rich piece of ground he chuckled and i knew i was handing those boys a good thing but a fellow owes something to his friends doesnt he i thought you said it was low grade low grade big lars threw back his head and laughed loudly i never said nothing of the kind me knock my own ground why id have banked my life on hunker here was luck pierce told himself a fortune had been handed him on a silver platter and he had shoved it aside he was sick with regret he was furious with himself for his lack of wisdom he hated laure for the deception she had practised upon him the waste he had made of this opportunity bred in him a feeling of desperation toward the close of the show laure found him braced against the bar the face he turned upon her was cold repellent when she urged him to take her to supper he shook his head whats the matter she inquired big lars never told you hunker was low grade he declared the girl flushed she tossed her dark head defiantly well what of it simply this tom and jerry and the mccaskeys have struck rich pay indeed you lied to me laures lips parted slowly in a smile what did you expect what would any girl do she laid a caressing hand upon his arm i dont care how much they make or how poor you are pierce disengaged her grasp i care he cried roughly ive lost my big chance theyve made their piles and im well look at me you blame me he stared at her for a moment whats the difference whether i blame you or myself im through ive been through for some time but this is curtain pierce impatiently he flung her off and strode out of the theater laure was staring blindly after him when joe mccaskey spoke to her have a dance he inquired she undertook to answer but her lips refused to frame any words silently she shook her head whats the idea a lovers quarrel mccaskey eyed her curiously then he chuckled mirthlessly you can come clean with me i dont like him any better than you do mind your own business stormed the girl in a sudden fury thats what im doing and minding it good ive got a lot of business with that rat joes sinister black eyes held laures in spite of her effort to avoid them it was plain that he wished to say more but hesitated maybe it would pay us to get acquainted he finally suggested frank and me and the count are having a bottle of wine upstairs better join us i will said laure after a moment together they mounted the stairs to the gallery above chapter xxiii wal wat i tol you poleon doret exclaimed cheerfully me im cut off for poor man if one dose el dorado millionaire give me his paydump all de gold disappear biffore i get him in de sluicebox some people is born jonah despite this melancholy announcement poleon was far from depressed on the contrary he beamed like a boy and his eyes were sparkling with the joy of again beholding his sister he had returned from the hills late this evening and now he had come to fetch rouletta from her work this was his first opportunity for a word with her alone the girl was not unmoved by his tale of blighted expectations she refused nevertheless to accept it as conclusive nonsense she said briskly you know very well you havent prospected your claim for what its

resignedly i wont scold you forim too glad to see you affectionately she squeezed his arm whereupon he beamed again in the frankest delight now then well have supper and you can take me home the rialto was crowded with its usual midnight throng there was the hubbub of loud voices and the ebb and flow of laughter from midway of the gamblinghall rose the noisy exhortations of some amateur gamester who was breathing upon his dice and pleading earnestly feelingly with little joe from the theater issued the strains of a sentimental ballad as rouletta and her companion edged their way toward the lunchcounter in the next room they were intercepted by the snowbird whose nightly labors had also ended all aboard for the big eats the latter announced mochas buttoned up in a stud game where he dassent turn his head to spit hes good for all night but im on the job im having supper with poleon rouletta told him the snowbird paused in dismay say you cant run out on a pal he protested you got to ok my vittles or they wont harmonize but poleon has just come in from the creeks and weve a lot to talk about wont it keep i never seen talk spoil overnight when rouletta smilingly shook her head mr ryan dangled a tempting bait before her i got a swell fairystory for you i bet youd eat it up its like this once upon a time there was a beautiful princess named rouletta and she lived in an old castle all covered with ivy it was smothered up in them vines till youd vamp right by and never see it along came a busted prince who had been spendin his vacation and some perfectly good tendollar bills in the next county that you could scarcely tell from the real thing he was takin it afoot on account of the jailers daughter who had slipped him a file along with his laundry but she hadnt thought to put in any lunch see well its a story of how this here hungry prince et the greens off of the castle and discovered the sleepin princess its a knockout i bet youd like it im sure i would rouletta agreed save it for tomorrow night the snowbird was reluctant in yielding he eyed poleon darkly and there was both resentment and suspicion in his somber glance when he finally turned away not until rouletta and her companion were perched upon their high stools at the oilclothcovered lunchcounter did the latter speak then he inquired with a frown tell me is any dese feller mak love on you ma soeur why no theyre perfectly splendid like you why the terrible black look gamblers sureting guys boosters bah better dey lef you alone dats all youre nice gal too nice for dem feller rouletta smiled mirthlessly there was an expression in her eyes that the woodsman had never seen too nice thats almost funny when you think about it what sort of men would make love to me if not gamblers fellows like ryan poleon breathed an exclamation of astonishment at this assertion wat you sayin he cried if dat loafer mak fresh talk wit you i pull him in two piece wit dese fingers deres plenty good man i you he paused uncertainly then his tone changed to one of appeal you wont marry wit nobody eh promise me dat thats an easy promise under the circumstances bien i never tink bout you gettin married by gosh dats fierce ting for sure wat ill do if poleon shook his massive shoulders as if to rid himself of such unwelcome speculations no danger roulettas crooked smile did not go unnoticed poleon studied her face intently then he inquired wat ail you lil sister why nothing oh yes i got eye lak fox you seeck the idea miss kirby pulled herself together but there was such genuine concern in her companions face that her chin quivered she felt the need of saying something diverting then abruptly she turned away poleons big hand closed over hers in a voice too low for any but her ears he said someting is kill de song in your heart ma petite i give my life for mak you happy sometam you care for tell me mebbe i can hep lil bit the girl suddenly bowed her head her struggling tears overflowed reluctantly in a weary heartsick murmur she confessed im the most miserable girl in the world im so unhappy some instinct of delicacy prompted the woodsman to refrain from speaking in the same listless monotone rouletta continued ive always been a lucky gambler but the cards have turned against me ive been playing my own stakes and ive lost you been playing de bank he queried in some bewilderment no a gambler never plays his own game he always bucks the other fellows ive been playing hearts poleons grasp upon her hand tightened i see he said wal bad luck is boun to change in roulettas eyes when she looked up was a vision of some glory far beyond the woodsmans sight her lips had parted her tears had dried i wonder she breathed fathers luck always turned dont weaken be a thoroughbred thats what he used to tell me hed be ashamed of me now wouldnt he ive told you my troubles poleon because youre all i have left forgive me please big brother forgive mon dieu said he their midnight meal was set out to them it was tasteless and neither one made more than a silent pretense of eating it they were absorbed in their own thoughts when the sound of high voices a commotion of some sort at the front of the saloon attracted their attention roulettas ears were the first to catch it she turned then uttered a breathless exclamation the next instant she had slid down from her perch and was hurrying away poleon strode after her he was at her back when she paused on the outskirts of a group which had assembled near the cashiers cage pierce phillips had left his post behind the scales he count courteau and ben miller the proprietor were arguing hotly rock the police lieutenant was listening to first one then another the count was deeply intoxicated nevertheless he managed to carry himself with something of an air and at the moment he was making himself heard with considerable vehemence i have been drinking to be sure he acknowledged but am i drunk no damnation there is the evidence in his hand he was holding a small goldsack and this he shook defiantly under the officers nose do you call that eight hundred dollars i ask you weigh it weigh it rock took the little leather bag in his fingers then he agreed its a lot short of eight hundred for a fact but in a strong voice phillips cried i dont know what he had thats all there was in the sack when he paid his check the count lurched forward his face purple with indignation for shame he cried you thought i was blind you thought i was like these other cattle but i know to a dollar he turned to the crowd here i will prove what i say mccaskey bear me out with a show of some reluctance frank the younger and the smaller of the two brothers nodded to the police lieutenant hes giving you the straight goods he had eight hundred and something on him when he went up to the cage rock eyed the speaker sharply how do you know said he joe and i was with him for the last hour and a half aint that right joe joe verified this statement understand this aint any of our doings we dont want to mix up in it but the count had a thousand dollars that much ill swear to he lost about a hundred and forty up the street and he bought two rounds of drinks afterward i aint quick at figures pierce uttered a threatening cry he moved toward the speaker but rock laid a hand on his arm and in a tone of authority exclaimed none of that phillips ill do all the fighting ben miller who likewise had bestirred himself to forestall violence now spoke up im not boosting for the house said he but i want more proof than this kind of chatter pierce has been weighing here since last fall and nobody ever saw him go south with a color if he split this poke he must have the stuff on him let rock search you pierce phillips agreed readily enough to this suggestion and assisted the officers search of his pockets a procedure which yielded nothing dat boys no tief poleon whispered to rouletta msieu le comte has been frisk by somebody the girl did not answer she was intently watching the little drama before her during the search miller forced his way out of the ring of spectators unlocked the gate of the cashiers cage and passed inside we keep our takins in one pile and ill lay a little eight to five that theyll balance up with the checks to a pennyweight said he just wait till i add up the figgers and weigh he paused he stooped then he rose with something he had picked up from the floor beneath his feet what have you got ben it was rock speaking dam if i know there it is the proprietor shoved a clean new mooseskin goldsack through the wicket rock examined the bag then he lifted an inquiring gaze to pierce phillips there was a general craning of necks a shifting of feet a rustle of whispers ah mockingly exclaimed courteau i was dreaming eh to be sure he laughed disagreeably is this house money inquired the redcoat miller shook his head in some bewilderment we dont keep two kitties ill weigh it and see if it adds up with the counts oh it will add up phillips declared his face even whiter than before its a plant so of course it will add up defiantly he met the glances that were fixed upon him as his eyes roved over the faces turned upon him he became conscious for the first tune of poleons and roulettas presence also that laure had somehow appeared upon the scene the latter was watching him with a peculiar expression of hostility frozen upon her features her dark eyes were glowing she was sneering faintly of all the bystanders perhaps the two mccaskeys seemed the least inclined to take part in the affair both brothers in fact appeared desirous of effacing themselves as effectively as possible but courteaus indignation grew and in a burst of excitement he disclaimed the guilt implied in pierces words so you plead innocence you imply that i robbed myself eh well how did i place the gold yonder i ask you am i a magician he waved his arms wildly then in a tone of malevolence he cried this is not the first time you have been accused of theft i have heard that story about sheep camp sheep camp yes phillips eyes ignored the speaker his gaze flew to joe mccaskeys face and to him he directed his next words the whole thing is plain enough to me you tried something like this once before joe and failed i suppose your back is well enough now for the rest of those forty lashes well youll get em the count came promptly to the rescue of his friend ho again you lay your guilt upon others those miners at sheep camp let you off easy well a pretty woman can do much with a miners meeting but here there will be no devoted lady to the rescue no skirt to hide behind for courteau got no further ignoring rocks previous admonition pierce knocked the fellow down with a swift clean blow he would have followed up his attack only for the lieutenant who grappled with him here do you want me to put you in irons courteau raised himself with difficulty he groped for the bar and supported himself dizzily thereon snarling from the pain with his free hand he felt his cheek where pierces knuckles had found lodgment then as a fuller realization of the indignity his privileged person had suffered came home to him he burst into a torrent of frenzied abuse shut up the officer growled unsympathetically i know as much about that trial at sheep camp as you do and if phillips hadnt floored you i would thats how you stand with me you too he shot at the mccaskeys let me warn you if this is a frameup youll all go on the woodpile for the winter dyou hear me of course if you want to press this charge ill make the arrest but ill just take you three fellows along so you can do some swearing before the colonel where itll go on the records arrest but certainly screamed the count the fellow is a thief a pig he struck me me you saw him i sure i saw him the officer grinned i was afraid hed miss you stop yelling and come along with a nod that included the mccaskeys as well as the titled speaker he linked arms with pierce phillips and led the way out into the night wat fool biznesse doret indignantly exclaimed dat boy is hones as church he looked down at the sound of roulettas voice then he started the girls face was strained and white and miserable her hands were clasped over her bosom she was staring horrified at the door through which phillips had been taken she swayed as if about to fall poleon half dragged half carried her out into the street with his arm about her waist he helped her toward her hotel the walk was a silent one for rouletta was in a state bordering upon collapse gradually she regained control of herself and stumbled along beside him theyre three to one she said finally oh poleon theyll swear it on him the police are strict theyll give him five years i heard the colonel say so deres been good deal of shortweighin but doret shook his head nobody goin believe courteau and mccaskey is dam tief if only i could help him youll go to him poleon wont you promise silently the canadian assented they had reached the door of the hotel before he spoke again then he said slowly quietly you been playin hearts wit him ma soeur you you love him yes oh yes the confession came in a miserable gasp bien i never spect biff ore wal dats all right the police are swift and merciless rouletta persisted fearfully they hate the front street crowd theyd like to make an example go in your lil bed an sleep he told her gently dis ting is comin out all right poleon fix it sure hes dandy fixer for some time after the door had closed upon rouletta the big fellow stood with bent head staring at the snow beneath his feet the cheer the sympathy had left his face the smile had vanished from his lips his features were set and stony with an effort he shook himself then murmured poor lil bird wal i spose now i got to bus dat jail chapter xxiv although poleon had spoken with confidence he found upon arriving at police headquarters that the situation was by no means as simple as it had appeared and that something more than a mere word regarding phillips character would be required to offset the very definite accusation against him courteau he learned had pressed his charge with vigor and although the two mccaskeys had maintained their outward show of reluctance at being dragged into the affair they had nevertheless substantiated his statements with a thoroughness and a detail that hinted more than a little at vindictiveness pierce of course had denied his guilt but his total inability to explain how the golddust in dispute came to be concealed in the cashiers cage to which no one but he had access had left the police no alternative except to hold him by the time poleon arrived pierce had been locked up for the night drawing rock aside doret put in an earnest plea for his young friend the lieutenant answered him with some impatience i admit it looks fishy but what is there to do the colonel likes pierce as we all do but he had no choice its dirty frameup i imagine he believes so and yet how the deuce did that sack get where it was i was standing alongside the mccaskeys when courteau went up to pay his check and im sure they had no part in it msieu le comte is sore poleon asserted me i savvy plenty wal how we goin get dat boy from out of jail eh by gar i bet i don sleep none if im lock up get bail for him poleon was frankly puzzled at this suggestion but when its nature had been explained his face lit up ho dats nice arrangements for sure come i fix it now have you got enough money i got bout tirty dollar but dat aint mak no differ i go to workin somewhere me im good for anyting that wont do rock smiled you dont understand laboriously he made more plain the mysteries of court procedure whereupon his hearer expressed the frankest astonishment sacre the latter exclaimed what for you say two free tousan dollar courteau aint lose but six hundred an hes got it back no im tinkin you policemans is got good sense but i lak better a miners meetin us sourdough mak better law as dem feller at ottawa morris best was willing to go his bail rock informed him but miller wouldnt allow it ben is sore at having the rialto implicated theres been so much shortweighing going on understand poleon wagged his head in bewilderment i don savvy dis new kin of law you feller is bring in de country spose i say msieu jodge i know dis boy long tam he don steal dat gold de jodge he say doret how much money you got tousand dollar i say sure i got bout tousand dollar den he tell me wal dat aint nough mebbe so you

let phillips go home he don steal notin wat i tink of dem proceedins eh i tink de jodge is dam grafter rock laughed heartily dont let colonel cavendish hear you he cautioned seriously now hed let pierce go if he could he told me so hell undoubtedly allow him the freedom of the barracks so hell really be on parole until his trial trial you goin try him again the woodsman could make little of the affair if you try him two tam dose crook is mak tief of pierce for sure one trial is plenty i spose mebbe i better kill dem feller off an settle dis ting dont talk like that rock told him im not saying they dont need killing but nobody gets away with that stuff nowadays no poleon was interested and a trifle defiant for why you never catch me msieu nobody is able for doin dat im good traveler rock eyed the stalwart speaker meditatively id hate to take your trail thats a fact but id have to do it however that would be a poor way to help pierce if hes really innocent courteau will have a hard job to convict him i suggest that you let matters rest as they are for a day or so well treat the kid all right on the way to her room rouletta met the countess courteau and in a few words made known the facts of pierces arrest the elder woman listened in astonishment arrested for theft absurd who made the charge count courteau courteau where did he get a thousand dollars the speakers face was set in an expression of utter incredulity i dont know its all too wretched too terrible roulettas voice broke she hid her face in her hands for a moment there was silence then the elder woman exclaimed harshly peremptorily tell me everything quick theres a reason why i must know all about it drawing rouletta into her room she forced her into a chair then stood over her while the latter repeated the story in greater detail so thats it the countess cried at last the mccaskeys backed him up of course and he referred to sheep camp to me hes the sort to do a thing like that god what a dog after a time she went on im sorry pierce struck him hell never get over that and it will make it harder much harder you think it can be straightened out rouletta s face was strained her eyes searched the former speakers face eagerly its got to be straightened out it would be monstrous to allow the countess shook her head then with a mirthless smile exclaimed but what a situation henri of all persons its pleasant for me isnt it well somebody planted that poke probably one of the mccaskeys theyd like to railroad the boy joe is as vindictive as an indian and he blames pierce and me for his brothers death in desperation rouletta cried ill pay the count back his moneyill double it his money sneered the woman he hasnt a cent except what i give him that was mccaskeys dust she stared at the apprehensive figure crouched upon the edge of the chair and slowly her expression softened in a gentler tone she said i see you didnt take my advice you didnt heed my warning who ever heeds a warning like yours does pierce know that you feel this way about him rouletta sighed wearily i didnt know myself although i more than half suspected i didnt permit myself to think it made me so unhappy it ought to satisfy me somewhat to learn that he doesnt care for you but somehow it doesnt he didnt care for me either but i cared for him i love him now just as you love him better probably oh why conceal it ive spent a good many black hours thinking about it and trying to fight it mind you it wasnt his fault it was just fate there are some fellows who go smiling and singing along through life clean decent fellows too attending to their own affairs in a perfectly proper manner but leaving a trail of havoc behind them it isnt so true of women theyre usually flirts their smiles dont last and the echo of their songs dies out hes perfectly impossible for me i wouldnt marry him if i were free and if he asked me but that has nothing whatever to do with the case i had no idea rouletta said i suppose theres no hope for me either im not his kind hes told me about his life his people i wouldnt fit in it isnt that people are adaptable they make themselves fit for a while at least its a question of identities as much a matter of family histories as anything else youre his antithesis in every respect and like should mate with like now then about this other trouble i must work in my own way and i see but one ill have to pay high but the speaker lifted her shoulders as if a cold wind had chilled her ive paid high up to date and i suppose i shall to the end meanwhile if you can get him out of jail do so by all means i cant i darent even try when at a late hour count henri courteau entered the establishment that bore his name he was both surprised and angered to find his wife still awake the guests of the hotel were asleep the place was quiet but the countess was reading in an easychair beside the office stove she was in negligee her feet were resting upon the stove fender she turned her head to say well henri you look better than i thought you would the count passed a caressing hand over his swollen cheek and his discolored left eye you heard about the fight eh he inquired thickly yes if youd call it that courteau grimaced but there was a ring of triumph and of satisfaction in his voice when he cried well what do you think of that fellow it was like him wasnt it after i had caught him redhanded to punch you quite like him agreed the woman pig to strike a defenseless man without warning too it shows his breeding and now the speaker sneered openly i suppose you will bail him out indeed why should i oh dont pretend innocence the count stormed dont act so unconcerned whats your game anyhow whatever it is that fellow will cut cordwood for the rest of the winter where the whole of dawson can see him and say behold the lover of the countess courteau theres some mistake he isnt a thief no the husband swayed a few steps closer his face working disagreeably already it is proved he is exposed ruined bah he made of me a laughingstock well he shall suffer a born thief thats what he is what have you to say why nothing i hoped it was a mistake thats all you hoped to be sure sneered the speaker well what are you going to do about it when his wife said nothing the man muttered in some astonishment i didnt expect you to take it so quietly i was prepared for a scene what ails you hilda laid down her book she turned to face her accuser why should i make a scene she asked ive had nothing to do with phillips since we parted company at white horse ive scarcely spoken to him and you know it you dont deny there was something between you the woman shrugged noncommittally her lips parted in a faint cheerless smile i deny nothing i admit nothing although courteaus brain was fogged he experienced a growing surprise at the selfpossession with which his wife had taken this blow which he had aimed as much at her as at pierce phillips he studied her intently a mingling of suspicion of anger and of admiration in his uncertain gaze he saw for one thing that his effort to reach her had failed and that she remained completely the mistress of herself she reclined at ease in her comfortable chair quite unstirred by his derision his jubilation he became aware also of the fact that she presented an extremely attractive picture for the soft white fur of the loose robe she wore exposed an alluring glimpse of snowy throat and bosom one wide sleeve had fallen back showing a smoothly rounded arm her silken ankles lifted to the cozy warmth of the stove were small and trim her feet were shod in neat highheeled slippers the count admired neatly shod ladies youre a very smartlooking woman he cried with some reluctance youre beautiful hilda i dont blame the young fool for falling but youre too old too wise hilda nodded youve said it too old and too wise if id been as young and as silly as when i met you who knows hes a handsome boy again the husbands anger blazed up but im not young and silly his wife interrupted just the same you played me a rotten trick the count exploded and i dont forget as for him he swore savagely hell learn that its not safe to humiliate me to rob me of any woman wife or mistress youve never told me the half ive had to guess but im patient i know how to wait and to use my eyes and my ears then to strike me perdition ill follow this through never fear how did you get a thousand dollars henri the wife inquired curiously courteaus gaze shifted what difference i won it on a turn at the north star it was given to me i found it anyhow i had it it was a good night for me yes a very good night i had my revenge and i showed my friends that im a man to be reckoned with in a tone unexpectedly humble the woman said i had no idea you cared very much what i did or how i carried on after all it was your own fault mine the count laughed in derision and astonishment exactly if you had taken the trouble to show me that you cared well things might have been different however the countess rose and with another change of voice and manner said come along lets do something for your eye the count stared at her in bewilderment then he turned away crying bah i want no help at the door he paused to jeer once more pierce phillips a common thief a despicable creature who robs the very man he had most deeply injured ive exposed him to the law and to public scorn sleep on that my dear dream on it with a chuckle he traced an uncertain course to the stairs mounted them to his room and slammed his door behind him he had undressed and flung himself into bed but he had not yet fallen asleep when the door reopened and his wife entered bearing in her hand a steaming pitcher of hot water this she deposited into it she dipped a folded towel im sorry youre disfigured henri she told him quietly despite his surly protests she bathed and soothed his swollen features until he dropped asleep after which she stole out and down to her room on the floor below there however she paused staring back up the empty stairway a look of deepest loathing upon her face slowly carefully she wiped her hands as if they were unclean her lips curled into a mirthless smile then she passed into her chamber and turned the key behind her rock had spoken truly in assuring poleon that pierce phillips lot would be made as easy for him as possible that is what happened no one at the barracks appeared to take much stock in courteaus charge and even colonel cavendish the commandant took the trouble to send for him early the next morning and to ask for the whole story in detail when pierce had given it the officer nodded it looks very much like a spite case i couldnt imagine your doing such a thing my boy it is a spite case nothing else courteau is a rotter and your affair with his wife explains his animosity it wasnt exactly an affair sir pierce colored slightly as he went on to explain you see i was perfectly honest i didnt know there was a count and when i learned there was i up stakes and ended it she was the first woman who ever well sir i admired her tremendously she impressed me wonderfully no doubt the colonel smiled shes an impressive person are you still fond of her not in the same way what about this girl laure this time pierce flushed uncomfortably ive no excuses to offer there sir no explanations we just drifted together it was a long trip and the yukon does that sort of thing force of circumstance as much as anything i presume ive been trying to break away but he shrugged youve been a pretty foolish lad pierce remained silent at this accusation and the colonel went on however i didnt bring you here to lecture you the royal mounted have other things to think about than young wasters who throw themselves away after all its a freeandeasy country and if you want to play ducks and drakes its your own business i merely want you to realize that youve put yourself in a bad light and that you dont come into court with clean hands i understand i put in a wakeful night thinking about it its the first time in a long while that ive done any serious thinking well dont be discouraged a little thinking will benefit you now then im going to put rock at work on your case and meanwhile you may have the liberty of the barracks youre a gentleman and i trust you to act as one pierce was only too grateful for this courtesy and to realize that he retained the respect of this middleaged soldierly officer whom he had long admired filled him with deep relief he gave his promise readily enough later in the day broad and bridges came in to see him and their indignation at the outrage their positive assertion that it was nothing less than a deliberate conspiracy and so considered among the front street resorts immensely cheered him you remember the holler i let up when them sheepcampers wanted to hang mccaskey broad inquired it was my mistake his ear and a hemp knot would go together like rheumatism and liniment bridges agreed funny us three bein tillicums aint it he mused especially after the way we dredged you we didnt need your loose change but there it was so we took it youd of done better if youd turned on the hollow of your foot that day and romped right back to the old farm broad asserted youd never of doubled up with the mccaskeys and youd still be the blushing yokel you was yes youre a different kid now both gamblers it seemed were in the melancholy mood for moralizing why we was talkin to rouletta about you this morning shes all bereaved up over this thing she sent us here to cheer you you was clean as an apple then and easier to pick now youre just a common barfly the same as us laure done it shes the baby vampire that made a bum of you youre not very flattering phillips smiled faintly oh im sort of repeatin what letty said she put me to thinkin shes quite a noisy little missionary when she gets started missionary broad exclaimed in disdain i dont like the word them birds is about useful as a hip pocket in an undershirt why missionaries dont do no real lasting good outside of indian villages us surething guys are the best missionaries that ever struck this country look at the good we done around dyea and skagway them gospelbringers never touched it we met the suckers on the edge of the frozen north and we turned em back by the score them three walnut husks done more good than the ten commandments yes sir a set of cheatin tools will save more strayed lambs than a shipload of testaments letty figgers that somebody tossed that goldsack over the top of the cage after you follered the count out impossible pierce declared i got an idea it was broad speaking again the mere contemplation of physical violence unmans that frog hed about as soon have a beatin as have a leg cut off with a caseknife spose me and the kid lure him to some lonely spot some good yellinplace and set upon him with a coupla pickhandles well make him confess or well maim and meller him till he backs out through his bootlegs what dyou say pierce shook his head something must be done but i doubt if thats it its tough to be disgraced to have a thing like this hanging over you i wouldnt mind it half so much if i were up for murder or arson or any manssized crime anything except stealing a mere matter of choice the former speaker lightly declared we got boys around the rialto that has tried em all they dont notice no particular difference for some time the three friends discussed the situation then when his visitors rose to go pierce accompanied them to the limits of the barracks premises and there stood looking after them realizing with a fresh pang that he was a prisoner it was an unfortunate predicament he reflected and quite as unpleasant as the one which had brought him into conflict with the angry men of sheep camp that had been an experience fraught with peril but his present plight was little better it seemed to him for already he felt the weight of the dominion over him already he fancied himself enmeshed in a discouraging tangle of red tape there was no adventurous thrill to this affair nothing but an odious feeling of shame and disgrace which he could not shake off he was staring morosely at the ground between his feet when he heard a voice that caused him to start there facing him with a light of pleasure in her blue eyes was the girl of the skees hello said she she extended her hand and her mitten closed over pierces fingers with a firm clasp im awfully glad to see you again mr she hesitated then with a smile confessed do you know youre my only pupil and yet ive never heard your name phillips said he you dont deserve to be remembered at all for you didnt come to the dance and after you had promised too i couldnt come he assured her truthfully enough i looked for you i was quite hurt when you failed to appear then i thought perhaps you expected something more formal than a mere verbal invitation and in that way i managed to save my vanity if id known who you were or how to find you id have had my father send you a note if it wasnt that im glad well theres another dance this week and ill expect you i im not dancing he stammered not at the barracks anyhow the girl was puzzled therefore pierce summoned his courage and explained with as brave an attempt at lightness as he could afford you see before you a victim of unhappy circumstance a person to be shunned im worse than a case of smallpox i dont think you should be seen talking to me what are you driving at im getting up the spiritual momentum necessary to tell you that im a thief truly anyhow three choice gentlemen are so sure of it that they went to the trouble of perjuring themselves and having me arrested arrested you exactly and the evidence is very strong i almost think i must be guilty are you pierce shook his head of course youre not i remember now something father said at breakfast but i paid no attention you fought with that goodlooking french count didnt you thank you for reminding me of the one cheerful feature connected with the entire affair yes i raised my hand to him in anger and let it fall but lieutenant rock spoiled the whole party tell me everything please pierce was more than willing to oblige and he began his recital at the time of his first meeting with joe mccaskey on the beach at dyea while he talked the girl listened with that peculiar openeyed meditative gravity he had noted upon their former meeting when he had finished she cried breathlessly why its as exciting as a book you think so i dont if i were only a clever book character id execute some dramatic coup and confound my enemies book people always do but my mind is a blank my ingenuity is at a complete standstill i feel perfectly foolish and impotent to save me i cant understand how that gold got where it was for the cashiers cage is made of wire and the door has a springlock i heard it snap back of me when i followed the count outside i had an insane idea that his nose would stretch if i pulled it and i believe yet it would well ive spent one night in the dungeon and im not cut out to enjoy that mode of life all i can think about is the prisoner of chillon and the man in the iron mask and other distressing instances of the laws injustice i feel as if id grown a gray beard in the last twelve hours do i look much older than when we met the girl shook her head its tremendously dramatic think what a story it will make when its over and when you look back on it do you feel that way too pierce inquired curiously as if everything is an adventure i used to i used to stand outside of myself and look on but now im on the inside looking out i suppose its the effect of the gray beard experience comes fast in this country to one thing ive made up my mind however when i get out of this scrape if i ever do im going away up into the hills where the wind can blow me clean and stay there its a perfect shame the girl said indignantly i shall tell father to fix it he fixes everything i ask him to hes wonderful as you probably know inasmuch as i havent the faintest idea who he is why hes colonel cavendish im josephine cavendish i thought everybody knew me pierce could not restrain a start of surprise very humbly he inquired now that you understand who i am and what im charged with do you want to know me be friends with me we are friends miss cavendish warmly declared thats not something that may happen it has happened im peculiar about such matters i have my own way of looking at them and now that were friends were going to be friends throughout and im going to help you come along and meet mother i dont know how far my parole extends pierce ventured doubtfully nonsense theres only one authority around here father thinks hes it but he isnt i am youre my prisoner now give me your word you wont try to escape escape pierce smiled broadly i dont much care if i never get out prisons arent half as bad as theyre pictured then come chapter xxv you really must do something for this boy pierce phillips mrs cavendish spoke with decision the newspaper which the colonel was reading was barely six weeks old therefore he was deeply engrossed in it and he looked up somewhat absentmindedly yes yes of course my dear he murmured what does he want now why he wants his liberty he wants this absurd charge against him dismissed its a shame to hold a boy of his character his breeding on the mere word of a man like count courteau colonel cavendish smiled quizzically you too eh said he what do you mean by that why youre the fourth woman who has appealed to me since his arrest i dare say ill hear from others i never saw a fellow who had the female vote so solidly behind him im beginning to regard him as a sort of domestic menace you surely dont believe him guilty when her husband refused to commit himself mrs cavendish exclaimed rubbish first josephine came to me the colonel observed she was deeply indignant and considerably disappointed in me as a man and a father when i refused to quash the entire proceedings and apologize on behalf of the dominion government for the injury to the lads feelings she was actually peeved what ails her i dont know then the countess courteau dropped in and so did that lady dealer from the rialto now you take up his defense the speaker paused thoughtfully for an instant its bad enough to have the fellow hanging around our quarters at all hours but josephine actually suggested that we have him dine with us i know she spoke of it to me but he isnt hanging around at all hours josephine is interested in his case just as i am because my dear hes a weigher in a saloon a gamblinghouse employee dyou think it wise to raise such a dust about him i like the boy myself cant help liking him but you understand what hes been doing hes been cutting up going the pace i never knew you to countenance a fellow i never saw a boy toward whom i felt so motherly mrs cavendish said with some irrelevance i dont like wild young men any better than you do but he isnt a thief of that im sure look here colonel cavendish laid down his paper and there was more gravity than usual in his tone i havent told you everything but its evidently time i did phillips was mixed up with bad associates the very worst in town so he told me he couldnt have told you what im about to he had a most unfortunate affair with a dancehall girl one that reflects no credit upon him he was on the straight path to ruin and going at a gallop drinking gambling everything all the more reason for trying to save him remember you were pretty wild yourself wait i dont say hes guilty of this charge i want to believe him innocent id like to help prove it for that very reason it occurred to me that laure shes the dancehall girl might throw some light on the matter so i put rock to work on her well his report wasnt pleasant the girl talked but what she said didnt help phillips she confessed that hed been stealing right along and giving her the money mrs cavendish was shocked incredulous after a moment however she shook her head positively and exclaimed i dont believe a word of it shes going to swear to it her oath would be no better than her word good lord the colonel cried testily has this young imp completely hypnotized you women the kirby girl is frightened to death and the countess well she told me herself that her husbands jealousy was at the bottom of the whole thing laure in spite of what she said to rock is behaving like a mad person i dropped in at the rialto this evening and she asked me what was the worst pierce could expect i made it strong purposely and i thought shed faint no its a nasty affair all through and by jove to cap the climax you and josephine take part in it i flatter myself that im democratic but have him here to dine gad thats playing democracy pretty strong it isnt fair to imply that hes nothing more than a ladies man theyre detestable the men like phillips too true cavendish admitted he has the godgiven faculty of making friends and for that alone i can forgive him almost anything its a wonderful faculty better than being born lucky or rich or handsome im fond of him but ive favored him all i can if i thought josephine were seriously interested in him well i wouldnt feel so friendly the speaker laughed shortly no the man who claims that girls attention must be clean through and through he must stand the acid test when his wife silently approved this sentiment the colonel picked up ms paper and resumed his reading pierces friends were indeed uniformly indignant and without exception they maintained their faith in his innocence most of them in fact actually applied themselves to the task of clearing him of courteaus charge but of the latter the one who applied herself the most thoughtfully the most seriously was the countess courteau having reasoned that she herself was indirectly responsible for his plight she set about aiding him in a thoroughly feminine and indirect manner it was an unpleasant undertaking she took it up with intense abhorrence it required her utmost determination to carry it on her plan had formed itself immediately she had learned what had happened her meeting with the count that evening and her unexpected solicitude her unbidden attention to his injury were a part of it as time went on she assumed an air that amazed the man she meekly accepted his reproaches she submitted to his abuse cautiously patiently she paved the way to a reconciliation it was by no means easy for she and henri had long lived in what was little better than a state of open hostility and she had been at no pains to conceal the utter disregard and contempt she felt for him he of course had resented it her change of demeanor now awoke his suspicion he was a vain and shallow person however his conceit was thoroughly latin and hildas perseverance was in a way rewarded slowly grudgingly he gave ground before her subtle advances they were in fact less advances on her part than opportunities for him he experienced a feeling of triumph and began to assume a masterful air that was indeed trying to one of her disposition before his friends he boasted that his energetic defense of his honor had worked a marvel in his home in her presence he made bold to take on a swagger and an authority hitherto unknown hilda stood it with what cost no one could possibly understand in some manner she managed to convey the idea that he dominated her and that she cringed spiritually before him she permitted him occasionally to surprise a look of bewilderment almost of fright in her eyes and this tickled the man immensely with a fatuous complacency thoroughly typical he told himself that she feared and respected him was actually falling in love with him all over again when he felt the impulse to scout this idea he went to his mirror and examined himself critically why not he asked himself he was very pleasing women had always been wax in his hands he had a personality an air an irresistible something that had won him many conquests it seemed not unlikely that hilda had been shocked into a new and keener realization of his many admirable qualities and was ready to make up if or when he graciously chose to permit her on the very evening that colonel cavendish and his wife were discussing pierce phillips affair courteau feeling in a particularly jubilant mood decided to put the matter to a test therefore he surprised his wife by walking into her room unannounced my dear he began its high time we had a talk indeed said she what about about you about me about our affairs are we husband and wife or are we not i ask you with a queer flicker of her eyelids she answered why of course you have appeared to forget it sometimes but no reproaches please the past is gone neither of us is without blame youve had your fling too but ive shown you that im made of stern stuff and will tolerate no further foolishness i am a different courteau than you ever knew ive had my rebirth now then our present mode of life is not pleasing to me for im a fellow of spirit think of me in the attitude of a dependent i share generously with you i give you money the very point he broke in excitedly you give i accept you direct i obey it must end now at once i cannot play the accompaniment while you sing either i close my eyes to your folly and forgive utterly either we become man and wife again and i assume leadership or i make different plans for the future just what do you propose henri the fellow shrugged i offer you a reconciliation that to begin with youve had your lesson and i flatter myself that you see me in a new light the brave can afford to be generous i well ive always had a feeling for you ive never been blind to your attractions my dear lately ive even experienced something of the er the old spell understand me its a fact im actually taken with you hilda i have the fire of an impetuous lover courteaus eyes gleamed there was an unusual warmth to his gaze and a vibrance to his tone he curled his mustache he swelled his chest he laughed lightly but deeply what do you say eh im not altogether displeasing no you see something in me to admire i thrill you confess the wife lowered her eyes you have some power she murmured power precisely the count nodded and there was a growing vivacity and sparkle to him that is my quality a power to charm a power to achieve a power to triumph well i choose now to win you again for myself it is my whim to rekindle a love which one has lost is a test of any mans power nestce pas you are fond of me i see it am i not right my sweet he laid his soft white hands upon his wifes shoulders and bent an ardent gaze upon her hilda faced him with an odd smile her cheeks were white her iceblue eyes were very wide and bright and they held a curious expression come a kiss he persisted oho you tremble you shrink like a maiden i too am exhilarated but with a chuckle he folded her in his embrace and she did not resist after a moment he resumed this is quite too amusing i wish my friends to see and to understand put on your prettiest dress what for we are going downtown we shall celebrate our reunion we shall drink to it publicly all dawson shall take note they have said courteau is a loafer a neerdowell and he permits another to win his wife away from him i propose to show them you mean you propose to show me off is that it another conquest eh have it as you will i i wont go hilda cried furiously she freed herself from his arms you know i wont go youd like to parade me in the places you frequent saloons dancehalls gamblinghouses the idea you wont tut tut what is this courteau cried angrily rebellious so soon is this recent change of demeanor assumed have you been fooling me what change the woman parried i dont know oh yes you do for the first time in years you have treated me as a husband should be treated halfmeasures will no longer satisfy me we have arrived at the showup are you a miserable delilah or please dont ask me to go out with you henri the woman pleaded in genuine distress now that she saw he was in earnest to be paraded like an animal on a chain think of my feelings indeed think of mine he cried this is my hour my triumph i propose to make it complete now that i carefully consider it i will put you to the test youve had a fine time if you pay a price for it whose fault is that no one must be cruel to be kind cruel kind hilda sneered it merely pleases you to humiliate me very well blazed the count if it pleases me so be it that is my attitude now and henceforth my will is to be law come your prettiest dress and your prettiest smile for we celebrate yes and money too im as povertyridden as usual we will treat my friends we will gamble here and there we will watch the shows to an accompaniment of popping corks so that every one shall see us and say yonder is courteau and his wife they have made up and she adores him like a mistress parbleu the man has a way with women eh it shall be a great night for me are you really serious courteau stamped his feltshod foot anger me no more hildas face was colorless her eyes were still glowing with that peculiar light of defiance of desperation of curiosity nevertheless she turned away and began to dress herself courteau was not disappointed his appearance in the riverfront resorts accompanied by his wife created a sensation indeed and hildas bearing under the circumstances added to his gratification for now that the die was cast she surrendered completely she clung to him as if feeling a new dependence and this filled his cup to overflowing it was an outrageous thing to do no one save a courteau would have thought of subjecting the woman who bore his name to such a humiliation but he was a perverse individual his mind ran in crooked courses he took a bizarre delight in the unusual and morality of the common sort he knew not to smirch her even a little bit to subject her to seeming disgrace not only taught her a lesson but also united them more closely so he told himself that he had the ability to compel her to do anything against her will immensely tickled his vanity for her stubborn independence had always been a trial to him he knew that her social status was not of the highest nevertheless her reputation was far better than his and among all except the newest arrivals in dawson she bore a splendid name to be himself the cause of blackening that name in order to match his own gratified his feelings of resentment all in all it was a night of nights for him and he was at no pains to conceal his satisfaction from one place to another he led her taking malicious enjoyment from the distress he caused courteau was not loud nor blatant nevertheless his triumphant demeanor his proprietary air fairly shouted the fact that he had tamed this woman and was exhibiting her against her inclinations at every bar he forced her to drink with him and with his friends he even called up barroom loafers whom he did not know and introduced them with an elaborate flourish the money he spent was hers of course but he squandered it royally leaving a trail of empty champagnebottles behind champagne at this time sold for twenty dollars a quart and although hilda saw her earnings melting away with appalling rapidity she offered no protest together they flung their chips broadcast upon the gamblingtables and their winnings which were few went to buy more popularity with the satellites who trailed them as time passed and hilda continued to meet the test her husbands satisfaction gained a keener edge he beamed he strutted he twisted his mustache to needlepoints she was a thoroughbred that he assured himself but after all why shouldnt she do this for him the women with whom he was accustomed to associate would not have counted such an evening as this a sacrifice and even had they so considered it he was in the habit of exacting sacrifices from women they liked it it proved their devotion her subjugation was made complete when he led her into a box at the rialto theater and insisted upon the two mccaskeys joining them the brothers at first declined but by this time courteaus determination carried all before it joe halted him outside the box door however to inquire into the meaning of the affair it means this the count informed him i have effected a complete reconciliation with my adorable wife women are all alike they fear the iron they kiss the hand that smites them i have made her my obedient slave mon ami thats what it means it dont look good to me joe said morosely shes got an ace buried somewhere eh what are you trying to say ive got a hunch shes salving you count shes stuck on phillips like i told you and shes trying to get a peek at your hole card it was characteristic of courteau that he should take instant offense at this reflection upon his sagacity this doubt of his ability as a charmer you insult my intelligence he cried stiffly and above all i possess intelligence you do not no you are coarse you are gross i am full of sentiment rats mccaskey growled i get that way myself sometimes sentiment like yours costs twenty dollars a quart but this aint the time for a spree we got business on our hands the count eyed his friend with a frown it is a personal affair and concerns our business not in the least i am a revengeful person i have pride and i exact payment from those who wound it i brought my wife here as a punishment and i propose to make her drink with you your company is not agreeable at any time my friend and she does you an honor cut out that tony talk joe said roughly youre a brokenhipped stiff and youre trying to grab her bankroll dont you spose im on my company was all right until you got your hand in the hotel cashdrawer now im coarse maybe shes on the square she fell for you once but i bet shes working you make sure of this my high and mighty nobleman for emphasis the speaker laid a heavy hand upon the counts shoulder and thrust his disagreeable face closer that you keep your mouth shut savvy dont let her sweat you the admonitory words ended abruptly for the door of the box reopened and joe found the countess courteau facing him for an instant their glances met and in her eyes the man saw an expression uncomfortably reminiscent of that day at sheep camp when she had turned public wrath upon his brother jims head but the look was fleeting she turned it upon her husband and the count with an apology for his delay entered the box dragging mccaskey with him frank it appeared shared his brothers suspicions the two exchanged glances as joe entered then when the little party had adjusted itself to the cramped quarters they watched the countess curiously hoping to analyze her true intent but in this they were unsuccessful she treated both of them with a cool impartial formality quite natural under the circumstances but in no other way did she appear conscious of that clash on the chilkoot trail it was not a pleasant situation at best and joe especially was ill at ease but courteau continued his spendthrift role keeping the waiters busy and under the influence of his potations the elder mccaskey soon regained some of his natural sangfroid all three men drank liberally and by the time the lower floor had been cleared for dancing they were in a hilarious mood they laughed loudly they shouted greetings across to other patrons of the place they flung corks at the whirling couples below meanwhile they forced the woman to imbibe with them joe in spite of his returning confidence kept such close watch of her that she could not spill her glass into the bucket except rarely hilda hated alcohol and its effect she was not accustomed to drinking as she felt her intoxication mounting she became fearful that the very medium upon which she had counted for success would prove to be her undoing desperately she battled to retain her wits more than once with a reckless defiance utterly foreign to her preconceived plans she was upon the point of hurling the bubbling contents of her glass into the flushed faces about her and telling these men how completely she was shamming but she managed to resist the temptation that she felt such an impulse at all made her fearful of committing some action equally rash of dropping some word that would prove fatal it was a hideous ordeal she realized that already the cloak of decency of respectability which she had been at such pains to preserve during these difficult years was gone lost for good and all she had made herself a lady godiva by this night of conspicuous revelry she had undone everything not only had she condoned the sins and the shortcomings of her dissolute husband but also she had put herself on a level with him and with the fallen women of the town his customary associates courteau had done this to her it had been his proposal she could have throttled him where he sat the long night dragged on interminably like leeches the two mccaskeys clung to their prodigal host and not until the early hours of morning when the count had become sodden sullen stupefied and when they were in a condition little better did they permit him to leave them how hilda got him home she scarcely knew for she too had all but lost command of her senses there were moments when she fought unavailingly against a mental numbness a stupor that rolled upward and suffused her like a cloud of noxious vapors leaving her knees weak her hands clumsy her vision blurred again waves of deathly illness surged over her under and through it all however her subconscious will to conquer remained firm over and over she told herself ill have the truth and then ill make him pay courteau followed his wife into her room and there his maudlin manner changed he roused himself and smiled at her fatuously into his eyes flamed a desire into his cheeks came a deeper flush he pawed at her caressingly he voiced thick passionate protestations hilda had expected nothing less it was for this that she had bled her flesh and crucified her spirit these many hours youre wonderful woman the man mumbled as he swayed with her in his arms got all the old charm and more game too he laughed foolishly then in drunken gravity asserted well im the man the stronger vessel to turn hate into love that youve taken your price youve had your hour she told him her head was thrown back her eyes were closed her teeth were clenched as if in a final struggle for selfrestraint courteau pressed his lips to hers then in a sudden frenzy he crushed her closer and fell to kissing her cheeks her neck her throat he mistook her shudder of abhorrence for a thrill responsive to his passion and hiccoughed youre mine again all mine and im mad about you im aflame this is like the night of our marriage what are you satisfied now that youve made me suffer do you still imagine i care for that foolish boy phillips bah a noisy swine again the count chuckled but this time his merriment ran away with him until he shook and until tears came to his eyes without reason hilda joined in his laughter together they stood rocking giggling snickering as if at some excruciating jest he he tried to steal you from me from me imagine it then he struck me well where is he now eh i never dreamed that you cared enough for me to do what you did to risk so much risk hilda nodded and her loose strawgold hair brushed courteaus cheek dont pretend any longer i knew from the start but you were jealous when a woman loses the power to excite jealousy its a sign shes growing old and ugly and losing her fire she can face anything except that fire henri exclaimed parbleu dont i know you to be a volcano how did you manage the affair that fellows ruin it frightens me to realize that you can accomplish such things the count pushed his wife away what are you talking about he demanded oh very well carry it out if you wish she said with a careless shrug but youre not fooling me in the least on the contrary i admire your spirit now then im thirsty and you are too with a smile she evaded his outstretched arms and left the room she was back in a moment with a bottle and two glasses the latter she filled her own she raised with a gesture and courteau blindly followed suit in spite of his deep intoxication the man still retained the embers of suspicion and when she spoke of pierce phillips they began to glow and threatened to burst into flame cunningly persistently she played upon him however she enticed she coquetted she cajoled she maddened him with her advances she teased him with her repulses she drugged him with her smiles her fragrant charms time and again he was upon the point of surrender but caught himself in time she won at last she dragged the story from him bit by bit playing upon his vanity until he gabbled boastfully and took a crapulent delight in repeating the details it was a tale distorted and confused but the truth was there she made an excuse to leave him finally and remained out of the room for a long time when she returned it was to find him sprawled across her bed and fast asleep for a moment she held dizzily to the bedpost and stared down at him her mask had slipped now her face was distorted with loathing and so deep were her feelings that she could not bear to touch him even to cover him over leaving him spreadeagled as he was she staggered out of his unclean presence hilda was deathly sick objects were gyrating before her eyes she felt a hideous nightmare sensation of unreality and was filled with an intense contempt a tragic disgust for herself pausing at the foot of the stairs she strove to gather herself together then slowly passionately she cursed the name of pierce phillips chapter xxvi tom linton and jerry quirk toiled slowly up the trail toward their cabin both men were bundled thickly in clothing both bewhiskered visages bore grotesque breathmasks of ice even their eyebrows were hoary with frost the partners were very tired pausing in the chiplittered space before their door they gazed down the trail to a mound of gravel which stood out raw and red against the universal whiteness this mound was in the form of a truncated cone and on its level top was a windlass and a pole bucket track from beneath the windlass issued a cloud of smoke which mounted in billows as if breathed forth from a concealed chimney smoke from the smothered drift fires laid against the frozen face of pay dirt forty feet below the surface evidently this fire was burning to suit the partners after watching it a moment tom took a bucksaw and fell stiffly to work upon a dry spruce log which lay on the sawbuck jerry spat on his mittens and began to split the blocks as they fell darkness was close at hand but both men were so fagged that they found it impossible to hurry neither did they speak patiently silently they sawed and chopped then carried the wood into the chilly cabin while one lit the lamp and went for a sack of ice the other kindled a fire these tasks accomplished by mutual consent but still without exchanging a word they approached the table from the windowsill tom took a coin and balanced it upon his thumb and forefinger then in answer to his bleak inquiring glance jerry nodded and he snapped the piece into the air while it was still spinning jerry barked sharply tails both gray heads bent and nearsightedly examined the coin tails she is tom announced he replaced the silver piece crossed the room to his bunk seated himself upon it and remained there while jerry with a sudden access of cheerfulness hustled to the stove warmed himself and then began culinary preparations these preparations were simple but precise also they were deliberate jerry cut one slice of ham he measured out just enough coffee for one person he opened one can of corn and he mixed a halfpan of biscuits tom watched him from beneath a frown meanwhile tugging moodily at the icicles which still clung to his lips his corner of the cabin was cold hence it was a painful process when he had disposed of the last lump and when he could no longer restrain his irritation he broke out of course you had to make bread didnt you just because you know im starving it come tails didnt it jerry inquired with aggravating pleasantness it aint my fault youre starving and you got all night to cook what you want after im done i dont care if you bake a layer cake and freeze icecream you can put your front feet in the trough and champ your swill you can root and waller in it for all of me i wont hurry you not in the least its come tails every time lately grumbled the former speaker jerry giggled i always was right lucky except in pickin pardners he declared in a cracked and tuneless voice he began humming a roundelay evidently intended to express gaiety and contentment unable longer to withstand his gnawing hunger tom secured for himself a large round hardtack and with this he tried to ward off the pangs of starvation but he had small success with the endeavor for his teeth were poor he flung the thing of adamant aside finally and cried testily my god aint it bad enough to eat a phonograph record without having to listen to the damn machine shut up will you youve got the indecentest singing voice i ever heard say jerry looked up belligerently you dont have to listen to my singin theres plenty of room outside all the room from here south to seattle and you dont have to gum that pilotbread if your teeth is loose you can boil yourself a pot of mush when your turn comes you got a free hand as for me i eat anything i want to and i sing anything i want to whenever i want to and id like to see anybody stop me we dont have to toss up for turns at singin more loudly he raised his highpitched voice ostentatiously he rattled his dishes tom settled back in exasperated silence but as time wore on and his hungry nostrils were assailed with the warm tantalizing odor of frying ham fat he fidgeted nervously having prepared a meal to his liking jerry set the table with a single plate cup and saucer then seated himself with a luxurious grunt he ate slowly he rolled every mouthful with relish he fletcherized it with calculated deliberation he paused betweentimes to blow loudly upon his coffee and to smack his lipssounds that in themselves were a provocation and an insult to his listener when he had cleaned up his interminable repast and was finishing the last scrap tom rose and made for the stove jerry watched him paralyzed in midmotion until his partners hand was outstretched then he suddenly shouted get away from there tom started what for he queried a light of rebellion flaring into his eyes aint you through with your supper you been at it long enough you see me eatin dont you after i get fed up and my teeth picked i got all my dishes to wash that wasnt our arrangement it was so youll eat all night tom complained almost tearfully youll set there and gorge till you bust thats my privilege i dont aim to swaller my grub whole im shy a few teeth and some of the balance dont meet so i cant consume vittles like i was a pulpmill i didnt start this row who did now aint that a fool question jerry leaned back comfortably and began an elaborate vacuumcleaning process of what teeth he retained who starts all our rows if i dont no im as easygoing as a greased eel and most anybody can get along with me but tread on my tail and i swop ends pronto thats me i go my own even way but i live up to my bargains and i see to it that others do the same you get the hell away from that stove tom abandoned his purpose and with the resignation of a martyr returned to teeter upon the edge of his bunk he remained there glum malevolent watchful until his cabinmate had leisurely cleared the table washed and put away his dishes then with a sigh of fat repletion unmistakably intended as a provocation the tormentor lit his pipe and stretched himself luxuriously upon his bed even then tom made no move he merely glowered at the recumbent figure jerry blew a cloud of smoke then waved a generous gesture now then fly at it mr linton he said sweetly ive et my fill ive had an ample sufficiency im through and in for the night oh no you aint you get up and wash that skillet mr quirk started guiltily hustle your creaking joints and scrub it out pshaw i only fried a slice scrub it linton ordered this command jerry obeyed although it necessitated heating more water a procedure which of course he maliciously prolonged waited till i was all spread out didnt you he sneered as he stooped over the woodbox thats like you some people are so smallcalibered theyd rattle around in a gnats bladder like a mustard seed in a bass drum im particular who i eat after tom said so be sure you scrub it clean thought youd spoil my smoke well i can smoke standin on my head and enjoy it there was a silence broken only by the sound of jerrys labors at last he spoke once again i repeat what i told you yesterday i took the words out of your own mouth you said the woman was a hellion i never did even if i had i wouldnt allow a comparative stranger to apply such an epithet to a member of my family you did say it and she aint a member of your family toms jaws snapped if patience is a virtue he declared in quivering anger ill slide into heaven on skids assassination ought not to be a crime its warranted like abating a nuisance it aint even a misdemeanor sometimes she was a noble woman hellion i got it on the authority of her own husband you tom rose and stamped over to the stove he slammed its door and clattered the coffeepot to drown this hateful persistence having had the last word as usual jerry retreated in satisfaction to his bed and stretched his aching frame upon it the dingy cabin was fragrant with the odor of cooking food for a second time that evening when the sound of voices and a knock at the door brought both old men to their feet before they could answer the door flew open and in and out of the frosty evening came rouletta kirby and poleon doret the girls cheeks were rosy her eyes were sparkling she warmly greeted first one partner then the other pausing she sniffed the air hungrily goody she cried were just in time and were as hungry as bears dis gal aint never got nough to eat since shes seeck in wite orse poleon laughed for las hour shes been sayin hurry hurry we goin be late i mos keel dem dog lintons seamed face softened it cracked into a smile of genuine pleasure there was real hospitality and welcome in his voice when he said youre in luck for sure lay off your things and pull up to the fire it wont take a jiffy to parlay the ham and coffee one calls three as they say no need to ask if youre well youre prettier than ever and some folks would call that impossible jerry nodded in vigorous agreement youre as sweet as a bunch of jessamine letty why youre like a breath of spring what brought you out to see us anyhow dats long story poleon answered sapre we got plenty talkin to do letty shes goin hep you mak de supper now an i fix dem dog we goin camp wit you all night golly we have beeg tam the newcomers had indeed introduced a breath of new clean air of a sudden the cabin had brightened it was vitalized it was filled with a magic purpose and good humor rouletta flung aside her furs and bustled into the supper preparations soon the meal was ready the first pause in her chatter came when she set the table for four and when jerry protested that he had already dined the girl paused plate in hand then we were late and you didnt tell us she pouted reproachfully no i got through early but tom he was held up in the traffic you see i dont eat much anyhow i just nibble around and take a cold snack where i can get it and you let him rouletta turned to chide the other partner hell come down sick tom and youll have to nurse him again if you boys wont learn to keep regular meal hours ill have to come out and run your house for you shall i speak up what am i offered now this was the most insidious flattery boys indeed jerry chuckled tom looked up from the stove and his smokeblue eyes were twinkling i cant offer you more n a halfinterest in the lay thats all i own is dis claim so reech lak people say poleon inquired deyre tellin me you goin mak hondred tousan dollar were just breastin out crosscuttin the streak but looky jerry removed a bakingpowder can from the windowshelf and out of it he poured a considerable amount of coarse gold which the visitors examined with intense interest thems our pannins how splendid rouletta cried i been clamorin to hire some men and take life easy i say put on a gang and hist it out but jerry shot a glance at his partner people tell me im vilent an headstrong they say prove it up linton interrupted by loudly exclaiming come and get it strangers or ill throw it out and wash the skillet supper was welcome but despite the diners preoccupation with it despite toms and jerrys effort to conceal the fact of their estrangement it became evident that something was amiss rouletta finally sat back and with an accusing glance demanded to know what was the matter the old men met her eyes with an assumption of blank astonishment fess up she persisted have you boys been quarreling again who us why not exactly we sort of had words mebbe what about there was an awkward an ominous silence that mr linton said in a harsh and firm voice is something i cant discuss its a personal matter it aint personal with me jerry announced carelessly we was talkin about toms married life and i happened to say dont lintons cry of warning held a threat dont spill your indecencies in the presence of this child or ill hang the fryingpan around your neck the truth is he told letty theres no use trying to live with a horn toad ive done my best ive let him defame me to my face and degrade me before strangers but he remains hostyle to every impulse in my being he picks and pesters and poisons me a thousand times a day and snore my god you ought to hear him at night strangely enough mr quirk did not react to this passionate outburst on the contrary he bore it with indications of a deep and genuine satisfaction hes workin up steam to propose another divorce said the object of toms tirade that i am divorce is the word linton growled whoopee jerry uttered a highpitched shout i been waitin for that i wanted him to say it now im free as air and twice as light you heard him propose it didnt you wat you goin do bout dis lay toleon inquired split her yelled jerry dis cabin too sure slam a partition right through her we wont slam no partition anywhere tom declared think im going to lay awake every night listening to distant bugles no well pull her apart limb from limb and divvy the logs its a pesthouse anyhow ill burn my share toms positive refusal even to permit mention of the cause of the quarrel rendered efforts at a reconciliation difficult poleons and roulettas attempts at badinage therefore were weak failures and their conversation met with only the barest politeness now that the truth had escaped neither partner could bring himself to a serious consideration of anything except his own injuries they exchanged evil glances they came into direct verbal contact only seldom and when they did it was to clash as flint upon steel no statement of the one was sufficiently conservative sufficiently broad to escape a sneer and an immediate refutation from the other evidently the rift was deep and was widening rapidly of course the facts were revealed eventually rouletta had a way of winning confidences a subtle sweet persuasiveness they had to do with the former mrs linton that shadowy female figure which had fallen athwart toms early life it seemed that jerry had referred to her as a hellion now the injured husband himself had often applied even more disparaging terms to the lady in question therefore the visitors were puzzled at his show of rabid resentment the most they could make out of it was that he claimed the right of disparagement as a personal and exclusive privilege and considered detraction out of the lips of another a trespass upon his intimate private affairs an aspersion and an insult the wife of a mans bosom he averred was sacred any creature who breathed disrespect of her into the ears of her husband was lower than a hole in the ground and lacked the first qualifications of a friend a gentleman or a citizen jerry on the other hand would not look at the matter in this light tom had called the woman a hellion therefore he was privileged to do the same and any denial of that privilege was an iniquitous encroachment upon his sacred rights those rights he proposed to safeguard to fight for if necessary he would shed his last drop of blood in their defense no cantankerous old grouch could refuse him free speech and get away with it youre not really mad at each other rouletta told them aint we they hoarsely chorused she shook her head you need a change thats all as a matter of fact your devotion to each other is about the most beautiful the most touching thing i know youd lay down your lives for each other youre like man and wife and well you know it who us jerry was aghast which one of us is the woman i been insulted by experts but none of em ever called me mrs linton she was a tough customer a regular hellion hes off again tom growled me lay down my life for a squawking parrot hell repeat that pet word for the rest of time if i dont wring his neck mebbe so you lak hear bout some other fellers trouble poleon broke in diplomatically wal ma soeur shes come to you for help queeck both old men became instantly alert you in trouble tom demanded of the girl whos been hurting you id like to know jerry too leaned forward and into his widening eyes came a stormy look sure has one of them crawlin worms got fresh with you letty say he reached up and removed his sixshooter from its nail over his bed rouletta set them upon the right track swiftly but earnestly she recited the nature and the circumstances of the misfortune that had overtaken pierce phillips and of the fruitless efforts his friends were making in his behalf she concluded by asking her hearers to go his bail why sure linton exclaimed with manifest relief thats easy ill go it if theyll take me there you are hoggin the curtain as usual jerry protested ill go his bail myself i got him in trouble at sheep camp i owe him ive known the boy longer than you have besides im a family man i know the anguish of a parents heart lay off that family stuff howled mr quirk you know it riles me i could of had as much of a family as you had if id wanted to youd think it give you some sort of privilege why ever since we set up with letty youve assumed a fatherly air even to her and you act like i was a plumb outsider you remind me of a hen settin on every loose doorknob you find if youd lay off the family subject wed get along better once again the fray was on it raged intermittently throughout the evening it did not die out until bedtime put an end to it rouletta and her three companions were late in reaching town on the following day for they awakened to find a storm raging and in consequence the trails were heavy out of this white smother they plodded just as the lights of dawson were beginning to gleam leaving the men at the barracks the girl proceeded to her hotel she had changed out of her trail clothes and was upon the point of hurrying downtown to her work when she encountered hilda courteau where in the world have you been the latter inquired nowhere in the world rouletta smiled ive been quite out of it then she told of her and poleons trip to the mines and of their success pierce will be at liberty inside of an hour she declared well ive learned the truth rouletta started eagerly she clutched at the elder woman what you mean yes i wrung it out of courteau he confessed it was a frameup a plot oh my dear exactly but dont get hysterical im the one to do that what a night what a day ive put in the speaker shuddered and rouletta noticed for the first time how pale how ill she looked then pierce is free already hes out not yet ill tell you everything if youll promise not to breathe a word not to interfere until henri has a chance to square himself i think ive earned the right to demand that much i told you the whole thing was counterfeit was the work of joe mccaskey i couldnt believe henri was up to such villainy hes dissolute weak vain anything you choose but hes not voluntarily criminal well i went to work on him i pretended to the countess again shivered with disgust oh you saw what i was doing i hated myself but there was no choice things came to a climax last night i dont like to talk about it think about it but youre bound to hear i consented to go out with him he dragged me through the dancehalls and the saloons made me drink with him publicly and with the scum of the town noting the expression on her hearers face the countess laughed shortly mirthlessly shocking wasnt it low indecent wretched thats what everybody is saying dawson is humming with it god how he humiliated me but i loosened his tongue i got most of the details not all but enough it was late almost daylight before i succeeded he slept all day stupefied and so did i when i wasnt too ill he remembered something about it he had some shadowy recollection of talking too much when he woke up he sent for me then we had it he denied everything of course he lied and he twisted but im the stronger always have been i beat him down as usual i could have felt sorry for the poor wretch only for what he had put me through he went out not long ago where to tell me to the police to colonel cavendish i gave him the chance to make a clean breast of everything and save his hide if possible if he weakens ill take the bit in my teeth rouletta stood motionless for a moment then in deep emotion she exclaimed im so glad and yet it must have been a terrible sacrifice i think i understand how you must loathe yourself it was a very generous thing to do however not many women could have risen to it i hope he doesnt make me tell i havent much pride left but id like to save what remains for you can imagine what cavendish will think a wife betraying her husband for her for another man what a story for those women on the hill impulsively rouletta bent forward and kissed the speaker colonel cavendish will understand hes a man of honor but after all when a woman really cares theres a satisfaction a compensation in sacrifice no matter how great hilda courteaus eyes were misty their darkfringed lids trembled wearily shut yes she nodded i suppose so bitter and sweet when a woman of my sort my age and experience lets herself really care she tastes both all i can hope is that pierce never learns what he made me pay for loving him he wouldnt understandyet she opened her eyes again and met the earnest gaze bent upon her i dare say you think i feel the same toward him as you do that i want him that im hungry for him well im not im way past that ive been through fire and fire purifies now run along child im sure everything will come out right the earlier snowfall had diminished when rouletta stepped out into the night but a gusty boisterous wind had risen and this filled the air with blinding clouds of fine hard particles whirled up from the streets and the girl was forced to wade through newly formed drifts that rose over the sidewalks in places nearly to her knees the wind flapped her garments and cut her bare cheeks like a knife when she pushed her way into the rialto and stamped the snow from her feet her face was wet with tears but they were frost tears she dried them quickly and with a song in her heart she hurried back to the lunchcounter and climbed upon her favorite stool there it was that doret and his two elderly companions found her well we sprung him tom announced all we done was sign on the dotted line jerry explained but say if that boy hops out of town hell cost us a lot of money hows he going to hop out tom demanded thats the hell of this country theres no getting away jerry snorted derisively no gettin away what are you talkin about aint the boundary within ninety miles aint plenty of people made getaways all they need is a dogteam and a few hours start of the police everytings all fix poleon told his sister i had talk wit pierce he aint comin back here no more not coming back the girl exclaimed doret met her startled gaze not in dis kin of place hes cut em out for good i mak him promise a touch of jail aint a bad thing for a harumscarum kid tom volunteered as he finished giving his supper order its a cold compress takes down the fever nothing of the sort jerry asserted jails is a total waste of time i dont believe in em you think this boys tamed do you well i talked with him an all i got to say is this keep courteau away from him or theres one count youll lose count of the boys got pizen in him an i dont blame him none if i was him id make that frog hop you hear me poleon met roulettas worried glance with a reassuring smile i been tinkin bout dat too wat you say i go pardners wit him eh i got dogteam an fine claim on hilltop spose i geeve him halfinteres to go wit me will you eagerly queried the girl already i spoke it to him he say mebbe so but firs hes got lil biznesse here of course his case but that will be cleared up mark what i say yes rouletta nodded happily take him with you poleon out where things are clean and healthy and where he can get a new start oh you make me very happy the woodsman laid a big hand gently over hers in a low voice he murmured dats all i want ma soeur to mak you happy if dat claim is wort million dollar it aint too much to pay but im scare shes noder bum the song was still sounding in roulettas heart when she sat down at the farotable and all through the evening it seemed to her that the revelry round about was but an echo of her gladness pierce was free his name was clean probably ere this the whole truth was known to the mounted police and by tomorrow it would be made public moreover he and poleon were to be partners that generous woodsman because of his affection for her proposed to take the young fellow into his heart and make a man of him that was like him always giving much and taking little well she was poleons sister who could tell what might result from this new union of interests of course there was no pay out there on that mountaincrest but hard work honest poverty an end of these demoralizing surroundings were bound to affect pierce only for the better rouletta blessed the name of hilda courteau who had made this possible and of poleon doret too poleon of the great heart who loved her so sincerely so unselfishly he never failed her he was a brother truly the best the cheeriest the most loyal in the world rouletta was amazed to realize what a part in her life the french canadian had played his sincere affection was about the biggest thing that had come to her so it seemed occupied with such comforting thoughts rouletta failed to note that the evening had passed more quickly than usual and that it was after midnight when she did realize that fact she wondered what could have detained lucky broad promptness was a habit with him he and bridges usually reported at least a halfhour ahead of time she caught sight of the pair finally through the wide archway and saw that they were surrounded by an excited crowd a crowd that grew swiftly as some whisper some intelligence spread with electric rapidity through the barroom yielding to a premonition that something was amiss rouletta asked the lookout to relieve her and rising she hurried into the other hall even before she had come within sound of luckys voice the cause of the general excitement was made known to her it came in the form of an exclamation a word or two snatched out of the air courteau dead shot back street body just found fiercely rouletta fought her way through the press an unvoiced question trembling upon her lips broad turned at her first touch tough aint it said he me and the kid stumbled right over him kicked him out of the snow we thought hed been froze we never dreamed hed been shot till we got him clean down to the drugstore bridges supplemented shot in the back too questions were flying back and forth now profiting by the confusion rouletta dragged broad aside and queried breathlessly was he dead quite dead oh sure who shot him the question came with difficulty lucky stared at his interrogator queerly then he shrugged quien sabe nobody seen or heard the shooting hed been croaked a long while when we found him for a moment the two eyed each other silently do you think rouletta turned her white face toward the cashiers cage more n likely he was bitter he made a lot of cracks around the barracks the first thing the police said when we notified em was wheres phillips we didnt know the boy was out until that very minute or wed a done different wed a left the count in the drift and run phillips down and framed an alibi think of us his pals turnin up the evidence lucky breathed an oath oh why moaned the girl he it was so useless everything was all right perhaps after all he didnt do it you know him as well as i do im hoping he had better sense but hes got a temper he was always talking about the disgrace has he gone cant you help him he might make the boundary broad shook his head no use its too late for that if hes still here me n the kid will do our best to swear him out of it rouletta swayed she groped blindly at the bar rail for support whereupon her companion cried in a low voice here brace up or youll tip it all off if he stands pat how they going to prove anything the counts been dead for hours he was all drifted broad was interrupted by the mocha kid who entered out of the night at that instant with the announcement well they got him rock found him and he denies it but theyve got him at the barracks puttin him through the third degree i dont mind sayin that frenchman needed croakin bad and theyd ought to give phillips a vote of thanks and a bronx tablet mochas words added to roulettas terror for it showed that other minds ran as did hers already it seemed to her pierce phillips had been adjudged guilty through the murk of fright of apprehension in which her thoughts were racing there came a name poleon doret here was deep trouble grave peril a threat to her newfound happiness poleon her brother would know what to do for his head was clear his judgment was unerring he never failed her blindly she ran for her wraps hurriedly she flung them on then plunged out into the night as she scurried through the street panicstricken beset one mans name was in her thoughts but anothers was upon her lips over and over she kept repeating poleon ohpoleon chapter xxvii the news of count courteaus death traveled fast poleon doret was not long in hearing of it and of course he went at once in search of rouletta by the time he found her the girls momentary panic had been succeeded by a quite unnatural selfpossession her perturbation had changed to an intense but governable agitation and her mind was working with a clarity and a rapidity more than normal this power of rising to an emergency she had doubtless inherited from her father onearmed kirby had been a man of resource and so long as he remained sober he had never lost his head swiftly the girl told of the instant suspicion that had attached to phillips and of his prompt apprehension who done dat shootin if he dont doret inquired quickly joe mccaskey or frank rouletta answered with positiveness poleon started through the gloom he stared incredulously at the speaker im sure of it now that ive had time to think the girl declared thats why i ran for you now listen i promised not to tell this but i must courteau confessed to his wife that he and the mccaskeys trumped up that charge against pierce they paid courteau well for his part or they promised to and he perjured himself as did they hilda got the truth out of him while he was drunk of course he denied it later but she broke him down and this evening just before we got home he promised to go to colonel cavendish and make a clean breast of everything he went out for that purpose but evidently he lacked courage to go through with it otherwise how did he come to be on the back streets the mccaskeys live somewhere back yonder dont they sure poleon meditated briefly mebbe so youre right he said finally i know im right rouletta cried the first thing to do is find them where are they i don see em no place then we must tell the colonel to look them up but dorets brows remained puckered in thought wait he exclaimed i got idea of my own if dem feller kill courteau dey aint nowheres roun here dey beat it firs ting to hunker perhaps no for de bounry poleon slapped his thigh in sudden enlightenment by golly dats why i don see em no place you stay here i mak sure he turned and strode away but rouletta followed at his heels im going too she stoutly asserted dont argue ill bet ten to one we find their cabin empty together they made their way rapidly out of the brightly illuminated portion of the town and into the maze of blank warehouses and snowbanked cabins which lay behind at this hour of the night few lamps were burning even in private residences and inasmuch as these back streets were unlighted the travelers had to feel their way the wind was diminishing but even yet the air was thick with flying flakes and new drifts seriously impeded progress wading kneedeep in places stumbling in and out of cuts where the late snow had been removed clambering over treacherous slopes where other snows lay hard packed and slippery the two pursued their course poleon came to a pause at length in the shelter of a pole provisioncache and indistinctly took his bearings silently he pointed to the premises and vigorously nodded his head then he craned his neck for a view of the stovepipe overhead neither sparks nor smoke nor heat was rising from it after a cautious journey of exploration he returned to rouletta and spoke aloud dey gone sled dogs everting gone he pushed open the cache door and a moment later there came the sound of rending wood as he shouldered his way into the dark cabin regardless of lock and bar rouletta was close behind him when he struck a match and held it to a candle which he discovered fixed in its own wax beside the window curiously the interlopers surveyed the unfamiliar premises rouletta spoke first with suppressed excitement you were right and they left in a hurry too sure beddin gone an dey got plenty beddin on hunker here dey mak grubpack see poleon ran his finger through a white dust of flour which lay thick upon the table striding to the stove he laid his hand upon it he lifted the lid and felt of the ashes within dey lef bout five hour ago wal dats beeg start i guess mebbe dey safe enough dont say that rouletta implored rock can overtake them hes a famous traveler i dunno dey got good team he must catch them why he has ninety miles to do it in he must poleon he must of course this is evidence but it isnt proof remember pierce talked wildly people are prejudiced against him and you know the police they act on suspicion and circumstances are certainly strong poor boy if these men get away who knows what may happen to him i tell you his very life may be in danger for the law is an awful thing i ive always been afraid of it so was father to his dying day we must send rock flying yes and without a moments delay you still got deep feelin for dat feller poleon inquired gravely the quick look of anguish the frank nod of assent that he received were enough bien he said slowly i mak satisfy dats all i never see you so scare as dis you know how i feel rouletta said then more curiously why do you need to make sure do you think ive changed she hesitated for an instant there came a faint pucker of apprehension between her brows into her eyes crept a look of wonder which changed to astonishment then to incredulity fright oh h she exclaimed she raised a faltering hand to her lips as if to stay a further betrayal of the knowledge that had suddenly come to her oh poleon my dear my brother the man smiled painfully as he met her shocked gaze im fonny feller ma saeur always dreamin de mos foolish ting don pay notention i am i always will be that your sister have i made you unhappy vigorously he shook his head his face slowly cleared no no in dis life one ting is give me happiness one ting alone an dat is bring you joy now come de grass growin on our feet together and in silence they hurried back as they had come then on the plea that he could make better time alone poleon left his companion and headed for the barracks rouletta let him go without protest her heart was heavier than lead she could find no words whatever a new tragedy it seemed had risen to face her for she realized now that she had hurt the man who loved her best of all that certainty filled her with such regret such a feeling of guilt that she could not bear to think of it a very poignant sense of pain troubled her as she turned into the rialto and as a consequence the lively clatter of the place grated upon her sensibilities she felt a miserable sick desire to shut her ears to this sound of laughter which was like ribald applause for the deathblow she had dealt yes she had dealt a deathblow and to one most dear but how could she have known how could she have foreseen such a wretched complication as this who would have dreamed that gay careless laughing poleon doret was like other men rouletta felt the desire to bend her head and release those scalding tears that trembled on her lashes lieutenant rock was preparing for bed when poleon after some little difficulty forced his way in upon him the officer listened to his callers recital and even before it was finished he had begun to dress himself in his trail clothes courteau confessed eh and the mccaskeys have disappeared taken french leave say that changes the look of things for a fact of course they may have merely gone back to hunker in de middle of snowstorm dis tam de night no dey makin run for de line an its goin tak fas team for pull em down well ive got the best dogs in town rocks caller smiled msieu dey goin travel some if dey keep in sight of me you rock straightened himself will you go along jove id like that he cried heartily ive heard you own a lively bunch of mutts i give you tase of injun travel better you dress light an buckle up dat belt for i got reason to fin out who keel courteau i aint goin sleep no more till i know the officer smiled as he declared that suits me exactly we may not catch them but theyll know theyve been in a race before they thumb their noses at us from across the boundary now see how fast you can harness up it was considerably after midnight when poleon swung his dogteam into the lighted space in front of the rialto nevertheless many people were about for dawson was a city of sleephaters the sight of a racingteam equipped for a flying trip at this hour of the night evoked instant interest and speculation pointing as it did to a new gold discovery and a stampede stampedes were frequent they never failed to create a sensation therefore the woodsman was soon the center of an inquisitive crowd not until he had fully explained the nature of his business was suspicion allayed then his word that joe and frank mccaskey had fled for the boundary ran up and down the street and caused even greater excitement rouletta came hurrying forth with the others and to her poleon made known his intention of accompanying the fleetfooted rock nobody is able to catch dem feller but him an me he explained dey got too long start you think they may get across she queried apprehensively five six hour dats beeg edge but me the speaker shrugged forty mile circle fort yukon rampart it mak no differ i get em some place if i go plumb to st michaels when i get goin fas it tak me long tam for run down roulettas eyes opened but poleon you cant theres the boundary youre not an officer you have no warrant dem ting is dam nuisance he declared i don savvy dis law biznesse you say get em bien i do it rouletta stared curiously wonderingly into the big fellows face she was about to put her thoughts into words when a shout arose from the crowd as the police team streamed into view down the street it came at a great pace flashing through shadows and past glaring lighted fronts snatching the light hickory sled along behind as if it were a thing of paper rock balanced himself upon the runner heels until with a shout he put his weight upon the sharptoothed sled brake and came to a pause near poleon the rival teams plunged into their collars and set up a pandemonium of yelping but willing hands held them from flying at one anothers throats meanwhile saloon doors were opening the street was filling dancehall girls whiteaproned bartenders blearyeyed pedestrians nightowls all the queerly assorted devotees of dawsons vivid and roisterous nocturnal life hastened thither even the secondstory windows framed heads for this clamor put slumber to flight without delay the wind was no longer strong and already a clearing sky was evidenced by an occasional winking star nevertheless it was bitterly cold and those who were not heavily clad were forced to stamp their feet and to whip their arms in order to keep their blood in motion nothing is more exciting more ominous than a manhunt doubly portentous was this one the hasty preparations for which went forward in the dead of night dawson had seen the start of more than one race for the boundary and had awaited the outcome with breathless interest most of the fugitives overtaken had walked back into town spent famished frostblackened but there were some who had returned on their backs wrapped in robe or canvas and offering mute testimony to the speedy and relentless efficiency of the men from the barracks of that small picked corps lieutenant rock was by long odds the favorite now therefore he was the center of attention and wagers were laid that he would catch his men however rapidly they traveled however great their start only a few oldtimers sourdoughs from the distant reaches of the yukon knew poleon doret but those few drew close to him and gave the lieutenant little notice this french canadian they regarded as the most tireless traveler in all the north about him therefore they assembled and to him they addressed their questions and offered their advice the dogs were inspired now with the full intoxication of the chase they strained forward fretfully their gray plumes waving their tongues lolling their staccato chorus adding to the general disturbance when the word came to go they leaped into their harness and with a musical jingle of bells they swept down toward the river over the steep bank they poured and were gone a shout of encouragement followed rock as he was snapped into the blackness then noisily the crowd bolted for the warm interiors behind them rouletta was slow in leaving for some time she stood harkening to the swift diminuendo of those tinkling sleighbells staring into the night as if to fix in her minds eye the picture of what she had last seen the picture of a mighty man riding the rail of a plunging basket sled in spite of the biting cold he was stripped down a thin drill parka sufficed to break the temper of the wind light fur boots were upon his feet the cheek pieces of his otter cap were tied above his crown he had turned to wave at her and to shout a word of encouragement just before he vanished that was like him she told herself eager to spare her even the pain of undue apprehension the shock of her discovery of an hour ago was still too fresh in roulettas memory it was still too new and too agitating to permit of orderly thought yet there it stood stark and dismaying this woodsman loved her no longer as a sister but as the one woman of his choice as yet she could not reconcile herself to such a state of affairs her attempts to do so filled her with mixed emotions poor poleon why had this come to him roulettas throat swelled tears not of the wind or the cold stood in her eyes once again an aching tenderness and pity welled up from her heart she became conscious finally that her body was growing numb so she bestirred herself she had taken but a step or two however when some movement in the shadows close at hand arrested her peering into the gloom she discovered a figure it was laure the girl wore some sort of wrap evidently snatched at random but under it she was clad in her dancehall finery and she too was all but frozen rouletta was about to move on when the other addressed her through teeth that clicked like castanets i got here late is it true have they gone after joe and frank yes what happened i i havent heard dont they think pierce did it you know he didnt do it rouletta cried neither did he steal courteaus money what do you mean i know laures voice was harsh imperative she clutched at the other girl then as rouletta hesitated she regained control of herself and ran on in a tone bitterly resentful oh youd like to get him out of it save him for yourself wouldnt you but you cant you cant have him i wont let you my god letty hes the only thing i ever cared for i never had even a dog or a cat or a canary of my own think a little bit of me almost dazed by this mingled accusation and appeal rouletta at length responded by a question then why havent you done something to clear him laure drew her flimsy wrap closer she was shaking wretchedly when she spoke her words were spilled from her lips as if by the tremors of her body i could help i would but you shant have him nobody shall id rather see him dead id no no i dont know what im saying id sooner die than hurt him id do my bit only mccaskeyd kill me say will rock get him dyou think i hear he gets his man every time but joes different hes not the ordinary kind hes got the devil in him frank hes a dog but joell fight hell kill at the drop of the hat so will rock i suppose maybe hell kill them both eh or maybe theyll kill him and get away i dont care which way it goes dont talk like that rouletta exclaimed i mean it laure ran on crazily yes joed kill anybody that stood in his way or doublecrossed him i guess i know why he told me so himself and courteau knew it perfectly well the poor fool but look at him now he got his didnt he rouletta laid a cold hand upon the shivering distracted creature before her sternly she said i believe you know who committed that murder you act as if you did im a ggood guesser but i can keep my mouth shut i know when im well off thats more than the count knew and you probably know something about his robbery too i mean that goldsack laure cast off the hand that rested upon her she looked up quickly if i did dyou think id tell you well hardly but i dont i dont know anything except that pierce is a thief he stole and gave me the money he did that regularly and thats more than hed do for you you may as well know the truth cavendish knows it you think hes too good for me dont you well he isnt and youre no better than i am either for that matter youve got a nerve to put on airs god how i hate you and your superior ways never mind me i want to know who killed count courteau all right wait till rock comes back and ask him he thinks hell find out but well see joe mccaskeyll be over the line and away thank heaven if anything happens and they should overtake him well hell fight hell never come in alive never turning the speaker stumbled toward the lights of the saloon and as she went rouletta heard her mutter again hell never come in alive never thank god for that chapter xxviii from dawson city the yukon flows in a northwesterly direction toward the international boundary and although the camp is scarcely more than fifty miles due east of american territory by the river it is ninety since the yukon is the main artery of travel both winter and summer there being no roads or trails it behooved those malefactors who fled the wrath of the northwest mounted police to obtain a liberal start for ninety miles of dead flat going is no easy run and the police teams were fleet of foot time was when evildoers had undertaken to escape upriver or to lose themselves in the hills to the northward but this was a desperate adventure at best and had issued in such uniform disaster as to discourage its practice the police had won the reputation of never leaving a trail and in consequence none but madmen longer risked anything except a dash for american soil and even then only with a substantial margin of time in their favor but the winter winds are moody the temper of the arctic is uncertain hence luck played a large part in these enterprises both rock and doret were sufficiently familiar with the hazards and the disappointments of travel at this time of year to feel extremely doubtful of overhauling the two mccaskeys and so they were by no means sanguine of success as they drove headlong into the night both teams were loaded light neither driver carried stove tent or camp duffle sleepingbags a little cooked food for themselves a bundle of dried fish for the dogs that was the limit the pursuers had allowed themselves given good weather nothing more was needed in case of a storm a sudden blizzard and a drop in temperature this lack of equipment was apt to prove fatal but neither traveler permitted himself to think about such things burdened thus lightly the sleds rode high and the malamutes romped along with them when the late dawn finally came it found them far on their way that wind following the snowfall of the day before had been a happy circumstance for in many places it had blown the trail clean so that daylight showed it winding away into the distance like a thread laid down at random here and there of course it was hidden under the lee of bluffs or of wooded bends for instance it was drifted deep completely obliterated in fact and in such places even a seasoned musher would have floundered aimlessly trying to hold it but poleon doret possessed a sixth sense it appeared and his lead dog too had unusual sagacity rock from his position in the rear marveled at the accuracy with which the woodsmans sled followed the narrow hardpacked ridge concealed beneath the soft new covering undoubtedly the fellow knew his business and the officer congratulated himself upon bringing him along they had been under way for five or six hours when the tardy daylight came but even thereafter doret continued to run with his hand upon his sled seldom did he ride and then only for a moment or two when the going was best for the most part he maintained a steady swinging trot that kept pace with the pattering feet ahead of him and caused the miles rapidly to drop behind through drifts kneedeep through long soft stretches he held to that unfaltering stride occasionally he turned his head and flashed a smile or waved his hand at the man behind along about ten oclock he halted his team where a dead spruce overhung the riverbank by the time rock had pulled in behind him he had clambered up the bank ax in hand and was making the chips fly he sent the dry top crashing down then explained dem dogs go better for lil rest we boil de kettle eh rock wiped the sweat from his face youre certainly hitting it off old man weve made good time but i havent seen any tracks have you we see em bimeby kind of a joke if they hadnt come after all if theyd really gone out to hunker gee the laugh would be on us dey come dis way poleon stoutly maintained soon a blaze was going then while the ice in the blackened teabucket was melting the drivers sliced a slab of bacon into small cubes and fed it sparingly to their animals after which they carefully examined the dogs feet and cleaned them of ice and snow pellets the tea was gulped the hardtack swallowed and the travelers were under way again almost before their sweaty bodies had begun to chill on they hurried mile after mile sweeping past bends eagerly hopefully scanning every empty tangent that opened up ahead of them they made fast time indeed but the immensity of the desolation through which they passed the tremendous scale upon which this country had been molded made their progress seem slower than an antcrawl eventually poleon shouted something and pointed to the trail underfoot rock fancied he could detect the faint fresh markings of sled runners but into them he could not read much significance it was an encouragement to be sure but nevertheless he still had doubts and those doubts were not dispelled until doret again halted his team this time beside the cold embers of a fire fresh chips were scattered under the bank charred fagots had embedded themselves in the ice and were frozen fast but poleon interpreted the various signs without difficulty here dey mak breakfas bout daylight said he dey go slower as us but theyre going pretty fast for all that well never get them this side of forty mile you don spec it do you dey got beeg scare dem feller dey runnin so fas dey can forty mile so called because the river of that name enters the yukon forty miles above the boundary was a considerable camp prior to the dawson boom but thereafter it had languished and this winter it was all but deserted so too was cudahy the rival tradingpost a halfmile below it was on the bars of this stream that the earliest pioneers had first found gold here at its mouth during the famine days before the steamboats came they had cached their supplies here they had brewed their hootch in the fall and held high carnival to celebrate their good luck or to drown their illfortune rock and his companion pulled up the bank and in among the windowless cabins during the afternoon they had halted their dogs before the mounted police station only to find the building locked and cold the few faithful fortymilers who came out to exchange greetings explained that both occupants of the barracks had gone downriver to succor some sick indians rock was disgusted but his next question elicited information that cheered him yes a pair of strangers had just passed through one of them an active heavyset fellow the other a tall dark sinister man with black eyes and a stormy demeanor they had come fast and they had tarried only long enough to feed their dogs and to make some inquiries upon learning that the local police were on the main river somewhere below they had held a consultation and then had headed up the forty mile up forty mile rock cried in surprise are you sure we seen em go his informant declared thats what made us think there was something wrong thats why we been on the lookout for you we figgered they was on the dodge and hard pressed but we couldnt do nothing about it you see its only about twentythree miles to the line up forty mile down the yukon its forty they been gone most two hours now what do you want em for another bystander inquired murder rock exclaimed shortly then he heaved his sled into motion once more for poleon had started his team and was making off through the town down into the bed of the smaller stream the pursuers made their way and up this they turned again they urged their dogs into a run it took some effort to maintain a galloping pace now for the teams were tiring and after some mental calculations rock shook his head doubtfully of course his quarry was at a disadvantage there being two men to one sled but twentythree miles with a twohour start it was altogether too great a handicap the lieutenant had figured on that last forty miles the last five or ten in fact but this change of direction had upset all his plans and his estimates evidently the mccaskeys cared not how nor where they crossed the line so long as they crossed it quickly and got canadian territory behind them barring accident therefore which was extremely unlikely rock told himself regretfully that they were as good as gone two hours it was too much on the other hand he and poleon now had a fresh trail to follow while the fleeing brothers had unbroken snow ahead of them and that meant that they must take turns ahead of their dogs then too fifty miles over drifted trails at this season of the year was a heavy days work and the mccaskeys must be very tired by now for neither was in the best of condition in the spring when the snows were wet and sled runners ran as if upon grease such a journey would have been no great effort but in this temperature the steel shoes creaked and a mans muscles did not work freely men had been known to play out unexpectedly after all there was a possibility of pulling them down and as long as there was that possibility the mounted policeman refused to quit rock assured himself that this flight had established one thing at least and that was pierce phillips innocence of the courteau killing the murderers were here there could be no doubt of it their frantic haste confessed their guilt friendship for the boy pride in his own reputation the memory of that ovation he had received upon leaving gave the officer new strength and determination so he shut his teeth and spurred his rebellious limbs into swifter action there was no longer any opportunity of riding the sled even where the trail was hard for some of the police dogs were limping and loafing in their collars this was indeed a race a marathon a twentythreemile test of courage and endurance and victory would go to him who could call into fullest response his last uttermost ounce of reserve power doret had promised that he would show his trailmate how to travel and that promise he had made good all day he had held the lead and without assistance from the lash even now his dogs while not fresh were far from exhausted as for the man himself rock began to feel a conviction that the fellow could go on at this rate eternally luck finally seemed to break in favor of the pursuers accident appeared to work in their behalf the day was done night was again upon them when doret sent back a cry of warning and leaping upon his sled turned his leader at right angles toward the bank his companion understood the meaning of that move but the police team was less responsive to command and before rock could swing them he felt his feet sink into soft slush dam overflow doret panted when the two teams were safely out upon the bank you wet your feet eh apprehensively the officer felt of his moccasins they were wet to the touch but as yet no moisture had penetrated his socks you yelled in the nick of time he declared as he dried his soles in the loose snow dem feller got in it ankledeep i bet we fin campfire soon this prediction came true as the travelers rounded the next bluff they smelled the odor of burning spruce and came upon a trampled bed of boughs beside which some embers were still smoldering jove that gives us a chance doesnt it rock panted his companion smiled we goin start travel now for sure dey cant be more n a mile or two ahead down upon the riverbed the teams rushed with biting lash and sharp commands the drivers urged them into a swifter run rock was forcing his dogs now he made the smoke fly from their hides when they lagged he vowed that he would not permit this french canadian to outdistance him he swore a good deal at his malamutes he cursed himself as a weakling a quitter anger at his fatigue ran through him the travelers were up among the hills by now occasionally they passed a deserted cabin home of some early golddigger valleys dark with night opened up to right and to left as the forty mile wound higher deeper into the maze of rounded domes the boundary was close at hand the hillsides hid their feet in black thickets of spruce but their slopes were thinly timbered their crests were nearly bare and the white snow gave off a dim radiance that made traveling possible even after the twilight had deepened by and by it grew lighter and the north horizon took on a rosy flush that spread into a tremendous flare the night was still clear crackly it was surcharged with some static force and so calm was the air so deathlike the hush that the empty valley rang like a bell that mysterious illumination in the north grew more and more impressive great ribbons long pathways of quivering light unrolled themselves and streamed across the sky they flamed and flickered they writhed and melted disappearing reappearing rising falling it was as if the lid had been lifted from some stupendous caldron and the heavens reflected the radiance from its whitehot contents mighty fingers like the beams of polar searchlights groped through the voids overhead tumbling waves of color rushed up and dashed themselves away into space the whole arch of the night was lit as from a world in flames red yellow orange violet ultraviolet the tints merged with one another bewilderingly and the snows threw back their flicker until coarse print would have been readable against that war of clashing colors the mountaincrests stood out in silhouette and the fringe of lonely windtwisted trunks high up on their saddles were etched in blackest ink it was a weird an unearthly effect it was exciting too as always when the aurora is in full play the onlookers marveled that such a tremendous exhibition of energy could continue in such silence that was the oddest the most impressive feature of all for the crash of avalanches the rumble of thunder the diapason of a hundred niagaras should have accompanied such appalling phenomena it seemed odd indeed that the whine of sled runners the scuff of moccasins the panting of dogs should be the only audible sounds there were other overflows underfoot now but the cold had frozen them and the going was getting constantly better the snow was thin and in places the sleds slewed sidewise and the dogs ran on slack traces across long stretches of bare glare ice it was while negotiating such a place as this that rock paid the price of his earlier carelessness dorets dry mooseskin soles had a sure grip hence he never hesitated but the lieutenants moccasins were like a pair of tin shoes now and without warning he lost his footing he was running swiftly at the moment he strove to save himself to twist in midair but he failed poleon heard a cry of pain and dismay so he halted his team and came striding back rock raised himself then took a step but faltered and clung helplessly to the handlebars he began to curse furiously he undertook to estimate the extent of his injury then explained my foot doubled under me and i came down on it like a ton of bricks by heavens i believe something broke poleon was solicitous he blamed himself too its dem wet moccasin i should have stop an mak you change said he we cant stop rock groaned ill be all right as soon as the words ended in another explosive oath as he again put his weight upon the injured member blasphemy poured from his lips as repeatedly he tried to force his foot to carry him he cursed himself for a clumsy blundering ass he shouted at his dogs he sent his sled forward and lurched along behind it half supporting himself until poleon finally halted him its no good mak bad ting worse msieu the woodsman declared you bus him for sure an its no use goin furder spose mebbe we boil de kettle eh and let them get away clean when we had em they cant be a mile ahead let em slip between our fingers raved the officer i cant i wont we mak lil fire an look him over dat foot me i tink you don walk no more for two free week you go ill deputize you get em doret quick you can do it ill wait go ahead the other nodded sure i can get em i never have no doubt bout dat in de least but its better we fix you comforble theyll be across i tell you over the line i came pas dat place more n once or twice the french canadian grinned an i never seen it no line he forced his companion to lower himself upon the sled then swung it toward the riverbank calling upon his own lead dog to follow up and into the shelter of the spruce he drove the police team quickly he felled dry wood and kindled a fire this took but a few moments but rock was wet with sweat and in consequence he was shivering wretchedly his teeth were chattering even before the blaze had taken hold poleon continued to work with what speed he could and in a surprisingly short time he had built a snug wickiup and filled it with boughs this done he unhitched and fed both teams spread rocks sleepingbag under the shelter and set a pail of snow to melt by the light of the fire he examined the latters injury but could make little of it for already it was badly swollen and every manipulation caused its owner extreme pain there were no remedies available there was not even a vessel of sufficient size in which to bathe the foot hence poleon contented himself by bandaging it and helping his trailmate into bed not since leaving dawson had either man tasted hot food but their hunger was as nothing to their thirst even in this length of time their bodies had shrunk withered inside their clothing and for perhaps an hour they took turns greedily draining the pail of its tepid contents under intense cold the human body consumes itself at a rapid rate once it has burned itself out it preys upon those deephidden forces which nature holds in reserve and the process of recuperation waits upon a restoration of a normal balance of moisture both men were weighed down by an aching nightmare fatigue and as they sat gulping hot water absorbing heat from within and without their muscles set and they felt as if their limbs had turned to stone but once the first mad craving for drink had been assuaged they fried bacon and made tea like wolves they fell upon the salt meat they dipped the hot grease up in their spoons and swallowed it with relish they crunched their hardtack and washed the powdery mouthfuls down with copious draughts from the blackened pail when the tea was gone they brewed another scalding bucketful rock lay back finally but the movement caused him to bare his teeth in agony at poleons quick inquiry he shook his head im all right he declared good for the night you can pull out any time you want to deres plenty tam poleon lit his pipe and reached again for the teabucket better go before you stiffen up i go bimeby sooner i get lil drinkin done theyll fight rock announced after a silence of perhaps five minutes i feel pretty rotten playing out like this you done firs rate the woodsman told him if i come alone i catch em ten mile below but lil tam more less don mak no differ i believe you would have got em the officer acknowledged after a time he persisted theyll put up a battle doret youll need to be careful poleon was squatted indian fashion over the blaze he was staring fixedly into the flames and an aboriginal reticence had settled upon him after a long time he answered mebbe so i keel de beeg feller i dunno so long one is lef i mak him clear dat boy phillips decent of you to take a chance like that for pierce rock resumed its different with me i have to do it just the same i wouldnt care to follow those fellows over the boundary i dont think youd better try it in spite of his suffering the lieutenant fell into a doze whether he slept ten minutes or an hour he never knew but he awoke groaning to find the big woodsman still bulked over the campfire still smoking still sipping tea rock ate and drank some more again he slept for a second time his pain roused him and once more he marveled to discover poleon occupied as before it seemed to him that the fellow would never satisfy himself eventually however the latter arose and made preparations to leave the northern lights had flickered out now the empty sky was sprinkled with a million stars which glittered like scintillating frost jewels frozen into the dome of heaven there were no sounds whatever to break the deathlike silence of the night for the arctic wastes are all but lifeless there were no birdcalls no sounds of insects not even the whisper of running water for the river was locked deep beneath its icy armor you got nough wood to las long tam poleon declared if i don come back dem forty mile police is sure to pick you up i can go in alone if i have to the injured man declared au revoir and good luck poleon made no attempt to hurry his tired team for several miles he plodded along behind them guiding them to right or left by a lowspoken word years before he had rocked on the bars of this stream therefore its landmarks were familiar to him and in spite of the darkness he readily identified them in time he made out the monuments marking the international boundary and a short distance beyond that point he unhitched his dogs then took a carbine from his sled and slipped it full of shells next he removed his lash rope coiled it and placed it in his pocket after which he resumed his journey alone occasionally he dimly glimpsed deserted cabins habitations built by the golddiggers of other days carefully he followed the all but indistinguishable sled tracks ahead of him until they swerved abruptly in toward the bank here he paused pulled a mitten and moistening a finger held it up to test the wind what movement there was to the air seemed to satisfy him for step by step he mounted the steep slope until his head finally rose over its crest against the skyline he now made out a small clearing straining his eyes he could see the black square of a cabin wall no light shone from it therefore he argued that his men had supped and were asleep he had assumed that they would not could not go far beyond the boundary he had purposely allowed them sufficient time in which to overcome the first agony of fatigue and to fall asleep he wondered apprehensively where they had put their dogs and if by any evil chance the mccaskey team included an outside dog of the watchful barking variety gingerly he stepped out and found that the snow underfoot gave off only the faintest whisper like a shadow he stole closer to the hut keeping the imperceptible night breeze in his face so noiseless was his approach that the tired dogs snugly curled each in its own deep bed of snow did not hear him your malamutes that are broken to harness are bad watchdogs at best not until he had melted into the gloom beneath the wide overhang above the cabin door did the first disturbance come then something started into life and the silence was broken poleon saw that a canvas sledcover had been used to curtain the door opening and during the instant following the alarm he brushed the tarpaulin aside and stepped into the pitchblack interior it had been a swift maneuver the result of a lightninglike decision and not so reckless as it appeared he stood now with his back to the rough log wall every muscle in his body taut his ears strained for some sound some challenge he had been prepared for a shot out of the darkness but nothing came his lungs were filling with the first deep breath of relief when a sleepy voice spoke that you frank poleon remained fixed in his tracks frank there was a moments pause then frank followed a rustle as of a body turning then a startled mumble in answer was that you joe mccaskeys voice again demanded me what was you outside outside i heard the dogs rowing theyre stirring now hear em ill swear i saw that fly drop mccaskeys words died out and again the interior of the cabin became soundless whos there the former speaker suddenly barked when another moment had dragged by a sulphur match was struck for a second or two it shed a sickly blue radiance sufficient only to silhouette a pair of hands cupped over it then as the flame ignited the tiny shaft it burst into a yellow glow and sent the shadows of the cabin leaping joe mccaskey uttered a cry a scream the flame was crushed in his palms and again the cabin was ink black it remained as silent as before except for a dry rattling of breath in the elder brothers throat wha whatd you see the younger one gasped both men were now fully awake but disregarding the question joe cried wildly who are you what dyou want and then when no answer came christ say something poleon could hear the wretch moisten his dry lips he could picture both men sitting bolt upright in their sleepingbags he could feel the terror that was creeping over them whod you see frank whispered again ssomething big right there by god somethings in here joes tone was firmer now nevertheless fright still held him motionless paralyzed he was staring with blind eyes into the velvet blackness and his flesh was rippling with a superstitious horror of that formless creature he had glimpsed what was it that had walked in out of the night and now crouched ready to spring nothing human nothing natural that was sure similar thoughts raced madly through his brothers brain and the latter let forth a thin wail almost a sob the sound set joe into motion swiftly but clumsily he fumbled through the dry grass with which his bunk was filled he uttered a throaty curse for he had laid his revolver by his side right where his hand would fall upon it where was the thing joes body turned rigid his shaking fingers grew stiff and useless when out of the darkness came a sigh faint but unmistakable whence it issued neither brother could tell with another shriek frank fell back and burrowed into his sleepingbag chapter xxix rouletta kirby spent an anxious and a thoughtful night the more she dwelt upon laures peculiar behavior the more it roused her suspicions and the more she felt justified in seeking an interview with colonel cavendish she rose early therefore and went to police headquarters two people were in the office when she entered one a redcoat evidently acting in some clerical capacity the other a girl whom rouletta had never seen the colonel was engaged so rouletta was told and she sat down to wait with furtive curiosity she began to study this other young woman it was plain that the latter was a privileged person for she made herself perfectly at home and appeared to be not in the least chilled by the official formality of her surroundings she wandered restlessly about the room humming a tune under her breath she readjusted the windowcurtains to her liking she idly thumbed the books upon the shelves finally she perched herself upon the table in the midst of the documents upon which the officer was engaged and began a lowvoiced conversation with him rouletta was not a little impressed by this stranger she had never seen a finer healthier cleanercut girl here for once was a nice woman of the town who did not stare at her with open and offensive curiosity she was not surprised when she overheard the police officer address her as miss cavendish no wonder this girl had poise and breeding the cavendishes were the best people in the community with a jealous pang the caller reflected that the colonels daughter was very much what she herself would like to be very much her ideal so far as she could judge when eventually the commandant himself emerged from his sanctum he paused for a moment at his daughters side then he approached rouletta very briefly the latter made known the reason of her presence and the colonel nodded you did quite right in coming here he declared and im sure this dancehall girl knows more than she has told in fact i was on the point of sending for her please wait until she arrives perhaps we can straighten out this whole unpleasant affair informally ill need phillips too meanwhile theres a friend of yours inside stepping to the inner door he spoke to some one and an instant later the countess courteau came forth rouletta had not seen the countess alone since early the previous evening she went swiftly to her now and placed an arm about her shoulders hilda responded to this mark of sympathy with a weary smile well i had to go through with it to the bitter end she said in a low voice henri didnt spare me even that rouletta pressed her closer murmuring colonel cavendish is a fine man im sure he understands youve undergone a dreadful ordeal but its nearly over hes sending for laure now she can tell a good deal if she will about the theft yes but what about the murder joe mccaskey did it theres no doubt about that henri weakened after i gave him his chance he got to drinking i hear and evidently he conceived the notion of telling those men he may have gone to warn them to appeal to them i dont know then they must have quarreled its all clear enough when you understand the inside facts without knowing them it was natural to suspect pierce soi did what i had to do i doubt if laure knows anything about this part of the affair the two women were still talking when laure entered in company with the mounted police officer who had been sent to fetch her at sight of them she halted a sudden pallor came into her cheeks she cast a glance of alarm about her as if seeking retreat but colonel cavendish grimly invited her to follow him and stepped into his private office the newcomer faltered then with a defiant toss of her head and with lips curled in disdain she obeyed the door closed behind her rouletta and the countess courteau fell silent now they found nothing to talk about and in spite of themselves they strained their ears for some sound from the other room even miss cavendish seemed vaguely to feel the suspense for she finally took her stand beside a frostrimed window and engaged herself in tracing patterns thereon with the tip of her finger an occasional stormy murmur of voices deadened by the thick log partition indicated that laure and her inquisitor were not getting on well together suddenly the girl at the window started her apathy vanished her expression of boredom gave place to one of such lively anticipation as to draw the attention of the two other women a magic change came over her she became suddenly animated alive atingle in every nerve her eyes sparkled and a new color flooded her cheeks the alteration interested her observers they were mystified as to its cause until a quick step sounded in the entry and the door opened to admit pierce phillips it was natural that he should first see miss cavendish and that he should greet her before recognizing the other occupants of the room it was natural too that he should be a trifle nonplussed at finding hilda here nevertheless he managed to cover his lack of ease not so however when a moment later the door to colonel cavendishs office opened and laure of all persons appeared therein quickly pierce inferred the reason for his summons but happily for him he was spared further embarrassment cavendish called to him took him by the hand in the friendliest manner and again disappeared into his retreat drawing the young man with him brief as had been the interruption both hilda and rouletta had gathered much from it their inference was borne out when laure paused before them and in a voice subdued by the very force of her agitation exclaimed well i hope youre satisfied i got it and got it good her face was livid her dark eyes were blazing wrathfully she outthrust a shaking hand and unclenched her fingers displaying therein a crumpled sheet of pink paper a printed official form the telltale tint of which indicated its fateful character both of her hearers were familiar with the socalled pink tickets of the mounted police every one in the northwest territory in fact knew what they were deportation orders but in a tone hoarse and suppressed laure read leave by the first safe conveyance thats what it says the first safe conveyance i suppose youd like it better if it were a blue ticket and i had to leave in twentyfour hours you put it over but i wont forget ill get even with you we had nothing to do with that the countess declared quietly im sorry you take it so hard but it serves you right who wouldnt take it hard to be expelled fired out like a thief a the girls voice broke then she pulled herself together and uttered a quavering artificial laugh she tossed her head again with an obvious attempt at defiance oh it takes more than a pink ticket to down me anyhow im sick of this place sick of the people i hate them with a vicious fling of her shoulders she swept on to a seat as far from them as possible and sank into it so the girl had confessed hilda reflected she was glad for pierces sake that this miserable complication was in process of clearing up and that he would be finally and completely exonerated she was glad too that her efforts in his behalf her humiliation had borne fruit he would never know how high he had made her pay but that was all right she felt very gently toward him at this moment and experienced a certain wistful desire that he might understand how unselfish had been her part it might make a difference probably it would things now were not as they had been she was a free woman this thought obtruded itself insistently into the midst of her meditations yes courteau was gone there was no reason now why she could not look any man honestly in the eye of course there was the same disparity in years between her and pierce which she had recognized from the beginning but after all was that necessarily fatal he had loved her genuinely enough at one time hilda recalled that windy night on the shores of linderman when the whimper of a rising storm came out of the darkness when the treetops tossed their branches to the sky and when her own soul had broken its fetters and defied restraint she thrilled at memory of those strong young arms about her those hot lips pressing hers that was a moment to remember always and those dreamy magic days that had followed the more delightful the more unreal because she had deliberately drugged her conscience then that night at white horse he had told her bitterly brokenheartedly that he could never forget perhaps even yet with an effort hilda courteau roused herself never forget why he had forgotten the very next day as was quite natural no she was a foolish sentimentalist and he well he was just one whom fate had cast for a lovers role one destined to excite affection in women good and bad some day he would find his mate and hilda believed she loved him well enough to rejoice in his happiness when it came there spoke the maternal instinct which phillips had the knack of rousing for want of something better she determined she would cherish that meanwhile laure sat in her corner her head bowed her very soul in revolt she was tasting failure disappointment balked desire and it was like gall in her mouth she could have cried out aloud in her rage she hated these other women whom she blamed for her undoing she hated cavendish pierce phillips herself it serves me right she told herself furiously i deserve the pink ticket for making a fool of myself yes a fool what has pierce ever done for me nothing and i before her minds eye came a vision of the opportunities she had let slip the chances she had ignored she knew full well that she could have had the pick of many men the newmade millionaires of dawson but instead she had chosen him and why merely because he had a way a smile a warm and pleasing personality some magnetic appeal too intangible to identify it was like her to make the wrong choice she always did she had come north with but one desire one determination namely to make money to reap to the full her share of this free harvest she had given up the life she liked the people she knew the comforts she craved for that and for nothing else and what a mess she had made of the venture other girls not half so smart not half so pretty as she had feathered their nests right here before her eyes while she was wasting her time they had kept their heads and they would go out in the spring first class with good clothes and a bankroll in the pursers safe some of them were married and respectable never again she whispered to herself the next one will pay chagrin at the treatment she had suffered filled her with a poisonous hatred of all mankind and soundlessly she cursed phillips as the cause of her present plight such thoughts as these ran tumbling through the girls mind her rage and her resentment were real enough nevertheless through this overtone there ran another note a small voice was speaking in the midst of all her tumult a small voice which she refused to listen to what i ever saw in him i dont know she sneered goading herself to further bitterness and stiffening her courage i never really cared for him im too wise for that i dont care for him now i detest the poor simpleminded fool i hate him so she fought with herself drowning the persistent piping of that other voice then her eyes dropped to that fatal paper in her lap and suddenly venom fled from her she wondered if cavendish would tell pierce that he had given her the pink ticket probably not the mounted police were usually closemouthed about such things and yet laure crushed the paper into a crumpled ball and furtively hid it in the pocket of her coat then she raised wild apprehensive eyes to the door if only she dared slip out now before pierce reappeared before he had a chance to see her it seemed as if she could not bear to have him know but cavendish had ordered her to wait my god the girl whispered ill die if he knows ill die she began to tremble wretchedly and to wring her hands she could not remove her gaze from the door this waitingroom at the barracks had housed people of divers and many sorts during its brief history it had harbored strained faces it had been the scene of strong emotional conflicts but never perhaps had its narrow walls encompassed emotions in wider contrast than those experienced by the four silent women who waited there at this moment one object of interest dominated the thoughts of each of them these thoughts were similar in nature and sprang from the same startingpoint curiously enough however they took channels as wide apart as the poles josephine cavendish had heard just enough about the incidents of the previous night to awaken her apprehensions and to stir her feeling of loyalty to the depths the suggestion that pierce phillips was in the slightest degree responsible for the death of count courteau had roused her indignation and her fightingblood unable to endure the suspense of idle waiting she had sought relief by assuming a sort of sentinel post where she could watch developments it was something to be close to his affairs it was next to being close to him hence the reason of her presence and her insistence upon remaining in her mind there had never been the slightest question of pierces innocence any doubt of it expressed or implied awoke in her a sharp and bitter antagonism quite remarkable no bird could have flown quicker to the aid of her chick no wolf mother could have bristled more ferociously at threat to her cub than did this serene inexperienced girlwoman at hint of peril to pierce phillips and yet on the surface at least she and pierce were only friends he had never voiced a word of love to her butof what use are words when hearts are full and when confession lurks in every glance every gesture when every commonplace is thrilling and significant in her eyes no disgrace whatever attached to him as a result of the notoriety he had suffered on the contrary she considered him a martyr a hero the object of a deep conspiracy and his wrongs smarted her he was in short a romantic figure moreover she had recently begun to believe that this entire situation was contrived purely for the purpose of bringing them together of acquainting them with each other and of testing the strength of their mutual regard these other women whom she saw today for the first time she considered merely extra figures in the drama of which she and pierce played the leads witnesses in the case deserving no attention she would be grateful to them of course if they succeeded in helping him but at best they were minor characters supers in the cast once pierce himself strode into the scene she forgot them entirely what a picture her lover made she reflected how he filled her eye what importance he possessed surely the world must see and feel how dominant how splendid he was it must recognize how impossible it would be for him to do wrong the mere sight of him had set her to vibrating and now inspired in her a certain reckless abandon guilty or innocent he was her mate and she would have followed him at a word but he was innocent it was her part to wait here as patiently as she could until the fact was proved and until he could ask that question which forever trembled between them such thoughts as these were impossible to conceal they were mirrored upon the face of the colonels daughter as she stood raptly gazing at the door through which pierce phillips had disappeared her lips were parted the shadow of the smile his coming had evoked still lingered upon them her soul was in her shining eyes unknown to her at least one of the other women present had read her sudden emotions and now watched her curiously with an intent and growing astonishment rouletta kirby had been as quick as the countess to correctly interpret laures chagrin and she too had experienced a tremendous relief oddly enough however she had felt no such fierce and jealous exultation as she had anticipated there had been no selfish thrill such as she had expected what ailed her she wondered while groping for an answer her attention had been challenged by the expression upon miss cavendishs face and vaguely she began to comprehend the truth breathlessly now she watched the girl slowly conviction grew into certainty so that was why the colonels daughter was here that was why at sound of a certain step she had become glorified that was why pierce had been blind to her own and hildas presence in the room it would be untrue to say that rouletta was not shocked by this discovery it came like a thunderclap and its very unexpectedness jolted her mind out of the ruts it had been following these many days but astonishing to relate it caused her no anguish after the first moment or two of dizzy bewilderment had passed she found that her whole being was galvanized into new life and that the eyes of her soul were opened to a new light with understanding came a peculiar emotional letdown a sudden welcome relaxation almost a sensation of relief rouletta asked herself over and over what could be the matter with her why she felt no twinge no jealousy why the sight of that eager breathless girl with the rapturous face failed to cause her a heartache she was amazed at herself it could not be that she no longer cared for pierce that she had mistaken her feelings toward him no he was what he had always been her ideal the finest the most lovable the dearest creature she had ever met just the sort of fellow she had always longed to know the kind any girl would crave for lover friend brother she felt very tender toward him she was not greatly surprised that the nicest girl in dawson had recognized his charm and had surrendered to it well he deserved the nicest girl in the world rouletta was startled at the direction her thoughts were taking did she love pierce phillips as she had believed she did or had she merely fallen in love with his good qualities certainly he had never been dearer to her than he was at this moment and yet rouletta abandoned the problem of selfanalysis and allowed her bubbling relief at the turn events had taken to remain a mystery for the time being the door to the commandants office opened without warning pierce stood framed in it his head was up his shoulders were back his countenance was alight with confident tread he entered the big room and crossed it directly to the girl who stood waiting beside the table he held out his two hands to her and with a flash of her clear blue eyes she placed hers in his gladness trust blind faith and adoration were in her face she murmured something which rouletta did not hear for at that instant colonel cavendish appeared with the curt announcement that is all ladies you neednt remain longer blindly confusedly rouletta rose and fumbled with her wraps she saw the colonel go to laure and speak with her in a stiff formal way she saw pierce and josephine turn away hand in hand their heads close together he had not even glanced in her direction then cavendish was speaking to her directly at first she did not understand him but finally made out that he was telling her that everything had been cleared up including even the mystery of count courteaus goldsack laure confessed that she got a duplicate key to the cashiers cage she heard the colonel say got it from pierce it was she who put the evidence in there during the confusion pretty ingenious i call it and pretty spiteful did she have anything to say about the the murder rouletta inquired no but the countess has that figured out right im sure well have the proof when rock brings back his prisoners as rouletta moved toward the door pierce stopped her there was a ring in his voice as he said rouletta i want you to meet miss cavendish i want the two nicest girls in the world to know each other josephine this is miss kirby of whom ive said so much then without reason he laughed joyously and so did the colonels daughter the latter took roulettas hand in a warm and friendly clasp her smiling lips were tremulous engagingly shyly she said pierce has told me how splendid youve been to him and im sure youre as happy as we are but things always come out right if we wish for them hard enough dont you think so the countess courteau was walking slowly when rouletta overtook her a block or so down the street she looked up as the younger woman joined her well she said i presume you saw not a look not a thought for any one but her that other girl yes i saw there was a pause then shes wonderful i think im very glad glad hilda raised her brows she glanced curiously at the speaker if i had a brother id want him to love a girl like that but you have no brother outside of poleon doret hilda was more than ever amazed when her companion laughed softly contentedly i know but if i had one id want him to be like pierce i my dear something has changed in me oh surprisingly i scarcely know what it is but im walking on air and my eyes are open for the first time and you weve been honest with each other how do you feel i the countess smiled wistfully why it doesnt matter how i feel the boy has found himself and nothing else is of the least importance chapter xxx joe mccaskey was not a coward neither was he a superstitious man but he had imagination the steady strain of his and franks long flight the certainty of pursuit close behind had frayed his nerve and rendered him jumpy for a man in his condition to be awakened out of a trancelike sleep by an intruder at once invisible dumb to feel the presence of that mysterious visitor and actually to see him it bulked dim and formless among the darting shadows cast by a blazing match was a test indeed it was too much for joe as for frank he had actually seen nothing heard nothing except his brothers voice and then that sigh for that very reason his terror was if anything even greater than his brothers during what seemed an age there was no sound except the stertorous breathing of the mccaskeys themselves and the stir of the dogs outside the pale square of the single window over which a bleachedout cotton floursack had been tacked let in only enough light to intensify the gloom within the cabin was a blackness thick tangible oppressive the brothers stared into it with bulging eyes and listened with eardrums strained to the point of rupture oddly enough this utter silence augmented their agitation unable finally to smother the evidence of his steadily growing fright frank uttered a halfaudible moan joe in the next bunk put it down as a new and threatening phenomenon what sort of thing was it that sighed and moaned thus as evidence of the direction joes mind was taking he wondered if these sounds could be the complaint of courteaus unshriven spirit it was a shocking thought but involuntarily he gasped the dead mans name a guilty conscience is a proven cowardmaker so too is a quick imaginative mind it took only a moment or two to convince joe that this nocturnal interloper was not a creature of flesh and blood but some enormous unmentionable creeping thing come out of the other world out of the cold earth to visit punishment upon him for his crime he could hear it stirring finally now here now there he could make out the rustle of its graveclothes there is no doubt that the cabin was full of halfdistinguishable sounds so is any warm habitation but to joes panicky imagination the nature of these particular sounds indicated that they could not come from any normal living being there was for instance a slow asthmatic wheezing like the breath of a sorely wounded man a stretching and straining as of a body racked with mortal agony even a faint bubbling choke like a deathrattle heard in an adjoining chamber these and others as horribly suggestive joes wild agitation distorted all of them no matter whether they came from his brother frank from the poorly seasoned pole rafters overhead or from the sleepy dogs outside and poleon doret with a grim internal chuckle took advantage of the fact when finally the elder mccaskey heard his own name whispered the last shred of selfcontrol left to him was whipped away his wits went skittering and for a second time he groped with frantic twitching fingers for his revolver he raised it and with a yell fired at random into the blackness meanwhile covering his eyes with his left arm for fear of beholding in the sulphurous flash that bloodless fleshless menace whatever it might be somehow he managed to get out of bed and to place his back against the wall and there he cowered until he heard his brothers body threshing about the floor as a matter of fact that shot had sent frank sprawling from his bunk and he was striving to kick off the hampering folds of his sleepingbag nothing more but the thumping of his knees and elbows bore a dreadful significance to the terrified listener evidently the thing had closed in had grappled with frank its hands damp with death sweat even now were groping for him joe the thought was unbearable blindly the elder brother thrust his revolver at full length in front of him and pulled the trigger frank shrieked but again and again joe fired and when the last cartridge was spent he continued to snap the weapon he desisted only when he heard a voice faint but hoarse with agony crying o god youve shot me joe youve shot me then and not until then did a sort of sanity come to the wretch the revolver slipped from his fingers he felt his bones dissolving into water a horror ten times greater than he had previously suffered fell upon him he tried to speak to throw off this hideous nightmare but his voice came only as a dry reedy whisper frank was still now he did not respond to his brothers incoherencies except with a deep groaning that momentarily became more alarming i i didnt christ i didnt shoot you frank answer me say something even yet the dread of that hobgoblin presence lay like ice upon the elder brother he feared to move lest he encounter it lest he touch it and it enfold him but when franks twitching body became still he fell to his knees and went groping forward on allfours in search of it death was here now he had slain his brother and there was no light joe began to sob and to chatter in a maudlin hysteria of fright and apprehension he succeeded in finding frank by the sound of his breathing and he was pawing at him and wildly calling his name when at his back a match was struck the sound the flare brought a scream from his throat he cringed and cowered the pallid face he raised was slackjawed his gaze was that of a crazy man slowly very slowly his dementia left him his eyes were still distended to be sure but into them sanity recognition began to creep he stared dazedly about him and at last he managed to speak dorets name whwhat you doing here he breathed me i come to tak you back joe shook his head weakly you cant were across safe his eyes dropped to the prostrate body beside which he knelt and a new thought swiftly flooded his vacant mind look you now i understand you did it you shot him i never by god the fellows insane vehemence the panting eagerness with which he undertook to absolve himself from the hideous results of his deed argued that he loved his brother he rose slowly to his feet his countenance flaming his gaze fixed in an arresting expression of mingled rage and horror upon the woodsmans face you did it damn you shot him in the dark asleep now you want me take me back eh you cant do it im safe safe poleon uttered a grunt he leaned his carbine against the wall behind him and from his pocket he drew a thin cotton sledrope with this in his hand he advanced upon the slayer mccaskey retreated weakly at first he fought off his captor then as fear overwhelmed him he became possessed of a phrenetic energy and struggled with the strength of two men he struck he bit he clawed he kicked it was like the battle of a man with a beast ferocious merciless while it lasted they rocked about the cabin heedless of the wounded man the stove came crashing down and they trampled the pipe under their feet but mccaskey collapsed as suddenly as he had flown to action when poleon trussed him up he had neither strength nor spirit either for resistance or for resentment he was as spineless as a wet sack with anguished eyes he watched his captor lift frank into a bunk and then proceed to do what remained to be done bleak of face lifeless of voice hopeless of expression he answered the questions put to him and made no feeblest effort at concealment he was in fact no longer capable of any resistance mental or physical frank died as the first ashen streaks of dawn came through the window and lit the sickly face of the brother who had slain him there was no longer need of the rope in fact joe implored his captor with such earnestness not to leave him alone that poleon untied his hands feeling sure that he was impotent joe followed him outside and stood near by while he harnessed the dogs he accompanied every step the woodsman took wild horses could not have dragged him away in his present frame of mind and finally when they set out back toward the canadian line he shambled along ahead of the team with head down and eyes averted from the gruesome bundle that lay in the sled his punishment had overtaken him and he was unequal to it dawson was in ferment for the news of another strike had come in and a stampede was under way discoveries of gold or rumors of them had been common the camp had thrilled to many arabian nights tales but this one was quite the most sensational of all so amazing so unbelievable was it in truth that those who had been too often fooled laughed at it and declared it impossible on its face some woodcutters on the hills above el dorado had been getting out dry timber for the drift fires so ran the report and in shooting the treetrunks down into the valley they had discovered a deposit of wash gravel one of them possessed of the prospectors instinct had gophered a capful of the gravel from off the rim where the plunging treetrunks had dug through the snow and exposed the outcropping bedrock and to satisfy his curiosity had taken it down to camp for a test he had thawed and panned it to his amazement he had discovered that it carried an astonishing value in gold coarse rough gold exactly like that in the creek paystreak except with less signs of abrasion and erosion rumor placed the contents of that first prospect at ten dollars ten cents would have meant the riches of aladdin but ten dollars no wonder the wiseacres shook their heads ten dollars to the pan on a hilltop absurd how did metal of that specific gravity get up there how could there be wash gravel on the crest of a mountain there was no sense to such a proposition but such old california placer miners as chanced to hear of it lost no time in hitting the trail they were familiar with high bars prehistoric riverbeds and they went as fast as their old legs would carry them more faith was put in the story when it became known that the diggings were being deserted and that the men of el dorado and bonanza were quitting their jobs actually leaving their thawed drifts to freeze while they scattered over the domes and saddles round about staking claims that settled matters so far as dawson was concerned men who had dogs hitched them up those who had none rolled their packs soon the trail up the klondike was black and the recorders office prepared for riotous activity those who had set out thus late met excited travelers hastening townward and from them obtained confirmation yes the story was true more than true the half had not been told as yet gold lay under the grass roots where anybody could see it it was more plentiful than in the creeks this was the richest thing ever known frenchmans hill the discovery had been named but all the ground for miles round about had been already staked and now men were going even further afield it was well to hurry a frenzy took possession of the hearers and they pressed on more rapidly this was like the rush of the autumn previous from dyea to the chilkoot only here dogs flew under snapping lashes pedestrians when shouldered aside abandoned their burdens and sacrificed all to speed at the forks the new arrivals scattered up over the hills and that night roadhouses cabins tents were crowded men slept on chairs on floors they stood around open fires dawson awoke on the second morning to behold a long queue of furclad miners waiting outside the gold commissioners office the town took on an electric liveliness this signified big things it gave permanence it meant that dawson was to be the worlds first placer camp business picked up the saloons became thronged on every corner knots of gossiping men assembled there began a considerable speculation in claims on frenchmans hill merchants planned larger stocks for the next season the price of town lots doubled late that afternoon through the streets ran a cry that took every footfree man hurrying to the riverfront rock was coming in a jiffy the vantagepoints were crowded sure enough far down the yukon two teams were approaching with the smoke of dawson in their nostrils they were coming on the run and soon the more keeneyed spectators announced that they could make out poleon doret the lieutenant himself however was not in evidence instantly speculation became rife here was a sensation indeed and when the second runner was identified beyond question as joe mccaskey excitement doubled where was rock where was the other fugitive what in the name of all that was unexpected had occurred a shout of relief issued from the crowd when the teams drew in under the bank and rock sat up waving a mittened hand the shout was quickly hushed as the lookerson saw what sort of burden joe mccaskey was driving up into the main street came the cavalcade the crowd fell in alongside and ran with it to the barracks clamoring for details pouring questions upon the returning travelers joe mccaskey of course was speechless this ordeal proving as a matter of fact scarcely less trying than that other one at sheep camp when he had run the gauntlet as for rock and the french canadian neither had much to say and as a result sensational stories soon spread through the resorts the mounted policeman had got his men as usual but only after a desperate affray in which frank mccaskey had fallen and the officer himself had been wounded so ran the first account those who had gone as far as the barracks returned with a fanciful tale of a siege in the snow and of rocks singlehanded conquest of the two fugitives these conflicting reports were confusing and served to set the town so completely agog that it awaited fuller details with the most feverish impatience one thing only was certain the lieutenant had again made himself a hero he had put a new feather in his cap men lifted glasses to him and to the force such efficiency as this commanded their deepest respect and admiration pierce phillips of course was the most eager member of that welcoming throng at the earliest moment he bore poleon away to his cabin and there when the last morbid curiosityseeker had been shaken off and the dogs had been attended to he heard the story you don got no more worry poleon told him with a smile joe keel de count he confessed really rouletta figger it out jus right by golly dats de smartes gal she is indeed but frank what happened how did you manage poleon hesitated there was a reason why he did not wish the details of that affair on the upper forty mile to become public joe mccaskey was beginning to talk loudly about his outraged rights his citizenship international law and such incomprehensible things but stronger by far than any fear of consequences to himself remote at best poleon felt a desire to help his friend the police lieutenant rock was deeply humiliated at his weak failure in living up to his reputation he felt that he had cut a very sorry figure indeed and although he had undertaken to conceal that feeling from poleon the latter had read him like a book and had secretly made up his mind to give full credit to the officer eliminating himself as much as possible there was no reason why the actual facts should be made public so far as he could see and once an artfully colored account of the exploit had gained currency rock could not well contradict it he might undoubtedly would make a truthful report to his superiors but poleon determined that in the eyes of the heroworshiping people of dawson the fellow should still remain a hero and stand for one hundred per cent efficiency that was quite as it should be it was not difficult to distort the story enough to reverse the roles he and the officer had played and when he had finished pierce was loud in his praise of the mounted policeman well things happened here too the youth declared succinctly he told the story of laures delayed confession proving that he had been the victim of a deliberate conspiracy believe me im glad it has all come out so well he said people didnt actually accuse me but i was conscious of their suspicion their doubt i had talked too much then too there was that beastly rumor about the countess and me it was fierce appearances were strong id have gone on the stampede only i didnt have the heart youve heard about that of course the new strike when poleon shook his head the young mans eyes kindled why man he broke out the towns crazy dippy its the biggest thing ever frenchmans hill its called get that frenchmans hill some french feller mak lucky strike eh poleon was not greatly interested where de place is who dis frenchman its a high bar somewhere above el dorado a mountain of pay gravel an old riverbed or something they say its where all the gold came from the mother lode you can see it right at the grass roots poleon started and his mouth opened then he shook his head by gar dats fonny i seen gravel up dere but me im onlucky never i quite get notin always im close by when noder feller mak strike pierce still managed to control himself enough to explain they were shooting dead timber down into the gulch and they wore the snow off where the rim cropped out it happened to be staked ground right there pierces excitement the odd light in his dancing eyes bore to poleon a significance some frenchman had taken it up so they called it frenchmans hill dorets blank confounded stare caused the speaker finally to blurt out good heavens man wake up im trying to break the news gently that youre a millionaire the frenchman of frenchmans hill i dont want you to faint first time in history a miner ever left his claim and another fellow came along doret uttered a feeble cry and rose to his feet ma soeur he exclaimed shes got claim up dere i stake it for her for me i don care if i lose mine plenty tam i come jus so close as dis but if dem feller jump her groun wait wait theres no question of anything like that nobody has jumped your claim or hers either the law wouldnt let em i wonder if she knows why she cant know i left her not two hours ago she don know pierce shook his head she doesnt dream i wish id known id have loved to tell her poleon doret gazed fixedly curiously at the speaker he nodded his head a peculiar set hopeless look crept into his eyes his broad shoulders sagged wearily he had traveled far and swiftly on this young mans affairs he had slept but little and now a great fatigue mastered him oddly enough too that fierce consuming desire to see rouletta which had hourly gnawed at him was gone all at once he felt that she was quite the last person he wished to face this weakness this smallness of spirit was only temporary he assured himself it would soon pass and then he would find the strength to go to her with his customary smile his mask in place now however he was empty cheerless frightened by the portent of this new thing it could have but one significance it meant that he would lose his sister that she would have no further need of him well that was all right it was something like this that he had worked for why cherish a mean envy of this happy boy why permit a narrow selfishness to mar this supreme moment doret was not a grudging giver he straightened himself finally and into his tired eyes there came the gleam that phillips had been waiting for bien he breathed my lil bird goin wear de plumage she deserve shes goin be reech an happy all her life by golly dats nice for fac i feel lak gettin drunk shed never stand for that i spec you tol her you an me is pardners on dis frenchman hill eh an shes glad bout dat oh see here pierces tone changed abruptly of course i didnt tell her thats cold its off dyou think id

bully of you but well hardly im not that sort no ive laid off the old stuff absolutely straightened out ive lived ten years in the last ten days wait and see poleon im the happiest the most deliriously happy man you ever saw i only want one thing thats work and lots of it the harder the better so long as its honest and selfrespecting what dyou think of that wat i tink the woodsman said warmly i tink dats de bes news of all mon ami you got reecher paystreak in you as frenchman hill if only you work im hard but you need pardner to get im out he winked meaningly i guess mebbe you fin

word to her she doesnt know ho ho cried the elder man oh she does know of course if she didnt i wouldnt feel as i do but weve never actually mentioned it ive got to prove myself understand it came to

finally then sweeps you on again fortunately shes big enough to understand and make allowances if she werent id die i wouldnt want to live and not make good its ecstasy and its pain im frightened too at my own unworthiness abruptly the speakers voice ceased and he bowed his head poleon wet his dry lips and essayed to speak but he could find nothing to say of course rouletta was big enough to understand and make allowance for any human shortcomings she was the sanest the most liberal the most charitable of girls and it was true too that love came unbidden he had learned that to his cost it was pretty hard to stand quietly and lend a sympathetic ear to this lucky devil it took an effort to maintain a smile to keep a friendly gaze fixed upon phillips face the big fellow was growing weary of forever fighting himself it would be a relief to get away and to yield to his misery but with a lovers fatuous absorption in his own affairs pierce resumed ive been thinking lately how i came to this country looking for life the big adventure everything that happened good or bad was part of a stage play ive been two people in one the fellow who did things and the fellow who looked on and applauded actor and audience it was tremendously interesting in an unreal sort of way and i jotted everything down mentally i was stocking up with experience understand well the whole thing has suddenly become very different im not in the gallery now not in the theater at all not acting and i thank god for it i dont imagine that i make myself plain in the least evidently he had not evidently too his auditors mind had strayed slightly for the latter said i spose you tinkin all at once bout gettin marry eh phillips paled he uttered a panicky denial not yet oh no that is ive thought about it

upon his head i ive a notion to i can almost say it anyhow i can say enough so shell understand gad i will i just needed you to stiffen me up fiercely he wrung the woodsmans hand and forgetful of all else but his new determination moved toward the door thanks for all youve done for me old man and all youve offered to do frenchman hill is nice place for two nestin doves fine place for sing an be happy the other reminded him in a choking voice pierce exclaimed youre a prince doret and i wont forget a prince he was gone the cabin door had slammed shut with a crash poleon sank to a seat and with a long sigh bowed his head it was over he had done his bit for a long while he remained there inert his patient haggard face bent his eyes fixed upon the floor he felt very old very much used up and the labor of thinking was unbearable when the fire had died and a chill had crept into the room he roused himself to note that it had grown dark manifestly this would not do there was the problem of living still to face sooner or later this very evening he must go to rouletta and pretend to a joyousness he could never again know that meant more smiles more effort it would take all he had in him to carry it off and meanwhile the more he let his mind dwell upon her the more unbearable became his thoughts this solitude was playing tricks with him enough of it he must get out into the lights he must hear voices and regain the mastery of himself through contact with sane people perhaps in the saloons the restaurants he could absorb enough laughter to make safe the mockery he purposed perhaps it would enable him to stamp a grin upon his features but his impulse was futile in spite of himself he shrank from people and hid himself unobtrusively in a corner of the first place he entered he was hurt wounded sick to death he longed to creep away somewhere and be alone with his pain in order that he might the sooner be free to do so he rose finally and slunk out upon the street it would soon be time for rouletta to go to work he would get it over with cap in hand his heart beating heavily at the prospect of merely seeing her he came on noiseless soles to her door he could hear her stirring inside so he took a deep breath and rapped softly she uttered a cry when she saw him standing there then a sudden pallor crept into her cheeks a queer constraint enveloped her nevertheless she put both her hands in his and drew him across the threshold she said something which neither of them understood poleons ears were roaring but after a few moments he discovered that she was gently chiding him where had he been why had he delayed so long knowing all the time that she was dying to see him and to hear his story he could not understand her embarrassment her shyness the fact that she seemed hurt wal im tucker out wit travelin he declared dats hardes trip ever i mak you hear bout im eh bout how mccaskey tell de truth rouletta nodded with a curious little smile upon her lips yes i heard all about it the first thing how rock ran down those fellows everything the town was ringing with his name inside of an hour of course i went to the barracks finally looking for you im just back i saw the lieutenant and he told me the true story poleon stirred uncomfortably he swore at you roundly and said hed take it out of your skin as soon as he was able giving him the credit he told me it was you who did it all how you followed those men over the line alone after he played out how joe mccaskey killed his own brother in trying to kill you but the whole thing is public now i heard it as i came back youre quite a famous character in dawson tonight poleon dear what with this and with frenchmans hill ho dat frenchman hill the man broke out hurriedly its beeg sprise for us eh pierce told you bout dat pierce the girl shook her head vaguely you member i stake two claim one for you one for me by golly ma soeur youre millionaire i remembered of course rouletta said faintly i she closed her eyes i couldnt believe it however at first i didnt understand where the strike had been made then i couldnt credit it i thought i was dreaming you dream as much as you can poleon said warmly dey all come true now what everyting come out nice eh rouletta opened her eyes they were shining so too was her face yes my dream has come true that is my biggest finest dream im the happiest girl in the world poleon ma soeur the man cried brokenly and with a depth of feeling that even rouletta could not fathom i give my life to hear you say dose word to see dat light in your eye no price too high for dat a silence throbbing intense fell between them rouletta felt her heartbeats swaying her she opened her lips but no sound issued the figure before her was growing misty and she had to wink the tears back into place ma soeur she echoed faintly i love to hear you say that dear it has grown to be a caress a kiss when you say it but ive something to tell you i know something you dont know and would never guess ive found another brother when he stared at her in open bewilderment she repeated yes another brother i took him for something altogether different but she laughed happily
