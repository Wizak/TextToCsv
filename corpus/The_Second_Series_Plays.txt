bunch of yellow roses in the other a door closes above and sir william cheshire in evening dress comes downstairs he is perhaps fiftyeight of strong build rather bullnecked with grey eyes and a wellcoloured face whose choleric autocracy is veiled by a thin urbanity he speaks before he reaches the bottom sir william well freda nice roses who are they for freda my lady told me to give the yellow to mrs keith sir william and the white to miss lanfarne for their first evening sir william capital passing on towards the drawingroom your father coming up tonight freda yes sir william be

yees i havent forgotten his facelast time freda you stood with mr bill hes better to stand with than mr harold or captain keith mabel he didnt touch a feather that day freda people dont when theyre anxious to do their best a gong sounds and mabel lanfarne giving freda a rather inquisitive stare moves on to the drawingroom left alone without the roses freda still lingers at the slamming of a door above and hasty footsteps she shrinks back against the stairs bill runs down and comes on her suddenly he is a tall goodlooking edition of his father with the same stubborn look of veiled choler bill freda and as she shrinks still further back whats the matter then at some sound he looks round uneasily and draws away from her arent you glad to see me freda ive something to say to you mr bill after dinner bill mister she passes him and rushes away upstairs and bill who stands frowning and looking after her recovers himself sharply as the drawingroom door is opened and sir william and miss lanfarne come forth followed by keith dot harold christine latter and joan all leaning across each other and talking by herself behind them comes lady cheshire a refinedlooking woman of fifty with silvery dark hair and an expression at once gentle and ironic they move across the hall towards the diningroom sir william ah bill mabel how do you do keith how are you old chap dot gloomily do you

afraid so dear christine but cant they be dot ah ahh christine and her mother are silent my child im not the young person christine no of course not only nodding towards joan and mable dot look here this is just an instance of what i hate lady cheshire my dear another one dot yes mother and dont you pretend you dont understand because you know you do christine instance of what joan and mabel have ceased talking and listen still at the fire dot humbug of course why should you want them to marry if hes tired of her christine ironically well if your imagination doesnt carry you as far as that dot when people marry do you believe they ought to be in love with each other christine with a shrug thats not the point dot oh were you in love with ronny christine dont be idiotic dot would you have

you marry him if you werent mabel no i would not dot now mother did you love father christine dot you really are awful dot rueful and detached well it is a bit too thick perhaps joan dot dot well mother did you i mean quite calmly lady cheshire yes dear quite calmly dot would you have married him if you hadnt lady cheshire shakes her head then were all agreed mabel except yourself dot grimly even if i loved him he might think himself lucky if i married him mabel indeed and im not so sure dot making a face at her what i was going to lady cheshire but dont you think dear youd better not dot well i wont say what i was going to say but what i do say is why the devil lady cheshire quite so dot dot a little disconcerted if theyre tired of each other they ought not to marry and if fathers going to make them christine you dont understand in the least its for the sake of the dot out with it old sweetness the approaching infant god bless it there is a sudden silence for keith and latter are seen coming from the diningroom latter that must be so ronny keith no john not a bit of it latter you dont think keith good gad who wants to think after dinner dot come on lets play pool she turns at the billiardroom door look here rehearsal tomorrow is directly after breakfast from eccles enters breathless to the end mabel whatever made you choose caste dot you know its awfully difficult dot because its the only play thats not too advanced the girls all go into the billiardroom lady cheshire wheres bill ronny keith with a grimace i rather think sir william and he are in committee of supply memsahib lady cheshire oh she looks uneasily at the diningroom then follows the girls out latter in the tone of one resuming an argument there cant be two opinions about it ronny young dunnings refusal is simply indefensible keith i dont agree a bit john latter of course if you wont listen keith clipping a cigar draw it mild my dear chap weve had the whole thing over twice at least latter my point is this keith regarding latter quizzically with his halfclosed eyes i know i know but the point is how far your point is simply professional latter if a man wrongs a woman he ought to right her again theres no answer to that keith it all depends latter thats rank opportunism keith rats look here oh hang it john one cant argue this out with a parson latter frigidly why not harold who has entered from the diningroom pull devil pull baker keith shut up harold latter to play the game is the religion even of the army keith exactly but what is the game latter what else can it be in this case keith youre too puritanical young john you cant help it line of country laid down for you all draghuntin what latter with concentration look here harold imitating the action of a man pulling at a horses head come hup i say you hugly beast keith to latter youre not going to draw me old chap you dont see where youd land us all he smokes calmly latter how do you imagine vice takes its rise from precisely this sort of thing of young dunnings keith from human nature i should have thought john i admit that i dont like a fellows leavin a girl in the lurch but i dont see the use in drawin hard and fast rules you only have to break em sir william and you would just tie dunning and the girl up together willynilly to save appearances and ten to one but therell be the deuce to pay in a years time you can take a horse to the water you cant make him drink latter i entirely and absolutely disagree with you harold good old john latter at all events we know where your principles take you keith rather dangerously where please harold turns up his eyes and points downwards dry up harold latter did you ever hear the story of faust keith now look here john with all due respect to your cloth and all the politeness in the world you may go toblazes latter well i must say ronny of all the rude boorshe turns towards the billiardroom keith sorry i smashed the glass old chap latter passes out there comes a mingled sound through the opened door of female voices laughter and the click of billiard balls dipped of by the sudden closing of the door keith impersonally deuced odd the way a parson puts ones back up because you know i agree with him really young dunning ought to play the game and i hope sir williamll make him the butler jackson has entered from the door under the stairs followed by the keeper studdenham a man between fifty and sixty in a fullskirted coat with big pockets cord breeches and gaiters he has a steady self respecting weathered face with blue eyes and a short grey beard which has obviously once been red keith hullo studdenham studdenham touching his forehead evenin captain keith jackson sir william still in the diningroom with mr bill sir harold with a grimace

we cant have open scandals in the village if he wants to keep his place he must marry her at once lady cheshire to her husband in a low voice is it right to force them do you know what the girl wishes studdenham studdenham shows a spirit my lady says shell have him willin or not lady cheshire a spirit i see if they marry like that theyre sure to be miserable sir william what doesnt follow at all besides my dear you ought to know by this time theres an unwritten law in these matters theyre perfectly well aware that when there are consequences they have to take them studdenham some o these young people my lady they dont put two and two together no more than an old cock pheasant sir william ill give him till tomorrow if he remains obstinate hell have to go hell get no character

under the stairs is opened bill now do sir william ill be gentle with him sharply come in lady cheshire retires to the billiardroom she gives a look back and a half smile at young dunning a fair young man dressed in broom cords and leggings and holding his cap in his hand then goes out sir william evenin dunning dunning twisting his cap evenin sir william sir william studdenhams told you what i want to see you about dunning yes sir sir william the things in your hands take it or leave it i dont put pressure on you i simply wont have this sort of thing on my estate dunning id like to say sir

now dunning ive no more to say dunning goes sadly away under the stairs sir william following and look here just understand this he too goes out bill lighting a cigarette has approached the writingtable he looks very glum the billiardroom door is flung open mabel lanfarne appears and makes him a little curtsey mabel against my will i am bidden to bring you in to pool bill sorry ive got letters mabel you seem to have become very conscientious bill oh i dont know mabel do you remember the last day of the covert shooting bits i do mabel suddenly what a pretty girl freda studdenhams grown bill has she mabel she walks in beauty bill really hadnt noticed mabel have you been taking lessons in conversation bill dont think so mabel oh there is a silence mr cheshire bill miss lanfarne mabel whats the matter with you arent you rather queer considering that i dont bite and was rather a pal bill stolidly im sorry then seeing that his mother has came in from the billiardroom he sits down at the writingtable lady cheshire mabel dear do take my cue wont you play too bill and try and stop ronny hes too terrible bill thanks ive got these letters mabel taking the cue passes back into the billiardroom whence comes out the sound of talk and laughter lady cheshire going over and standing behind her sons chair anything wrong darling bill nothing thanks suddenly i say i wish you hadnt asked that girl here lady cheshire mabel why shes wanted for rehearsals i thought you got on so well with her last christmas bill with a sort of sullen exasperation a year ago lady cheshire the girls like her so does your father personally i must say i think shes rather nice and irish bill shes all right i daresay he looks round as if to show his mother that he wishes to be left alone but lady cheshire having seen that he is about to look at her is not looking at him lady cheshire im afraid your fathers been talking to you bill bill he has lady cheshire debts do try and make allowances with a faint smile of course he is a little bill he is lady cheshire i wish i could bill oh lord dont you get mixed up in it lady cheshire it seems almost a pity that you told him bill he wrote and asked me point blank what i owed lady cheshire oh forcing herself to speak in a casual voice i happen to have a little money bill i think it would be simpler if bill now look here mother youve tried that before i cant help spending money i never shall be able unless i go to the colonies or something of the kind lady cheshire dont talk like that dear bill i would for two straws lady cheshire its only because your father thinks such a lot of the place and the name and your career the cheshires are all like that theyve been here so long theyre all root bill deuced funny business my career will be i expect lady cheshire fluttering but restraining herself lest he should see but bill why must you spend more than your allowance bill why anything i didnt make myself lady cheshire im afraid we did that it was inconsiderate perhaps bill yes youd better have left me out lady cheshire but why are you so only a little fuss about money bill yees lady cheshire youre not keeping anything from me are you bill facing her no he then turns very deliberately to the writing things and takes up a pen i must write these letters please lady cheshire bill if theres any real trouble you will tell me wont you bill theres nothing whatever he suddenly gets up and walks about lady cheshire too moves over to the fireplace and after an uneasy look at him turns to the fire then as if trying to switch of his mood she changes the subject abruptly lady cheshire isnt it a pity about young dunning im so sorry for rose taylor there is a silence stealthily under the staircase freda has entered and seeing only bill advances to speak to him bill suddenly oh well you cant help these things in the country as he speaks freda stops dead perceiving that he is not alone bill too catching sight of her starts lady cheshire still speaking to the fire it seems dreadful to force him i do so believe in people doing things of their own accord then seeing freda standing so uncertainly by the stairs do you want me freda freda only your cloak my lady shall i begin it at this moment sir william enters from the drawingroom lady cheshire yes yes sir william genially can you give me another five minutes bill pointing to the billiardroom well come directly my dear freda with a look at bill has gone back whence she came and lady cheshire goes reluctantly away into the billiardroom sir william i shall give young dunning short shrift he moves over to the fireplace and divides hip coattails now about you bill i dont want to bully you the moment you come down but you know this cant go on ive paid your debts twice shant pay them this time unless i see a disposition to change your mode of life a pause you get your extravagance from your mother shes very queer a pause all the winterleighs are like that about money bill mothers particularly generous if thats what you mean sir william drily we will put it that way a pause at the present moment you owe as i understand it eleven hundred pounds bill about that sir william mere fleabite a pause ive a proposition to make bill wont it do tomorrow sir sir william tomorrow appears to be your motto in life bill thanks sir william im anxious to change it today bill looks at him in silence its time you took your position seriously instead of hanging about town racing and playing polo and what not bill go ahead at something dangerous in his voice sir william modifies his attitude sir william the propositions very simple i cant suppose anything so rational and to your advantage will appeal to you but drily i mention it marry a nice girl settle down and stand for the division you can have the dower house and fifteen hundred a year and ill pay your debts into the bargain if youre elected ill make it two thousand plenty of time to work up the constituency before we kick out these infernal rads carpetbagger against you if you go hard at it in the summer itll be odd if you dont manage to get in your three days a week next season you can take rocketer and that fouryearold hes well up to your weight fully eight and a half inches of bone youll only want one other and if miss if your wife means to hunt bill youve chosen my wife then sir william with a quick look i imagine youve some girl in your mind bill ah sir william used not to be unnatural at your age i married your mother at twentyeight here you are eldest son of a family that stands for something the more i see of the times the more im convinced that everybody who is anybody has got to buckle to and save the landmarks left unless were true to our caste and prepared to work for it the landed classes are going to go under to this infernal democratic spirit in the air the outlooks very serious were threatened in a hundred ways if you mean business youll want a wife when i came into the property i should have been lost without your mother bill i thought this was coming sir william with a certain geniality my dear fellow i dont want to put a pistol to your head youve had a slack rein so far ive never objected to your sowing a few wild oatsso long as you er unseen by sir william bill makes a sudden movement short of that at all events ive not inquired into your affairs i can only judge by the er pecuniary evidence youve been good enough to afford me from time to time i imagine youve lived like a good many young men in your position im not blaming you but theres a time for all things bill why dont you say outright that you want me to marry mabel lanfarne sits william well i do girls a nice one good family got a little money rides well isnt she goodlooking

you into this particular marriage if you dont care for miss lanfarne marry a girl youre fond of bill i refuse sir william in that case you know what to look out for with a sudden rush of choler you young he checks himself and stands glaring at bill who glares back at him this means i suppose that youve got some entanglement or other bill suppose what you like sir sits william i warn you if you play the blackguard bill you cant force me like young dunning hearing the raised voices lady cheshire has come back from the billiardroom lady cheshire closing the door what is it sir william you deliberately refuse go away dorothy lady cheshire resolutely i havent seen bill for two months sir william what hesitating well we must talk it over again lady cheshire come to the billiardroom both of you bill do finish those letters with a deft movement she draws sir william toward the billiardroom and glances back at bill before going out but he has turned to the writingtable when the door is closed bill looks into the drawingroom them opens the door under the stairs and backing away towards the writingtable sits down there and takes up a pen freda who has evidently been waiting comes in and stands by the table bill i say this is dangerous you know freda yes but i must bill well then with natural recklessness arent you going to kiss me without moving she looks at him with a sort of miserable inquiry bill do you know you havent seen me for eight weeks freda quite long enough for you to have forgotten bill forgotten i dont forget people so soon freda no bill whats the matter with you freda freda after a long look itll never be as it was bill jumping up how dyou mean freda ive got something for you she takes a diamond ring out of her dress and holds it out to him ive not worn

her head bill good god freda father brought me up not to whine like the puppies when they hold them up by their tails with a sudden break in her voice oh bill bill with his head down seizing her hands freda he breaks away from her towards the fire good god she stands looking at him then quietly slips away by the door under the staircase bill turns to speak to her and sees that she has gone he walks up to the fireplace and grips the mantelpiece bill by jove this is the curtain falls act ii the scene is lady cheshires morning room at ten oclock on the following day it is a pretty room with white

terrible bill the governor had better know lady cheshire oh no not yet bill waiting wont cure it the door from the corridor is thrown open christine and dot run in with their copies of the play in their hands seeing that something is wrong they stand still after a look at his mother bill turns abruptly and goes back into the workroom lady cheshire moves towards the window joan following her

speaks suddenly mabel lanfarne goes towards him holding out her hand bill does not take her hand but bows then after a swift glance at the girls faces mabel goes out into the corridor and the three

way hypnotised by their private longing for what christine has been urging they have all fixed their eyes on lady cheshire who looks from face to face and moves her hands as if in physical pain christine softly mother lady cheshire suddenly rises looking towards the billiardroom door listening they all follow her eyes she sits down again passing her hand over her lips as sir william enters his hunting clothes are splashed his face very grim and set he walks to the fore without a glance at any one and stands looking down into it very quietly every one but lady cheshire steals away lady cheshire what have you done sir william you there lady cheshire dont keep me in suspense sir william the fool my god dorothy i didnt think i had a blackguard for a son who was a fool into the bargain lady cheshire rising if he were a blackguard he would not be what you call a fool sir william after staring angrily makes her a slight bow very well lady cheshire in a low voice bill dont be harsh its all too terrible sir william sit down my dear she resumes her seat and he turns back to the fire sir william in all my life ive never been face to face with a thing like this gripping the mantelpiece

mantelpiece it breaks with the pressure of his hand and falls into the fireplace while he stands looking at it blankly there is a knock sir william come in freda enters from the corridor sir william ive asked you to be good enough to come in order that pointing to chair you may sit down but though she advances two or three steps she does not sit down sir william this is a sad business freda below her breath yes sir william sir william becoming conscious of the depths of feeling before him i er are you attached to my son freda in a whisper yes sir william its very painful to me to have to do this he turns away from her and speaks to the fire i sent for you to ask quickly how old are you freda twentytwo sir william more resolutely do you expect me to sanction such a mad idea as a marriage freda i dont expect anything sir william you know you havent earned the right to be considered freda not yet sir william what that oughtnt to help you on the contrary now brace yourself up and listen

with a silencing gesture at the same time what made you forget yourself youve no excuse you know freda no sir william youll deserve all youll get confound it to expect me to its intolerable do you

motionless looking at him he turns abruptly and opens the billiardroom door ill speak to him first come in here please to freda go in and wait lady cheshire and bill come in and freda passing them goes into the billiardroom to wait sir william speaking with a pause between each sentence your mother and i have spoken of this calamity i imagine that even you have some dim perception of the monstrous nature of it i must tell you this if you do this mad thing you fend for yourself youll receive nothing from me now or hereafter i consider that only due to the position our family has always held here your brother will take your place we shall get on as best we can without you there is a dead silence till he adds sharply well bill i shall marry her lady cheshire oh bill without lovewithout anything bill all right mother to sir william youve mistaken your man sir because im a rotter in one way im not necessarily a rotter in all you put the butt end of the pistol to dunnings head yesterday you put the other end to mine today well he turns round to go out let the d d thing off lady cheshire bill bill turning to her im not going to leave her in the lurch sir william do me the justice to admit that i have not attempted to persuade you to bill no youve chucked me out i dont see what else you could have done under the circumstances its quite all right but if you wanted me to throw her over father you went the wrong way to work thats all neither you nor i are very good at seeing consequences sir william do you realise your position bilk grimly ive a fair notion of it sir william with a sudden outburst you have none not the faintest brought up as youve been bill i didnt bring myself up sir william with a movement of uncontrolled anger to which his son responds you ungrateful young dog lady cheshire how can you both they drop their eyes and stand silent sir william with grimly suppressed emotion i am speaking under the stress of very great pain some consideration is due to me this is a disaster which i never expected to have to face it is a matter which i naturally can never hope to forget i shall carry this down to my death we shall all of us do that i have had the misfortune all my life to believe in our position here to believe that we counted for something that the country wanted us i have tried to do my duty by that position i find in one moment that it is gone smoke gone my philosophy is not equal to that to countenance this marriage would be unnatural bill i know im sorry ive got her into this i dont see any other way out its a bad business for me father as well as for you he stops seeing that jackson has route in and is standing there waiting jackson will you speak to studdenham sir william its about young dunning after a

studdenham come here you freda moves a few steps towards her father when did you start this freda almost inaudibly in the summer father lady cheshire dont be harsh to her studdenham harsh his eyes

it was hard for him here i thought he goes up to her stays a moment looking down then bends and kisses her hungrily seelchen art thou angry he does not answer but turning out the lamp goes into an inner room seelchen sits gazing through the window at the peaks bathed in full moonlight then drawing the blankets about her she snuggles doom on the window seat seelchen in a sleepy voice they kissed me both she sleeps the scene falls quite dark scene ii the scene is slowly illumined as by dawn seelchen is still lying on the window seat she sits up freeing her face and hands from the blankets changing the swathings of deep sleep for the filmy coverings of a dream the wall of the hut has vanished there is nothing between her and the three mountains veiled in mist save a through of darkness there as the peaks of the mountains brighten they are seen to have great faces seelchen oh they have faces the face of the wine horn is the profile of a beardless youth the face of the cow horn is that of a mountain shepherd solemn and broom with fierce black eyes and a black beard between them the great horn whose hair is of snow has a high beardless visage as of carved bronze like a male sphinx serene without cruelty far down below the faces of the peaks above the trough of darkness are peeping out the four little heads of the flowers of edelweiss and gentian mountain dandelion and alpenrose on their heads are crowns made of their several flowers all powdered with dewdrops and when the flowers lift their childfaces little tinkling bells ring all around the peaks there is nothing but blue sky edelweiss in a tiny voice would you would you would you ah ha gentian m dandelion alpenrose with their bells ranging enviously oooooo from behind the cow horn are heard the voices of cowbells and mountain air clinkelclink clinkelclink mountain air mountain air from behind the wine horn rise the rival voices of view of italy flume of steam and things in books i am italy italy see me steam in the distance o remember the things in books and all call out together very softly with the flowers ringing their bells then far away like an echo comes a sighing mountain air mountain air and suddenly the peak of the cow horn speaks in a voice as of one unaccustomed the cow horn amongst kine and my blackbrown sheep i live i am silence and monotony i am the solemn hills i am fierceness and the mountain wind clean pasture and wild rest look in my eyes love me alone seelchen breathless the cow horn he is speaking for felsman and the mountains it is the half of my heart the flowers laugh happily the cow horn i stalk the eternal hills i drink the mountain snows my eyes are the colour of burned wine in them lives melancholy the lowing of the kine the wind the sound of falling rocks the running of the torrents no other talk know i thoughts simple and blood hot strength huge the cloak of gravity seelchen yes yes i want him he is strong the voices of cowbells and mountain air cry out together clinkelclink clinkelclink mountain air mountain air the cow horn little soul hold to me love me live with me under the stars seelchen below her breath i am afraid and suddenly the peak of the wine horn speaks in a youths voice the wine horn i am the will o the wisp that dances thro the streets i am the cooing dove of towns from the plane trees and the chestnuts shade from day to day all changes where i burn my incense to my thousand little gods in white palaces i dwell and passionate dark alleys the life of men in crowds is mine of lamplight in the streets at dawn softly i have a thousand loves and never one too long for i am nimbler than your heifers playing in the sunshine the flowers ringing in alarm cry we know them the wine horn i hear the rustlings of the birth and death of pleasure and the rattling of swift wheels i hear the hungry oaths of men and love kisses in the airless night without me little soul you starve and die seelchen he is speaking for the gentle sir and the big world of the town it pulls my heart the wine horn my thoughts surpass in number the flowers in your meadows they fly more swiftly than your eagles on the wind i drink the wine of aspiration and the drug of disillusion thus am i never dull the voices of view of italy flume of steam and things in books are heard calling out together i am italy italy see me steam in the distance o remember remember the wine horn love me little soul i paint life fifty colours i make a thousand pretty things i twine about your heart seelchen he is honey the flowers ring their bells jealously and cry bitter bitter the cow horn stay with me seelchen i wake thee with the crystal air the voices of cowbells and mountain air tiny out far away clinkelclink clinkelclink mountain air mountain air and the flowers laugh happily the wine horn come with me seelchen my fan variety shall wake you the voices of view of italy flume of steam and things in books chant softly i am italy italy see me steam in the distance o remember remember and the flowers moan seelchen in grief my heart it is torn the wine horn with me little soul you shall race in the streets and peep at all secrets we will hold hands and fly like the thistledown m dandelion my puffballs fly faster the wine horn i will show you the sea gentian my blue is deeper the wine horn i will shower on you blushes alpenrose i can blush redder the wine horn little soul listen my jewels silk velvet edelweiss i am softer than velvet the wine horn proudly my wonderful rags the flowers moaning of those we have none seelchen he has all things the cow horn mine are the clouds with the dark silvered wings mine are the rocks on fire with the sun and the dewdrops cooler than pearls away from my breath of snow and sweet grass thou wilt droop little soul the wine horn the dark clove is my fragrance the flowers ring eagerly and turning up their faces cry we too smell sweet but the voices of view of italy flume of steam and things in books cry out i am italy italy see me steam in the distance o remember remember seelchen distracted oh it is hard the cow horn i will never desert thee the wine horn a hundred times i will desert you a hundred times come back and kiss you seelchen whispering peace for my heart the cow horn with me thou shalt lie on the warm wild thyme the flowers laugh happily the wine horn with me you shall lie on a bed of doves feathers the flowers moan the wine horn i will give you old wine the cow horn i will give thee new milk the wine horn hear my song from far away comes the sound as of mandolins seelchen clasping her breast my heart it is leaving me the cow horn hear my song from the distance floats the piping of a shepherds reed seelchen curving her hand at her ears the piping ah the cow horn stay with me seelchen the wine horn come with me seelchen the cow horn i give thee certainty the wine horn i give you chance the cow horn i give thee peace the wine horn i give you change the cow horn i give thee stillness the wine horn i give you voice the cow horn i give thee one love the wine horn i give you many seelchen as if the words were torn from her heart both both i will love and suddenly the peak of the great horn speaks the great horn and both thou shalt love little soul thou shalt lie on the hills with silence and dance in the cities with knowledge both shall possess thee the sun and the moon on the mountains shall burn thee the lamps of the town singe thy wings small moth each shall seem all the world to thee each shall seem as thy grave thy heart is a feather blown from one mouth to the other but be not afraid for the life of a man is for all loves in turn tis a little raft moored then sailing out into the blue a tune caught in a hush then whispering on a newborn babe half courage and half sleep there is a hidden rhythm change quietude chance certainty the one the many burn on thou pretty flame trying to eat the world thou shaft come to me at last my little soul the voices and the flowerbells peal out seelchen enraptured stretches her arms to embrace the sight and sound but all fades slowly into dark sleep scene iii the dark scene again becomes glamorous seelchen is seen with her hand stretched out towards the piazza of a little town with a plane tree on one side a wall on the other and from the open doorway of an inn a pale path of light over the inn hangs a full golden moon against the wall under the glimmer of a lamp leans a youth with the face of the wine horn in a crimson dock thrumming a mandolin and singing little star soul through the frost fields of night roaming alone disconsolate from out the cold i call thee in striking my dark mandolin beneath this moon of gold from the inn comes a burst of laughter and the sound of dancing seelchen whispering it is the big world the youth of the wine horn sings on pretty grey moth where the strange candles shine seeking for warmth so desperate ah fluttering dove i bid thee win striking my dark mandolin the crimson flame of love seelchen gazing enraptured at the inn they are dancing as she speaks from either side come mothchildren meeting and fluttering up the path of light to the inn doorway then wheeling aside they form again and again flutter forward seelchen holding out her hands they are real their wings are windy the youth of the wine horn sings on lips of my song to the white maidens heart go ye and whisper passionate these words that burn o listening one love that flieth past is gone nor ever may return seelchen runs towards him but the light above him fades he has become shadow she turns bewildered to the dancing moth children but they vanish before her at the door of the inn stands lamond in a dark cloak seelchen it is you lamond without my little soul i am cold come he holds out his arms to her seelchen shall i be safe lamond what is safety are you safe in your mountains seelchen where am i here lamond the town smiling he points to the doorway and silent as shadows there come dancing out two by two two girls and two youths the first girl is dressed in white satin and jewels and the first youth in black velvet the second girl is in rags and a shawl and the second youth in shirt and corduroys they dance gravely each couple as if in a world apart seelchen whispering in the mountains all dance together do they never change partners lamond how could they little one those are rich these poor but see a corybantic couple come dancing forth the girl has bare limbs a flamecoloured shift and hair bound with red flowers the youth wears a pantherskin they pursue not only each other but the other girls and youths for a moment all is a furious medley then the corybantic couple vanish into the inn and the first two couples are left slowly solemnly dancing apart from each other as before seelchen shuddering shall i one day dance like that the youth of the wine horn appears again beneath the lamp he strikes a loud chord then as seelchen moves towards that sound the lamp goes out there is again only blue shadow but the couples have disappeared into the inn and the doorway has grown dark seelchen ah what i do not like he will not let me see lamond will you not come then little soul seelchen always to dance lamond not so the shutters of the houses are suddenly thrown wide in a lighted room on one aide of the inn are seen two pale men and a woman amongst many clicking machines on the other side of the inn in a forge are visible two women and a man but half clothed making chains seelchen recoiling from both sights in turn how sad they look all what are they making in the dark doorway of the inn a light shines out and in it is seen a figure visible only from the waist up clad in goldcloth studded with jewels with a flushed complacent face holding in one hand a glass of golden wine seelchen it is beautiful what is it lamond luxury seelchen what is it standing on i cannot see unseen the wine horns mandolin twangs out lamond for that do not look little soul seelchen can it not walk he shakes his head is that all they make here with their sadness but again the mandolin twangs out the shutters fall over the houses the door of the inn grows dark lamond what is it then you would have is it learning there are books here that piled on each other would reach to the stars but seelchen shakes her head there is religion so deep that no man knows what it means but seelchen shakes her head there is religion so shallow you may have it by turning a handle we have everything seelchen is god here lamond who knows is god with your goats but seelchen shakes her head what then do you want seelchen life the mandolin twangs out lamond pointing to his breast there is but one road to life seelchen ah but i do not love lamond when a feather dies is it not loving the wind the unknown when the day brings not new things we are children of sorrow if darkness and light did not change could we breathe child to live is to love to love is to liveseeking for wonder and as she draws nearer see to love is to peer over the edge and spying the little grey flower to climb down it has wings it has flown again you must climb it shivers tis but air in your hand you must crawl you must cling you must leap and still it is there and not there for the grey flower flits like a moth and the wind of its wings is all you shall catch but your eyes shall be shining your cheeks shall be burning your breast shall be panting ah little heart the scene falls darker and when the night comes there it is still thistledown blown on the dark and your white hands will reach for it and your honey breath waft it and never never shall you grasp that wanton thing but life shall be lovely his voice dies to a whisper he stretches out his arms seelchen touching his breast i will come lamond drawing her to the dark doorway love me seelchen i love the mandolin twangs out the doorway for a moment is all glamorous and they pass through illumined by the glimmer of the lamp the youth of the wine hour is seen again and slowly to the chords of his mandolin he begins to sing the windy hours through darkness fly canst hear them little heart new loves are born and old loves die and kissing lips must part the dusky bees of passing years canst see them soul of mine from flower and flower supping tears and pale sweet honey wine his voice grown strange and passionate o flame that treads the marsh of time flitting for ever low where through the black enchanted slime we desperate following go untimely fire we bid thee stay into dark air above the golden gipsy thins away so has it been with love while he is singing the moon grows pale and dies it falls dark save for the glimmer of the lamp beneath which he stands but as his song ends the dawn breaks over the houses the lamp goes out the wine horn becomes shadow then from the doorway of the inn in the shrill grey light seelchen comes forth she is pale as if wan with living her eyes like pitch against the powdery whiteness of her face seelchen my heart is old but as she speaks from far away is heard a faint chiming of cowbells and while she stands listening lamond appears in the doorway of the inn lamond little soul seelchen you always you lamond i have new wonders seelchen mournfully no lamond i swear it you have not tired of me that am never the same it cannot be seelchen listen the chime of the cowbells is heard again lamond jealously the music of dull sleep has life then with me been sorrow seelchen i do not regret lamond come seelchen pointingto her breast the bird is tired with flying touching her lips the flowers have no dew lamond would you leave me seelchen see there in a streak of the dawn against the plane tree is seen the shepherd of the cow horn standing wrapped in his mountain cloak lamond what is it seelchen he lamond there is nothing he holds her fast i have shown you the marvels of my town the gay the bitter wonders we have known life if with you i may no longer live then let us die see here are sweet deaths by slumber and by drowning the mandolin twangs out and from the dim doorway of the inn come forth the shadowy forms death by slumber and death by drowning who to a ghostly twanging of mandolins dance slowly towards seelchen stand smiling at her and as slowly dance away seelchen following yes they are good and sweet while she moves towards the inn lamonds face becomes transfigured with joy but just as she reaches the doorway there is a distant chiming of bells and blowing of pipes and the shepherd of the cow horn sings to the wild grass come and the dull far roar of the falling rock to the flowery meads of thy mountain home where the eagles soar and the grizzled flock in the sunshine feeds to the alp where i in the pale light crowned with the moons thin horns to my pasture roam to the silent sky and the wistful sound of the rosy dawns my daughter come while he sings the sun has risen and seelchen has turned with parted lips and hands stretched out and the forms of death have vanished seelchen i come lamond clasping her knees little soul must i then die like a gnat when the sun goes down without you i am nothing seelchen releasing herself poor heart i am gone lamond it is dark he covers his face with his cloak then as seelchen reaches the shepherd of the cow horn there is blown a long note of a pipe the scene falls back and there rises a far continual mingled sound of cowbells and flower bells and pipes scene iv the scene slowly brightens with the misty flush of dawn seelchen stands on a green alp with all around nothing but blue sky a slip of a crescent moon is lying on her back on a low rock sits a brown faced goatherd blowing on a pipe and the four flowerchildren are dancing in their shifts of grey white and blue rosepink and burntgold their bells are ringing as they pelt each other with flowers of their own colours and each in turn wheeling flings one flower at seelchen who puts them to her lips and eyes seelchen the dew she moves towards the rock goatherd but the flowers encircle him and when they wheel away he has vanished she turns to the flowers but they too vanish the veils of mist are rising seelchen gone she rubs her eyes then turning once more to the rock sees felsman standing there with his arms folded thou felsman so thou hast come like a sick heifer to be healed was it good in the town that kept thee so long seelchen i do not regret felsman why then return seelchen i was tired felsman never again shalt thou go from me seelchen mocking with what wilt thou keep me felsman grasping her thus seelchen i have known change i am no timid maid felsman moodily aye thou art different thine eyes are hollow thou art whitefaced seelchen still mocking then what hast thou here that shall keep me felsman the sun seelchen to burn me felsman the air there is a faint wailing of wind seelchen to freeze me felsman the silence the noise of the wind dies away seelchen yes it is lonely felsman wait and the flowers shall dance to thee and to a ringing of their bells the flowers come dancing till one by one they cease and sink down nodding falling asleep seelchen see even they grow sleepy here felsman i will call the goats to wake them the goatherd is seen again sitting upright on his rock and piping and there come four little brown wildeyed naked boys with goats legs and feet who dance gravely in and out of the sleeping flowers and the flowers wake spring up and fly till each goat catching his flower has vanished and the goatherd has ceased to pipe and lies motionless again on his rock felsman love me seelchen thou art rude felsman love me seelchen thou art grim felsman aye i have no silver tongue listen this is my voice sweeping his arm round all the still alp it is quiet from dawn to the first star all is fast laying his hand on her heart and the wings of the birds shall be still seelchen touching his eyes thine eyes are fierce in them i see the wild beasts crouching in them i see the distance are they always fierce felsman never to look on thee my flower seelchen touching his hands thy hands are rough to pluck flowers she breaks away from him to the rock where the goatherd is lying see nothing moves the very day stands still boy but the goatherd neither stirs nor answers he is lost in the blue passionately boy he will not answer me no one will answer me here felsman with fierce longing am i then no one seelchen thou the scene darkens with evening see sleep has stolen the day it is night already there come the female shadow forms of sleep in grey cobweb garments waving their arms drowsily wheeling round her seelchen are you sleep dear sleep smiling she holds out her arms to felsman he takes her swaying form they vanish encircled by the forms of sleep it is dark save for the light of the thin horned moon suddenly grown bright then on his rock to a faint gaping the goatherd sings my goat my little speckled one my yelloweyed sweetsmelling let moon and wind and golden sun and stars beyond all telling make every day a sweeter grass and multiply thy leaping and may the mountain foxes pass and never scent thee sleeping oh let my pipe be clear and far and let me find sweet water no hawk nor udderseeking jar come near thee little daughter may fiery rocks defend at noon thy tender feet from slipping oh hear my prayer beneath the moon great master goatgod skipping there passes in the thin moonlight the goatgood pan and with a long wail of the pipe the goatherd boy is silent then the moon fades and all is black till in the faint grisly light of the false dawn creeping up seelchen is seen rising from the side of the sleeping felsman the goatherd boy has gone but by the rock stands the shepherd of the cow horn in his dock seelchen years years i have slept my spirit is hungry then as she sees the shepherd of the cow horn standing there i know thee now life of the earth the smell of thee the sight of thee the taste of thee and all thy music i have passed thee and gone by she moves away felsman waking where wouldst thou go seelchen to the edge of the world felsman rising and trying to stay her thou shalt not leave me but against her smiling gesture he struggles as though against solidity seelchen friend the time is on me felsman were my kisses then too rude was i too dull seelchen i do not regret the youth of the wine horn is seen suddenly standing opposite the motionless shepherd of the cow horn and his mandolin twangs out felsman the cursed music of the town is it back to him thou wilt go groping for sight of the hated figure i cannot see seelchen fear not i go ever onward felsman do not leave me to the wind in the rocks without thee love is dead and i must die seelchen poor heart i am gone felsman crouching against the rock it is cold at the blowing of the shepherds pipe the cow horn stretches forth his hand to her the mandolin twangs out and the wine horn holds out his hand she stands unmoving seelchen companions i must go in a moment it will be dawn in silence the cow horn and the wine horn cover their faces the false dawn dies it falls quite dark scene v then a faint glow stealing up lights the snowy head of the great horn and streams forth on seelchen to either aide of that path of light like shadows the cow horn and the wine horn stand with cloaked heads seelchen great one i come the peak of the great horn speaks in a faraway voice growing with the light clearer and stronger wandering flame thou restless fever burning all things regretting none the winds of fate are stilled for ever thy little generous life is done and all its wistful wonderings cease thou traveller to the tideless sea where light and dark and change and peace are one come little soul to mystery seelchen falling on her knees bows her head to the ground the glow slowly fades till the scene is black scene vi then as the blackness lifts in the dim light of the false dawn filtering through the window of the mountain hut lamond and felsman are seen standing beside seelchen looking down at her asleep on the window seat felsman putting out his hand to wake her in a moment it will be dawn she stirs and her lips move murmuring lamond let her sleep shes dreaming felsman raises a lantern till its light falls on her face then the two men move stealthily towards the door and as she speaks pass out seelchen rising to her knees and stretching out her hands with ecstasy great one i come waking she looks around and struggles to her feet my little dream

the outer office sweedle putting his head in theres some children outside here ruth theyre mine please sweedle shall i hold them in check ruth theyre quite small sir she takes a step towards cokeson

that bit of common ground cokeson we neednt worry about that were the right side of the law walter i dont like it cokeson with an indulgent smile we shant want to set ourselves up against the law your father wouldnt waste his time doing that as he speaks james how comes in from the partners room he is a shortish man with white sidewhiskers plentiful grey hair shrewd eyes and gold pincenez james

poor young wife i liked the young man dear oh dear in this office walter shall i go to the bank and ask the cashier james grimly bring him round here and ring up scotland yard walter really he goes

cokeson looking at him over his spectacles i dont quite take you sir james your story would sound dd thin to any one who didnt know you cokeson yees he laughs then with a sudden gravity im sorry for that young man i feel it as if it was my own son mr james james a nasty business cokeson it unsettles you all goes on regular and then a thing like this happens shant relish my lunch today james as bad as that cokeson cokeson it makes you think confidentially he must have had temptation james not so fast we havent convicted him yet cokeson id sooner have lost a months salary than had this happen he broods james i hope that fellow will hurry up cokeson keeping things pleasant for the cashier it isnt fifty yards mr james he wont be a minute james the idea of dishonesty about this office it hits me hard cokeson he goes towards the door of the partners room sweedle entering quietly to cokeson in a low voice shes popped up again sirsomething she forgot to say to falder cokeson roused from his abstraction eh impossible send her away james whats that cokeson nothing mr james a private matter here ill come myself he goes into the outer office as james passes into the partners room now you

entering with the cashier passes ruth as she leaves the outer office cokeson to the cashier who resembles a sedentary dragoon goodmorning to walter your fathers in there walter crosses and goes into the partners room cokeson its a nahsty unpleasant little matter mr cowley im quite ashamed to have to trouble you cowley i remember the cheque quite well as if it were a liver seemed in perfect order cokeson sit down wont you im not a sensitive man but a thing like this about the place its not nice i like people to be open and jolly together cowley quite so cokeson buttonholing him and glancing toward the partners room of course hes a young man ive told him about it before now leaving space after his figures but he will do it cowley i should remember the persons face quite a youth cokeson i dont think we shall be able to show him to you as a matter of fact james and walter have come back from the partners room james goodmorning mr cowley youve seen my son and myself youve seen mr cokeson and youve seen sweedle my officeboy it was none of us i take it the cashier shakes his head with a smile james be so good as to sit there cokeson engage mr cowley in conversation will you he goes toward falders room cokeson just a word mr james james well cokeson you dont want to upset the young man in there do you hes a nervous young feller james this must be thoroughly cleared up cokeson for the sake of falders name to say nothing of yours cokeson with some dignity thatll look after itself sir hes been upset once this morning i dont want him startled again james its a matter of form but i cant stand upon niceness over a thing like this too serious just talk to mr cowley he opens the door of falders room james bring in the papers in boulters lease will you falder cokeson bursting into voice do you keep dogs the cashier with his eyes fixed on the door does not answer cokeson you havent such a thing as a bulldog pup you could spare me i suppose at the look on the cashiers face his jaw drops and he turns to see falder standing in the doorway with his eyes fixed on cowley like the eyes of a rabbit fastened on a snake falder advancing with the papers here they are sir james taking them thank you falder do you want me sir james no thanks falder turns and goes back into his own room as he shuts the door james gives the cashier an interrogative look and the cashier nods james sure this isnt as we suspected cowley quite he knew me i suppose he cant slip out of that room cokeson gloomily theres only the window a whole floor and a basement the door of falders room is quietly opened and falder with his hat in his hand moves towards the door of the outer office james quietly where are you going falder falder to have my lunch sir james wait a few minutes would you i want to speak to you about this lease falder yes sir he goes back into his room cowley if im wanted i can swear thats the young man who cashed the cheque it was the last cheque i handled that morning before my lunch these are the numbers of the notes he had he puts a slip of paper on the table then brushing his hat round goodmorning james goodmorning mr cowley cowley to cokeson goodmorning cokeson with stupefaction goodmorning the cashier goes out through the outer office cokeson sits down in his chair as though it were the only place left in the morass of his feelings walter what are you going to do james have him in give me the cheque and the counterfoil cokeson i dont understand i thought young davis james we shall see walter one moment father have you thought it out james call him in cokeson rising with difficulty and opening falders door hoarsely step in here a minute falder impassively yes sir james turning to him suddenly with the cheque held out you know this cheque falder falder no sir jades look at it you cashed it last friday week falder oh yes sir that one davis gave it me james i know and you gave davis the cash falder yes sir james when davis gave you the cheque was it exactly like this falder yes i think so sir james you know that mr walter drew that cheque for nine pounds falder no sir ninety james nine falder falder faintly i dont understand sir james the suggestion of course is that the cheque was altered whether by you or davis is the question falder i i cokeson take your time take your time falder regaining his impassivity not by me sir james the cheque was handed to cokeson by mr walter at one oclock we know that because mr cokesons lunch had just arrived cokeson i couldnt leave it james exactly he therefore gave the cheque to davis it was cashed by you at we know that because the cashier recollects it for the last cheque he handled before his lunch falder yes sir davis gave it to me because some friends were giving him a farewell luncheon james puzzled you accuse davis then falder i dont know sir its very funny walter who has come close to his father says something to him in a low voice james davis was not here again after that saturday was he cokeson anxious to be of assistance to the young man and seeing faint signs of their all being jolly once more no he sailed on the monday james was he falder falder very faintly no sir james very well then how do you account for the fact that this nought was added to the nine in the counterfoil on or after tuesday cokeson surprised hows that falder gives a sort of lurch he tries to pull himself together but he has gone all to pieces james very grimly out im afraid cokeson the chequebook remained in mr walters pocket till he came back from trenton on tuesday morning in the face of this falder do you still deny that you altered both cheque and counterfoil falder no sir no mr how i did it sir i did it cokeson succumbing to his feelings dear dear what a thing to do falder i wanted the money so badly sir i didnt know what i was doing cokeson however such a thing could have come into your head falder grasping at the words i cant think sir really it was just a minute of madness james a long minute falder tapping the counterfoil four days at least falder sir i swear i didnt know what id done till afterwards and then i hadnt the pluck oh sir look over it ill pay the money back i will i promise james go into your room falder with a swift imploring look goes back into his room there is silence james about as bad a case as there could be cokeson to break the law like thatin here walter whats to be done james nothing for it prosecute walter its his first offence james shaking his head ive grave doubts of that too neat a piece of swindling altogether cokeson i shouldnt be surprised if he was tempted james lifes one long temptation cokeson cokeson yees but im speaking of the flesh and the devil mr james there was a woman come to see him this morning walter the woman we passed as we came in just now is it his wife cokeson no no relation restraining what in jollier circumstances would have been a wink a married person though walter how do you know cokeson brought her children scandalised there they were outside the office james a real bad egg walter i should like to give him a chance james i cant forgive him for the sneaky way be went to work counting on our suspecting young davis if the matter came to light it was the merest accident the chequebook stayed in your pocket walter it must have been the temptation of a moment he hadnt time james a man doesnt succumb like that in a moment if hes a clean mind and habits hes rotten got the eyes of a man who cant keep his hands off when theres money about walter dryly we hadnt noticed that before james brushing the remark aside ive seen lots of those fellows in my time no doing anything with them except to keep em out of harms way theyve got a blind spat walter its penal servitude cokeson theyre nahsty placesprisons james hesitating i dont see how its possible to spare him out of the question to keep him in this office honestys the sine qua non cokeson hypnotised of course it is james equally out of the question to send him out amongst people whove no knowledge of his character one must think of society walter but to brand him like this james if it had been a straightforward case id give him another chance its far from that he has dissolute habits cokeson i didnt say that extenuating circumstances james same thing hes gone to work in the most coldblooded way to defraud his employers and cast the blame on an innocent man if thats not a case for the law to take its course i dont know what is walter for the sake of his future though james sarcastically according to you no one would ever prosecute walter nettled i hate the idea of it cokeson thats rather ex parte mr walter we must have protection james this is degenerating into talk he moves towards the partners room walter put yourself in his place father james you ask too much of me walter we cant possibly tell the pressure there was on him james you may depend on it my boy if a man is going to do this sort of thing hell do it pressure or no pressure if he isnt nothingll make him walter hell never do it again cokeson fatuously spose i were to have a talk with him we dont want to be hard on the young man james thatll do cokeson ive made up my mind he passes into the partners room cokeson after a doubtful moment we must excuse your father i dont want to go against your father if he thinks it right walter confound it cokeson why dont you back me up you know you feel cokeson on his dignity i really cant say what i feel walter we shall regret it cokeson he must have known what he was doing walter bitterly the quality of mercy is not strained cokeson looking at him askance come come mr walter we must try and see it sensible sweedle entering with a tray your lunch sir cokeson put it down while sweedle is putting it down on cokesons table the detective wister enters the outer office and finding no one there comes to the inner doorway he is a square mediumsized man cleanshaved in a serviceable blue serge suit and strong boots cokeson hoarsely here here what are we doing wister to walter from scotland yard sir detectivesergeant blister walter askance very well ill speak to my father he goes into the partners room james enters james morning in answer to an appealing gesture from cokeson im sorry id stop short of this if i felt i could open that door sweedle wondering and scared opens it come here mr falder as falder comes shrinkingly out the detective in obedience to a sign from james slips his hand out and grasps his arm falder recoiling oh no oh no walter come come theres a good lad james i charge him with felony falter oh sir theres some one i did it for her let me be till tomorrow james motions with his hand at that sign of hardness falder becomes rigid then turning he goes out quietly in the detectives grip james follows stiff and erect sweedle rushing to the door with open mouth pursues them through the outer office into the corridor when they have all disappeared cokeson spins completely round and makes a rush for the outer office cokeson hoarsely here what are we doing there is silence he takes out his handkerchief and mops the sweat from his face going back blindly to his table sits down and stares blankly at his lunch the curtain falls act ii a court of justice on a foggy october afternoon crowded with barristers solicitors reporters ushers and jurymen sitting in the large solid dock is falder with a warder on either side of him placed there for his safe custody but seemingly indifferent to and unconscious of his presence falder is sitting exactly opposite to the judge who raised above the clamour of the court also seems unconscious of and indifferent to everything harold cleaver the counsel for the crown is a dried yellowish man of more than middle age in a wig worn almost to the colour of his face hector frome the counsel for the defence is a young tall man clean shaved in a very white wig among the spectators having already given their evidence are james and walter how and cowley the cashier wister the detective is just leaving the witnessbox cleaver that is the case for the crown me lud gathering his robes together he sits down frome rising and bowing to the judge if it please your lordship and gentlemen of the jury i am not going to dispute the fact that the prisoner altered this cheque but i am going to put before you evidence as to the condition of his mind and to submit that you would not be justified in finding that he was responsible for his actions at the time i am going to show you in fact that he did this in a moment of aberration amounting to temporary insanity caused by the violent distress under which he was labouring gentlemen the prisoner is only twentythree years old i shall call before you a woman from whom you will learn the events that led up to this act you will hear from her own lips the tragic circumstances of her life the still more tragic infatuation with which she has inspired the prisoner this woman gentlemen has been leading a miserable existence with a husband who habitually illuses her from whom she actually goes in terror of her life i am not of course saying that its either right or desirable for a young man to fall in love with a married woman or that its his business to rescue her from an ogrelike husband im not saying anything of the sort but we all know the power of the passion of love and i would ask you to remember gentlemen in listening to her evidence that married to a drunken and violent husband she has no power to get rid of him for as you know another offence besides violence is necessary to enable a woman to obtain a divorce and of this offence it does not appear that her husband is guilty judge is this relevant mr frome frome my lord i submit extremely i shall be able to show your lordship that directly judge very well frome in these circumstances what alternatives were left to her she could either go on living with this drunkard in terror of her life or she could apply to the court for a separation order well gentlemen my experience of such cases assures me that this would have given her very insufficient protection from the violence of such a man and even if effectual would very likely have reduced her either to the workhouse or the streets for its not easy as she is now finding for an unskilled woman without means of livelihood to support herself and her children without resorting either to the poor law or to speak quite plainly to the sale of her body judge you are ranging rather far mr frome frome i shall fire pointblank in a minute my lord judge let us hope so frome now gentlemen mark and this is what i have been leading up to this woman will tell you and the prisoner will confirm her that confronted with such alternatives she set her whole hopes on himself knowing the feeling with which she had inspired him she saw a way out of her misery by going with him to a new country where they would both be unknown and might pass as husband and wife this was a desperate and as my friend mr cleaver will no doubt call it an immoral resolution but as a fact the minds of both of them were constantly turned towards it one wrong is no excuse for another and those who are never likely to be faced by such a situation possibly have the right to hold up their hands as to that i prefer to say nothing but whatever view you take gentlemen of this part of the prisoners story whatever opinion you form of the right of these two young people under such circumstances to take the law into their own hands the fact remains that this young woman in her distress and this young man little more than a boy who was so devotedly attached to her did conceive this if you like reprehensible design of going away together now for that of course they required money and they had none as to the actual events of the morning of july th on which this cheque was altered the events on which i rely to prove the defendants irresponsibility i shall allow those events to speak for themselves through the lips of my witness robert cokeson he turns looks round takes up a sheet of paper and waits cokeson is summoned into court and goes into the witnessbox holding his hat before him the oath is administered to him frome what is your name cokeson robert cokeson frome are you managing clerk to the firm of solicitors who employ the prisoner cokeson yees frome how long had the prisoner been in their employ cokeson two years no im wrong there all but seventeen days frome had you him under your eye all that time cokeson except sundays and holidays frome quite so let us hear please what you have to say about his general character during those two years cokeson confidentially to the jury and as if a little surprised at being asked he was a nice pleasantspoken young man id no fault to find with him quite the contrary it was a great surprise to me when he did a thing like that frome did he ever give you reason to suspect his honesty cokeson no to have dishonesty in our office thatd never do frome im sure the jury fully appreciate that mr cokeson cokeson every man of business knows that honestys the sign qua non frome do you give him a good character all round or do you not cokeson turning to the judge certainly we were all very jolly and pleasant together until this happened quite upset me frome now coming to the morning of the th of july the morning on which the cheque was altered what have you to say about his demeanour that morning cokeson to the jury if you ask me i dont think he was quite compos when he did it the judge sharply are you suggesting that he was insane cokeson not compos the judge a little more precision please frome smoothly just tell us mr cokeson cokeson somewhat outraged well in my opinion looking at the judge such as it is he was jumpy at the time the jury will understand my meaning frome will you tell us how you came to that conclusion cokeson yees i will i have my lunch in from the restaurant a chop and a potato saves time that day it happened to come just as mr walter how handed me the cheque well i like it hot so i went into the clerks office and i handed the cheque to davis the other clerk and told him to get change i noticed young falder walking up and down i said to him this is not the zoological gardens falder frome do you remember what he answered cokeson yees i wish to god it were struck me as funny frome did you notice anything else peculiar cokeson i did frome what was that cokeson his collar was unbuttoned now i like a young man to be neat i said to him your collars unbuttoned frome and what did he answer cokeson stared at me it wasnt nice the judge stared at you isnt that a very common practice cokeson yees but it was the look in his eyes i cant explain my meaning it was funny frome had you ever seen such a look in his eyes before cokeson no if i had i should have spoken to the partners we cant have anything eccentric in our profession the judge did you speak to them on that occasion cokeson confidentially well i didnt like to trouble them about prime facey evidence frome but it made a very distinct impression on your mind cokeson yees the clerk davis could have told you the same frome quite so its very unfortunate that weve not got him here now can you tell me of the morning on which the discovery of the forgery was made that would be the th did anything happen that morning cokeson with his hand to his ear im a little deaf frome was there anything in the course of that morning i mean before the discovery that caught your attention cokeson yees a woman the judge how is this relevant mr frome frome i am trying to establish the state of mind in which the prisoner committed this act my lord the judge i quite appreciate that but this was long after the act frome yes my lord but it contributes to my contention the judge well frome you say a woman do you mean that she came to the office cokeson yees frome what for cokeson asked to see young falder he was out at the moment frome did you see her cokeson i did frome did she come alone cokeson confidentially well there you put me in a difficulty i mustnt tell you what the officeboy told me frome quite so mr cokeson quite so cokeson breaking in with an air of you are young leave it to me but i think we can get round it in answer to a question put to her by a third party the woman said to me theyre mine sir the judge what are what were cokeson her children they were outside the judge how do you know cokeson your lordship mustnt ask me that or i shall have to tell you what i was told and thatd never do the judge smiling the officeboy made a statement cokeson eggzactly frome what i want to ask you mr cokeson is this in the course of her appeal to see falder did the woman say anything that you specially remember cokeson looking at him as if to encourage him to complete the sentence a leetle more sir frome or did she not cokeson she did i shouldnt like you to have led me to the answer frome with an irritated smile will you tell the jury what it was cokeson its a matter of life and death foreman of the jury do you mean the woman said that cokeson nodding its not the sort of thing you like to have said to you frome a little impatiently did falder come in while she was there cokeson nods and she saw him and went away cokeson ah there i cant follow you i didnt see her go frome well is she there now cokeson with an indulgent smile no frome thank you mr cokeson he sits down cleaver rising you say that on the morning of the forgery the prisoner was jumpy well now sir what precisely do you mean by that word cokeson indulgently i want you to understand have you ever seen a dog thats lost its master he was kind of everywhere at once with his eyes cleaver thank you i was coming to his eyes you called them funny what are we to understand by that strange or what cokeson yees funny cokeson sharply yes sir but what may be funny to you may not be funny to me or to the jury did they look frightened or shy or fierce or what cokeson you make it very hard for me i give you the word and you want me to give you another cleaver rapping his desk does funny mean mad cleaver not mad fun cleaver very well now you say he had his collar unbuttoned was it a hot day cokeson yees i think it was cleaver and did he button it when you called his attention to it cokeson yees i think he did cleaver would you say that that denoted insanity he sits downs cokeson who has opened his mouth to reply is left gaping frome rising hastily have you ever caught him in that dishevelled state before cokeson no he was always clean and quiet frome that will do thank you cokeson turns blandly to the judge as though to rebuke counsel for not remembering that the judge might wish to have a chance arriving at the conclusion that he is to be asked nothing further he turns and descends from the box and sits down next to james and walter frome ruth honeywill ruth comes into court and takes her stand stoically in the witnessbox she is sworn frome what is your name please ruth ruth honeywill frome how old are you ruth

trouble all the time frome you knew her husband falder only through her hes a brute the judge i cant allow indiscriminate abuse of a person not present frome bowing if your lordship pleases to falder you admit altering this cheque falder bows his head frome carry your mind please to the morning of friday july the th and tell the jury what happened falder turning to the jury i was having my breakfast when she came her dress was all torn and she was gasping and couldnt seem to get her breath at all there were the marks of his fingers round her throat her arm was bruised and the blood had got into her eyes dreadfully it frightened me and then when she told me i felt i felt well it was too much for me hardening suddenly if youd seen it having the feelings for her that i had youd have felt the same i know frome yes falder when she left me because i had to go to the office i was out of my senses for fear that hed do it again and thinking what i could do i couldnt work all the morning i was like that simply couldnt fix my mind on anything i couldnt think at all i seemed to have to keep moving when davis the other clerk gave me the cheque he said itll do you good will to have a run with this you seem half off your chump this morning then when i had it in my hand i dont know how it came but it just flashed across me that if i put the ty and the nought there would be the money to get her away it just came and went i never thought of it again then davis went out to his luncheon and i dont really remember what i did till id pushed the cheque through to the cashier under the rail i remember his saying gold or notes then i suppose i knew what id done anyway when i got outside i wanted to chuck myself under a bus i wanted to throw the money away but it seemed i was in for it so i thought at any rate id save her of course the tickets i took for the passage and the little i gave hers been wasted and all except what i was obliged to spend myself ive restored i keep thinking over and over however it was i came to do it and how i cant have it all again to do differently falder is silent twisting his hands before him frome how far is it from your office to the bank falder not more than fifty yards sir frome from the time davis went out to lunch to the time you cashed the cheque how long do you say it must have been falder it couldnt have been four minutes sir because i ran all the way frome during those four minutes you say you remember nothing falder no sir only that i ran frome not even adding the ty and the nought falder no sir i dont really frome sits down and cleaver rises cleaver but you remember running do you falder i was all out of breath when i got to the bank cleaver and you dont remember altering the cheque falder faintly no sir cleaver divested of the romantic glamour which my friend is casting over the case is this anything but an ordinary forgery come falder i was half frantic all that morning sir cleaver now now you dont deny that the ty and the nought were so like the rest of the handwriting as to thoroughly deceive the cashier falder it was an accident cleaver cheerfully queer sort of accident wasnt it on which day did you alter the counterfoil falder hanging his head on the wednesday morning cleaver was that an accident too falder faintly no cleaver to do that you had to watch your opportunity i suppose falder almost inaudibly yes cleaver you dont suggest that you were suffering under great excitement when you did that falder i was haunted cleaver with the fear of being found out falder very low yes the judge didnt it occur to you that the only thing for you to do was to confess to your employers and restore the money falder i was afraid there is silence cleaver you desired too no doubt to complete your design of taking this woman away falder when i found id done a thing like that to do it for nothing seemed so dreadful i might just as well have chucked myself into the river cleaver you knew that the clerk davis was about to leave england didnt it occur to you when you altered this cheque that suspicion would fall on him falder it was all done in a moment i thought of it afterwards cleaver and that didnt lead you to avow what youd done falder sullenly i meant to write when i got out there i would have repaid the money the judge but in the meantime your innocent fellow clerk might have been prosecuted falder i knew he was a long way off your lordship i thought thered be time i didnt think theyd find it out so soon frome i might remind your lordship that as mr walter how had the chequebook in his pocket till after davis had sailed if the discovery had been made only one day later falder himself would have left and suspicion would have attached to him and not to davis from the beginning the judge the question is whether the prisoner knew that suspicion would light on himself and not on davis to falder sharply did you know that mr walter how had the chequebook till after davis had sailed falder i i thought he the judge now speak the truthyes or no falder very low no my lord i had no means of knowing the judge that disposes of your point mr frome frome bows to the judge cleaver has any aberration of this nature ever attacked you before falder faintly no sir cleaver you had recovered sufficiently to go back to your work that afternoon falder yes i had to take the money back cleaver you mean the nine pounds your wits were sufficiently keen for you to remember that and you still persist in saying you dont remember altering this cheque he sits down falder if i hadnt been mad i should never have had the courage frome rising did you have your lunch before going back falder i never ate a thing all day and at night i couldnt sleep frome now as to the four minutes that elapsed between daviss going out and your cashing the cheque do you say that you recollect nothing during those four minutes falder after a moment i remember thinking of mr cokesons face frome of mr cokesons face had that any connection with what you were doing falder no sir frome was that in the office before you ran out falder yes and while i was running frome and that lasted till the cashier said will you have gold or notes falder yes and then i seemed to come to myself and it was too late frome thank you that closes the evidence for the defence my lord the judge nods and falder goes back to his seat in the dock frome gathering up notes if it please your lordship gentlemen of the jury my friend in crossexamination has shown a disposition to sneer at the defence which has been set up in this case and i am free to admit that nothing i can say will move you if the evidence has not already convinced you that the prisoner committed this act in a moment when to all practical intents and purposes he was not responsible for his actions a moment of such mental and moral vacuity arising from the violent emotional agitation under which he had been suffering as to amount to temporary madness my friend has alluded to the romantic glamour with which i have sought to invest this case gentlemen i have done nothing of the kind i have merely shown you the background of life that palpitating life which believe me whatever my friend may say always lies behind the commission of a crime now gentlemen we live in a highly civilized age and the sight of brutal violence disturbs us in a very strange way even when we have no personal interest in the matter but when we see it inflicted on a woman whom we love what then just think of what your own feelings would have been each of you at the prisoners age and then look at him well he is hardly the comfortable shall we say bucolic person likely to contemplate with equanimity marks of gross violence on a woman to whom he was devotedly attached yes gentlemen look at him he has not a strong face but neither has he a vicious face he is just the sort of man who would easily become the prey of his emotions you have heard the description of his eyes my friend may laugh at the word funny i think it better describes the peculiar uncanny look of those who are strained to breakingpoint than any other word which could have been used i dont pretend mind you that his mental irresponsibility was more than a flash of darkness in which all sense of proportion became lost but to contend that just as a man who destroys himself at such a moment may be and often is absolved from the stigma attaching to the crime of selfmurder so he may and frequently does commit other crimes while in this irresponsible condition and that he may as justly be acquitted of criminal intent and treated as a patient i admit that this is a plea which might well be abused it is a matter for discretion but here you have a case in which there is every reason to give the benefit of the doubt you heard me ask the prisoner what he thought of during those four fatal minutes what was his answer i thought of mr cokesons face gentlemen no man could invent an answer like that it is absolutely stamped with truth you have seen the great affection legitimate or not existing between him and this woman who came here to give evidence for him at the risk of her life it is impossible for you to doubt his distress on the morning when he committed this act we well know what terrible havoc such distress can make in weak and highly nervous people it was all the work of a moment the rest has followed as death follows a stab to the heart or water drops if you hold up a jug to empty it believe me gentlemen there is nothing more tragic in life than the utter impossibility of changing what you have done once this cheque was altered and presented the work of four minutes four mad minutes the rest has been silence but in those four minutes the boy before you has slipped through a door hardly opened into that great cage which never again quite lets a man go the cage of the law his further acts his failure to confess the alteration of the counterfoil his preparations for flight are all evidence not of deliberate and guilty intention when he committed the prime act from which these subsequent acts arose no they are merely evidence of the weak character which is clearly enough his misfortune but is a man to be lost because he is bred and born with a weak character gentlemen men like the prisoner are destroyed daily under our law for want of that human insight which sees them as they are patients and not criminals if the prisoner be found guilty and treated as though he were a criminal type he will as all experience shows in all probability become one i beg you not to return a verdict that may thrust him back into prison and brand him for ever gentlemen justice is a machine that when some one has once given it the starting push rolls on of itself is this young man to be ground to pieces under this machine for an act which at the worst was one of weakness is he to become a member of the luckless crews that man those dark illstarred ships called prisons is that to be his voyagefrom which so few return or is he to have another chance to be still looked on as one who has gone a little astray but who will come back i urge you gentlemen do not ruin this young man for as a result of those four minutes ruin utter and irretrievable stares him in the face he can be saved now imprison him as a criminal and i affirm to you that he will be lost he has neither the face nor the manner of one who can survive that terrible ordeal weigh in the scales his criminality and the suffering he has undergone the latter is ten times heavier already he has lain in prison under this charge for more than two months is he likely ever to forget that imagine the anguish of his mind during that time he has had his punishment gentlemen you may depend the rolling of the chariotwheels of justice over this boy began when it was decided to prosecute him we are now already at the second stage if you permit it to go on to the third i would not give that for him he holds up finger and thumb in the form of a circle drops his hand and sits dozen the jury stir and consult each others faces then they turn towards the counsel for the crown who rises and fixing his eyes on a spot that seems to give him satisfaction slides them every now and then towards the jury cleaver may it please your lordship rising on his toes gentlemen of the jury the facts in this case are not disputed and the defence if my friend will allow me to say so is so thin that i dont propose to waste the time of the court by taking you over the evidence the plea is one of temporary insanity well gentlemen i daresay it is clearer to me than it is to you why this rather what shall we call it bizarre defence has been set up the alternative would have been to plead guilty now gentlemen if the prisoner had pleaded guilty my friend would have had to rely on a simple appeal to his lordship instead of that he has gone into the byways and hedges and found this er peculiar plea which has enabled him to show you the proverbial woman to put her in the box to give in fact a romantic glow to this affair i compliment my friend i think it highly ingenious of him by these means he has to a certain extent got round the law he has brought the whole story of motive and stress out in court at first hand in a way that he would not otherwise have been able to do but when you have once grasped that fact gentlemen you have grasped everything with goodhumoured contempt for look at this plea of insanity we cant put it lower than that you have heard the woman she has every reason to favour the prisoner but what did she say she said that the prisoner was not insane when she left him in the morning if he were going out of his mind through distress that was obviously the moment when insanity would have shown itself you have heard the managing clerk another witness for the defence with some difficulty i elicited from him the admission that the prisoner though jumpy a word that he seemed to think you would understand gentlemen and im sure i hope you do was not mad when the cheque was handed to davis i agree with my friend that its unfortunate that we have not got davis here but the prisoner has told you the words with which davis in turn handed him the cheque he obviously therefore was not mad when he received it or he would not have remembered those words the cashier has told you that he was certainly in his senses when he cashed it we have therefore the plea that a man who is sane at ten minutes past one and sane at fifteen minutes past may for the purposes of avoiding the consequences of a crime call himself insane between those points of time really gentlemen this is so peculiar a proposition that i am not disposed to weary you with further argument you will form your own opinion of its value my friend has adopted this way of saying a great deal to you and very eloquently on the score of youth temptation and the like i might point out however that the offence with which the prisoner is charged is one of the most serious known to our law and there are certain features in this case such as the suspicion which he allowed to rest on his innocent fellow clerk and his relations with this married woman which will render it difficult for you to attach too much importance to such pleading i ask you in short gentlemen for that verdict of guilty which in the circumstances i regard you as unfortunately bound to record letting his eyes travel from the judge and the jury to frome he sits down the judge bending a little towards the jury and speaking in a businesslike voice gentlemen you have heard the evidence and the comments on it my only business is to make clear to you the issues you have to try the facts are admitted so far as the alteration of this cheque and counterfoil by the prisoner the defence set up is that he was not in a responsible condition when he committed the crime well you have heard the prisoners story and the evidence of the other witnesses so far as it bears on the point of insanity if you think that what you have heard establishes the fact that the prisoner was insane at the time of the forgery you will find him guilty but insane if on the other hand you conclude from what you have seen and heard that the prisoner was sane and nothing short of insanity will count you will find him guilty in reviewing the testimony as to his mental condition you must bear in mind very carefully the evidence as to his demeanour and conduct both before and after the act of forgery the evidence of the prisoner himself of the woman of the witness er cokeson and er of the cashier and in regard to that i especially direct your attention to the prisoners admission that the idea of adding the ty and the nought did come into his mind at the moment when the cheque was handed to him and also to the alteration of the counterfoil and to his subsequent conduct generally the bearing of all this on the question of premeditation and premeditation will imply sanity is very obvious you must not allow any considerations of age or temptation to weigh with you in the finding of your verdict before you can come to a verdict of guilty but insane you must be well and thoroughly convinced that the condition of his mind was such as would have qualified him at the moment for a lunatic asylum he pauses then seeing that the jury are doubtful whether to retire or no adds you may retire gentlemen if you wish to do so the jury retire by a door behind the judge the judge bends over his notes falder leaning from the dock speaks excitedly to his solicitor pointing dawn at ruth the solicitor in turn speaks to frome frome rising my lord the prisoner is very anxious that i should ask you if your lordship would kindly request the reporters not to disclose the name of the woman witness in the press reports of these proceedings your lordship will understand that the consequences might be extremely serious to her the judge pointedly with the suspicion of a smile well mr frome you deliberately took this course which involved bringing her here frome with an ironic bow if your lordship thinks i could have brought out the full facts in any other way the judge hm well frome there is very real danger to her your lordship the judge you see i have to take your word for all that frome if your lordship would be so kind i can assure your lordship that i am not exaggerating the judge it goes very much against the grain with me that the name of a witness should ever be suppressed with a glance at falder who is gripping and clasping his hands before him and then at ruth who is sitting perfectly rigid with her eyes fixed on falder ill consider your application it must depend i have to remember that she may have come here to commit perjury on the prisoners behalf frome your lordship i really the judge yes yes i dont suggest anything of the sort mr frome leave it at that for the moment as he finishes speaking the jury return and file back into the box clerk of assize gentlemen are you agreed on your verdict foreman we are clerk of assize is it guilty or guilty but insane foreman guilty the judge nods then gathering up his notes sits looking at falder who stands motionless frome rising if your lordship would allow me to address you in mitigation of sentence i dont know if your lordship thinks i can add anything to what i have said to the jury on the score of the prisoners youth and the great stress under which he acted the judge i dont think you can mr frome frome if your lordship says so i do most earnestly beg your lordship to give the utmost weight to my plea he sits down the judge to the clerk call upon him the clerk prisoner at the bar you stand convicted of felony have you anything to say for yourself why the court should not give you judgment according to law falder shakes his head the judge william falder you have been given fair trial and found guilty in my opinion rightly found guilty of forgery he pauses then consulting his notes goes on the defence was set up that you were not responsible for your actions at the moment of committing this crime there is no doubt i think that this was a device to bring out at first hand the nature of the temptation to which you succumbed for throughout the trial your counsel was in reality making an appeal for mercy the setting up of this defence of course enabled him to put in some evidence that might weigh in that direction whether he was well advised to so is another matter he claimed that you should be treated rather as a patient than as a criminal and this plea of his which in the end amounted to a passionate appeal he based in effect on an indictment of the march of justice which he practically accused of confirming and completing the process of criminality now in considering how far i should allow weight to his appeal i have a number of factors to take into account i have to consider on the one hand the grave nature of your offence the deliberate way in which you subsequently altered the counterfoil the danger you caused to an innocent man and that to my mind is a very grave point and finally i have to consider the necessity of deterring others from following your example on the other hand i have to bear in mind that you are young that you have hitherto borne a good character that you were if i am to believe your evidence and that of your witnesses in a state of some emotional excitement when you committed this crime i have every wish consistently with my duty not only to you but to the community to treat you with leniency and this brings me to what are the determining factors in my mind in my consideration of your case you are a clerk in a lawyers office that is a very serious element in this case there can be no possible excuse made for you on the ground that you were not fully conversant with the nature of the crime you were committing and the penalties that attach to it it is said however that you were carried away by your emotions the story has been told here today of your relations with this er mrs honeywill on that story both the defence and the plea for mercy were in effect based now what is that story it is that you a young man and she a young woman unhappily married had formed an attachment which you both say with what truth i am unable to gauge had not yet resulted in immoral relations but which you both admit was about to result in such relationship your counsel has made an attempt to palliate this on the ground that the woman is in what he describes i think as a hopeless position as to that i can express no opinion she is a married woman and the fact is patent that you committed this crime with the view of furthering an immoral design now however i might wish i am not able to justify to my conscience a plea for mercy which has a basis inimical to morality it is vitiated ab initio and would if successful free you for the completion of this immoral project your counsel has made an attempt to trace your offence back to what he seems to suggest is a defect in the marriage law he has made an attempt also to show that to punish you with further imprisonment would be unjust i do not follow him in these flights the law is what it is a majestic edifice sheltering all of us each stone of which rests on another i am concerned only with its administration the crime you have committed is a very serious one i cannot feel it in accordance with my duty to society to exercise the powers i have in your favour you will go to penal servitude for three years falder who throughout the judges speech has looked at him steadily lets his head fall forward on his breast ruth starts up from her seat as he is taken out by the warders there is a bustle in court the judge speaking to the reporters gentlemen of the press i think that the name of the female witness should not be reported the reporters bow their acquiescence the judge to ruth who is staring in the direction in which falder has disappeared do you understand your name will not be mentioned cokeson pulling her sleeve the judge is speaking to you ruth turns stares at the judge and turns away the judge i shall sit rather late today call the next case clerk of assize to a warder put up john booley to cries of witnesses in the case of booley the curtain falls act iii scene i a prison a plainly furnished room with two large barred windows overlooking the prisoners exercise yard where men in yellow clothes marked with arrows and yellow brimless caps are seen in single file at a distance of four yards from each other walking rapidly on serpentine white lines marked on the concrete floor of the yard two warders in blue uniforms with peaked caps and swords are stationed amongst them the room has distempered walls a bookcase with numerous officiallooking books a cupboard between the windows a plan of the prison on the wall a writingtable covered with documents it is christmas eve the governor a neat gravelooking man with a trim fair moustache the eyes of a theorist and grizzled hair receding from the temples is standing close to this writingtable looking at a sort of rough saw made out of a piece of metal the hand in which he holds it is gloved for two fingers are missing the chief warder wooder a tall thin military looking man of sixty with grey moustache and melancholy monkeylike eyes stands very upright two paces from him the governor with a faint abstracted smile queerlooking affair mr wooder where did you find it wooder in his mattress sir havent come across such a thing for two years now the governor with curiosity had he any set plan wooder hed sawed his windowbar about that much he holds up his thumb and finger a quarter of an inch apart the governor ill see him this afternoon whats his name moaney an old hand i think wooder yes sirfourth spell of penal youd think an old lag like him would have had more sense by now with pitying contempt occupied his mind he said breaking in and breaking out thats all they think about the governor whos next him wooder ocleary sir the governor the irishman wooder next him again theres that young fellow falder star class and next him old clipton the governor ah yes the philosopher i want to see him about his eyes wooder curious thing sir they seem to know when theres one of these tries at escape going on it makes them restive theres a regular wave going through them just now the governor meditatively odd things those waves turning to look at the prisoners exercising seem quiet enough out here wooder that irishman ocleary began banging on his door this morning little thing like thats quite enough to upset the whole lot theyre just like dumb animals at times the governor ive seen it with horses before thunder itll run right through cavalry lines the prison chaplain has entered he is a darkhaired ascetic man in clerical undress with a peculiarly steady tightlipped face and slow cultured speech the governor holding up the saw seen this miller the chaplain usefullooking specimen the governor do for the museum eh he goes to the cupboard and opens it displaying to view a number of quaint ropes hooks and metal tools with labels tied on them thatll do thanks mr wooder wooder saluting thank you sir he goes out the governor account for the state of the men last day or two miller seems going through the whole place the chaplain no i dont know of anything the governor by the way will you dine with us on christmas day the chaplain tomorrow thanks very much the governor worries me to feel the men discontented gazing at the saw have to punish this poor devil cant help liking a man who tries to escape he places the saw in his pocket and locks the cupboard again the chaplain extraordinary perverted willpower some of them nothing to be done till its broken the governor and not much afterwards im afraid ground too hard for golf wooder comes in again wooder visitor whos been seeing q asks to speak to you sir i told him it wasnt usual the governor what about wooder shall i put him off sir the governor resignedly no no lets see him dont go miller wooder motions to some one without and as the visitor comes in withdraws the visitor is cokeson who is attired in a thick overcoat to the knees woollen gloves arid carries a top hat cokeson im sorry to trouble you ive been talking to the young man the governor we have a good many here cokeson name of falder forgery producing a card and handing it to the governor firm of james and walter how well known in the law the governor receiving the cardwith a faint smile what do you want to see me about sir cokeson suddenly seeing the prisoners at exercise why what a sight the governor yes we have that privilege from here my office is being done up sitting down at his table now please cokeson dragging his eyes with difficulty from the window i wanted to say a word to you i shant keep you long confidentially fact is i oughtnt to be here by rights his sister came to me hes got no father and mother and she was in some distress my husband wont let me go and see him she said says hes disgraced the family and his other sister she said is an invalid and she asked me to come well i take an interest in him he was our junior i go to the same chapel and i didnt like to refuse and what i wanted to tell you was he seems lonely here the governor not unnaturally cokeson im afraid itll prey on my mind i see a lot of them about working together the governor those are local prisoners the convicts serve their three months here in separate confinement sir cokeson but we dont want to be unreasonable hes quite downhearted i wanted to ask you to let him run about with the others the governor with faint amusement ring the bellwould you miller to cokeson youd like to hear what the doctor says about him perhaps the chaplain ringing the bell you are not accustomed to prisons it would seem sir cokeson no but its a pitiful sight hes quite a young fellow i said to him before a months up i said youll be out and about with the others itll be a nice change for you a month he said like that come i said we mustnt exaggerate whats a month why its nothing a day he said shut up in your cell thinking and brooding as i do its longer than a year outside i cant help it he said i try but im built that way mr cokeson and he held his hand up to his face i could see the tears trickling through his fingers it wasnt nice the chaplain hes a young man with large rather peculiar eyes isnt he not church of england i think cokeson no the chaplain i know the governor to wooder who has come in ask the doctor to be good enough to come here for a minute wooder salutes and goes out lets see hes not married cokeson no confidentially but theres a party hes very much attached to not altogether comilfa its a sad story the chaplain if it wasnt for drink and women sir this prison might be closed cokeson looking at the chaplain over his spectacles yees but i wanted to tell you about that special he had hopes theyd have let her come and see him but they havent of course he asked me questions i did my best but i couldnt tell the poor young fellow a lie with him in here seemed like hitting him but im afraid its made him worse the governor what was this news then cokeson like this the woman had a nahsty spiteful feller for a husband and shed left him fact is she was going away with our young friend its not nice but ive looked over it well when he was put in here she said shed earn her living apart and wait for him to come out that was a great consolation to him but after a month she came to me i dont know her personally and she said i cant earn the childrens living let alone my own ive got no friends im obliged to keep out of everybodys way else my husbandd get to know where i was im very much reduced she said and she has lost flesh ill have to go in the workhouse its a painful story i said to her no i said not that ive got a wife an family but sooner than you should do that ill spare you a little myself really she said shes a nice creature i dont like to take it from you i think id better go back to my husband well i know hes a nahsty spiteful feller drinks but i didnt like to persuade her not to the chaplain surely no cokeson yees but im sorry now its upset the poor young fellow dreadfully and what i wanted to say was hes got his three years to serve i want things to be pleasant for him the chaplain with a touch of impatience the law hardly shares your view im afraid cokeson but i cant help thinking that to shut him up there by himselfll turn him silly and nobody wants that i spose i dont like to see a man cry the chaplain its a very rare thing for them to give way like that cokeson looking at himin a tone of sudden dogged hostility i keep dogs the chaplain indeed cokeson yees and i say this i wouldnt shut one of them up all by himself month after month not if hed bit me all over the chaplain unfortunately the criminal is not a dog he has a sense of right and wrong cokeson but thats not the way to make him feel it the chaplain ah there im afraid we must differ cokeson its the same with dogs if you treat em with kindness theyll do anything for you but to shut em up alone it only makes em savage the chaplain surely you should allow those who have had a little more experience than yourself to know what is best for prisoners cokeson doggedly i know this young feller ive watched him for years hes eurotic got no stamina his father died of consumption im thinking of his future if hes to be kept there shut up by himself without a cat to keep him company itll do him harm i said to him where do you feel it i cant tell you mr cokeson he said but sometimes i could beat my head against the wall its not nice during this speech the doctor has entered he is a mediumsized rather goodlooking man with a quick eye he stands leaning against the window the governor this gentleman thinks the separate is telling on q falder young thin fellow star class what do you say doctor clements the doctor he doesnt like it but its not doing him any harm cokeson but hes told me the doctor of course hed say so but we can always tell hes lost no weight since hes been here cokeson its his state of mind im speaking of the doctor his minds all right so far hes nervous rather melancholy i dont see signs of anything more im watching him carefully cokeson nonplussed im glad to hear you say that the chaplain more suavely its just at this period that we are able to make some impression on them sir i am speaking from my special standpoint cokeson turning bewildered to the governor i dont want to be unpleasant but having given him this news i do feel its awkward the governor ill make a point of seeing him today cokeson im much obliged to you i thought perhaps seeing him every day you wouldnt notice it the governor rather sharply if any sign of injury to his health shows itself his case will be reported at once thats fully provided for he rises cokeson following his own thoughts of course what you dont see doesnt trouble you but having seen him i dont want to have him on my mind the governor i think you may safely leave it to us sir cokeson mollified and apologetic i thought youd understand me im a plain man never set myself up against authority expanding to the chaplain nothing personal meant goodmorning as he goes out the three officials do not look at each other but their faces wear peculiar expressions the chaplain our friend seems to think that prison is a hospital cokeson returning suddenly with an apologetic air theres just one little thing this woman i suppose i mustnt ask you to let him see her itd be a rare treat for them both hes thinking about her all the time of course shes not his wife but hes quite safe in here theyre a pitiful couple you couldnt make an exception the governor wearily as you say my dear sir i couldnt make an exception he wont be allowed another visit of any sort till he goes to a convict prison cokeson i see rather coldly sorry to have troubled you he again goes out the chaplain shrugging his shoulders the plain man indeed poor fellow come and have some lunch clements he and the doctor go out talking the governor with a sigh sits down at his table and takes up a pen the curtain falls scene ii part of the ground corridor of the prison the walls are coloured with greenish distemper up to a stripe of deeper green about the height of a mans shoulder and above this line are whitewashed the floor is of blackened stones daylight is filtering through a heavily barred window at the end the doors of four cells are visible each cell door has a little round peephole at the level of a mans eye covered by a little round disc which raised upwards affords a view o f the cell on the wall close to each cell door hangs a little square board with the prisoners name number and record overhead can be seen the iron structures of the firstfloor and secondfloor corridors the warder instructor a bearded man in blue uniform with an apron and some dangling keys is just emerging from one of the cells instructor speaking from the door into the cell ill have another bit for you when thats finished ocleary unseen in an irish voice little doubt o that sirr instructor gossiping well youd rather have it than nothing i spose ocleary an thats the blessed truth sounds are heard of a cell door being closed and locked and of approaching footsteps instructor in a sharp changed voice look alive over it he shuts the cell door and stands at attention the governor comes walking down the corridor followed by wooder the governor anything to report instructor saluting q he points to a cell is behind with his work sir hell lose marks today the governor nods and passes on to the end cell the instructor goes away the governor this is our maker of saws isnt it he takes the saw from his pocket as wooder throws open the door of the cell the convict moaney is seen lying on his bed athwart the cell with his cap on he springs up and stands in the middle of the cell he is a rawboned fellow about fiftysix years old with outstanding bats ears and fierce staring steelcoloured eyes wooder cap off moaney removes his cap out here moaney comes to the door the governor beckoning him out into the corridor and holding up the saw with the manner of an officer speaking to a private anything to say about this my man moaney is silent come moaney it passed the time the governor pointing into the cell not enough to do eh moaney it dont occupy your mind the governor tapping the saw you might find a better way than this moaney sullenly well what way i must keep my hand in against the time i get out whats the good of anything else to me at my time of life with a gradual change to civility as his tongue warms ye know that sir ill be in again within a year or two after ive done this lot i dont want to disgrace meself when im out youve got your pride keeping the prison smart well ive got mine seeing that the governor is listening with interest he goes on pointing to the saw i must be doin a little o this its no harm to any one i was five weeks makin that saw a bit of all right it is too now ill get cells i suppose or seven days bread and water you cant help it sir i know that i quite put meself in your place the governor now look here moaney if i pass it over will you give me your word not to try it on again think he goes into the cell walks to the end of it mounts the stool and tries the windowbars the governor returning well moaney who has been reflecting ive got another six weeks to do in here alone i cant do it and think o nothing i must have something to interest me youve made me a sporting offer sir but i cant pass my word about it i shouldnt like to deceive a gentleman pointing into the cell another four hours steady work would have done it the governor yes and what then caught brought back punishment five weeks hard work to make this and cells at the end of it while they put anew bar to your window is it worth it moaney moaney with a sort of fierceness yes it is the governor putting his hand to his brow oh well two days cellsbread and water moaney thank e sir he turns quickly like an animal and slips into his cell the governor looks after him and shakes his head as wooder closes and locks the cell door the governor open cliptons cell wooder opens the door of cliptons cell clipton is sitting on a stool just inside the door at work on a pair of trousers he is a small thick oldish man with an almost shaven head and smouldering little dark eyes behind smoked spectacles he gets up and stands motionless in the doorway peering at his visitors the governor beckoning come out here a minute clipton clipton with a sort of dreadful quietness comes into the corridor the needle and thread in his hand the governor signs to wooder who goes into the cell and inspects it carefully the governor how are your eyes clifton i dont complain of them i dont see the sun here he makes a stealthy movement protruding his neck a little theres just one thing mr governor as youre speaking to me i wish youd ask the cove next door here to keep a bit quieter the governor whats the matter i dont want any tales clipton clipton he keeps me awake i dont know who he is with contempt one of this star class i expect oughtnt to be here with us the governor quietly quite right clipton hell be moved when theres a cell vacant clipton he knocks about like a wild beast in the early morning im not used to it stops me getting my sleep out in the evening too its not fair mr governor as youre speaking to me sleeps the comfort ive got here im entitled to take it out full wooder comes out of the cell and instantly as though extinguished clipton moves with stealthy suddenness back into his cell wooder all right sir the governor nods the door is closed and locked the governor which is the man who banged on his door this morning wooder going towards oclearys cell this one sir ocleary he lifts the disc and glances through the peephole the governor open wooder throws open the door ocleary who is seated at a little table by the door as if listening springs up and stands at attention jest inside the doorway he is a broadfaced middleaged man with a wide thin flexible mouth and little holes under his high cheekbones the governor wheres the joke ocleary ocleary the joke your honour ive not seen one for a long time the governor banging on your door ocleary oh that the governor its womanish ocleary an its that im becoming this two months past the governor anything to complain of ocleary no sirr the governor youre an old hand you ought to know better ocleary yes ive been through it all the governor youve got a youngster next door youll upset him ocleary it cam over me your

working his mouth its here i feel it the want of a little noise a terrible little wud ease me the governor you know as well as i do that if you were out in the shops you wouldnt be allowed to talk ocleary with a look of profound meaning not with my mouth the governor well then ocleary but its the great conversation id have the governor with a smile well no more conversation on your door ocleary no sirr i wud not have the little wit to repeat meself the governor turning goodnight ocleary goodnight your honour he turns into his cell the governor shuts the door the governor looking at the record card cant help liking the poor blackguard wooder hes an amiable man sir the governor pointing down the corridor ask the doctor to come here mr wooder wooder salutes and goes away down the corridor the governor goes to the door of falders cell he raises his uninjured hand to uncover the peephole but without uncovering it shakes his head and drops his hand then after scrutinising the record board he opens the cell door falder who is standing against it lurches forward the governor beckoning him out now tell me cant you settle down falder falder in a breathless voice yes sir the governor you know what i mean its no good running your head against a stone wall is it falder no sir the governor well come falder i try sir the governor cant you sleep falder very little between two oclock and getting ups the worst time the governor hows that falder his lips twitch with a sort of smile i dont know sir i was always nervous suddenly voluble everything seems to get such a size then i feel ill never get out as long as i live the governor thats morbid my lad pull yourself together falder with an equally sudden dogged resentment yes ive got to the governor think of all these other fellows falder theyre used to it the governor they all had to go through it once for the first time just as youre doing now falder yes sir i shall get to be like them in time i suppose the governor rather taken aback hm well that rests with you now come set your mind to it like a good fellow youre still quite young a man can make himself what he likes falder wistfully yes sir the governor take a good hold of yourself do you read falder i dont take the words in hanging his head i know its no good but i cant help thinking of whats going on outside in my cell i cant see out at all its thick glass sir the governor youve had a visitor bad news falder yes the governor you mustnt think about it falder looking back at his cell how can i help it sir he suddenly becomes motionless as wooder and the doctor approach the governor motions to him to go back into his cell falder quick and low im quite right in my head sir he goes back into his cell the governor to the doctor just go in and see him clements the doctor goes into the cell the governor pushes the door to nearly closing it and walks towards the window wooder following sorry you should be troubled like this sir very contented lot of men on the whole the governor shortly you think so wooder yes sir its christmas doing it in my opinion the governor to himself queer that wooder beg pardon sir the governor christmas he turns towards the window leaving wooder looking at him with a sort of pained anxiety wooder suddenly do you think we make show enough sir if youd like us to have more holly the governor not at all mr wooder wooder very good sir the doctor has come out of falders cell and the governor beckons to him the governor well the doctor i cant make anything much of him hes nervous of course the governor is there any sort of case to report quite frankly doctor the doctor well i dont think the separates doing him any good but then i could say the same of a lot of them theyd get on better in the shops theres no doubt the governor you mean youd have to recommend others the doctor a dozen at least its on his nerves theres nothing tangible that fellow there pointing to oclearys cell for instance feels it just as much in his way if i once get away from physical facts i shant know where i am conscientiously sir i dont know how to differentiate him he hasnt lost weight nothing wrong with his eyes his pulse is good talks all right the governor it doesnt amount to melancholia the doctor shaking his head i can report on him if you like but if i do i ought to report on others the governor i see looking towards falders cell the poor devil must just stick it then as he says thin he looks absently at wooder wooder beg pardon sir for answer the governor stares at him turns on his heel and walks away there is a sound as of beating on metal the governor stopping mr wooder wooder banging on his door sir i thought we should have more of that he hurries forward passing the governor who follows closely the curtain falls scene iii falders cell a whitewashed space thirteen feet broad by seven deep and nine feet high with a rounded ceiling the floor is of shiny blackened bricks the barred window of opaque glass with a ventilator is high up in the middle of the end wall in the middle of the opposite end wall is the narrow door in a corner are the mattress and bedding rolled up two blankets two sheets and a coverlet above them is a quartercircular wooden shelf on which is a bible and several little devotional books piled in a symmetrical pyramid there are also a black hair brush toothbrush and a bit of soap in another corner is the wooden frame of a bed standing on end there is a dark ventilator under the window and another over the door falders work a shirt to which he is putting buttonholes is hung to a nail on the wall over a small wooden table on which the novel lorna doone lies open low down in the corner by the door is a thick glass screen about a foot square covering the gasjet let into the wall there is also a wooden stool and a pair of shoes beneath it three bright round tins are set under the window in fastfailing daylight falder in his stockings is seen standing motionless with his head inclined towards the door listening he moves a little closer to the door his stockinged feet making no noise he stops at the door he is trying harder and harder to hear something any little thing that is going on outside he springs suddenly upright as if at a soundand remains perfectly motionless then with a heavy sigh he moves to his work and stands looking at it with his head doom he does a stitch or two having the air of a man so lost in sadness that each stitch is as it were a coming to life then turning abruptly he begins pacing the cell moving his head like an animal pacing its cage he stops again at the door listens and placing the palms of hip hands against it with his fingers spread out leans his forehead against the iron turning from it presently he moves slowly back towards the window tracing his way with his finger along the top line of the distemper that runs round the wall he stops under the window and picking up the lid of one of the tins peers into it it has grown very nearly dark suddenly the lid falls out of his hand with a clatter the only sound that has broken the silence and he stands staring intently at the wall where the stuff of the shirt is hanging rather white in the darkness he seems to be seeing somebody or something there there is a sharp tap and click the cell light behind the glass screen has been turned up the cell is brightly lighted falder is seen gasping for breath a sound from far away as of distant dull beating on thick metal is suddenly audible falder shrinks back not able to bear this sudden clamour but the sound grows as though some great tumbril were rolling towards the cell and gradually it seems to hypnotise him he begins creeping inch by inch nearer to the door the banging sound travelling from cell to cell draws closer and closer falders hands are seen moving as if his spirit had already joined in this beating and the sound swells till it seems to have entered the very cell he suddenly raises his clenched fists panting violently he flings himself at his door and beats on it the curtain falls act iv the scene is again cokesons room at a few minutes to ten of a march morning two years later the doors are all open sweedle now blessed with a sprouting moustache is getting the offices ready he arranges papers on cokesons table then goes to a covered washstand raises the lid and looks at himself in the mirror while he is gazing his full ruth honeywill comes in through the outer office and stands in the doorway there seems a kind of exultation and excitement behind her habitual impassivity sweedle suddenly seeing her and dropping the lid of the washstand with a bang hello its you ruth yes sweedle theres only me here they dont waste their time hurrying down in the morning why it must be two years since we had the pleasure of seeing you nervously what have you been doing with yourself ruth sardonically living sweedle impressed if you want to see him he points to cokesons chair hell be here directly never misses not much delicately i hope our friends back from the country his times been up these three months if i remember ruth nods i was awful sorry about that the governor made a mistake if you ask me ruth he did sweedle he ought to have given him a chanst and i say the judge ought to ha let him go after that theyve forgot what human natures like whereas we know ruth gives him a honeyed smile sweedle they come down on you like a cartload of bricks flatten you out and when you dont swell up again they complain of it i know em seen a lot of that sort of thing in my time he shakes his head in the plenitude of wisdom why only the other day the governor but cokeson has come in through the outer office brisk with east wind and decidedly greyer cokeson drawing off his coat and gloves why its you then motioning sweedle out and closing the door quite a stranger must be two years dyou want to see me i can give you a minute sit down family well ruth yes im not living where i was cokeson eyeing her askance i hope things are more comfortable at home ruth i couldnt stay with honeywill after all cokeson you havent done anything rash i hope i should be sorry if youd done anything rash ruth ive kept the children with me cokeson beginning to feel that things are not so jolly as ha had hoped well im glad to have seen you youve not heard from the young man i suppose since he came out ruth yes i ran across him yesterday cokeson i hope hes well ruth with sudden fierceness he cant get anything to do its dreadful to see him hes just skin and bone cokeson with genuine concern dear me im sorry to hear that on his guard again didnt they find him a place when his time was up ruth he was only there three weeks it got out cokeson im sure i dont know what i can do for you i dont like to be snubby ruth i cant bear his being like that cokeson scanning her not unprosperous figure i know his relations arent very forthy about him perhaps you can do something for him till he finds his feet ruth not now i could have but not now cokeson i dont understand ruth proudly ive seen him again thats all over cokeson staring at her disturbed im a family man i dont want to hear anything unpleasant excuse me im very busy ruth id have gone home to my people in the country long ago but theyve never got over me marrying honeywill i never was waywise mr cokeson but im proud i was only a girl you see when i married him i thought the world of him of course he used to come travelling to our farm cokeson regretfully i did hope youd have got on better after you saw me ruth he used me worse than ever he couldnt break my nerve but i lost my health and then he began knocking the children about i couldnt stand that i wouldnt go back now if he were dying cokeson who has risen and is shifting about as though dodging a stream of lava we mustnt be violent must we ruth smouldering a man that cant behave better than that there is silence cokeson fascinated in spite of himself then there you were and what did you do then ruth with a shrug tried the same as when i left him before making skirts cheap things it was the best i could get but i never made more than ten shillings a week buying my own cotton and working all day i hardly ever got to bed till past twelve i kept at it for nine months fiercely well im not fit for that i wasnt made for it id rather die cokeson my dear woman we mustnt talk like that ruth it was starvation for the children too after what theyd always had i soon got not to care i used to be too tired she is silent cokeson with fearful curiosity why what happened then ruth with a laugh my employer happened then hes happened ever since cokeson dear oh dear i never came across a thing like this ruth dully hes treated me all right but ive done with that suddenly her lips begin to quiver and she hides them with the back of her hand i never thought id see him again you see it was just a chance i met him by hyde park we went in there and sat down and he told me all about himself oh mr cokeson give him another chance cokeson greatly disturbed then youve both lost your livings what a horrible position ruth if he could only get here where theres nothing to find out about him cokeson we cant have anything derogative to the firm ruth ive no one else to go to cokeson ill speak to the partners but i dont think theyll take him under the circumstances i dont really ruth he came with me hes down there in the street she points to the window cokeson on his dignity he shouldnt have done that until hes sent for then softening at the look on her face weve got a vacancy as it happens but i cant promise anything ruth it would be the saving of him cokeson well ill do what i can but im not sanguine now tell him that i dont want him till i see how things are leave your address repeating her mullingar street he notes it on blottingpaper goodmorning ruth thank you she moves towards the door turns as if to speak but does not and goes away cokeson wiping his head and forehead with a large white cotton handkerchief what a business then looking amongst his papers he sounds his bell sweedle answers it cokeson was that young richards coming here today after the clerks place sweedle yes cokeson well keep him in the air i dont want to see him yet sweedle what shall i tell him sir cokeson with asperity invent something use your brains dont stump him off altogether sweedle shall i tell him that weve got illness sir cokeson no nothing untrue say im not here today sweedle yes sir keep him hankering cokeson exactly and look here you remember falder i may be having him round to see me now treat him like youd have him treat you in a similar position sweedle i naturally should do cokeson thats right when a mans down never hit im tisnt necessary give him a hand up thats a metaphor i recommend to you in life its sound policy sweedle do you think the governors will take him on again sir cokeson cant say anything about that at the sound of some one having entered the outer office whos there sweedle going to the door and looking its falder sir cokeson vexed dear me thats very naughty of her tell him to call again i dont want he breaks off as falder comes in falder is thin pale older his eyes have grown more restless his clothes are very worn and loose sweedle nodding cheerfully withdraws cokeson glad to see you youre rather previous trying to keep things pleasant shake hands shes striking while the irons hot he wipes his forehead i dont blame her shes anxious falder timidly takes cokesons hand and glances towards the partners door cokeson no not yet sit down falder sits in the chair at the aide of cokesons table on which he places his cap now you are here id like you to give me a little account of yourself looking at him over his spectacles hows your health falder im alive mr cokeson cokeson preoccupied im glad to hear that about this matter i dont like doing anything out of the ordinary its not my habit im a plain man and i want everything smooth and straight but i promised your friend to speak to the partners and i always keep my word falder i just want a chance mr cokeson ive paid for that job a thousand times and more i have sir no one knows they say i weighed more when i came out than when i went in they couldnt weigh me here he touches his head or here he touches his heart and gives a sort of laugh till last night id have thought there was nothing in here at all cokeson concerned youve not got heart disease falder oh they passed me sound enough cokeson but they got you a place didnt they falser yes very good people knew all about it very kind to me i thought i was going to get on first rate but one day all of a sudden the other clerks got wind of it i couldnt stick it mr cokeson i couldnt sir cokeson easy my dear fellow easy falder i had one small job after that but it didnt last cokeson how was that falder its no good deceiving you mr cokeson the fact is i seem to be struggling against a thing thats all round me i cant explain it its as if i was in a net as fast as i cut it here it grows up there i didnt act as i ought to have about references but what are you to do you must have them and that made me afraid and i left in fact im im afraid all the time now he bows his head and leans dejectedly silent over the table cokeson i feel for you i do really arent your sisters going to do anything for you falder ones in consumption and the other cokeson yees she told me her husband wasnt quite pleased with you falder when i went there they were at supper my sister wanted to give me a kiss i know but he just looked at her and said what have you come for well i pocketed my pride and i said arent you going to give me your hand jim cis is i know i said look here he said thats all very well but wed better come to an understanding ive been expecting you and ive made up my mind ill give you fifteen pounds to go to canada with i see i saidgood riddance no thanks keep your fifteen pounds friendships a queer thing when youve been where i have cokeson i understand will you take the fifteen pound from me flustered as falder regards him with a queer smile quite without prejudice i meant it kindly falder im not allowed to leave the country cokeson oh yees ticketofleave you arent looking the thing falder ive slept in the park three nights this week the dawns arent all poetry there but meeting her i feel a different man this morning ive often thought the being fond of hers the best thing about me its sacred somehow and yet it did for me thats queer isnt it cokeson im sure were all very sorry for you falder thats what ive found mr cokeson awfully sorry for me with quiet bitterness but it doesnt do to associate with criminals cokeson come come its no use calling yourself names that never did a man any good put a face on it falder its easy enough to put a face on it sir when youre independent try it when youre down like me they talk about giving you your deserts well i think ive had just a bit over cokeson eyeing him askance over his spectacles i hope they havent made a socialist of you falder is suddenly still as if brooding over his past self he utters a peculiar laugh cokeson you must give them credit for the best intentions really you must nobody wishes you harm im sure falder i believe that mr cokeson nobody wishes you harm but they down you all the same this feeling he stares round him as though at something closing in its crushing me with sudden impersonality i know it is cokeson horribly disturbed theres nothing there we must try and take it quiet im sure ive often had you in my prayers now leave it to me ill use my gumption and take em when theyre jolly as he speaks the two partners come in cokeson rather disconcerted but trying to put them all at ease i didnt expect you quite so soon ive just been having a talk with this young man i think youll remember him james with a grave keen look quite well how are you falder walter holding out his hand almost timidly very glad to see you again falder falder who has recovered his selfcontrol takes the hand thank you sir cokeson just a word mr james to falder pointing to the clerks office you might go in there a minute you know your way our junior wont be coming this morning his wifes just had a little family falder goes uncertainly out into the clerks office cokeson confidentially im bound to tell you all about it hes quite penitent but theres a prejudice against him and youre not seeing him to advantage this morning hes undernourished its very trying to go without your dinner james is that so cokeson cokeson i wanted to ask you hes had his lesson now we know all about him and we want a clerk there is a young fellow applying but im keeping him in the air james a gaolbird in the office cokeson i dont see it walter the rolling of the chariotwheels of justice ive never got that out of my head james ive nothing to reproach myself with in this affair whats he been doing since he came out cokeson hes had one or two places but he hasnt kept them hes sensitive quite natural seems to fancy everybodys down on him james bad sign dont like the fellow never did from the first weak characters written all over him walter i think we owe him a leg up james he brought it all on himself walter the doctrine of full responsibility doesnt quite hold in these days james rather grimly youll find it safer to hold it for all that my boy walter for oneself yes not for other people thanks james well i dont want to be hard cokeson im glad to hear you say that he seems to see something spreading his arms round him tisnt healthy james what about that woman he was mixed up with i saw some one uncommonly like her outside as we came in cokeson that well i cant keep anything from you he has met her james is she with her husband cokeson no james falder living with her i suppose cokeson desperately trying to retain the newfound jollity i dont know that of my own knowledge tisnt my business james its our business if were going to engage him cokeson cokeson reluctantly i ought to tell you perhaps ive had the party here this morning james i thought so to walter no my dear boy it wont do too shady altogether cokeson the two things together make it very awkward for you i see that walter tentatively i dont quite know what we have to do with his private life james no no he must make a clean sheet of it or he cant come here walter poor devil cokeson will you have him in and as james nods i think i can get him to see reason james grimly you can leave that to me cokeson walter to james in a low voice while cokeson is summoning falder his whole future may depend on what we do dad falder comes in he has pulled himself together and presents a steady front james now look here falder my son and i want to give you another chance but there are two things i must say to you in the first place its no good coming here as a victim if youve any notion that youve been unjustly treated get rid of it you cant play fast and loose with morality and hope to go scotfree if society didnt take care of itself nobody would the sooner you realise that the better falder yes sir but may i say something james well falder i had a lot of time to think it over in prison he stops cokeson encouraging him im sure you did falder there were all sorts there and what i mean sir is that if wed been treated differently the first time and put under somebody that could look after us a bit and not put in prison not a quarter of us would ever have got there james shaking his head im afraid ive very grave doubts of that falder falder with a gleam of malice yes sir so i found james my good fellow dont forget that you began it falder i never wanted to do wrong james perhaps not but you did falder with all the bitterness of his past suffering its knocked me out of time pulling himself up that is i mean im not what i was james this isnt encouraging for us falder cokeson hes putting it awkwardly mr james falder throwing over his caution from the intensity of his feeling i mean it mr cokeson james now lay aside all those thoughts falder and look to the future falder almost eagerly yes sir but you dont understand what prison is its here it gets you he grips his chest cokeson in a whisper to james i told you he wanted nourishment walter yes but my dear fellow thatll pass away times merciful falder with his face twitching i hope so sir james much more gently now my boy what youve got to do is to put all the past behind you and build yourself up a steady reputation and that brings me to the second thing this woman you were mixed up with you must give us your word you know to have done with that theres no chance of your keeping straight if youre going to begin your future with such a relationship falder looking from one to the other with a hunted expression but sir but sir its the one thing i looked forward to all that time and she too i couldnt find her before last night during this and what follows cokeson becomes more and more uneasy james this is painful falder but you must see for yourself that its impossible for a firm like this to close its eyes to everything give us this proof of your resolve to keep straight and you can come back not otherwise falder after staring at james suddenly stiffens himself i couldnt give her up i couldnt oh sir im all shes got to look to and im sure shes all ive got james im very sorry falder but i must be firm its for the benefit of you both in the long run no good can come of this connection it was the cause of all your disaster falder but sir it meanshaving gone through all thatgetting broken up my nerves are in an awful state for nothing i did it for her james come if shes anything of a woman shell see it for herself she wont want to drag you down further if there were a prospect of your being able to marry her it might be another thing falder its not my fault sir that she couldnt get rid of him she would have if she could thats been the whole trouble from the beginning looking suddenly at walter if anybody would help her its only money wants now im sure cokeson breaking in as walter hesitates and is about to speak i dont think we need consider that its rather farfetched falder to walter appealing he must have given her full cause since she could prove that he drove her to leave him walter im inclined to do what you say falder if it can be managed falder oh sir he goes to the window and looks down into the street cokeson hurriedly you dont take me mr walter i have my reasons falder from the window shes down there sir will you see her i can beckon to her from here walter hesitates and looks from cokeson to james james with a sharp nod yes let her come falder beckons from the window cokeson in a low fluster to james and walter no mr james shes not been quite what she ought to ha been while this young mans been away shes lost her chance we cant consult how to swindle the law falder has come from the window the three men look at him in a sort of awed silence falder with instinctive apprehension of some change looking from one to the other theres been nothing between us sir to prevent it what i said at the trial was true and last night we only just sat in the park sweedle comes in from the outer office cokeson what is it sweedle mrs honeywill there is silence james show her in ruth comes slowly in and stands stoically with falder on one side and the three men on the other no one speaks cokeson turns to his table bending over his papers as though the burden of the situation were forcing him back into his accustomed groove james sharply shut the door there sweedle shuts the door weve asked you to come up because there are certain facts to be faced in this matter i understand you have only just met falder again ruth yes only yesterday james hes told us about himself and were very sorry for him ive promised to take him back here if hell make a fresh start looking steadily at ruth this is a matter that requires courage maam ruth who is looking at falder begins to twist her hands in front of her as though prescient of disaster falder mr walter how is good enough to say that hell help us to get you a divorce ruth flashes a startled glance at james and walter james i dont think thats practicable falder falder but sir james steadily

feel better by yourself for a minute he points to the clerks room and moves towards the outer office falder does not move ruth puts out her hand timidly he shrinks back from the touch she turns and goes miserably into the clerks room with a brusque movement he follows seizing her by the shoulder just inside the doorway cokeson shuts the door james pointing to the outer office get rid of that whoever it is sweedle opening the office door in a scared voice detective sergeant blister the detective enters and closes the door behind him wister sorry to disturb you sir a clerk you had here two

another six months sir walter has he to keep in touch with the police till then wister were bound to know where he sleeps every night i dare say we shouldnt interfere sir even though he hasnt reported himself but weve just heard theres a serious matter of obtaining employment with a forged reference what with the two things together we must have him again there is silence walter and cokeson steal glances at james who stands staring steadily at the detective cokeson expansively were very busy at the moment if you could make it convenient to call again we might be able to tell you then james decisively im a servant of the law but i dislike peaching in fact i cant do such a thing if you want him you must find him without us as he speaks his eye falls on falders cap still lying on the table and his face contracts wister noting the gesture quietly very good sir i ought to warn you that having broken the terms of his licence hes still a convict and sheltering a convict james i shelter no one but you mustnt come here and ask questions which its not my business to answer wister dryly i wont trouble you further then gentlemen cokeson im sorry we couldnt give you the information you quite

clerks door ruthss voice is heard oh do and falders i cant there is a little pause then with sharp fright ruth says whos that wister has gone in the three men look aghast at the door wister from within keep back please he comes swiftly out with his arm twisted in falders the latter gives a white staring look at the three men walter let him go this time for gods sake wister i couldnt take the responsibility sir falder with a queer desperate laugh good flinging a look back at ruth he throws up his head and goes out through the outer office half dragging wister after him walter with despair that finishes him itll go on for ever now sweedle can be seen staring through the outer door there are sounds of footsteps descending the stone stairs suddenly a dull thud a faint my god in wisters voice james whats that sweedle dashes forward the door swings to behind him there is dead silence walter starting forward to the inner room the womanshes fainting he and cokeson support the fainting ruth from the doorway of the clerks room cokeson distracted here my dear there there walter have you any brandy cokeson ive got sherry walter get it then quick he places ruth in a chair which james has dragged forward cokeson with sherry here its good strong sherry they try to force the sherry between her lips there is the sound of feet and they stop to listen the outer door is reopened wister and sweedle are seen carrying some burden james hurrying forward what is it they lay the burden doom in the outer office out of sight and all but ruth cluster round it speaking in hushed voices wister he jumped necks broken walter good god wister he must have been mad to think he could give me the slip like that and what was it just a few months walter bitterly was that all james what a desperate thing then in a voice unlike his own run for a doctor you sweedle rushes from the outer office an ambulance wister goes out on ruths face an expression of fear and horror has been seen growing as if she dared not turn towards the voices she now rises and steals towards them walter turning suddenly look the three men shrink back out of her way one by one into cokesons room ruth drops on her knees by the body ruth in a whisper what is it hes not breathing she crouches over him my dear my pretty in the outer office doorway the figures of men am seen standing ruth leaping to her feet no no no no hes dead the figures of the men shrink back cokeson stealing forward in a hoarse voice there there poor dear woman at the sound behind her ruth faces round at him cokeson no onell touch him now never again hes safe with gentle jesus ruth stands as though turned to stone in the doorway staring at cokeson who bending humbly before her holds out his hand as one would to a lost dog the curtain falls
