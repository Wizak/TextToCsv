the october country by ray bradbury fifteen of the stories included in this collection were written before my twentysixth birthday and published in august derleths arkham house edition of my first book dark carnival this book has been out of print for some years and i welcomethe opportunity given me by the editors of ballantine books to select edit and in some cases rewrite my favorite stories from that early work for my later readers the october country will present a side of my writing that is probably unfamiliar to them and a type of story that i have rarely done since looking back on those years i cannot help but express again my gratitude to august derleth who was my first publishereditor and to my hardestworking and most patient teachers leigh brackett and henry kuttner r b for who else but august derleth contents the dwarf the next in line the watchful poker chip of h matisse skeleton the jar the lake the emissary touched with fire the small assassin the crowd jackinthebox the scythe uncle einar the wind the man upstairs there was an old woman the cistern homecoming the wonderful death of dudley stone the october country that country where it is always turning late in the year that country where the hills are fog and the rivers are mist where noons go quickly dusks and twilights linger and midnights stay that country composed in the main of cellars subcellars coalbins closets attics and pantries faced away from the sun that country whose people are autumn people thinking only autumn thoughts whose people passing at night on the empty walks sound like rain the october country the dwarf aimee watched the sky quietly tonight was one of those motionless hot summer nights the concrete pier empty the strong red white yellow bulbs like insects in the air above the wooden emptiness the managers of the various carnival pitches stood like melting wax dumrnies eyes staring blindly not talking all down the line two customers had passed through an hour before those two lonely people were now in the roller coaster screaming murderously as it plummeted down the blazing night around one emptiness after another aimee moved slowly across the strand a few worn wooden hoopla rings sticking to her wet hands she stopped behind the ticket booth that fronted the mirror maze she saw herself grossly misrepresented in three rippled mirrors outside the maze a thousand tired replicas of herself dissolved in the corridor beyond hot images among so much clear coolness she stepped inside the ticket booth and stood looking a long while at ralph bangharts thin neck he clenched an unlit cigar between his long uneven yellow teeth as he laid out a battered game of solitaire on the ticket shelf when the roller coaster wailed and fell in its terrible avalanche again she was reminded to speak what kind of people go up in roller coasters ralph banghart worked his cigar a full thirty seconds people wanna die that rollie coasters the handiest thing to dying there is he sat listening to the faint sound of rifle shots from the shooting gallery this whole damn carny businesss crazy for instance that dwarf you seen him every night pays his dime runs in the mirror maze all the way back through to screwy louies room you should see this little runt head back there my god oh yes said aimee remembering i always wonder what its like to be a dwarf i always feel sorry when i see him i could play him like an accordion dont say that my lord ralph patted her thigh with a free hand the way you carry on about guys you never even met he shook his head and chuckled him and his secret only he dont know i know see boy howdy its a hot night she twitched the large wooden hoops nervously on her damp fingers dont change the subject hell be here rain or shine aimee shifted her weight ralph seized her elbow hey you aint mad you wanna see that dwarf dont you sh ralph turned here he comes now the dwarfs hand hairy and dark appeared all by itself reaching up into the booth window with a silver dime an invisible person called one in a high childs voice involuntarily aimee bent forward the dwarf looked up at her resembling nothing more than a darkeyed darkhaired ugly man who has been locked in a winepress squeezed and wadded down and down fold on fold agony on agony until a bleached outraged mass is left the face bloated shapelessly a face you know must stare wideeyed and awake at two and three and four oclock in the morning lying flat in bed only the body asleep ralph tore a yellow ticket in half one the dwarf as if frightened by an approaching storm pulled his black coatlapels tightly about his throat and waddled swiftly a moment later ten thousand lost and wandering dwarfs wriggled between the mirror flats like frantic dark beetles and vanished quick ralph squeezed aimee along a dark passage behind the mirrors she felt him pat her all the way back through the tunnel to a thin partition with a peekhole this is rich he chuckled go onlook aimee hesitated then put her face to the partition you see him ralph whispered aimee felt her heart beating a full minute passed there stood the dwarf in the middle of the small blue room his eyes were shut he wasnt ready to open them yet now now he opened his eyelids and looked at a large mirror set before him and what he saw in the mirror made him smile he winked he pirouetted he stood sidewise he waved he bowed he did a little clumsy dance and the mirror repeated each motion with long thin arms with a tall tall body with a huge wink and an enormous repetition of the dance ending in a gigantic bow every night the same thing whispered ralph in aimees ear aint that rich aimee turned her head and looked at ralph steadily out of her motionless face for a long time and she said nothing then as if she could not help herself she moved her head slowly and very slowly back to stare once more through the opening she held her breath she felt her eyes begin to water ralph nudged her whispering hey whats the little gink doin now they were drinking coffee and not looking at each other in the ticket booth half an hour later when the dwarf came out of the mirrors he took his hat off and started to approach the booth when he saw aimee and hurried away he wanted something said aimee yeah ralph squashed out his cigarette idly i know what too but he hasnt got the nerve to ask one night in this squeaky little voice he says i bet those mirrors are expensive well i played dumb i said yeah they were he sort of looked at me waiting and when i didnt say any more he went home but next night he said i bet those mirrors cost fifty a hundred bucks i bet they do i said i laid me out a hand of solitaire ralph she said he glanced up why you look at me that way ralph she said why dont you sell him one of your extra ones look aimee do i tell you how to run your hoop circus how much do those mirrors cost i can get em secondhand for thirtyfive bucks why dont you tell him where he can buy one then aimee youre not smart he laid his hand on her knee she moved her knee away even if i told him where to go you think hed buy one not on your life and why hes selfconscious why if he even knew i knew he was flirtin around in front of that mirror in screwy louies room hed never come back he plays like hes goin through the maze to get lost like everybody else pretends like he dont care about that special room always waits for business to turn bad late nights so he has that room to himself what he does for entertainment on nights when business is good god knows no sir he wouldnt dare go buy a mirror anywhere he aint got no friends and even if he did he couldnt ask them to buy him a thing like that pride by god pride only reason he even mentioned it to me is im practically the only guy he knows besides look at himhe aint got enough to buy a mirror like those he might be savin up but where in hell in the world today can a dwarf work dime a dozen drug on the market outside of circuses i feel awful i feel sad aimee sat staring at the empty boardwalk where does he live flytrap down on the waterfront the ganghes arms why im madly in love with him if you must know he grinned around his cigar aimee he said you and your very funny jokes a warm night a hot morning and a blazing noon the sea was a sheet of burning tinsel and glass aimee came walking in the lockedup carnival alleys out over the warm sea keeping in the shade half a dozen sunbleached magazines under her arm she opened a flaking door and called into hot darkness ralph she picked her way through the black hall behind the mirrors her heels tacking the wooden floor ralph someone stirred sluggishly on the canvas cot aimee he sat up and screwed a dim light bulb into the dressing table socket he squinted at her half blinded hey you look like the cat that swallowed a canary ralph i came about the midget dwarf aimee honey dwarf a midget is in the cells born that way a dwarf is in the glands ralph i just found out the most wonderful thing about him honest to god he said to his hands holding them out as witnesses to his disbelief this woman who in hell gives two cents for some ugly little ralph she held out the magazines her eyes shining hes a writer think of that its a pretty hot day for thinking he lay back and examined her smiling faintly i just happened to pass the ganghes arms and saw mr greeley the manager he says the typewriter runs all night in mr bigs room is that his name ralph began to roar with laughter writes just enough pulp detective stories to live i found one of his stories in the secondhand magazine place and ralph guess what im tired aimee this little guys got a soul as big as all outdoors hes got every thing in his head why aint he writin for the big magazines then i ask you because maybe hes afraidmaybe he doesnt know he can do it that happens people dont believe in themselves but if he only tried i bet he could sell stories anywhere in the world why aint he rich i wonder maybe because ideas come slow because hes down in the dumps who wouldnt be so small that way i bet its hard to think of anything except being so small and living in a oneroom cheap apartment hell snorted ralph you talk like florence nightingales grandma she held up the magazine ill read you part of his crime story its got all the guns and tough people but its told by a dwarf i bet the editors never guessed the author knew what he was writing about oh please dont sit there like that ralph listen and she began to read aloud i am a dwarf and i am a murderer the two things cannot be separated one is the cause of the other the man i murdered used to stop me on the street when i was twentyone pick me up in his arms kiss my brow croon wildly to me sing rockabye baby haul me into meat markets toss me on the scales and cry watch it dont weigh your thumb there butcher do you see how our lives moved toward murder this fool this persecutor of my flesh and soul as for my childhood my parents were small people not quite dwarfs not quite my fathers inheritance kept us in a dolls house an amazing thing like a whitescrolled wedding cakelittle rooms little chairs miniature paintings cameos ambers with insects caught inside everything tiny tiny tiny the world of giants far away an ugly rumor beyond the garden wall poor mama papa they meant only the best for me they kept me like a porcelain vase small and treasured to themselves in our ant world our beehive rooms our microscopic library our land of beetlesized doors and moth windows only now do i see the magnificent size of my parents psychosis they must have dreamed they would live forever keeping me like a butterfly under glass but first father died and then fire ate up the little house the wasps nest and every postagestamp mirror and saltcellar closet within mama too gone and myself alone watching the fallen embers tossed out into a world of monsters and titans caught in a landslide of reality rushed rolled and smashed to the bottom of the cliff it took me a year to adjust a job with a sideshow was unthinkable there seemed no place for me in the world and then a month ago the persecutor came into my life clapped a bonnet on my unsuspecting head and cried to friends i want you to meet the little woman aimee stopped reading her eyes were unsteady and the magazine shook as she handed it to ralph you finish it the rest is a murder story its all right but dont you see that little man that little man ralph tossed the magazine aside and lit a cigarette lazily i like westerns better ralph you got to read it he needs someone to tell him how good he is and keep him writing ralph looked at her his head to one side and guess whos going to do it well well aint we just the saviours right hand i wont listen use your head damn it you go busting in on him hell think youre handing him pity hell chase you screamin outa his room she sat down thinking about it slowly trying to turn it over and see it from every side i dont know maybe youre right oh its not just pity ralph honest but maybe itd look like it to him ive got to be awful careful he shook her shoulder back and forth pinching softly with his fingers hell hell lay off him is all i ask youll get nothing but trouble for your dough god aimee i never seen you so hepped on anything look you and me lets make it a day take a lunch get us some gas and just drive on down the coast as far as we can drive swim have supper see a good show in some little townto hell with the carnival how about it a damn nice day and no worries i been savin a coupla bucks its because i know hes different she said looking off into darkness its because hes something we can never beyou and me and all the rest of us here on the pier its so funny so funny life fixed him so hes good for nothing but carny shows yet there he is on the land and life made us so we wouldnt have to work in the camy shows but here we are anyway way out here at sea on the pier sometimes it seems a million miles to shore how come ralph that we got the bodies but hes got the brains and can think things well never even guess you havent even been listening to me said ralph she sat with him standing over her his voice far away her eyes were half shut and her hands were in her lap twitching i dont like that shrewd look youre getting on he said finally she opened her purse slowly and took out a small roll of bills and started counting thirtyfive forty dollars there im going to phone billie fine and have him send out one of those talltype mirrors to mr bigelow at the ganghes arms yes i am what think how wonderful for him ralph having one in his own room any time he wants it can i use your phone go ahead be nutty ralph turned quickly and walked off down the tunnel a door slammed aimee waited then after a while put her hands to the phone and began to dial with painful slowness she paused between numbers holding her breath shutting her eyes thinking how it might seem to he small in the world and then one day someone sends a special mirror by a mirror for your room where you can hide away with the big reflection of yourself shining and write stories and stories never going out into the world unless you had to how might it he then alone with the wonderful illusion all in one piece in the room would it make you happy or sad would it help your writing or hurt it she shook her head back and forth back and forth at least this way there would be no one to look down at you night after night perhaps rising secretly at three in the cold morning you could wink and dance around and smile and wave at yourself so tall so tall so very fine and tall in the bright lookingglass a telephone voice said billie fines oh billie she cried night came in over the pier the ocean lay dark and loud under the planks ralph sat cold and waxen in his glass coffin laying out the cards his eyes fixed his mouth stiff at his elbow a growing pyramid of burnt cigarette butts grew larger when aimee walked along under the hot red and blue bulbs smiling waving he did not stop setting the cards down slow and very slow hi ralph she said hows the love affair he asked drinking from a dirty glass of iced water hows charlie boyer or is it gary grant i just went and bought me a new hat she said smiling gosh i feel good you know why billie fines sending a mirror out tomorrow cant you just see the nice little guys face im not so hot at imagining oh lord youd think i was going to marry him or something why not carry him around in a suitcase people say wheres your husband all you do is open your bag yell here he is like a silver cornet take him outa his case any old hour play a tune stash him away keep a little sandbox for him on the back porch i was feeling so good she said benevolent is the word ralph did not look at her his mouth tight benevolent i suppose this all comes from me watching him through that knothole getting my kicks that why you sent the mirror people like you run around with tambourines taking the joy out of my life remind me not to come to your place for drinks any more id rather go with no people at all than mean people ralph exhaled a deep breath aimee aimee dont you know you cant help that guy hes bats and this crazy thing of yours is like saying go ahead be batty ill help you pal once in a lifetime anyway its nice to make a mistake if you think itll do somebody some good she said god deliver me from dogooders aimee shut up shut up she cried and then said nothing more he let the silence lie a while and then got up putting his fingerprinted glass aside mind the booth for me sure why she saw ten thousand cold white images of him stalking down the glassy corridors between mirrors his mouth straight and his fingers working themselves she sat in the booth for a full minute and then suddenly shivered a small clock ticked in the booth and she turned the deck of cards over one by one waiting she heard a hammer pounding and knocking and pounding again far away inside the maze a silence more waiting and then ten thousand images folding and refolding and dissolving ralph striding looking out at ten thousand images of her in the booth she heard his quiet laughter as he came down the ramp well whats put you in such a good mood she asked suspiciously aimee he said carelessly we shouldnt quarrel you say tomorrow billies sending that mirror to mr bigs youre not going to try anything funny me he moved her out of the booth and took over the cards humming his eyes bright not me oh no not me he did not look at her but started quickly to slap out the cards she stood behind him her right eye began to twitch a little she folded and unfolded her arms a minute ticked by the only sound was the ocean under the night pier ralph breathing in the heat the soft ruffle of the cards the sky over the pier was hot and thick with clouds out at sea faint glows of lightning were beginning to show ralph she said at last relax aimee he said about that trip you wanted to take down the coast tomorrow he said maybe next month maybe next year old ralph bangharts a patient guy im not worried aimee look he held up a hand im calm she waited for a roll of thunder at sea to fade away i just dont want you mad is all i just dont want anything bad to happen promise me the wind now warm now cool blew along the pier there was a smell of rain in the wind the clock ticked aimee began to perspire heavily watching the cards move and move distantly you could hear targets being hit and the sound of the pistols at the shooting gallery and then there he was waddling along the lonely concourse under the insect bulbs his face twisted and dark every movement an effort from a long way down the pier he came with aimee watching she wanted to say to him this is your last night the last time youll have to embarrass yourself by coming here the last time youll have to put up with being watched by ralph even in secret she wished she could cry out and laugh and say it right in front of ralph but she said nothing hello hello shouted ralph its free on the house tonight special for old customers the dwarf looked up startled his little black eyes darting and swimming in confusion his mouth formed the word thanks and he turned one hand to his neck pulling his tiny lapels tight up about his convulsing throat the other hand clenching the silver dime secretly looking back he gave a little nod and then scores of dozens of compressed and tortured faces burnt a strange dark color by the lights wandered in the glass corridors ralph aimee took his elbow whats going on he grinned im being benevolent aimee benevolent ralph she said sh he said listen they waited in the booth in the long warm silence then a long way off muffled there was a scream ralph said aimee listen listen he said there was another scream and another and still another and a threshing and a pounding and a breaking a rushing around and through the maze there there wildly colliding and ricocheting from mirror to mirror shrieking hysterically and sobbing tears on his face mouth gasped open came mr bigelow he fell out in the blazing night air glanced about wildly wailed and ran off down the pier ralph what happened ralph sat laughing and slapping at his thighs she slapped his face whatd you do he didnt quite stop laughing come on ill show you and then she was in the maze rushed from whitehot mirror to mirror seeing her lipstick all red fire a thousand times repeated on down a burning silver cavern where strange hysterical women much like herself followed a quickmoving smiling man come on he cried and they broke free into a dustsmelling tiny room ralph she said they both stood on the threshold of the little room where the dwarf had come every night for a year they both stood where the dwarf had stood each night before opening his eyes to see the miraculous image in front of him aimee shuffled slowly one hand out into the dim room the mirror had been changed this new mirror made even normal people small small small it made even tall people little and dark and twisted smaller as you moved forward and aimee stood before it thinking and thinking that if it made big people small standing here god what would it do to a dwarf a tiny dwarf a dark dwarf a startled and lonely dwarf she turned and almost fell ralph stood looking at her ralph she said god why did you do it aimee come back she ran out through the mirrors crying staring with blurred eyes it was hard to find the way but she found it she stood blinking at the empty pier started to run one way then another then still another then stopped ralph came up behind her talking but it was like a voice heard behind a wall late at night remote and foreign dont talk to me she said someone came running up the pier it was mr kelly from the shooting gallery hey any you see a little guy just now little stiff swiped a pistol from my place loaded run off before id get a hand on him you help me find him and kelly was gone sprinting turning his head to search between all the canvas sheds on away under the hot blue and red and yellow strung bulbs aimee rocked back and forth and took a step aimee where you going she looked at ralph as if they had just turned a corner strangers passing and bumped into each other i guess she said im going to help search you wont be able to do nothing i got to try anyway oh god ralph this is all my fault i shouldnt have phoned billie fine i shouldntve ordered a mirror and got you so mad you did this its me shouldve gone to mr big not a crazy thing like i bought im going to find him if its the last thing i ever do in my life swinging about slowly her cheeks wet she saw the quivery mirrors that stood in front of the maze ralphs reflection was in one of them she could not take her eyes away from the image it held her in a cool and trembling fascination with her mouth open aimee whats wrong whatre you he sensed where she was looking and twisted about to see what was going on his eyes widened he scowled at the blazing mirror a horrid ugly little man two feet high with a pale squashed face under an ancient straw hat scowled back at him ralph stood there glaring at himself his hands at his sides aimee walked slowly and then began to walk fast and then began to run she ran down the empty pier and the wind blew warm and it blew large drops of hot rain out of the sky on her all the time she was running the next in line it was a little caricature of a town square in it were the following fresh ingredients a candybox of a bandstand where men stood on thursday and sunday nights exploding music fine greenpatinated bronzecopper benches all scrolled and flourished fine blue and pink tiled walksblue as womens newly lacquered eyes pink as womens hidden wonders and fine frenchclipped trees in the shapes of exact hatboxes the whole from your hotel window had the fresh ingratiation and unbelievable fantasy one might expect of a french villa in the nineties but no this was mexico and this a plaza in a small colonial mexican town with a fine state opera house joseph came out on the sunheated balcony in the morning and knelt by the grille pointing his little box brownie behind him in the bath the water was running and maries voice came out whatre you doing he muttered a picture she asked again he clicked the shutter stood up wound the spool inside squinting and said took a picture of the town square god didnt those men shout last night i didnt sleep until twothirty we would have to arrive when the local rotarys having its wingding whatre our plans for today she asked were going to see the mummies he said oh she said there was a long silence he came in set the camera down and lit himself a cigarette ill go up and see them alone he said if youd rather no she said not very loud ill go along but i wish we could forget the whole thing its such a lovely little town look here he cried catching a movement from the corner of his eyes he hurried to the balcony stood there his cigarette smoking and forgotten in his fingers come quick marie im drying myself she said please hurry he said fascinated looking down into the street there was movement behind him and then the odor of soap and waterrinsed flesh wet towel fresh cologne marie was at his elbow stay right there she cautioned him so i can look without exposing myself im stark what is it look he cried a procession traveled along the street one man led it with a package on his head behind him came women in black rebozos chewing away the peels of oranges and spitting them on the cobbles little children at their elbows men ahead of them some ate sugar cane gnawing away at the outer bark until it split down and they pulled it off in great hunks to get at the succulent pulp and the juicy sinews on which to suck in all there were fifty people joe said marie behind him holding his arm it was no ordinary package the first man in the procession carried on his head balanced delicately as a chickenplume it was covered with silver satin and silver fringe and silver rosettes and he held it gently with one brown hand the other hand swinging free this was a funeral and the little package was a coffin joseph glanced at his wife she was the color of fine fresh milk the pink color of the bath was gone her heart had sucked it all down to some hidden vacuum in her she held fast to the french doorway and watched the traveling people go watched them eat fruit heard them talk gently laugh gently she forgot she was naked he said some little girl or boy gone to a happier place where are they takingher she did not think it unusual her choice of the feminine pronoun already she had identified herself with that tiny fragment parceled like an unripe variety of fruit now in this moment she was being carried up the hill within compressing darkness a stone in a peach silent and terrified the touch of the father against the coffin material outside gentle and noiseless and firm inside to the graveyard naturally thats where theyre taking her he said the cigarette making a filter of smoke across his casual face not the graveyard theres only one cemetery in these towns you know that they usually hurry it that little girl had probably been dead only a few hours a few hours she turned away quite ridiculous quite naked with only the towel supported by her limp untrying hands she walked toward the bed a few hours ago she was alive and now he went on now theyre hurrying her up the hill the climate isnt kind to the dead its hot theres no embalming they have to finish it quickly but to that graveyard that horrible place she said with a voice from a dream oh the mummies he said dont let that bother you she sat on the bed again and again stroking the towel laid across her lap her eyes were blind as the brown paps of her breasts she did not see him or the room she knew that if he snapped his fingers or coughed she wouldnt even look up they were eating fruit at her funeral and laughing she said its a long climb to the cemetery she shuddered a convulsive motion like a fish trying to free itself from a deepswallowed hook she lay back and he looked at her as one examines a poor sculpture all criticism all quiet and easy and uncaring she wondered idly just how much his hands had had to do with the broadening and flattening and changement of her body certainly this was not the body hed started with it was past saving now like clay which the sculptor has carelessly impregnated with water it was impossible to shape again in order to shape clay you warm it with your hands evaporate the moisture with heat but there was no more of that fine summer weather between them there was no warmth to bake away the aging moisture that collected and made pendant now her breasts and body when the heat is gone it is marvelous and unsettling to see how quickly a vessel stores selfdestroying water in its cells i dont feel well she said she lay there thinking it over i dont feel well she said again when he made no response after another minute or two she lifted herself lets not stay here another night joe but its a wonderful town yes but weve seen everything she got up she knew what came next gayness blitheness encouragement everything quite false and hopeful we could go on to patzcuaro make it in no time you wont have to pack ill do it all myself darling we can get a room at the don posada there they say its a beautiful little town this he remarked is a beautiful little town bougainvillea climb all over the buildings she said these he pointed to some flowers at the window are bougainvillea and wed fish you like fishing she said in bright haste and id fish too id learn yes i would ive always wanted to learn and they say the tarascan indians there are almost mongoloid in feature and dont speak much spanish and from there we could go to paracutin thats near uruapбn and they have some of the finest lacquered boxes there oh itll be fun joe ill pack you just take it easy and marie he stopped her with one word as she ran to the bathroom door yes i thought you said you didnt feel well i didnt i dont but thinking of all those swell places we havent seen onetenth of this town he explained logically theres that statue of morelos on the hill i want a shot of that and some of that french architecture up the street weve traveled three hundred miles and weve been here one day and now you want to rush off somewhere else ive already paid the rent for another night you can get it back she said why do you want to run away he said looking at her with an attentive simplicity dont you like the town i simply adore it she said her cheeks white smiling its so green and pretty well then he said another day youll love it thats settled she started to speak yes he asked nothing she closed the bathroom door behind it she rattled open a medicine box water rushed into a tumbler she was taking something for her stomach he came to the bathroom door marie the mummies dont bother you do they unhunh she said was it the funeral then unh because if you were really afraid id pack in a moment you know that darling he waited no im not afraid she said good girl he said the graveyard was enclosed by a thick adobe wall and at its four corners small stone angels tilted out on stony wings their grimy heads capped with bird droppings their hands gifted with amulets of the same substance their faces unquestionably freckled in the warm smooth flow of sunlight which was like a depthless tideless river joseph and marie climbed up the hill their shadows slanting blue behind them helping one another they made the cemetery gate swung back the spanish blue iron grille and entered it was several mornings after the celebratory fiesta of el dia de los muertos the day of the dead and ribbons and ravels of tissue and sparkletape still clung like insane hair to the raised stones to the handcarved lovepolished crucifixes and to the aboveground tombs which resembled marble jewelcases there were statues frozen in angelic postures over gravel mounds and intricately carved stones tall as men with angels spilling all down their rims and tombs as big and ridiculous as beds put out to dry in the sun after some nocturnal accident and within the four walls of the yard inserted into square mouths and slots were coffins walled in plated in by marble plates and plaster upon which names were struck and upon which hung tin pictures cheap peso portraits of the inserted dead thumbtacked to the different pictures were trinkets theyd loved in life silver charms silver arms legs bodies silver cups silver dogs silver church medallions bits of red crape and blue ribbon on some places were painted slats of tin showing the dead rising to heaven in oiltinted angels arms looking at the graves again they saw the remnants of the death fiesta the little tablets of tallow splashed over the stones by the lighted festive candles the wilted orchid blossoms lying like crushed redpurple tarantulas against the milky stones some of them looking horridly sexual limp and withered there were loopframes of cactus leaves bamboo reeds and wild dead morningglories there were circles of gardenias and sprigs of bougainvillea desiccated the entire floor of the yard seemed a ballroom after a wild dancing from which the participants have fled the tables askew confetti candles ribbons and deep dreams left behind they stood marie and joseph in the warm silent yard among the stones between the walls far over in one corner a little man with high cheekbones the milk color of the spanish infiltration thick glasses a black coat a gray hat and gray unpressed pants and neatly laced shoes moved about among the stones supervising something or other that another man in overalls was doing to a grave with a shovel the little man with glasses carried a thrice folded newspaper under his left arm and had his hands in his pockets buenos dias seсora y seсor he said when he finally noticed joseph and marie and came to see them is this the place of las mommias asked joseph they do exist do they not si the mummies said the man they exist and are here in the catacombs por favor said joseph yo quiero veo las mommias si si seсor me espaсol es mucho estupido es muy malo apologized joseph no no seсor you speak well this way please he led between the flowered stones to a tomb near the wall shadows it was a large flat tomb flush with the gravel with a thin kindling door flat on it padlocked it was unlocked and the wooden door flung back rattling to one side revealed was a round hole the circled interior of which contained steps which screwed into the earth before joseph could move his wife had set her foot on the first step here he said me first no thats all right she said and went down and around in a darkening spiral until the earth vanished her she moved carefully for the steps were hardly enough to contain a childs feet it got dark and she heard the caretaker stepping after her at her ears and then it got light again they stepped out into a long whitewashed hall twenty feet under the earth dimly lit by a few small gothic windows high in the arched ceiling the hall was fifty yards long ending on the left in a double door in which were set tall crystal panes and a sign forbidding entrance on the right end of the hall was a large stack of white rods and round white stones the soldiers who fought for father morelos said the caretaker they walked to the vast pile they were neatly put in place bone on bone like firewood and on top was a mound of a thousand dry slculls i dont mind skulls and bones said marie theres nothing even vaguely human to them im not scared of skulls and hones theyre like something insectile if a child was raised and didnt know he had a skeleton in him he wouldnt think anything of hones would he thats how it is with me everything human has been scraped off these theres nothing familiar left to be horrible in order for a thing to be horrible it has to suffer a change you can recognize this isnt changed theyre still skeletons like they always were the part that changed is gone and so theres nothing to show for it isnt that interesting joseph nodded she was quite brave now well she said lets see the mummies here seсora said the caretaker he took them far down the hall away from the stack of hones and when joseph paid him a peso he unlocked the forbidden crystal doors and opened them wide and they looked into an even longer dimly lighted hall in which stood the people they waited inside the door in a long line under the archroofed ceiling fiftyfive of them against one wall on the left fiftyfive of them against the right wall and five of them way down at the very end mister interlocutor said joseph briskly they resembled nothing more than those preliminary erections of a sculptor the wire frame the first tendons of clay the muscles and a thin lacquer of skin they were unfinished all one hundred and fifteen of them they were parchmentcolored and the skin was stretched as if to dry from bone to bone the bodies were intact only the watery humors had evaporated from them the climate said the caretaker it preserves them very dry how long have they been here asked joseph some one year some five seсor some ten some seventy there was an embarrassment of horror you started with the first man on your right hooked and wired upright against the wall and he was not good to look upon and you went on to the woman next to him who was unbelievable and then to a man who was horrendous and then to a woman who was very sorry she was dead and in such a place as this what are they doing here said joseph their relatives did not pay the rent upon their graves is there a rent si seсor twenty pesos a year or if they desire the permanent interment one hundred seventy pesos but our people they are very poor as you must know and one hundred seventy pesos is as much as many of them make in two years so they carry their dead here and place them into the earth for one year and the twenty pesos are paid with fine intentions of paying each year and each year but each year and each year after the first year they have a burro to buy or a new mouth to feed or maybe three new mouths and the dead after all are not hungry and the dead after all can pull no ploughs or there is a new wife or there is a roof in need of mending and the dead remember can be in no beds with a man and the dead you understand can keep no rain off one and so it is that the dead are not paid up upon their rent then what happens are you listening marie said joseph marie counted the bodies one two three four five six seven eight what she said quietly are you listening i think so what oh yes im listening eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen well then said the little man i call a trabajando and with his delicate shovel at the end of the first year he does dig and dig and dig down how deep do you think we dig seсor six feet thats the usual depth ah no ah no there seсor you would be wrong knowing that after the first year the rent is liable not to be paid we bury the poorest two feet down it is less work you understand of course we must judge by the family who own a body some of them we bury sometimes three sometimes four feet deep sometimes five sometimes six depending on how rich the family is depending on what the chances are we wont have to dig him from out his place a year later and let me tell you seсor when we bury a man the whole six feet deep we are very certain of his staying we have never dug up a sixfootburied one yet that is the accuracy with which we know the money of the people twentyone twentytwo twentythree maries lips moved with a small whisper and the bodies which are dug up are placed down here against the wall with the other compaсeros do the relatives know the bodies are here si the small man pointed this one yo veo it is new it has been here but one year his madre y padre know him to be here but have they money ah no isnt that rather gruesome for his parents the little man was earnest they never think of it he said did you hear that marie what thirty thirtyone thirtytwo thirtythree thirtyfour yes they never think of it what if the rent is paid again after a lapse inquired joseph in that time said the caretaker the bodies are reburied for as many years as are paid sounds like blackmail said joseph the little man shrugged hands in pockets we must live you are certain no one can pay the one hundred seventy pesos all at once said joseph so in this way you get them for twenty pesos a year year after year for maybe thirty years if they dont pay you threaten to stand mamacita or little niсo in the catacomb we must live said the little man fiftyone fiftytwo fiftythree marie counted in the center of the long corridor the standing dead on all sides of her they were screaming they looked as if they had leaped snapped upright in their graves clutched hands over their shriveled bosoms and screamed jaws wide tongues out nostrils flared and been frozen that way all of them had open mouths theirs was a perpetual screaming they were dead and they knew it in every raw fiber and evaporated organ they knew it she stood listening to them scream they say dogs hear sounds humans never hear sounds so many decibels higher than normal hearing that they seem nonexistent the corridor swarmed with screams screams poured from terroryawned lips and dry tongues screams you couldnt hear because they were so high joseph walked up to one standing body say ah he said sixtyfive sixtysix sixtyseven counted marie among the screams here is an interesting one said the proprietor they saw a woman with arms flung to her head mouth wide teeth intact whose hair was wildly flourished long and shimmery on her head her eyes were small pale whiteblue eggs in her skull sometimes this happens this woman she is a cataleptic one day she falls down upon the earth hut is really not dead for deep in her the little drum of her heart beats and beats so dim one cannot hear so she was buried in the graveyard in a fine inexpensive lox didnt you know she was cataleptic her sisters knew but this time they thought her at last dead and funerals are hasty things in this warm town she was buried a few hours after her death si the same all of this as you see her here we would never have known if a year later her sisters having other things to buy had not refused the rent on her burial so we dug very quietly down and loosed the box and took it up and opened the top of her box and laid it aside and looked in upon her marie stared this woman had wakened under the earth she had torn shrieked clubbed at the boxlid with fists died of suffocation in this attitude hands flung over her gaping face horroreyed hair wild be pleased seсor to find that difference between her hands and these other ones said the caretaker their peaceful fingers at their hips quiet as little roses hers ah hers are jumped up very wildly as if to pound the lid free couldnt rigor mortis do that believe me seсor rigor mortis pounds upon no lids rigor mortis screams not like this nor twists nor wrestles to rip free nails seсor or prise boards loose hunting for air seсor all these others are open of mouth si because they were not injected with the fluids of embalming but theirs is a simple screaming of muscles seсor this seсorita here hers is the muerte horrible marie walked scuffling her shoes turning first this way then that naked bodies long ago the clothes had whispered away the fat womens breasts were lumps of yeasty dough left in the dust the mens loins were indrawn withered orchids mr grimace and mr gape said joseph he pointed his camera at two men who seemed in conversation mouths in midsentence hands gesticulant and stiffened over some longdissolved gossip joseph clicked the shutter rolled the film focused the camera on another body clicked the shutter rolled the film walked on to another eightyone eightytwo eightythree jaws down tongues out like jeering children eyes pale brownirised in upclenched sockets hairs waxed and prickled by sunlight each sharp as quills embedded on the lips the cheeks the eyelids the brows little beards on chins and bosoms and loins flesh like drumheads and manuscripts and crisp bread dough the women huge illshaped tallow things deathmelted the insane hair of them like nests made and unmade and remade teeth each single each fine each perfect in jaw eightysix eightyseven eightyeight a rushing of maries eyes down the corridor flicking counting rushing never stopping on quick ninetyone ninetytwo ninetythree here was a man his stomach open like a tree hollow where you dropped your child love letters when you were eleven her eyes entered the hole in the space under his ribs she peeked in he looked like an erector set inside the spine the pelvic plates the rest was tendon parchment bone eye beardy jaw ear stupefied nostril and this ragged eaten cincture in his navel into which a pudding might be spooned ninetyseven ninetyeight names places dates things this woman died in childbirth like a little hungry doll the prematurely born child was wired dangling to her wrist this was a soldier his uniform still half on him maries eyes slammed the furthest wall after a backforth backforth swinging from horror to horror from skull to skull beating from rib to rib staring with hypnotic fascination at paralyzed loveless fleshless loins at men made into women by evaporation at women made into dugged swine the fearful ricochet of vision growing growing taking impetus from swollen breast to raving mouth wall to wall wall to wall again again like a ball hurled in a game caught in the incredible teeth spat in a scream across the corridor to be caught in claws lodged between thin teats the whole standing chorus invisibly chanting the game on on the wild game of sight recoiling rebounding reshuttling on down the inconceivable procession through a montage of erected horrors that ended finally and for all time when vision crashed against the corridor ending with one last scream from all present marie turned and shot her vision far down to where the spiral steps walked up into sunlight how talented was death how many expressions and manipulations of hand face body no two alike they stood like the naked pipes of a vast derelict calliope their mouths cut into frantic vents and now the great hand of mania descended upon all keys at once and the long calliope screamed upon one hundredthroated unending scream click went the camera and joseph rolled the film click went the camera and joseph rolled the film moreno morelos cantine gуmez gutiйrrez villanousul ureta licуn navarro iturbi jorge filomena nena manuel josй tomбs ramona this man walked and this man sang and this man had three wives and this man died of this and that of that and the third from another thing and the fourth was shot and the fifth was stabbed and the sixth fell straight down dead and the seventh drank deep and died dead and the eighth died in love and the ninth fell from his horse and the tenth coughed blood and the eleventh stopped his heart and the twelfth used to laugh much and the thirteenth was a dancing one and the fourteenth was most beautiful of all the fifteenth had ten children and the sixteenth is one of those children as is the seventeenth and the eighteenth was tomбs and did well with his guitar the next three cut maize in their fields had three lovers each the twentysecond was never loved the twentythird sold tortillas patting and shaping them each at the curb before the opera house with her little charcoal stove and the twentyfourth beat his wife and now she walks proudly in the town and is merry with new men and here he stands bewildered by this unfair thing and the twentyfifth drank several quarts of river with his lungs and was pulled forth in a net and the twentysixth was a great thinker and his brain now sleeps like a burnt plum in his skull id like a color shot of each and his or her name and how he or she died said joseph it would be an amazing an ironical book to publish the more you think the more it grows on you their life histories and then a picture of each of them standing here he tapped each chest softly they gave off hollow sounds like someone rapping on a door marie pushed her way through screams that hung netwise across her path she walked evenly in the corridor center not slow hut not too fast toward the spiral stair not looking to either side click went the camera behind her you have room down here for more said joseph si seсor many more wouldnt want to be next in line next on your waiting list ah no seсor one would not wish to be next how are chances of buying one of these oh no no seсor oh no no oh no seсor ill pay you fifty pesos oh no seсor no no seсor in the market the remainder of candy skulls from the death fiesta were sold from flimsy little tables women hung with black rebozos sat quietly now and then speaking one word to each other the sweet sugar skeletons the saccharine corpses and white candy skulls at their elbows each skull had a name on top in gold candy curlicue josй or carmen or ramуn or tena or guiermo or rosa they sold cheap the death festival was gone joseph paid a peso and got two candy skulls marie stood in the narrow street she saw the candy skulls and joceph and the dark ladies who put the skulls in a hag not really said marie why not said joseph not after just now she said in the catacombs she nodded he said but these are good they look poisonous just because theyre skullshaped no the sugar itself looks raw how do you know what kind of people made them they might have the colic my dear marie all people in mexico have colic he said you can eat them both she said alas poor yorick he said peeking into the bag they walked along a street that was held between high buildings in which were yellow window frames and pink iron grilles and the smell of tamales came from them and the sound of lost fountains splashing on hidden tiles and little birds clustering and peeping in bamboo cages and someone playing chopin on a piano chopin here said joseph how strange and swell he looked up i like that bridge hold this he handed her the candy hag while he clicked a picture of a red bridge spanning two white buildings with a man walking on it a red serape on his shoulder fine said joseph marie walked looking at joseph looking away from him and then back at him her lips moving but not speaking her eyes fluttering a little neck muscle under her chin like a wire a little nerve in her brow ticking she passed the candy bag from one hand to the other she stepped up a curb leaned back somehow gestured said something to restore balance and dropped the hag for christs sake joseph snatched up the bag look what youve done clumsy i should have broken my ankle she said i suppose these were the best skulls both of them smashed i wanted to save them for friends up home im sorry she said vaguely for gods sake oh damn it to hell he scowled into the hag i might not find any more good as these oh i dont know i give up the wind blew and they were alone in the street he staring down into the shattered debris in the bag she with the street shadows all around her sun on the other side of the street nobody about and the world far away the two of them alone two thousand miles from anywhere on a street in a false town which was nothing and around which was nothing but blank desert and circled hawks on top the state opera house a block down the golden greek statues stood sunbright and high and in a beer place a shouting phonograph cried ay marimba corazуn and all kinds of alien words which the wind stirred away joseph twisted the bag shut stuck it furiously in his pocket they walked back to the twothirty lunch at the hotel he sat at the table with marie sipping albуndigas soup from his moving spoon silently twice she commented cheerfully upon the wall murals and he looked at her steadily and sipped the bag of cracked skulls lay on the table seсora the soup plates were cleared by a brown hand a large plate of enchiladas was set down marie looked at the plate there were sixteen enchiladas she put her fork and knife out to take one and stopped she put her fork and knife down at each side of her plate she glanced at the walls and then at her husband and then at the sixteen enchiladas sixteen one by one a long row of them crowded together she counted them one two three four five six joseph took one on his plate and ate it six seven eight nine ten eleven she put her hands on her lap twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen she finished counting im not hungry she said he placed another enchilada before himself it had an interior clothed in a papyrus of corn tortilla it was slender and it was one of many he cut and placed in his mouth and she chewed it for him in her minds mouth and squeezed her eyes tight eh he asked nothing she said thirteen enchiladas remained like tiny bundles like scrolls he ate five more i dont feel well she said feel better if you ate he said no he finished then opened the sack and took out one of the halfdemolished skulls not here she said why not and he put one sugar socket to his lips chewing not bad he said thinking the taste he popped in another section of skull not bad at all she looked at the name on the skull he was eating marie it said it was tremendous the way she helped him pack in those newsreels you see men leap off divingboards into pools only a moment later when the reel is reversed to jump back up in airy fantasy to alight once more safe on the divingboard now as joseph watched the suits and dresses flew into their boxes and cases the hats were like birds darting clapped into round bright hatboxes the shoes seemed to run across the floor like mice to leap into valises the suitcases banged shut the hasps clicked the keys turned there she cried all packed oh joe im so glad you let me change your mind she started for the door here let me help he said theyre not heavy she said but you never carry suitcases you never have ill call a boy nonsense she said breathless with the weight of the valises a boy seized the cases outside the door seсora por favor have we forgotten anything he looked under the two beds he went out on the balcony and gazed at the plaza came in went to the bathroom looked in the cabinet and on the washbowl here he said coming out and handing her something you forgot your wristwatch did i she put it on and went out the door i dont know he said its damn late in the day to be moving out its only threethirty she said only threethirty i dont know he said doubtfully he looked around the room stepped out closed the door locked it went downstairs jingling the keys she was outside in the car already settled in her coat folded on her lap her gloved hands folded on the coat he came out supervised the loading of what luggage remained into the trunk receptacle came to the front door and tapped on the window she unlocked it and let him in well here we go she cried with a laugh her face rosy her eyes frantically bright she was leaning forward as if by this movement she might set the car rolling merrily down the hill thank you darling for letting me get the refund on the money you paid for our room tonight im sure well like it much better in guadalajara tonight thank you yeah he said inserting the ignition keys he stepped on the starter nothing happened he stepped on the starter again her mouth twitched it needs warming she said it was a cold night last night he tried it again nothing maries hands tumbled on her lap he tried it six more times well he said lying back ceasing try it again next time itll work she said its no use he said somethings wrong well youve got to try it once more he tried it once more itll work im sure she said is the ignition on is the ignition on he said yes its on it doesnt look like its on she said its on he showed her by twisting the key now try it she said there he said when nothing happened i told you youre not doing it right it almost caught that time she cried ill wear out the battery and god knows where you can buy a battery here wear it out then im sure itll start next time well if youre so good you try it he slipped from the car and beckoned her over behind the wheel go ahead she bit her lips and settled behind the wheel she did things with her hands that were like a little mystic ceremony with moves of hands and body she was trying to overcome gravity friction and every other natural law she patted the starter with her toeless shoe the car remained solemnly quiet a little squeak came out of maries tightened lips she rammed the starter home and there was a clear smell in the air as she fluttered the choke youve flooded it he said fine get back over on your side will you he got three boys to push and they started the car downhill he jumped in to steer the car rolled swiftly bumping and rattling maries face glowed expectantly thisll start it she said nothing started they rolled quietly into the filling station at the bottom of the hill bumping softly on the cobbles and stopped by the tanks she sat there saying nothing andwhen the attendant came from the station her door was locked the window up and he had to come around on the husbands side to make his query the mechanic arose from the car engine scowled at joseph and they spoke together in spanish quietly she rolled the window down and listened whats he say she demanded the two men talked on whats he say she demanded the dark mechanic waved at the engine joseph nodded and they conversed whats wrong marie wanted to know joseph frowned over at her wait a moment will you i cant listen to both of you the mechanic took josephs elbow they said many words whats he saying now she asked he says said joseph and was lost as the mexican took him over to the engine and bent him down in earnest discovery how much will it cost she cried out the window around at their bent backs the mechanic spoke to joseph fifty pesos said joseph how long will it take cried his wife joseph asked the mechanic the man shrugged and they argued for five minutes how long will it take said marie the discussion continued the sun went down the sky she looked at the sun upon the trees that stood high by the cemetery yard the shadows rose and rose until the valley was enclosed and only the sky was clear and untouched and blue two days maybe three said joseph turning to marie two days cant he fix it so we can just go on to the next town and have the rest done there joseph asked the man the man replied joseph said to his wife no hell have to do the entire job why thats silly its so silly he doesnt either he doesnt really have to do it all you tell him that joe tell him that he can hurry and fix it the two men ignored her they were talking earnestly again this time it was all in very slow motion the unpacking of the suitcases he did his own she left hers by the door i dont need anything she said leaving it locked youll need your nightgown he said ill sleep naked she said well it isnt my fault he said that damned car you can go down and watch them work on it later she said she sat on the edge of the bed they were in a new room she had refused to return to their old room she said she couldnt stand it she wanted a new room so it would seem they were in a new hotel in a new city so this was a new room with a view of the alley and the sewer system instead of the plaza and the drumbox trees you go down and supervise the work joe if you dont you know theyll take weeks she looked at him you should be down there now instead of standing around ill go down he said ill go down with you i want to buy some magazines you wont find any american magazines in a town like this i can look cant i besides we havent much money he said i dont want to have to wire my bank it takes a godawful time and its not worth the bother i can at least have my magazines she said maybe one or two he said as many as i want she said feverishly on the bed for gods sake youve got a million magazines in the car now posts colliers mercury atlantic monthlys barnaby superman you havent read half of the articles but theyre not new she said theyre not new ive looked at them and after youve looked at a thing i dont know try reading them instead of looking at them he said as they came downstairs night was in the plaza give me a few pesos she said and he gave her some teach me to say about magazines in spanish she said quiero una publicaciуn americano he said walking swiftly she repeated it stumblingly and laughed thanks he went on ahead to the mechanics shop and she turned in at the nearest farmacia botica and all the magazines racked before her there were alien colors and alien names she read the titles with swift moves of her eyes and looked at the old man behind the counter do you have american magazines she asked in english embarrassed to use the spanish words the old man stared at her habla inglйs she asked no seсorita she tried to think of the right words quierono she stopped she started again americanouhmaggahzeenas oh no seсorita her hands opened wide at her waist then closed like mouths her mouth opened and closed the shop had a veil over it in her eyes here she was and here were these small baked adobe people to whom she could say nothing and from whom she could get no words she understood and she was in a town of people who said no words to her and she said no words to them except in blushing confusion and bewilderment and the town was circled by desert and time and home was far away far away in another life she whirled and fled shop following shop she found no magazines save those giving bullfights in blood on their covers or murdered people or laceconfection priests but at last three poor copies of the post were bought with much display and loud laughter and she gave the vendor of this small shop a handsome tip rushing out with the posts eagerly on her bosom in both hands she hurried along the narrow walk took a skip over the gutter ran across the street sang lala jumped onto the further walk made another little scamper with her feet smiled an inside smile moving along swiftly pressing the magazines tightly to her halfclosing her eyes breathing the charcoal evening air feeling the wind watering past her ears starlight tinkled in golden nuclei off the highly perched greek figures atop the state theatre a man shambled by in the shadow balancing upon his head a basket the basket contained bread loaves she saw the man and the balanced basket and suddenly she did not move and there was no inside smile nor did her hands clasp tight the magazines she watched the man walk with one hand of his gently poised up to tap the basket any time it unbalanced and down the street he dwindled while the magazines slipped from maries fingers and scattered on the walk snatching them up she ran into the hotel and almost fell going upstairs she sat in the room the magazines were piled on each side of her and in a circle at her feet she had made a little castle with portcullises of words and into this she was withdrawn all about her were the magazines she had bought and bought and looked at and looked at on other days and these were the outer barrier and upon the inside of the barrier upon her lap as yet unopened but her hands were trembling to open them and read and read and read again with hungry eyes were the three battered post magazines she opened the first page she would go through them page by page line by line she decided not a line would go unnoticed a comma unread every little ad and every color would be fixed by her andshe smiled with discoveryin those other magazines at her feet were still advertisements and cartoons she had neglectedthere would be little morsels of stuff for her to reclaim and utilize later she would read this first post tonight yes tonight she would read this first delicious post page on page she would eat it and tomorrow night if there was going to be a tomorrow night but maybe there wouldnt be a tomorrow night here maybe the motor would start and thered be odors of exhaust and round hum of rubber tire on road and wind riding in the window and pennanting her hairbut suppose just suppose there would be a tomorrow night here in this room well then there would be two more posts one for tomorrow night and the next for the next night how neatly she said it to herself with her minds tongue she turned the first page she turned the second page her eyes moved over it and over it and her fingers unknown to her slipped under the next page and flickered it in preparation for turning and the watch ticked on her wrist and time passed and she sat turning pages turning pages hungrily seeing the framed people in the pictures people who lived in another land in another world where neons bravely held off the night with crimson bars and the smells were home smells and the people talked good fine words and here she was turning the pages and all the lines went across and down and the pages flew under her hands making a fan she threw down the first post seized on and riffled through the second in half an hour threw that down took up the third threw that down a good fifteen minutes later and found herself breathing breathing stiffly and swiftly in her body and out of her mouth she put her hand up to the back of her neck somewhere a soft breeze was blowing the hairs along the back of her neck slowly stood upright she touched them with one pale hand as one touches the nape of a dandelion outside in the plaza the street lights rocked like crazy flashlights on a wind papers ran through the gutters in sheep flocks shadows penciled and slashed under the bucketing lamps now this way now that here a shadow one instant there a shadow next now no shadows all cold light now no light all cold blueblack shadow the lamps creaked on their high metal hasps in the room her hands began to tremble she saw them tremble her body began to tremble under the bright bright print of the brightest loudest skirt she could find to put on especially for tonight in which she had whirled and cavorted feverishly before the coffinsized mirror beneath the rayon skirt the body was all wire and tendon and excitation her teeth chattered and fused and chattered her lipstick smeared one lip crushing another joseph knocked on the door they got ready for bed he had returned with the news that something had been done to the car and it would take time hed go watch them tomorrow but dont knock on the door she said standing before the mirror as she undressed leave it unlocked then he said i want it locked but dont rap call whats wrong with rapping he said it sounds funny she said what do you mean funny she wouldnt say she was looking at herself in the mirror and she was naked with her hands at her sides and there were her breasts and her hips and her entire body and it moved it felt the floor under it and the walls and air around it and the breasts could know hands if hands were put there and the stomach would make no hollow echo if touched for gods sake he said dont stand there admiring yourself he was in bed what are you doing he said whatre you putting your hands up that way for over your face he put the lights out she could not speak to him for she knew no words that he knew and he said nothing to her that she understood and she walked to her bed and slipped into it and he lay with his back to her in his bed and he was like one of these brownbaked people of this faraway town upon the moon and the real earth was off somewhere where it would take a starflight to reach it if only he could speak with her and she to him tonight how good the night might be and how easy to breathe and how lax the vessels of blood in her ankles and in her wrists and the underarms but there was no speaking and the night was ten thousand tickings and ten thousand twistings of the blankets and the pillow was like a tiny white warm stove undercheek and the blackness of the room was a mosquito netting draped all about so that a turn entangled her in it if only there was one word one word between them but there was no word and the veins did not rest easy in the wrists and the heart was a bellows forever blowing upon a little coal of fear forever illumining and making it into a cherry light again pulse and again an ingrown light which her inner eyes stared upon with unwanting fascination the lungs did not rest but were exercised as if she were a drowned person and she herself performing artificial respiration to keep the last life going and all of these things were lubricated by the sweat of her glowing body and she was glued fast between the heavy blankets like something pressed smashed redolently moist between the white pages of a heavy book and as she lay this way the long hours of midnight came when again she was a child she lay now and again thumping her heart in tambourine hysteria then quieting the slow sad thoughts of bronze childhood when everything was sun on green trees and sun on water and sun on blond child hair faces flowed by on merrygorounds of memory a face rushing to meet her facing her and away to the right another whirling in from the left a quick fragment of lost conversation and out to the right around and round oh the night was very long she consoled herself by thinking of the car starting tomorrow the throttling sound and the power sound and the road moving under and she smiled in the dark with pleasure but then suppose the car did not start she crumpled in the dark like a burning withering paper all the folds and corners of her clenched in about her and tick tick tick went the wristwatch tick tick tick and another tick to wither on morning she looked at her husband lying straight and easy on his bed she let her hand laze down at the cool space between the beds all night her hand had hung in that cold empty interval between once she had put her hand out toward him stretching but the space was just a little too long she couldnt reach him she had snapped her hand back hoping he hadnt heard the movement of her silent reaching there he lay now his eyes gently closed the lashes softly interlocked like clasped fingers breathing so quietly you could scarce see his ribs move as usual by this time of morning he had worked out of his pajamas his naked chest was revealed from the waist up the rest of him lay under cover his head lay on the pillow in thoughtful profile there was a beard stubble on his chin the morning light showed the white of her eyes they were the only things in the room in motion in slow starts and stops tracing the anatomy of the man across from her each little hair was perfect on the chin and cheeks a tiny hole of sunlight from the windowshade lay on his chin and picked out like the spikes of a musicbox cylinder each little hair on his face his wrists on either side of him had little curly black hairs each perfect each separate and shiny and glittering the hair on his head was intact strand by dark strand down to the roots the ears were beautifully carved the teeth were intact behind the lips joseph she screamed joseph she screamed again flailing up in terror bong bong bong went the bell thunder across the street from the great tiled cathedral pigeons rose in a papery white whirl like so many magazines fluttered past the window the pigeons circled the plaza spiraling up bong went the bells honk went a taxi horn far away down an alley a music box played cielito lindo all these faded into the dripping of the faucet in the bath sink joseph opened his eyes his wife sat on her bed staring at him i thought he said he blinked no he shut his eyes and shook his head just the bells a sigh what time is it i dont know yes i do eight oclock good god he murmured turning over we can sleep three more hours youve got to get up she cried nobodys up they wont be to work at the garage until ten you know that you cant rush these people keep quiet now but youve got to get up she said he halfturned sunlight prickled black hairs into bronze on his upper lip why why in christs name do i have to get up you need a shave she almost screamed he moaned so i have to get up and lather myself at eight in the morning because i need a shave well you do need one im not shaving again till we reach texas you cant go around looking like a tramp i can and will ive shaved every morning for thirty goddamn mornings and put on a tie and had a crease in my pants from now on no pants no ties no shaving no nothing he yanked the covers over his ears so violently that he pulled the blankets off one of his naked legs the leg hung upon the rim of the bed warm white in the sunlight each little black hairperfect her eyes widened focused stared upon it she put her hand over her mouth tight he went in and out of the hotel all day he did not shave he walked along the plaza tiles below he walked so slowly she wanted to throw a lightning bolt out of the window and hit him he paused and talked to the hotel manager below under a drumcut tree shifting his shoes on the pale blue plaza tiles he looked at birds on trees and saw how the state theatre statues were dressed in fresh morning gilt and stood on the corner watching the traffic carefully there was no traffic he was standing there on purpose taking his time not looking back at her why didnt he run lope down the alley down the hill to the garage pound on the doors threaten the mechanics lift them by their pants shove them into the car motor he stood instead watching the ridiculous traffic pass a hobbled swine a man on a bike a ford and three halfnude children go go go she screamed silently and almost smashed the window he sauntered across the street he went around the corner all the way down to the garage hed stop at windows read signs look at pictures handle pottery maybe hed stop in for a beer god yes a beer she walked in the plaza took the sun hunted for more magazines she cleaned her fingernails burnished them took a bath walked again in the plaza ate very little and returned to the room to feed upon her magazines she did not lie down she was afraid to each time she did she fell into a halfdream halfdrowse in which all her childhood was revealed in a helpless melancholy old friends children she hadnt seen or thought of in twenty years filled her mind and she thought of things she wanted to do and had never done she had meant to call lila holdridge for the past eight years since college but somehow she never had what friends they had been dear lila she thought when lying down of all the books the fine new and old books she had meant to buy and might never buy now and read how she loved books and the smell of books she thought of a thousand old sad things shed wanted to own the oz books all her life yet had never bought them why not while yet there was life the first thing shed do would be to buy them when she got back to new york and shed call lila immediately and shed see bert and jimmy and helen and louise and go back to illinois and walk around in her childhood place and see the things to be seen there if she got back to the states if her heart beat painfully in her paused held on to itself and beat again if she ever got back she lay listening to her heart critically thud and a thud and a thud pause thud and a thud and a thud pause what if it should stop while she was listening there silence inside her joseph she leaped up she grabbed at her breasts as if to squeeze to pump to start the silent heart again it opened in her closed rattled and beat nervously twenty rapid shotlike times she sank on to the bed what if it should stop again and not start what would she think what would there be to do shed die of fright thats what a joke it was very humorous die of fright if you heard your heart stop she would have to listen to it keep it beating she wanted to go home and see lila and buy the books and dance again and walk in central park andlisten thud and a thud and a thud pause joseph knocked on the door joseph knocked on the door and the car was not repaired and there would be another night and joseph did not shave and each little hair was perfect on his chin and the magazine shops were closed and there were no more magazines and they ate supper a little bit anyway for her and he went out in the evening to walk in the town she sat once more in the chair and slow erections of hair rose as if a magnet were passed over her neck she was very weak and could not move from the chair and she had no body she was only a heartbeat a huge pulsation of warmth and ache between four walls of the room her eyes were hot and pregnant swollen with child of terror behind the bellied tautened lips deeply inside herself she felt the first little cog slip another night another night another night she thought and this will be longer than the last the first little cog slipped the pendulum missed a stroke followed by the second and third interrelated cogs the cogs interlocked a small with a little larger one the little larger one with a bit larger one the bit larger one with a large one the large one with a huge one the huge one with an immense one the immense one with a titanic one a red ganglion no bigger than a scarlet thread snapped and quivered a nerve no greater than a red linen fiber twisted deep in her one little mech was gone and the entire machine imbalanced was about to steadily shake itself to bits she didnt fight it she let it quake and terrorize her and knock the sweat off her brow and jolt down her spine and flood her mouth with horrible wine she felt as if a broken gyro tilted now this way now that and blundered and trembled and whined in her the color fell from her face like light leaving a clickedoff bulb the crystal cheeks of the bulb vessel showing veins and filaments all colorless joseph was in the room he had come in but she didnt even hear him he was in the room but it made no difference he changed nothing with his coming he was getting ready for bed and said nothing as he moved about and she said nothing but fell into the bed while he moved around in a smokefilled space beyond her and once he spoke but she didnt hear him she timed it every five minutes she looked at her watch and the watch shook and time shook and the five fingers were fifteen moving reassembling into five the shaking never stopped she called for water she turned and turned upon the bed the wind blew outside cocking the lights and spilling bursts of illumination that hit buildings glancing sidelong blows causing windows to glitter like opened eyes and shut swiftly as the light tilted in yet another direction downstairs all was quiet after the dinner no sounds came up into their silent room he handed her a water glass im cold joseph she said lying deep in folds of cover youre all right he said no im not im not well im afraid theres nothing to be afraid of i want to get on the train for the united states theres a train in leon but none here he said lighting a new cigarette lets drive there in these taxis with these drivers and leave our car here yes i want to go youll be all right in the morning i know i wont be im not well he said it would cost hundreds of dollars to have the car shipped home i dont care i have two hundred dollars in the bank home ill pay for it but please lets go home when the sun shines tomorrow youll feel better its just that the suns gone now yes the suns gone and the winds blowing she whispered closing her eyes turning her head listening oh what a lonely wind mexicos a strange land all the jungles and deserts and lonely stretches and here and there a little town like this with a few lights burning you could put out with a snap of your fingers its pretty big country he said dont these people ever get lonely theyre used to it this way dont they get afraid then they have a religion for that i wish i had a religion the minute you get a religion you stop thinking he said believe in one thing too much and you have no room for new ideas tonight she said faintly id like nothing more than to have no more room for new ideas to stop thinking to believe in one thing so much it leaves me no time to be afraid youre not afraid he said if i had a religion she said ignoring him id have a lever with which to lift myself but i havent a lever now and i dont know how to lift myself oh for gods he mumbled to himself sitting down i used to have a religion she said baptist no that was when i was twelve i got over that i meanlater you never told me you should have known she said what religion plaster saints in the sacristy any special saint you liked to tell your beads to yes and did he answer your prayers for a little while lately no never never any more not for years now but i keep praying which saint is this saint joseph saint joseph he got up and poured himself a glass of water from the glass pitcher and it was a lonely trickling sound in the room my name coincidence she said they looked at one another for a few moments he looked away plaster saints he said drinking the water down after a while she said joseph he said yes and she said come hold my hand will you women he sighed he came and held her hand after a minute she drew her hand away hid it under the blanket leaving his hand empty behind with her eyes closed she trembled the words never mind its not as nice as i can imagine it its really nice the way i can make you hold my hand in my mind gods he said and went into the bathroom she turned off the light only the small crack of light under the bathroom door showed she listened to her heart it beat one hundred and fifty times a minute steadily and the little whining tremor was still in her marrow as if each bone of her body had a bluebottle fly imprisoned in it hovering buzzing shaking quivering deep deep deep her eyes reversed into herself to watch the secret heart of herself pounding itself to pieces against the side of her chest water ran in the bathroom she heard him washing his teeth joseph yes he said behind the shut door come here what do you want i want you to promise me something please oh please what is it open the door first what is it he demanded behind the closed door promise me she said and stopped promise you what he asked after a long pause promise me she said and couldnt go on she lay there he said nothing she heard the watch and her heart pounding together a lantern creaked on the hotel exterior promise me if anything happens she heard herself say muffled and paralyzed as if she were on one of the surrounding hills talking at him from the distance if anything happens to me you wont let me be buried here in the graveyard over those terrible catacombs dont be foolish he said behind the door promise me she said eyes wide in the dark of all the foolish things to talk about promise please promise youll be all right in the morning he said promise so i can sleep i can sleep if only youd say you wouldnt let me be put there i dont want to be put there honestly he said out of patience please she said why should i promise anything so ridiculous he said youll be fine tomorrow and besides if you died youd look very pretty in the catacomb standing between mr grimace and mr gape with a sprig of morningglory in your hair and he laughed sincerely silence she lay there in the dark dont you think youll look pretty there he asked laughingly behind the door she said nothing in the dark room dont you he said somebody walked down below in the plaza faintly fading away eh he asked her brushing his teeth she lay there staring up at the ceiling her breast rising and falling faster faster faster the air going in and out in and out her nostrils a little trickle of blood coming from her clenched lips her eyes were very wide her hands blindly constricted the bedclothes eh he said again behind the door she said nothing sure he talked to himself pretty as hell he murmured under the flow of tap water he rinsed his mouth sure he said nothing from her in the bed women are funny he said to himself in the mirror she lay in the bed sure he said he gargled with some antiseptic spat it down the drain youll be all right in the morning he said not a word from her well get the car fixed she didnt say anything be morning before you know it he was screwing caps on things now putting freshener on his face and the car fixed tomorrow maybe at the very latest the next day you wont mind another night here will you she didnt answer will you he asked no reply the light blinked out under the bathroom door marie he opened the door asleep she lay with eyes wide breasts moving up and down asleep he said well good night lady he climbed into his bed tired he said no reply tired he said the wind tossed the lights outside the room was oblong and black and he was in his bed dozing already she lay eyes wide the watch ticking on her wrist breasts moving up and down it was a fine day coming through the tropic of cancer the automobile pushed along the turning road leaving the jungle country behind heading for the united states roaring between the green hills taking every turn leaving behind a faint vanishing trail of exhaust smoke and inside the shiny automobile sat joseph with his pink healthy face and his panama hat and a little camera cradled on his lap as he drove a swathe of black silk pinned around the left upper arm of his tan coat he watched the country slide by and absentmindedly made a gesture to the seat beside him and stopped he broke into a little sheepish smile and turned once more to the window of his car humming a tuneless tune his right hand slowly reaching over to touch the seat beside him which was empty the watchful poker chip of h matisse when first we meet george garvey he is nothing at all later hell wear a white poker chip monocle with a blue eye painted on it by matisse himself later a golden bird cage might trill within george garveys false leg and his good left hand might possibly be fashioned of shimmering copper and jade but at the beginninggaze upon a terrifyingly ordinary man financial section dear the newspapers rattle in his evening apartment weatherman says rain tomorrow the tiny black hairs in his nostrils breathe in breathe out softly softly hour after hour time for bed by his look quite obviously born of several wax window dummies and with the trick much admired by magicians of sitting in a green velour chair andvanishing turn your head and you forgot his face vanilla pudding yet the merest accident made him the nucleus for the wildest avantgarde literary movement in history garvey and his wife had lived enormously alone for twenty years she was a lovely carnation but the hazard of meeting him pretty well kept visitors off neither husband nor wife suspected garveys talent for mummifying people instantaneously both claimed they were satisfied sitting alone nights after a brisk day at the office both worked at anonymous jobs and sometimes even they could not recall the name of the colorless company which used them like white paint on white paint enter the avantgarde enter the cellar septet these odd souls had flourished in parisian basements listening to a rather sluggish variety of jazz preserved a highly volatile relationship six months or more and returning to the united states on the point of clamorous disintegration stumbled into mr george garvey my god cried alexander pape erstwhile potentate of the clique i met the most astounding bore you simply must see him at bill timmins apartment house last night a note said hed return in an hour in the hall this garvey chap asked if id like to wait in his apartment there we sat garvey his wife myself incredible hes a monstrous ennui produced by our materialistic society he knows a billion ways to paralyze you absolutely rococo with the talent to induce stupor deep slumber or stoppage of the heart what a case study lets all go visit they swarmed like vultures life flowed to garveys door life sat in his parlor the cellar septet perched on his fringed sofa eyeing their prey garvey fidgeted anyone wants to smoke he smiled faintly whygo right aheadsmoke silence the instructions were mums the word put him on the spot thats the only way to see what a colossal norm he is american culture at absolute zero after three minutes of unblinking quiet mr garvey leaned forward eh he said whats your business mr crabtree the poet garvey mused over this hows he said business not a sound here lay a typical garvey silence here sat the largest manufacturer and deliverer of silences in the world name one he could provide it packaged and tied with throatclearings and whispers embarrassed pained calm serene indifferent blessed golden or nervous silences garvey was in there well the cellar septet simply wallowed in this particular evenings silence later in their coldwater flat over a bottle of adequate little red wine they tore this silence to bits and worried it did you see how he fingered his collar ho by god though i must admit hes almost cool mention muggsy spanier and bix beiderbecke notice his expression very cool i wish i could look so uncaring so unemotional ready for bed george garvey reflecting upon this extraordinary evening realized that when situations got out of hand when strange books or music were discussed he panicked he froze this hadnt seemed to cause undue concern among his rather oblique guests in fact on the way out they had shaken his hand vigorously thanked him for a splendid time what a really expert anumber bore cried alexander pape across town perhaps hes secretly laughing at us said smith the minor poet who never agreed with pape if he was awake lets fetch minnie and tom theyd love garvey a rare night well talk of it for months did you notice asked smith the minor poet eyes closed smugly when you turn the taps in their bathroom he paused dramatically hot water everyone stared irritably at smith they hadnt thought to try the clique an incredible yeast soon burst doors and windows growing you havent met the garveys my god lie back down in your coffin garvey must rehearse no ones that boorish without stanislavsky here the speaker alexander pape who depressed the entire group because he did perfect imitations now aped garveys slow selfconscious delivery ulysses wasnt that the book about the greek the ship and the oneeyed monster beg pardon a pause oh another pause i see a sitting back ulysses was written by james ce odd i could swear i remember years ago in school in spite of everyone hating alexander pape for his brilliant imitations they roared as he went on tennessee williams is he the man who wrote that hillbilly waltz quick whats garveys home address everyone cried my observed mr garvey to his wife life is fun these days its you replied his wife notice they hang on your every word their attention is rapt said mr garvey to the point of hysteria the least thing i say absolutely explodes them odd my jokes at the office always met a stony wall tonight for instance i wasnt trying to be funny at all i suppose its an unconscious little stream of wit that flows quietly under everything i do or say nice to know i have it in reserve ah theres the bell here we go hes especially rare if you get him out of bed at four am said alexander pape the combination of exhaustion and fin de siиcle morality is a regular salad everyone was pretty miffed at pape for being first to think of seeing garvey at dawn nevertheless interest ran high after midnight in late october mr garveys subconscious told him in utmost secrecy that he was the opener of a theatrical season his success dependent upon the staying power of the ennui he inspired in others enjoying himself he nevertheless guessed why these lemmings thronged to his private sea underneath garvey was a surprisingly brilliant man but his unimaginative parents had crushed him in the terribly strange bed of their environment from there he had been thrown to a larger lemonsqueezer his office his factory his wife the result a man whose potentialities were a time bomb in his own parlor the garveys repressed subconscious half recognized that the avantgardists had never met anyone like him or rather had met millions like him but had never considered studying one before so here he was the first of autumns celebrities next month it might be some abstractionist from allentown who worked on a twelvefoot ladder shooting housepaint in two colors only blue and cloudgray from cakedecorators and insecticidesprayers on canvas covered with layers of mucilage and coffee grounds who simply needed appreciation to grow or a chicago tincutter of mobiles aged fifteen already ancient with knowledge mr garveys shrewd subconscious grew even more suspicious when he made the terrible mistake of reading the avantgardes favorite magazine nucleus this article on dante now said garvey fascinating especially where it discusses the spatial metaphors conveyed in the foothills of the antipurgatorio and the paradiso terrestre on top of the mountain the bit about cantos xvxviii the socalled doctrinal cantos is brilliant how did the cellar septet react stunned all of them there was a noticeable chill they departed in short order when instead of being a delightfully massminded keepupwiththejoneses machinedominated chap leading a wishywashy life of quiet desperation garvey enraged them with opinions on does existentialism still exist or is kraftebbing they didnt want opinions on alchemy and symbolism given in a piccolo voice garveys subconscious warned him they only wanted garveys good oldfashioned plain white bread and churned country butter to be chewed on later at a dim bar exclaiming how priceless garvey retreated next night he was his old precious self dale carnegie splendid religious leader hart schaffner marx better than bond street member of the aftershave club that was garvey latest bookofthemonth here on the table had they ever tried elinor glyn the cellar septet was horrified delighted they let themselves be bludgeoned into watching milton berle garvey laughed at everything berle said it was arranged for neighbors to taperecord various daytime soap operas which garvey replayed evenings with religious awe while the cellar septet analyzed his face and his complete devotion to ma perkins and johns other wife oh garvey was getting sly his inner self observed youre on top stay there please your public tomorrow play the two black crows records mind your step bonnie baker now thats it theyll shudder incredulous that you really like her singing what about guy lombardo thats the ticket the mobmind said his subconscious youre symbolic of the crowd they came to study the dreadful vulgarity of this imaginary mass man they pretend to hate but theyre fascinated with the snakepit guessing his thought his wife objected they like you in a frightening sort of way he said ive lain awake figuring why they should come see me always hated and bored myself stupid tattletalegray man not an original thought in my mind all i know now is i love company ive always wanted to be gregarious never had the chance its been a ball these last months but their interest is dying i want company forever what shall ido his subconscious provided shopping lists beer its unimaginative pretzels delightfully passй stop by mothers pick up max field parrish painting the flyspecked sunburnt one lecture on same tonight by december mr garvey was really frightened the cellar septet was now quite accustomed to milton berle and guy lombardo in fact they had rationalized themselves into a position where they acclaimed berle as really too rare for the american public and lombardo was twenty years ahead of his time the nastiest people liked him for the commonest reasons garveys empire trembled suddenly he was just another person no longer diverting the tastes of friends but frantically pursuing them as they seized at nora bayes the knickerbocker quartette al jolson singing where did robinson crusoe go with friday on saturday night and shep fields and his rippling rhythm maxfield parrishs rediscovery left mr garvey in the north pasture overnight everyone agreed beers intellectual what a shame so many idiots drink it in short his friends vanished alexander pape it was rumored for a lark was even considering hot water for his coldwater flat this ugly canard was quashed but not before alexander pape suffered a comedown among the cognoscenti garvey sweated to anticipate the shifting taste he increased the free food output foresaw the swing back to the roaring twenties by wearing hairy knickers and displaying his wife in a tube dress and boyish bob long before anyone else but the vultures came ate and ran now that this frightful giant tv strode the world they were busily reembracing radio bootlegged transcriptions of vic and sade and pepper youngs family were fought over at intellectual galas at long last garvey was forced to turn to a series of miraculous tours de force conceived and carried out by his panicstricken inner self the first accident was a slammed car door mr garveys little fingertip was neatly cut off in the resultant chaos hopping about garvey stepped on then kicked the fingertip into a street drain by the time they fished it out no doctor would bother sewing it back on a happy accident next day strolling by an oriental shop garvey spied a beautiful objet dart his peppy old subconscious considering his steadily declining box office and his poor audiencerating among the avantgarde forced him into the shop and dragged out his wallet have you seen garvey lately screamed alexander pape on the phone my god go see whats that everyone stared mandarins fingerguard garvey waved his hand casually oriental antique mandarins used them to protect the fiveinch nails they cultivated he drank his beer the goldthimbled little finger cocked everyone hates cripples the sight of things missing it was sad losing my finger but im happier with this gold thingamajig its a much nicer finger now than any of us can ever have his wife dished them all a little green salad and george has the right to use it garvey was shocked and charmed as his dwindling popularity returned ah art ah life the pendulum swinging back and forth from complex to simple again to complex from romantic to realistic back to romantic the clever man could sense intellectual perihelions and prepare for the violent new orbits garveys subconscious brilliance sat up began to eat a bit and some days dared to walk about trying its unused limbs it caught fire how unimaginative the world is his longneglected other self said using his tongue if somehow my leg were severed accidentally i wouldnt wear a wooden leg no id have a gold leg crusted with precious stones made and part of the leg would be a golden cage in which a bluebird would sing as i walked or sat talking to friends and if my arm were cut off id have a new arm made of copper and jade all hollow inside a section for dry ice in it and five other compartments one for each finger drink anyone id cry sherry brandy dubonnet then id twist each finger calmly over the glasses from five fingers five cool streams five liqueurs or wines id tap the golden faucets shut bottoms up id cry but most of all one almost wishes that ones eye would offend one pluck it out the bible says it was the bible wasnt it if that happened to me id use no grisly glass eyes by god none of those black pirates patches know what id do id mail a poker chip to your friend in france whats his name matisse id say enclosed find poker chip and personal check please paint on this chip one beautiful blue human eye yrs sincerely g garvey well garvey had always abhorred his body found his eyes pale weak lacking character so he was not surprised a month later to see his right eye water fester and then pull a complete blank garvey was absolutely bombed butequallysecretly pleased with the cellar septet smiling like a jury of gargoyles at his elbow he airmailed the poker chip to france with a check for fifty dollars the check returned uncashed a week later in the next mail came the poker chip h matisse had painted a rare beautiful blue eye on it delicately lashed and browed h matisse had tucked this chip in a greenplush jewelers box quite obviously as delighted as was garvey with the entire enterprise harpers bazaar published a picture of garvey wearing the matisse pokerchip eye and yet another of matisse himself painting the monocle after considerable experimentation with three dozen chips h matisse had had the uncommon good sense to summon a photographer to leica the affair for posterity he was quoted after i had thrown away twentyseven eyes i finally got the very one i wanted it flies posthaste to monsieur garvey reproduced in six colors the eye rested balefully in its greenplush box duplicates were struck off for sales by the museum of modern art the friends of the cellar septet played poker using red chips with blue eyes white chips with red eyes and blue chips with white eyes but there was only one man in new york who wore the original matisse monocle and that was mr garvey im still a nervewracking bore he told his wife but now theyll never know what a dreadful ox i am underneath the monocle and the mandarins finger and if their interest should happen to dwindle again one can always arrange to lose an arm or leg no doubt of it ive thrown up a wondrous faзade no one will ever find the ancient boor again and as his wife put it only the other afternoon i hardly think of him as the old george garvey any more hes changed his name giulio he wants to be called sometimes at night i look over at him and call george but theres no answer there he is that mandarins thimble on his little finger the white and blue matisse pokerchip monocle in his eye i wake up and look at him often and do you know sometimes that incredible matisse poker chip seems to give out with a monstrous wink skeleton it was past time for him to see the doctor again mr harris turned palely in at the stair well and on his way up the flight saw dr burleighs name gilded over a pointing arrow would dr burleigh sigh when he walked in after all this would make the tenth trip so far this year but burleigh shouldnt complain he was paid for the examinations the nurse looked mr harris over and smiled a bit amusedly as she tiptoed to the glazed glass door opened it and put her head in harris thought he heard her say guess whos here doctor and didnt the doctors voice reply faintly oh my god again harris swallowed uneasily when harris walked in dr burleigh snorted aches in your bones again ah he scowled and adjusted his glasses my dear harris youve been curried with the finesttooth combs and bacteriabrushes known to science youre just nervous lets see your fingers too many cigarettes lets smell your breath too much protein lets see your eyes not enough sleep my response go to bed stop the protein no smoking ten dollars please harris stood sulking the doctor glanced up from his papers you still here youre a hypochondriac thats eleven dollars now but why should my bones ache asked harris dr burleigh spoke as to a child you ever had a sore muscle and kept irritating it fussing with it rubbing it it gets worse the more you bother it then you leave it alone and the pain vanishes you realize you caused most of the soreness yourself well son thats whats with you leave yourself alone take a dose of salts get out of here and take that trip to phoenix youve stewed about for months do you good to travel five minutes later mr harris riffled through a classified phone directory at the corner druggists a fine lot of sympathy one got from blind fools like burleigh he passed his finger down a list of bone specialists found one named m munigant munigant lacked an md or any other academic lettering behind his name but his office was conveniently near three blocks down one block over m munigant like his office was small and dark like his office he smelled of iodoform iodine and other odd things he was a good listener though and listened with eager shiny moves of his eyes and when he talked to harris his accent was such that he softly whistled each word undoubtedly because of imperfect dentures harris told all m munigant nodded he had seen cases like this before the bones of the body man was not aware of his bones ah yes the bones the skeleton most difficult something concerning an imbalance an unsympathetic coordination between soul flesh and skeleton very complicated softly whistled m munigant harris listened fascinated now here was a doctor who understood his illness psychological said m munigant he moved swiftly delicately to a dingy wall and slashed down half a dozen xrays to haunt the room with their look of things found floating in an ancient tide here here the skeleton surprised here luminous portraits of the long the short the large the small bones mr harris must be aware of his position his problem m munigants hand tapped rattled whispered scratched at faint nebulae of flesh in which hung ghosts of cranium spinalcord pelvis lime calcium marrow here there this that these those and others look harris shuddered the xrays and the paintings blew in a green and phosphorescent wind from a land peopled by the monsters of dali and fuseli m munigant whistled quietly did mr harris wish his bonestreated that depends said harris well m munigant could not help harris unless harris was in the proper mood psychologically one had to need help or the doctor was useless but m munigant would try harris lay on a table with his mouth open the lights were switched off the shades drawn m munigant approached his patient something touched harriss tongue he felt his jawbones forced out they creaked and made faint cracking noises one of those skeleton charts on the dim wall seemed to quiver and jump a violent shudder seized harris involuntarily his mouth snapped shut m munigant shouted his nose had almost been bitten off no use no use now was not the time m munigant whispered the shades up dreadfully disappointed when mr harris felt he could cooperate psychologically when mr harris really needed help and trusted m munigant to help him then maybe something could be done m munigant held out his little hand in the meantime the fee was only two dollars mr harris must begin to think here was a sketch for mr harris to take home and study it would acquaint him with his body he must be tremblingly aware of himself he must be on guard skeletons were strange unwieldy things m munigants eyes glittered good day to mr harris oh and would he care for a breadstick m munigant proffered a jar of long hard salty breadsticks to harris taking one himself saying that chewing breadsticks kept him inahpractice good day good day to mr harris mr harris went home the next day sunday mr harris discovered innumerable fresh aches and pains in his body he spent the morning his eyes fixed staring with new interest at the small anatomically perfect painting of a skeleton m munigant had given him his wife clarisse startled him at dinner when she cracked her exquisitely thin knuckles one by one until he clapped his hands to his ears and cried stop the rest of the afternoon he quarantined himself in his room clarisse played bridge in the parlor laughing and chatting with three other ladies while harris hidden away fingered and weighed the limbs of his body with growing curiosity after an hour he suddenly rose and called clarisse she had a way of dancing into any room her body doing all sorts of soft agreeable things to keep her feet from ever quite touching the nap of a rug she excused herself from her friends and came to see him now brightly she found him reseated in a far corner and she saw that he was staring at the anatomical sketch are you still brooding sweet she asked please dont she sat upon his knees her beauty could not distract him now in his absorption he juggled her lightness he touched her kneecap suspiciously it seemed to move under her pale glowing skin is it supposed to do that he asked sucking in his breath is what supposed to do what she laughed you mean my kneecap is it supposed to run around on top your knee that way she experimented so it does she marveled im glad yours slithers too he sighed i was beginning to worry about what he patted his ribs my ribs dont go all the way down they stop here and i found some confounded ones that dangle in midair beneath the curve of her small breasts clarisse clasped her hands of course silly everybodys ribs stop at a given point and those funny short ones are floating ribs i hope they dont float around too much the joke was most uneasy now above all he wished to be alone further discoveries newer and stranger archaeological diggings lay within reach of his trembling hands and he did not wish to be laughed at thanks for coming in dear he said any time she rubbed her small nose softly against his wait here now he put his finger to touch his nose and hers did you realize the nosebone grows down only this far from there on a lot of gristly tissue fills out the rest she wrinkled hers of course darling and she danced from the room now sitting alone he felt the perspiration rise from the pools and hollows of his face to flow in a thin tide down his cheeks he licked his lips and shut his eyes now now next on the agenda what the spinal cord yes here slowly he examined it in the same way he operated the many pushbuttons in his office thrusting them to summon secretaries messengers but now in these pushings of his spinal column fears and terrors answered rushed from a million doors in his mind to confront and shake him his spine felt horriblyunfamiliar like the brittle shards of a fish freshly eaten its bones left strewn on a cold china platter he seized the little rounded knobbins lord lord his teeth began to chatter god allmighty he thought why havent i realized it all these years all these years ive gone around with askeletoninside me how is it we take ourselves for granted how is it we never question our bodies and our being a skeleton one of those jointed snowy hard things one of those foul dry brittle gougeeyed skullfaced shakefingered rattling things that sway from neckchains in abandoned webbed closets one of those things found on the desert all long and scattered like dice he stood upright because he could not bear to remain seated inside me now he grasped his stomach his head inside my head is askull one of those curved carapaces which holds my brain like an electrical jelly one of those cracked shells with the holes in front like two holes shot through it by a doublebarreled shotgun with its grottoes and caverns of bone its revetments and placements for my flesh my smelling my seeing my hearing my thinking a skull encompassing my brain allowing it exit through its brittle windows to see the outside world he wanted to dash into the bridge party upset it a fox in a chickenyard the cards fluttering all around like chicken feathers burst upward in clouds he stopped himself only with a violent trembling effort now now man control yourself this is a revelation take it for what its worth understand it savor it but a skeleton screamed his subconscious i wont stand for it its vulgar its terrible its frightening skeletons are horrors they clink and tinkle and rattle in old castles hung from oaken beams making long indolently rustling pendulums on the wind darling will you come meet the ladies his wifes clear sweet voice called from far away mr harris stood his skeleton held him up this thing inside this invader this horror was supporting his arms legs and head it was like feeling someone just behind you who shouldnt be there with every step he realized how dependent he was on this other thing darling ill be with you in a moment he called weakly to himself he said come on brace up youve got to go back to work tomorrow friday you must make that trip to phoenix its a long drive hundreds of miles must be in shape for that trip or you wont get mr creldon to invest in your ceramics business chin up now a moment later he stood among the ladies being introduced to mrs withers mrs abblematt and miss kirthy all of whom had skeletons inside them but took it very calmly because nature had carefully clothed the bare nudity of clavicle tibia and femur with breasts thighs calves with coiffure and eyebrow satanic with beestung lips andlord shouted mr harris inwardlywhen they talk or eat part of their skeleton showstheir teeth i never thought of that excuse me he gasped and ran from the room only in time to drop his lunch among the petunias over the garden balustrade that night seated on the bed as his wife undressed he pared his toenails and fingernails scrupulously these parts too were where his skeleton was shoving indignantly growing out he must have muttered part of this theory because next thing he knew his wife in negligee was on the bed her arms about his neck yawning oh my darling fingernails are not bone theyre only hardened epidermis he threw the scissors down are you certain i hope so id feel better he looked at the curve of her body marveling i hope all people are made the same way if you arent the darndest hypochondriac she held him at arms length come on whats wrong tell mama something inside me he said somethingi ate the next morning and all afternoon at his downtown office mr harris sorted out the sizes shapes and construction of various bones in his body with displeasure at ten am he asked to feel mr smiths elbow one moment mr smith obliged but scowled suspiciously and after lunch mr harris asked to touch miss laurels shoulder blade and she immediately pushed herself back against him purring like a kitten and shutting her eyes miss laurel he snapped stop that alone he pondered his neuroses the war was just over the pressure of his work the uncertainty of the future probably had much to do with his mental outlook he wanted to leave the office get into business for himself he had more than a little talent for ceramics and sculpture as soon as possible hed head for arizona borrow that money from mr creldon build a kiln and set up shop it was a worry what a case he was but luckily he had contacted m munigant who seemed eager to understand and help him he would fight it out with himself not go back to either munigant or dr burleigh unless he was forced to the alien feeling would pass he sat staring into space the alien feeling did not pass it grew on tuesday and wednesday it bothered him terrifically that his epidermis hair and other appendages were of a high disorder while his integumented skeleton of himself was a slick clean structure of efficient organization sometimes in certain lights with his lips drawn morosely down weighted with melancholy he imagined he saw his skull grinning at him behind the flesh let go he cried let go of me my lungs stop he gasped convulsively as if his ribs were crushing the breath from him my brainstop squeezing it and terrifying headaches burnt his brain to a blind cinder my insides let them be for gods sake stay away from my heart his heart cringed from the fanning motion of ribs like pale spiders crouched and fiddling with their prey drenched with sweat he lay upon the bed one night while clarisse was out attending a red cross meeting he tried to gather his wits but only grew more aware of the conflict between his dirty exterior and this beautiful cool clean calciumed thing inside his complexion wasnt it oily and lined with worry observe the flawless snowwhite perfection of the skull his nose wasnt it too large then observe the tiny bones of the skulls nose before that monstrous nasal cartilage begins forming the lopsided proboscis his body wasnt it plump well consider the skeleton slender svelte economical of line and contour exquisitely carved oriental ivory perfect thin as a white praying mantis his eyes werent they protuberant ordinary numblooking be so kind as to note the eyesockets of the skull so deep and rounded somber quiet pools allknowing eternal gaze deep and you never touch the bottom of their dark understanding all irony all life all everything is there in the cupped darkness compare compare compare he raged for hours and the skeleton ever the frail and solemn philosopher hung quietly inside saying not a word suspended like a delicate insect within a chrysalis waiting and waiting harris sat slowly up wait a minute hold on he exclaimed youre helpless too ive got you too i can make you do anything i want you cant prevent it i say move your carpales metacarpales and phalanges andsswttup they go as i wave to someone he laughed i order the fibula and femur to locomote and hunn two three four hunn two three fourwe walk around the block there harris grinned its a fiftyfifty fight evenstephen and well fight it out we two after all im the part that thinks yes by god yes even if i didnt have you i could still think instantly a tigers jaw snapped shut chewing his brain in half harris screamed the bones of his skull grabbed hold and gave him nightmares then slowly while he shrieked nuzzled and ate the nightmares one by one until the last one was gone and the light went out at the end of the week he postponed the phoenix trip because of his health weighing himself on a penny scale he saw the slow gliding red arrow point to he groaned why ive weighed for years i cant have lost ten pounds he examined his cheeks in the flydotted mirror cold primitive fear rushed over him in odd little shivers you you i know what youre about you he shook his fist at his bony face particularly addressing his remarks to his superior maxillary his inferior maxillary to his cranium and to his cervical vertebrae you damn thing you think you can starve me make me lose weight eh peel the flesh off leave nothing but skin on bone trying to ditch me so you can be supreme ah no no he fled into a cafeteria turkey dressing creamed potatoes four vegetables three desserts he could eat none of it he was sick to his stomach he forced himself his teeth began to ache bad teeth is it he thought angrily ill eat in spite of every tooth clanging and banging and rattling so they fall in my gravy his head blazed his breath jerked in and out of a constricted chest his teeth raged with pain but he knew one small victory he was about to drink milk when he stopped and poured it into a vase of nasturtiums no calcium for you my boy no calcium for you never again shall i eat foods with calcium or other bonefortifying minerals ill eat for one of us not both my lad one hundred and fifty pounds he said the following week to his wife do you see how ive changed for the better said clarisse you were always a little plump for your height darling she stroked his chin i like your face its so much nicer the lines of it are so firm and strong now theyre not my lines theyre his damn him you mean to say you like him better than you like me him whos him in the parlor mirror beyond clarisse his skull smiled back at him behind his fleshy grimace of hatred and despair fuming he popped malt tablets into his mouth this was one way of gaining weight when you couldnt keep other foods down clarisse noticed the malt pellets but darling really you dont have to regain the weight for me she said oh shut up he felt like saying she made him lie with his head in her lap darling she said ive watched you lately youre sobadly off you dont say anything but you lookhunted you toss in bed at night maybe you should go to a psychiatrist but i think i can tell you everything he would say ive put it all together from hints youve let escape you i can tell you that you and your skeleton are one and the same one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all united you stand divided you fall if you two fellows cant get along like an old married couple in the future go back and see dr burleigh but first relax youre in a vicious circle the rnore you worry the more your bones stick out the more you worry after all who picked this fightyou or that anonymous entity you claim is lurking around behind your alimentary canal he closed his eyes i did i guess i did go on clarisse keep talking you rest now she said softly rest and forget mr harris felt buoyed up for half a day then he began to sag it was all very well to blame his imagination but this particular skeleton by god was fighting back harris set out for m munigants office late in the day walking for half an hour until he found the address he caught sight of the name m munigant initialed in ancient flaking gold on a glass plate outside the building then his bones seemed to explode from their moorings blasted and erupted with pain blinded he staggered away when he opened his eyes again he had rounded a corner m munigants office was out of sight the pains ceased m munigant was the man to help him if the sight of his name could cause so titanic a reaction of course m munigant must be just the man but not today each time he tried to return to that office the terrible pains took hold perspiring he had to give up and swayed into a cocktail bar moving across the dim lounge he wondered briefly if a lot of blame couldnt be put on m munigants shoulders after all it was munigant whod first drawn specific attention to his skeleton and let the psychological impact of it slam home could m munigant be using him for some nefarious purpose but what purpose silly to suspect him just a little doctor trying to be helpful munigant and his jar of breadsticks ridiculous m munigant was okay okay there was a sight within the cocktail lounge to give him hope a large fat man round as a butterball stood drinking consecutive beers at the bar now there was a successful man harris repressed a desire to go up clap the fat mans shoulder and inquire as to how hed gone about impounding his bones yes the fat mans skeleton was luxuriously closeted there were pillows of fat here resilient bulges of it there with several round chandeliers of fat under his chin the poor skeleton was lost it could never fight clear of that blubber it might have tried oncebut not now overwhelmed not a bony echo of the fat mans supporter remained not without envy harris approached the fat man as one might cut across the bow of an ocean liner harris ordered a drink drank it and then dared to address the fat man glands you talking to me asked the fat man or is there a special diet wondered harris i beg your pardon but as you see im down cant seem to put on any weight id like a stomach like that one of yours did you grow it because you were afraid of something you announced the fat man are drunk buti like drunkards he ordered more drinks listen close ill tell you layer by layer said the fat man twenty years man and boy i built this he held his vast stomach like a globe of the world teaching his audience its gastronomical geography it was no overnight circus the tent was not raised before dawn on the wonders installed within i have cultivated my inner organs as if they were thoroughbred dogs cats and other animals my stomach is a fat pink persian torn slumbering rousing at intervals to purr mew growl and cry for chocolate titbits i feed it well it will most sit up for me and my dear fellow my intestines are the rarest purebred indian anacondas you ever viewed in the sleekest coiled fine and ruddy health keep em in prime i do all my pets for fear of something perhaps this called for another drink for everyone gain weight the fat man savored the words on his tongue heres what you do get yourself a quarreling bird of a wife a bakers dozen of relatives who can flush a covey of troubles out from behind the veriest molehill add to these a sprinkling of business associates whose prime motivation is snatching your last lonely quid and you are well on your way to getting fat how so in no time youll begin subconsciously building fat betwixt yourself and them a buffer epidermal state a cellular wall youll soon find that eating is the only fun on earth but one needs to be bothered by outside sources too many people in this world havent enough to worry about then they begin picking on themselves and they lose weight meet all of the vile terrible people you can possibly meet and pretty soon youll be adding the good old fat and with that advice the fat man launched himself out into the dark tide of night swaying mightily and wheezing thats exactly what dr burleigh told me slightly changed said harris thoughtfully perhaps that trip to phoenix now at this time the trip from los angeles to phoenix was a sweltering one crossing as it did the mojave desert on a broiling yellow day traffic was thin and inconstant and for long stretches there would not be a car on the road for miles ahead or behind harris twitched his fingers on the steering wheel whether or not creldon in phoenix lent him the money he needed to start his business it was still a good thing to get away to put distance behind the car moved in the hot sluice of desert wind the one mr h sat inside the other mr h perhaps both perspired perhaps both were miserable on a curve the inside mr h suddenly constricted the outer flesh causing him to jerk forward on the hot steering wheel the car plunged off the road into boiling sand and turned half over night came a wind rose the road was lonely and silent the few cars that passed went swiftly on their way their view obstructed mr harris lay unconscious until very late he heard a wind rising out of the desert felt the sting of little sand needles on his cheeks and opened his eyes morning found him grittyeyed and wandering in thoughtless senseless circles having in his delirium got away from the road at noon he sprawled in the poor shade of a bush the sun struck him with a keen sword edge cutting through to hisbones a vulture circled harris parched lips cracked open so thats it he whispered redeyed bristlecheeked one way or another youll walk me starve me thirst me kill me he swallowed dry burrs of dust sun cook off my flesh so you can peek out vultures lunch off me and there youll lie grinning grinning with victory like a bleached xylophone strewn and played by vultures with an ear for odd music youd like that freedom he walked on through a landscape that shivered and bubbled in the direct pour of sunlight stumbling falling flat lying to feed himself little mouths of fire the air was blue alcohol flame and vultures roasted and steamed and glittered as they flew in glides and circles phoenix the road car water safety hey someone called from way off in the blue alcohol flame mr harris propped himself up hey the call was repeated a crunching of footsteps quick with a cry of unbelievable relief harris rose only to collapse again into the arms of someone in a uniform with a badge the car tediously hauled repaired phoenix reached harris found himself in such an unholy state of mind that the business transaction was a numb pantomime even when he got the loan and held the money in his hand it meant nothing this thing within him like a hard white sword in a scabbard tainted his business his eating colored his love for clarisse made it unsafe to trust an automobile all in all this thing had to be put in its place the desert incident had brushed too close too near the bone one might say with an ironic twist of ones mouth harris heard himself thanking mr creldon dimly for the money then he turned his car and motored back across the long miles this time cutting across to san diego so he would miss that desert stretch between el centro and beaumont he drove north along the coast he didnt trust that desert butcareful salt waves boomed hissing on the beach outside laguna sand fish and crustacea would cleanse his bones as swiftly as vultures slow down on the curves over the surf damn he was sick where to turn clarisse burleigh munigant bone specialist munigant well darling clarisse kissed him he winced at the solidness of the teeth and jaw behind the passionate exchange darling he said slowly wiping his lips with his wrist trembling you look thinner oh darling the business deal it went through i guess yes it did she kissed him again they ate a slow falsely cheerful dinner with clarisse laughing and encouraging him he studied the phone several times he picked it up indecisively then laid it down his wife walked in putting on her coat and hat well sorry but i have to leave she pinched him on the cheek come on now cheer up ill be back from red cross in three hours you lie around and snooze i simply have to go when clarisse was gone harris dialed the phone nervously m munigant the explosions and the sickness in his body after he set the phone down were unbelievable his bones were racked with every kind of pain cold and hot he had ever thought of or experienced in wildest nightmare he swallowed all the aspirin he could find in an effort to stave off the assault but when the doorbell finally rang an hour later he could not move he lay weak and exhausted panting tears streaming down his cheeks come in come in for gods sake m munigant came in thank god the door was unlocked oh but mr harris looked terrible m munigant stood in the center of the living room small and dark harris nodded the pains rushed through him hitting him with large iron hammers and hooks m munigants eyes glittered as he saw harris protuberant bones ah he saw that mr harris was now psychologically prepared for aid was it not so harris nodded again feebly sobbing m munigant still whistled when he talked something about his tongue and the whistling no matter through his shimmering eyes harris seemed to see m munigant shrink get smaller imagination of course harris sobbed out his story of the phoenix trip m munigant sympathized this skeleton was aa traitor they would fix him for once and for all mr munigant sighed harris faintly ii never noticed before your tongue round tubelike hollow my eyes delirious what do i do m munigant whistled softly appreciatively coming closer if mr harris would relax in his chair and open his mouth the lights were switched off m munigant peered into harris dropped jaw wider please it had been so hard that first visit to help harris with both body and bone in revolt now he had cooperation from the flesh of the man anyway even if the skeleton protested in the darkness m munigants voice got small small tiny tiny the whistling became high and shrill now relax mr harris now harris felt his jaw pressed violently in all directions his tongue depressed as with a spoon his throat clogged he gasped for breath whistle he couldnt breathe something squirmed corkscrewed his cheeks out bursting his jaws like a hotwater douche something squirted into his sinuses his ears clanged ahhhh shrieked harris gagging his head its carapaces riven shattered hung loose agony shot fire through his lungs harris could breathe again momentarily his watery eyes sprang wide he shouted his ribs like sticks picked up and bundled were loosened in him pain he fell to the floor wheezing out his hot breath lights flickered in his senseless eyeballs he felt his limbs swiftly cast loose and free through streaming eyes he saw the parlor the room was empty m munigant in gods name where are you m munigant come help me m munigant was gone help then he heard it deep down in the subterranean fissures of his body the minute unbelievable noises little smackings and twistings and little dry chippings and grindings and nuzzling soundslike a tiny hungry mouse down in the redblooded dimness gnawing ever so earnestly and expertly at what might have been but was not a submerged timber clarisse walking along the sidewalk held her head high and marched straight toward her house on saint james place she was thinking of the red cross as she turned the corner and almost ran into this little dark man who smelled of iodine clarisse would have ignored him if it were not for the fact that as she passed he took something long white and oddly familiar from his coat and proceeded to chew on it as on a peppermint stick its end devoured his extraordinary tongue darted within the white confection sucking out the filling making contented noises he was still crunching his goody as she proceeded up the sidewalk to her house turned the doorknob and walked in darling she called smiling around darling where are you she shut the door walked down the hall and into the living room darling she stared at the floor for twenty seconds trying to understand she screamed outside in the sycamore darkness the little man pierced a long white stick with intermittent holes then softly sighing his lips puckered played a little sad tune upon the improvised instrument to accompany the shrill and awful singing of clarisses voice as she stood in the living room many times as a little girl clarisse had run on the beach sands stepped on a jellyfish and screamed it was not so bad finding an intact gelatinskinned jellyfish in ones living room one could step back from it it was when the jellyfish called you by name the jar it was one of those things they keep in a jar in the tent of a sideshow on the outskirts of a little drowsy town one of those pale things drifting in alcohol plasma forever dreaming and circling with its peeled dead eyes staring out at you and never seeing you it went with the noiselessness of late night and only the crickets chirping the frogs sobbing off in the moist swampland one of those things in a big jar that makes your stomach jump as it does when you see a preserved arm in a laboratory vat charlie stared back at it for a long time a long time his big raw hands hairy on the roofs of them clenching the rope that kept back curious people he had paid his dime and now he stared it was getting late the merrygoround drowsed down to a lazy mechanical tinkle tentpeggers back of a canvas smoked and cursed over a poker game lights switched out putting a summer gloom over the carnival people streamed homeward in cliques and queues somewhere a radio flared up then cut leaving louisiana sky wide and silent with stars there was nothing in the world for charlie but that pale thing sealed in its universe of serum charlies loose mouth hung open in a pink weal teeth showing his eyes were puzzled admiring wondering someone walked in the shadows behind him small beside charlies gaunt tallness oh said the shadow coming into the lightbulb glare you still here bud yeah said charlie like a man in his sleep the carnyboss appreciated charlies curiosity he nodded at his old acquaintance in the jar everybody likes it in a peculiar kinda way i mean charlie rubbed his long jawbone youuhever consider selling it the carnybosss eyes dilated then closed he snorted naw it brings customers they like seeing stuff like that sure charlie made a disappointed oh well considered the carnyboss if a guy had money maybe how much money if a guy had the carnyboss estimated counting fingers watching charlie as he tacked it out one finger after another if a guy had three four say maybe seven or eight charlie nodded with each motion expectantly seeing this the carnyboss raised his total maybe ten dollars or maybe fifteen charlie scowled worried the carnyboss retreated say a guy has twelve dollars charlie grinned why he could buy that thing in that jar concluded the carnyboss funny thing said charlie i got just twelve bucks in my denims and i been reckoning how lookedupto id be back down at wilders hollow if i brung home something like this to set on my shelf over the table the folks would sure look up to me then i bet well now listen here said the carnyboss the sale was completed with the jar put on the back seat of charlies wagon the horse skittered his hoofs when he saw the jar and whinnied the carnyboss glanced up with an expression of almost relief i was tired of seeing that damn thing around anyway dont thank me lately i been thinking things about it funny thingsbut hell im a bigmouthed soandso slong farmer charlie drove off the naked blue light bulbs withdrew like dying stars the open dark country night of louisiana swept in around wagon and horse there was just charlie the horse timing his gray hoofs and the crickets and the jar behind the high seat it sloshed back and forth back and forth sloshed wet and the cold gray thing drowsily slumped against the glass looking out looking out but seeing nothing nothing charlie leaned back to pet the lid smelling of strange liquor his hand returned changed and cold and trembling excited yes sir he thought to himself yes sir slosh slosh slosh in the hollow numerous grassgreen and bloodred lanterns tossed dusty light over men huddled murmuring spitting sitting on general store property they knew the creakbumble of charlies wagon and did not shift their raw drabhaired skulls as he rocked to a halt their cigars were glowworms their voices were frog mutterings on summer nights charlie leaned down eagerly hi clem hi milt lo charlie lo charlie they murmured the political conflict continued charlie cut it down the seam i got somethin here i got somethin you might wanna see tom carmodys eyes glinted green in the lamplight from the general store porch it seemed to charlie that tom carmody was forever installed under porches in shadow or under trees in shadow or if in a room then in the farthest niche shining his eyes out at you from the dark you never knew what his face was doing and his eyes were always funning you and every time they looked at you they laughed a different way you aint got nothin we wants to see babydoll charlie made a fist and looked at it somethin in a jar he went on looks kine a like a brain kine a like a pickled jellyfish kine a likewell come see yourself someone snicked a cigar into a fall of pink ash and ambled over to look charlie grandly elevated the jar lid and in the uncertain lantern light the mans face changed hey now what in hell is this it was the first thaw of the evening others shifted lazily upright leaned forward gravity pulled them into walking they made no effort except to put one shoe before the other to keep from collapsing upon their unusual faces they circled the jar and contents and charlie for the first time in his life seized on some hidden strategy and crashed the glass lid shut you want to see more drop aroun my house itll be there he declared generously tom carmody spat from out his porch eyrie ha lemme see that again cried gramps medknowe is it a octopus charlie flapped the reins the horse stumbled into action come on aroun youre welcome whatll your wife say shell kick the tar offn our heels but charlie and wagon were gone over the hill the men stood all of them chewing their tongues squinting up the road in the dark tom carmody swore softly from the porch charlie climbed the steps of his shack and carried the jar to its throne in the living room thinking that from now on this leanto would be a palace with an emperorthat was the word emperorall cold and white and quiet drifting in his private pool raised elevated upon a shelf over a ramshackle table the jar as he watched burnt off the cold mist that hung over this place on the rim of the swamp what you got there thedys thin soprano turned him from his awe she stood in the bedroom door glaring out her thin body clothed in faded blue gingham her hair drawn to a drab knot behind red ears her eyes were faded like the gingham well she repeated what is it whats it look like to you thedy she took a thin step forward making a slow indolent pendulum of hips her eyes intent upon the jar her lips drawn back to show feline milk teeth the dead pale thing hung in its serum thedy snapped a dullblue glance at charlie then back to the jar once more at charlie once more to the jar then she whirled quickly itit lookslooks just like you charlie she cried the bedroom door slammed the reverberation did not disturb the jars contents but charlie stood there longing after his wife heart pounding frantically much later when his heart slowed he talked to the thing in the jar i work the bottom land to the buttbone every year and she grabs the money and runs off down home visitin her folks nine weeks at a stretch i cant keep hold of her her and the men from the store they make fun of me i cant help it if i dont know a way to hold onto her damn but i try philosophically the contents of the jar gave no advice charlie someone stood in the frontyard door charlie turned startled then broke out a grin it was some of the men from the general store uhcharlie wewe thoughtwellwe came up to have a look at thatstuffyou got in that there jar july passed warm and it was august for the first time in years charlie was happy as tall corn growing after a drought it was gratifying of an evening to hear boots shushing through the tall grass the sound of men spitting into the ditch prior to setting foot on the porch the sound of heavy bodies creaking the boards and the groan of the house as yet another shoulder leaned against its frame door and another voice said as a hairy wrist wiped a mouth clean kin i come in with elaborate casualness charlied invite the arrivals in thered be chairs soapboxes for all or at least carpets to squat on and by the time crickets were itching their legs into a summertime humming and frogs were throatswollen like ladies with goiters shouting in the great night the room would be full to bursting with people from all the bottom lands at first nobody would say anything the first halfhour of such an evening while people came in and got settled was spent in carefully rolling cigarettes putting tobacco neatly into the rut of brown paper loading it tamping it as they loaded and tamped and rolled their thoughts and fears and amazement for the evening it gave them time to think you could see their brains working behind their eyes as they fingered the cigarettes into smoking order it was kind of a rude church gathering they sat squatted leaned on plaster walls and one by one with reverent awe they stared at the jar upon its shelf they wouldnt stare suddenlike no they kind of did it slow casual as if they were glancing around the roomletting their eyes fumble over just any old object that happened into their consciousness andjust by accident of coursethe focus of their wandering eyes would occur always at the same place after a while all eyes in the room would be fastened to it like pins stuck in some incredible pincushion and the only sound would be someone sucking a corncob or the childrens barefooted scurry on the porch planks outside maybe some womans voice would come you kids git away now git and with a giggle like soft quick water the bare feet would rush off to scare the bullfrogs charlie would be up front naturally on his rocking chair a plaid pillow under his lean rump rocking slow enjoying the fame and lookeduptoness that came with keeping the jar thedy shed be seen way back of the room with the womenfolk in a bunch all gray and quiet abiding their men thedy looked like she was ripe for jealous screaming but she said nothing just watched men tromp into her living room and sit at the feet of charlie staring at this here holy graillike thing and her lips were set cold and hard and she spoke not a civil word to anybody after a period of proper silence someone maybe old gramps medknowe from crick road would clear the phlegm from a deep cave somewhere inside himself lean forward blinking wet his lips maybe and thered be a curious tremble in his calloused fingers this would cue everyone to get ready for the talking to come ears were primed people settled like sows in the warm mud after a rain gramps looked a long while measured his lips with a lizard tongue then settled back and said like always in a high thin oldmans tenor wonder what it is wonder if its a he or a she or just a plain old it sometimes i wake up nights twist on my cornmatting think about that jar settin here in the long dark think about it hangin in liquid peaceful and pale like an animal oyster sometimes i wake maw and we both think on it while talking gramps moved his fingers in a quavering pantomime everybody watched his thick thumb weave and the other heavynailed fingers undulate we both lay there thinkin and we shivers maybe a hot night trees sweatin mosquitoes too hot to fly but we shivers jest the same and turn over trying to sleep gramps lapsed back into silence as if his speech was enough from him let some other voice talk the wonder awe and strangeness juke marmer from willow sump wiped sweat off his palms on the round of his knees and softly said i remember when i was a runnelnosed kid we had a cat who was all the time makin kittens lordamighty shed a litter any time she jumped around and skipped a fence juke spoke in a kind of holy softness benevolent well we give the kittens away but when this one particular litter busted out everybody within walkin distance had onetwo our cats by gift already so ma busied on the back porch with a big twogallon glass jar fillin it to the top with water ma said juke you drown them kittens i member i stood there the kittens mewed runnin round blind small helpless and funnyjust beginnin to get their eyes open i looked at ma i said not me ma you do it but ma turned pale and said it had to be done and i was the only one handy and she went off to stir gravy and fix chicken ii picked up onekitten i held it it was warm it made a mewin sound i felt like runnin away not ever comin back juke nodded his head now eyes bright young seeing into the past making it new shaping it with words smoothing it with his tongue i dropped the kitten in the water the kitten closed his eyes opened his mouth tryin for air i member how the little white fangs showed the pink tongue came out and bubbles with it in a line to the top of the water i know to this day the way that kitten floated after it was all over driftin aroun slow and not worryin lookin out at me not condemnin me for what i done but not likin me neither ahhhh hearts jumped quick eyes swiveled from juke to the shelved jar back down up again apprehensively a pause jahdoo the black man from heron swamp tossed his ivory eyeballs like a dusky juggler in his head his dark knuckles knotted and flexedgrasshoppers alive you know what that is you know you know i tells you that be the center of life sure nuff lord believe me it so swaying in a treelike rhythm jahdoo was blown by a swamp wind no one could see hear or feel save himself his eyeballs went around again as if cut free to wander his voice needled a dark thread pattern picking up each person by the lobes of their ears and sewing them into one unbreathing design from that lyin back in the middibamboo sump all sort o thing crawl it put out hand it put out feet it put out tongue an horn an it grow little bitty amoeba perhap then a frog with a bulgethroat fit ta bust yah he cracked knuckles it slobber on up to its gummy joints and itit am human that am the center of creation that am middibamboo mama from which we all come ten thousand year ago believe it ten thousand year ago whispered granny carnation it am old looky it it donn worra no more it know betta it hang like pork chop in fryin fat it got eye to see with but it donn blink em they donn look fretted does they no man it know betta it know that we done come from it and we is goin back to it what color eyes it got gray naw green what color hair brown black red no gray then charlie would give his drawling opinion some nights hed say the same thing some nights not it didnt matter when you said the same thing night after night in the deep summer it always sounded different the crickets changed it the frogs changed it the thing in the jar changed it charlie said what if an old man went back into the swamp or maybe a young kid and wandered aroun for years and years lost in all that drippin on the trails and gullies in them old wet ravines in the nights skin a turnin pale and makin cold and shrivelin up bein away from the sun hed keep witherin away up and up and finally sink into a muckhole and lay in a kind ofscumlike the maggot skeeters sleepin in sumpwater why whyfor all we can tell this might be someone we know someone we passed words with once on a time for all we know a hissing from among the womenfolk back in the shadow one woman standing eyes shining black fumbled for words her name was mrs tridden and she murmured lots of little kids run stark naked to the swamp ever year they runs around and never comes back i almost got lost maseif ii lost my little boy foley that way youyou dont suppose breath was snatched through nostrils constricted tightened mouths turned down at corners bent by hard clinching muscle heads turned on celerystalk necks and eyes read her horror and hope it was in mrs triddens body wiretaut holding to the wall back of her with straight fingers stiff my baby she whispered she breathed it out my baby my foley foley foley is that you foley foley tell me baby is that you everybody held their breath turning to see the jar the thing in the jar said nothing it just stared blindwhite out upon the multitude and deep in rawboned bodies a secret fear juice ran like a spring thaw and their resolute calmness and belief and easy humbleness was gnawed and eaten by that juice and melted away in a torrent someone screamed it moved no no it didn move just your eyes playin tricks hones ta god cried juke i saw it shift slow like a dead kitten hush up now its been dead a long long time maybe since before you was born he made a sign screamed mrs tridden thats my foley my baby you got there threeyearold he was my baby lost and gone in the swamp the sobbing broke from her now mrs tridden there now set yourself down stop shakin aint no more your childn mine there there one of the womenfolk held her and faded out the sobbing into jerked breathing and a fluttering of her lips in butterfly quickness as the breath stroked over them afraid when all was quiet again granny carnation with a withered pink flower in her shoulderlength gray hair sucked the pipe in her trap mouth and talked around it shaking her head to make the hair dance in the light all this talkin and shovin words like as not well never find out never know what it is like as not if we found out we wouldnt want to know its like magic tricks magicians do at shows once you find the fake aint no more funn the innards of a jackbob we come collectin around here every ten nights or so talkin sociallike with somethin always somethin to talk about stands to reason if we spied out what the damn thing is thered be nothin to chew about so there well damn it to hell rumbled a bull voice i dont think its nothin tom carmody tom carmody standing as always in shadow out on the porch just his eyes staring in his lips laughing at you dimly mocking his laughter got inside charlie like a hornet sting thedy had put him up to it thedy was trying to kill charlies new life she was nothin repeated carmody harshly in that jar but a hunch of old jellyfish from sea cove a rottin and stinkin fit to whelp you mightnt be jealous cousin carmody asked charlie slow haw snorted carmody i just come aroun ta watch you dumb fools jaw about nuthin you notice i never set foot inside or took part im goin home right now anybody wanna come along with me he got no offer of company he laughed again as if this were a bigger joke how so many people could be so far gone and thedy was raking her palms with her fingernails away back in a corner of the room charlie saw her mouth twitch and was cold and could not speak carmody still laughing rapped off the porch with his highheeled boots and the sound of crickets took him away granny carnation gummed her pipe like i was sayin before the storm that thing on the shelf why couldnt it be sort ofall things lots of things all kinds of lifedeathi dont know mix rain and sun and muck and jelly all that together grass and snakes and children and mist and all the nights and days in the dead canebrake whys it have to be one thing maybe its lots and the talking ran soft for another hour and thedy slipped away into the night on the track of tom carmody and charlie began to sweat they were up to something those two they were planning something charlie sweated warm all the rest of the evening the meeting broke up late and charlie bedded down with mixed emotions the meeting had gone off well but what about thedy and tom very late with certain star coveys shuttled down the sky marking the time as after midnight charlie heard the slushing of the tall grass parted by her penduluming hips her heels tacked soft across the porch into the house into the bedroom she lay soundlessly in bed cat eyes staring at him he couldnt see them but he could feel them staring charlie he waited then he said im awake then she waited charlie what bet you dont know where i been bet you dont know where i been it was a faint derisive singsong in the night he waited

the spindly table he leaned over it sobbing if he lost this the world was gone and he was losing thedy too every month that passed she danced further away sneering at him funning him for too many years her hips had been the pendulum by which he reckoned the time of his living but other men tom carmody for one were reckoning time from the same source thedy stood waiting for him to smash the jar instead he petted and stroked and gradually quieted himself over it he thought of the long good evenings in the past month those rich evenings of friends and talk moving about the room that at least was good if nothing else he turned slowly to thedy she was lost forever to him thedy you didnt go to the carnival yes i did youre lyin he said quietly no im not thisthis jar has to have somethin in it

followed by all the others young and old sweet and sour creaking into chairs each with his or her thought hope fear and wonder in mind each not looking at the shrine but saying hello softly to charlie they waited for the others to gather from the shine of their eyes one could see that each saw something different in the jar something of the life and the pale life after life and the life in death and the death in life each with his story his cue his lines familiar old but new charlie sat alone hello charlie somebody peered into the empty bedroom your wife gone off again to visit her folks yeah

mouth then he looked at tom carmody who would never smile again in the door i reckon well never know yeah i reckon we wont charlie shook his head slowly and settled down with his guests looking looking it was just one of those things they keep in a jar in the tent of a sideshow on the outskirts of a little drowsy town one of those pale things drifting in alcohol plasma forever dreaming and circling with its peeled dead eyes staring out at you and never seeing you the lake the wave shut me off from the world from the birds in the sky the children on the beach my mother on the shore there was a moment of green silence then the wave gave me back to the sky the sand the children yelling i came out of the lake and the world was waiting for me having hardly moved since i went away i ran up on the beach mama swabbed me with a furry towel stand there and dry she said i stood there watching the sun take away the water beads on my arms i replaced them with goosepimples my theres a wind said mama put on your sweater waitll i watch my goosebumps i said harold said mama i put the sweater on and watched the waves come up and fall down on the beach but not clumsily on purpose with a green sort of elegance even a drunken man could not collapse with such elegance as those waves it was september in the last days when things are getting sad for no reason the beach was so long and lonely with only about six people on it the kids quit bouncing the ball because somehow the wind made them sad too whistling the way it did and the kids sat down and felt autumn come along the endless shore all of the hotdog stands were boarded up with strips of golden planking sealing in all the mustard onion meat odors of the long joyful summer it was like nailing summer into a series of coffins one by one the places slammed their covers down padlocked their doors and the wind came and touched the sand blowing away all of the million footprints of july and august it got so that now in september there was nothing but the mark of my rubber tennis shoes and donald and delaus arnolds feet down by the water curve sand blew up in curtains on the sidewalks and the merrygoround was hidden with canvas all of the horses frozen in midair on their brass poles showing teeth galloping on with only the wind for music slipping through canvas i stood there everyone else was in school i was not tomorrow i would be on my way west across the united states on a train mom and i had come to the beach for one last brief moment there was something about the loneliness that made me want to get away by myself mama i want to run up the beach aways i said all right but hurry back and dont go near the water i ran sand spun under me and the wind lifted me you know how it is running arms out so you feel veils from your fingers caused by wind like wings mama withdrew into the distance sitting soon she was only a brown speck and i was all alone being alone is a newness to a twelveyearold child he is so used to people about the only way he can be alone is in his mind there are so many real people around telling children what and how to do that a boy has to run off down a beach even if its only in his head to get by himself in his own world so now i was really alone i went down to the water and let it cool up to my stomach always before with the crowd i hadnt dared to look to come to this spot and search around in the water and call a certain name but now water is like a magician sawing you in half it feels as if you were cut in two part of you the lower part sugar melting dissolving away cool water and once in a while a very elegantly stumbling wave that fell with a flourish of lace i called her name a dozen times i called it tally tally oh tally you really expect answers to your calling when you are young you feel that whatever you may think can be real and sometimes maybe that is not so wrong i thought of tally swimming out into the water last may with her pigtails trailing blond she went laughing and the sun was on her small twelveyearold shoulders i thought of the water settling quiet of the life guard leaping into it of tallys mother screaming and of how tally never came out the life guard tried to persuade her to come out but she did not he came back with only bits of waterweed in his bigknuckled fingers and tally was gone she would not sit across from me at school any longer or chase indoor balls on the brick streets on summer nights she had gone too far out and the lake would not let her return and now in the lonely autumn when the sky was huge and the water was huge and the beach was so very long i had come down for the last time alone i called her name again and again tally oh tally the wind blew so very softly over my ears the way wind blows over the mouths of seashells to set them whispering the water rose embracing my chest then my knees up and down one way and another sucking under my heels tally come back tally i was only twelve but i know how much i loved her it was that love that comes before all significance of body and morals it was that love that is no more bad than wind and sea and sand lying side by side forever it was made of all the warm long days together at the beach and the humming quiet days of droning education at the school all the long autumn days of the years past when i had carried her books home from school tally i called her name for the last time i shivered i felt water on my face and did not know how it got there the waves had not splashed that high turning i retreated to the sand and stood there for half an hour hoping for one glimpse one sign one little bit of tally to remember then i knelt and built a sand castle shaping it fine building it as tally and i had often built so many of them but this time i only built half of it then i got up tally if you hear me come in and build the rest i walked off toward that faraway speck that was mama the water came in blended the sandcastle circle by circle mashing it down little by little into the original smoothness silently i walked along the shore far away a merrygoround jangled but it was only the wind the next day i went away on the train a train has a poor memory it soon puts all behind it it forgets the cornlands of illinois the rivers of childhood the bridges the lakes the valleys the cottages the hurts and the joys it spreads them out behind and they drop back of a horizon i lengthened my bones put flesh on them changed my young mind for an older one threw away clothes as they no longer fitted shifted from grammar to highschool to college and then there was a young woman in sacramento i knew her for a time and we were married by the time i was twentytwo i had almost forgotten what the east was like margaret suggested that our delayed honeymoon be taken back in that direction like a memory a train works both ways a train can bring rushing back all those things you left behind so many years before lake bluff population ioooo came up over the sky margaret looked so handsome in her fine new clothes she watched me as i felt my old world gather me back into its living she held my arm as the train slid into bluff station and our baggage was escorted out so many years and the things they do to peoples faces and bodies when we walked through the town together i saw no one i recognized there were faces with echoes in them echoes of hikes on ravine trails faces with small laughter in them from closed grammar schools and swinging on metallinked swings and going up and down on teetertotters but i didnt speak i walked and looked and filled up inside with all those memories like leaves stacked for autumn burning we stayed on two weeks in all revisiting all the places together the days were happy i thought i loved margaret well at least i thought i did it was on one of the last days that we walked down by the shore it was not quite as late in the year as that day so many years before but the first evidences of desertion were coming upon the beach people were thinning out several of the hotdog stands had been shuttered and nailed and the wind as always waited there to sing for us i almost saw mama sitting on the sand as she used to sit i had that feeling again of wanting to be alone but i could not force myself to speak of this to margaret i only held onto her and waited it got late in the day most of the children had gone home and only a few men and women remained basking in the windy sun the lifeguard boat pulled up on the shore the life guard stepped out of it slowly with something in his arms i froze there i held my breath and i felt small only twelve years old very little very infinitesimal and afraid the wind howled i could not see margaret i could see only the beach the life guard slowly emerging from the boat with a gray sack in his hands not very heavy and his face almost as gray and lined stay here margaret i said i dont know why i said it but why just stay here thats all i walked slowly down the sand to where the life guard stood he looked at me what is iti asked the life guard kept looking at me for a long time and he couldnt speak he put the gray sack on the sand and water whispered wet up around it and went back what is it i insisted strange said the life guard quietly i waited strange he said softly strangest thing i ever saw shes been dead a long time i repeated his words he nodded ten years id say there havent been any children drowned here this year there were twelve children drowned here since but we found all of them before a few hours had passed all except one i remember this body here why it must be ten years in the water its notpleasant i stared at the gray sack in his arms open it i said i dont know why i said it the wind was louder he fumbled with the sack hurry man open it i cried i better not do that he said then perhaps he saw the way my face must have looked she was such a little girl he opened it only part way that was enough the beach was deserted there was only the sky and the wind and the water and the autumn coming on lonely i looked down at her there i said something over and over a name the life guard looked at me where did you find her i asked down the beach that way in the shallow water its a long long time for her isnt it i shook my head yes it is oh god yes it is i thought people grow i have grown but she has not changed she is still small she is still young death does not permit growth or change she still has golden hair she will be forever young and and i will love her forever oh god i will love her forever the life guard tied up the sack again down the beach a few moments later i walked by myself i stopped and looked down at something this is where the life guard found her i said to myself there at the waters edge lay a sand castle only halfbuilt just like tally and i used to build them she half and i half i looked at it i knelt beside the sand castle and saw the small prints of feet coming in from the lake and going back out to the lake again and not returning theni knew ill help you finish it i said i did i built the rest of it up very slowly then i arose and turned away and walked off so as not to watch it crumble in the waves as all things crumble i walked back up the beach to where a strange woman named margaret was waiting for me smiling the emissary martin knew it was autumn again for dog ran into the house bringing wind and frost and a smell of apples turned to cider under trees in dark clocksprings of hair dog fetched goldenrod dust of farewellsummer acornhusk hair of squirrel feather of departed robin sawdust from freshcut cordwood and leaves like charcoals shaken from a blaze of maple trees dog jumped showers of brittle fern blackberry vine marshgrass sprang over the bed where martin shouted no doubt no doubt of it at all this incredible beast was october here boy here and dog settled to warm martins body with all the bonfires and subtle burnings of the season to fill the room with soft or heavy wet or dry odors of fartraveling in spring he smelled of lilac iris lawnmowered grass in summer icecreammustached he came pungent with firecracker roman candle pinwheel baked by the sun but autumn autumn dog whats it like outside and lying there dog told as he always told lying there martin found autumn as in the old days before sickness bleached him white on his bed here was his contact his carryall the quickmoving part of himself he sent with a yell to run and return circle and scent collect and deliver the time and texture of worlds in town country by creek river lake downcellar upattic in closet or coalbin ten dozen times a day he was gifted with sunflower seed cinderpath milkweed horsechestnut or full flamesmell of pumpkin through the loomings of the universe dog shuttled the design was hid in his pelt put out your hand it was there and where did you go this morning but he knew without hearing where dog had rattled down hills where autumn lay in cereal crispness where children lay in funeral pyres in rustling heaps the leafburied but watchful dead as dog and the world blew by martin trembled as his fingers searched the thick fur read the long journey through stubbled fields over glitters of ravine creek down marbled spread of cemetery yard into woods in the great season of spices and rare incense now martin ran through his emissary around about and home the bedroom door opened that dog of yours is in trouble again mother brought in a tray of fruit salad cocoa and toast her blue eyes snapping mother always digging places dug a hole in miss tarkins garden this morning shes spittin mad thats the fourth hole hes dug there this week maybe hes looking for something fiddlesticks hes too darned curious if he doesnt behave hell be locked up martin looked at this woman as if she were a stranger oh you wouldnt do that how would i learn anything how would i find things out if dog didnt tell me moms voice was quieter is that what he doestell you things theres nothing i dont know when he goes out and around and back nothing i cant find out from him they both sat looking at dog and the dry strewings of mold and seed over the quilt well if hell just stop digging where he shouldnt he can run all he wants said mother here boy here and martin snapped a tin note to the dogs collar my owner is martin smithten years oldsick in bed visitors welcome dog barked mother opened the downstairs door and let him out martin sat listening far off and away you could hear dog run in the quiet autumn rain that was falling now you could hear the barkingjingling fade rise fade again as he cut down alley over lawn to fetch back mr holloway and the oiled metallic smell of the delicate snowflakeinteriored watches he repaired in his home shop or maybe he would bring mr jacobs the grocer whose clothes were rich with lettuce celery tomatoes and the secret tinned and hidden smell of the red demons stamped on cans of deviled ham mr jacobs and his unseen pinkmeat devils waved often from the yard below or dog brought mr jackson mrs gillespie mr smith mrs holmes any friend or nearfriend encountered cornered begged worried and at last shepherded home for lunch or teaandbiscuits now listening martin heard dog below with footsteps moving in a light rain behind him the downstairs bell rang mom opened the door light voices murmured martin sat forward face shining the stair treads creaked a young womans voice laughed quietly miss haight of course his teacher from school the bedroom door sprang open martin had company morning afternoon evening dawn and dusk sun and moon circled with dog who faithfully reported temperatures of turf and air color of earth and tree consistency of mist or rain butmost important of allbrought back again and again and again miss haight on saturday sunday and monday she baked martin orangeiced cupcakes brought him library books about dinosaurs and cavemen on tuesday wednesday and thursday somehow he beat her at dominoes somehow she lost at checkers and soon she cried hed defeat her handsomely at chess on friday saturday and sunday they talked and never stopped talking and she was so young and laughing and handsome and her hair was a soft shining brown like the season outside the window and she walked clear clean and quick a heartbeat warm in the bitter afternoon when he heard it above all she had the secret of signs and could read and interpret dog and the symbols she searched out and plucked forth from his coat with her miraculous fingers eyes shut softly laughing in a gypsys voice she divined the world from the treasures in her hands and on monday afternoon miss haight was dead martin sat up in bed slowly dead he whispered dead said his mother yes dead killed in an auto accident a mile out of town dead yes dead which meant cold to martin which meant silence and whiteness and winter come long before its time dead silent cold white the thoughts circled round blew down and settled in whispers martin held dog thinking turned to the wall the lady with the autumncolored hair the lady with the laughter that was very gentle and never made fun and the eyes that watched your mouth to see everything you ever said theotherhalfofautumnlady who told what was left untold by dog about the world the heartbeat at the still center of gray afternoon the heartbeat fading mom what do they do in the graveyard mom under the ground just lay there lie there lie there is that all they do it doesnt sound like much fun for goodness sake its not made out to be fun why dont they jump up and run around once in a while if they get tired lying there gods pretty silly martin well youd think hed treat people better than to tell them to lie still for keeps thats impossible nobody can do it i tried once dog tries i tell him dead dog he plays dead awhile then gets sick and tired and wags his tail or opens one eye and looks at me bored boy i bet sometimes those graveyard people do the same huh dog dog barked be still with that kind of talk said mother martin looked off into space bet thats exactly what they do he said autumn burnt the trees bare and ran dog still farther around fording creek prowling graveyard as was his custom and back in the dusk to fire off volleys of barking that shook windows wherever he turned in the late last days of october dog began to act as if the wind had changed and blew from a strange country he stood quivering on the porch below he whined his eyes fixed at the empty land beyond town he brought no visitors for martin he stood for hours each day as if leashed trembling then shot away straight as if someone had called each night he returned later with no one following each night martin sank deeper and deeper in his pillow well people are busy said mother they havent time to notice the tag dog carries or they mean to come visit but forget but there was more to it than that there was the fevered shining in dogs eyes and his whimpering tic late at night in some private dream his shivering in the dark under the bed the way he sometimes stood half the night looking at martin as if some great and impossible secret was his and he knew no way to tell it save by savagely thumping his tail or turning in endless circles never to lie down spinning and spinning again on october thirtieth dog ran out and didnt come back at all even when after supper martin heard his parents call and call the hour grew late the streets and sidewalks stood empty the air moved cold about the house and there was nothing nothing long after midnight martin lay watching the world beyond the cool clear glass windows now there was not even autumn for there was no dog to fetch it in there would be no winter for who could bring the snow to melt in your hands father mother no not the same they couldnt play the game with its special secrets and rules its sounds and pantomimes no more seasons no more time the gobetween the emissary was lost to the wild throngings of civilization poisoned stolen hit by a car left somewhere in a culvert sobbing martin turned his face to his pillow the world was a picture under glass untouchable the world was dead martin twisted in bed and in three days the last halloween pumpkins were rotting in trash cans papiermachй skulls and witches were burnt on bonfires and ghosts were stacked on shelves with other linens until next year to martin halloween had been nothing more than one evening when tin horns cried off in the cold autumn stars children blew like goblin leaves along the flinty walks flinging their heads or cabbages at porches soapwriting names or similar magic symbols on on icy windows all of it as distant unfathomable and nightmarish as a puppet show seen from so many miles away that there is no sound or meaning for three days in november martin watched alternate light and shadow sift across his ceiling the firepageant was over forever autumn lay in cold ashes martin sank deeper yet deeper in white marble layers of bed motionless listening always listening friday evening his parents kissed him goodnight and walked out of the house into the hushed cathedral weather toward a motionpicture show miss tarkins from next door stayed on in the parlor below until martin called down he was sleepy then took her knitting off home in silence martin lay following the great move of stars down a clear and moonlit sky remembering nights such as this when hed spanned the town with dog ahead behind around about tracking the greenplush ravine lapping slumbrous streams gone milky with the fullness of the moon leaping cemetery tombstones while whispering the marble names on quickly on through shaved meadows where the only motion was the offon quivering of stars to streets where shadows would not stand aside for you but crowded all the sidewalks for mile on mile run now run chasing being chased by bitter smoke fog mist wind ghost of mind fright of memory home safe sound snugwarm asleep nine oclock chime the drowsy clock in the deep stairwell below chime dog come home and run the world with you dog bring a thistle with frost on it or bring nothing else but the wind dog where are you oh listen now ill call martin held his breath way off somewherea sound martin rose up trembling there againthe sound so small a sound like a sharp needlepoint brushing the sky long miles and many miles away the dreamy echo of a dogbarking the sound of a dog crossing fields and farms dirt roads and rabbit paths running running letting out great barks of steam cracking the night the sound of a circling dog which came and went lifted and faded opened up shut in moved forward went back as if the animal were kept by someone on a fantastically long chain as if the dog were running and someone whistled under the chestnut trees in moldshadow tarshadow moonshadow walking and the dog circled back and sprang out again toward home dog martin thought oh dog come home boy listen oh listen where you been come on boy make tracks five ten fifteen minutes near very near the bark the sound martin cried out thrust his feet from the bed leaned to the window dog listen boy dog dog he said it over and over dog dog wicked dog run off and gone all these days bad dog good dog home boy hurry and bring what you can near now near up the street barking to knock clapboard housefronts with sound whirl iron cocks on rooftops in the moon firing off volleysdog now at the door below martin shivered should he runlet dog in or wait for mom and dad wait oh god wait but what if dog ran off again no hed go down snatch the door wide yell grab dog in and run upstairs so fast laughing crying holding tight that dog stopped barking hey martin almost broke the window jerking to it silence as if someone had told dog to hush now hush hush a full minute passed martin clenched his fists below a faint whimpering then slowly the downstairs front door opened someone was kind enough to have opened the door for dog of course dog had brought mr jacobs or mr gillespie or miss tarkins or the downstairs door shut dog raced upstairs whining flung himself on the bed dog dog whereve you been whatve you done dog dog and he crushed dog hard and long to himself weeping dog dog he laughed and shouted dog but after a moment he stopped laughing and crying suddenly he pulled back away he held the animal and looked at him eyes widening the odor coming from dog was different it was a smell of strange earth it was a smell of night within night the smell of digging down deep in shadow through earth that had lain cheek by jowl with things that were long hidden and decayed a stinking and rancid soil fell away in clods of dissolution from dogs muzzle and paws he had dug deep he had dug very deep indeed that was it wasnt it wasnt it wasnt it what kind of message was this from dog what could such a message mean the stenchthe ripe and awful cemetery earth dog was a bad dog digging where he shouldnt dog was a good dog always making friends dog loved people dog brought them home and now moving up the dark hall stairs at intervals came the sound of feet one foot dragged after the other painfully slowly slowly slowly dog shivered a rain of strange night earth fell seething on the bed dog turned the bedroom door whispered in martin had company touched with fire they stood in the blazing sunlight for a long while looking at the bright faces of their oldfashioned railroad watches while the shadows tilted beneath them swaying and the perspiration ran out under their porous summer hats when they uncovered their heads to mop their lined and pinkened brows their hair was white and soaked through like something that had been out of the light for years one of the men commented that his shoes felt like two loaves of baked bread and then sighing warmly added are you positive this is the right tenement the second old man foxe by name nodded as if any quick motion might make him catch fire by friction alone i saw this woman every day for three days shell show up if shes still alive that is wait till you see her shaw lord what a case such an odd business said shaw if people knew theyd think us peeping toms doddering old fools lord i feel selfconscious standing here foxe leaned on his cane let me do all the talking ifhold on there she is he lowered his voice take a slow look as she comes out the tenement front door slammed viciously a dumpy woman stood at the top of the thirteen porch steps glancing this way and that with angry jerkings of her eyes jamming a plump hand in her purse she seized some crumpled dollar bills plunged down the steps brutally and set off down the street in a charge behind her several heads peered from apartment windows above summoned by her crashing of the door come on whispered foxe here we go to the butchers the woman flung open a butchershop door rushed in the two old men had a glimpse of a mouth sticky with raw lipstick her eyebrows were like mustaches over her squinting always suspicious eyes abreast of the butchershop they heard her voice already screaming inside i want a good cut of meat lets see what you got hidden to take home for yourself the butcher stood silently in his bloodyfingerprinted frock his hands empty the two old men entered behind the woman and pretended to admire a pink loaf of freshground sirloin them lambchops look sickly cried the woman whats the price on brains the butcher told her in a low dry voice well weigh me a pound of liver said the woman keep your thumbs off the butcher weighed it out slowly hurry up snapped the woman the butcher now stood with his hands out of sight below the counter look whispered foxe shaw leaned back a trifle to peer below the case in one of the butchers bloody hands empty before a silvery meat ax was now clenched tightly relaxed clenched tightly relaxed the butchers eyes were blue and dangerously serene above the white porcelain counter while the woman yelled into those eyes and that pink selfcontained face now do you believe whispered foxe she really needs our help they stared at the raw red cubesteaks for a long time noticing all the little dents and marks where it had been hit ten dozen times by a steel mallet the braying continued at the grocers and the dime store with the two old men following at a respectful distance mrs deathwish said mr foxe quietly its like watching a twoyearold run out on a battlefield any moment you say shell hit a mine bang get the temperature just right too much humidity everyone itching sweating irritable alongll come this fine lady whining shrieking and so goodby well shaw do we start business you mean just walk up to her shaw was stunned by his own suggestion oh but were not really going to do this are we i thought it was sort of a hobby people habits customs et cetera its been fun but actually mixing in weve better things to do have we foxe nodded down the street to where the woman ran out in front of cars making them stop with a great squall of brakes hornblowing and cursing are we christians do we let her feed herself subconsciously to the lions or do we convert her convert her to love to serenity to a longer life look at her doesnt want to live any more deliberately aggravates people one day soon someonell favor her with a hammer or strychnine shes been going down for the third time a long while now when youre drowning you get nasty grab at people scream lets have lunch and lend a hand eh otherwise our victim will run on until she finds her murderer shaw stood with the sun driving him into the boiling white sidewalk and it seemed for a moment the street tilted vertically became a cliff down which the woman fell toward a blazing sky at last he shook his head youre right he said i wouldnt want her on my conscience the sun burnt the paint from the tenement fronts bleached the air raw and turned the gutterwaters to vapor by midafternoon when the old men numbed and evaporated stood in the inner passageways of a house that funneled bakery air from front to back in a searing torrent when they spoke it was the submerged muffled talk of men in steam rooms preposterously tired and remote the front door opened foxe stopped a boy who carried a wellmangled loaf of bread son were looking for the woman who gives the door an awful slam when she goes out oh her the boy ran upstairs calling back mrs shrike foxe grabbed shaws arm lord lord it cant be true i want to go home said shaw but there it is said foxe incredulous tapping his cane on the roomindex in the lobby mr and mrs alfred shrike upstairs husbands a longshoreman big hulking brute comes home dirty saw them out on sunday her jabbering him never speaking never looking at her oh come on shaw its no use said shaw you cant help people like her unless they want to be helped thats the first law of mental health you know it i know it if you get in her way shell trample you dont be a fool but whos to speak for herand people like her her husband her friends the grocer the butcher theyd sing at her wake will they tell her she needs a psychiatrist does she know it no who knows it we do well then you dont keep vital information like that from the victim do you shaw took off his sopping hat and gazed bleakly into it once in biology class long ago our teacher asked if we thought we could remove a frogs nervous system intact with a scalpel take out the whole delicate antennalike structure with all its little pink thistles and halfinvisible ganglions impossible of course the nervous systems so much a part of the frog theres no way to pull it like a hand from a green glove youd destroy the frog doing it well thats mrs shrike theres no way to operate on a souring ganglion bile is in the vitreous humor of her mad little elephant eyes you might as well try to get all the saliva out of her mouth forever its very sad but i think weve gone too far already true said foxe patiently earnestly nodding but all i want to do is post a warning drop a little seed in her subconscious tell her youre a murderee a victim looking for a place to happen one tiny seed i want to plant in her head and hope itll sprout and flower a very faint very poor hope that before its too late shell gather her courage and go see a psychiatrist its too hot to talk all the more reason to act more murders are committed at ninetytwo degrees fahrenheit than any other temperature over one hundred its too hot to move under ninety cool enough to survive but right at ninetytwo degrees lies the apex of irritability everything is itches and hair and sweat and cooked pork the brain becomes a rat rushing around a redhot maze the least thing a word a look a sound the drop of a hair andirritable murder irritable murder theres a pretty and terrifying phrase for you look at that hall thermometer eightynine degrees crawling up toward ninety itching up toward ninetyone sweating toward ninetytwo an hour two hours from now heres the first flight of stairs we can rest on each landing up we go the two old men moved in the thirdfloor darkness dont check the numbers said foxe lets guess which apartment is hers behind the last door a radio exploded the ancient paint shuddered and flaked softly onto the worn carpet at their feet the men watched the entire door jitter with vibration in its grooves they looked at each other and nodded grimly another sound cut like an ax through the paneling a woman shrieking to someone across town on a telephone no phone necessary she should just open her window and yell foxe rapped the radio blasted out the rest of its song the voice bellowed foxe rapped again and tested the knob to his horror the door got free of his grasp and floated swiftly inward leaving them like actors trapped onstage when a curtain rises too soon oh no cried shaw they were buried in a flood of sound it was like standing in the spiliway of a dam and pulling the gatelever instinctively the old men raised their hands wincing as if the sound were pure blazing sunlight that burnt their eyes the woman stood at a wall phone saliva flying from her mouth at an incredible rate she showed all of her large white teeth chunking off her monologue nostrils flared a vein in her wet forehead ridged up pumping her free hand flexing and unflexing itself her eyes were clenched shut as she yelled tell that damned soninlaw of mine i wont see him hes a lazy hum suddenly the woman snapped her eyes wide some animal instinct having felt rather than heard or seen an intrusion she continued yelling into the phone meanwhile piercing her visitors with a glance forged of the coldest steel she yelled for a full minute longer then slammed down the receiver and said without taking a breath well the two men moved together for protection their lips moved speak up cried the woman would you mind said foxe turning the radio down she caught the word radio by lip reading still glaring at them out of her sunburnt face she slapped the radio without looking at it as one slaps a child that cries all day every day and has become an unseen pattern in life the radio subsided im not buyin anything she ripped a dogeared packet of cheap cigarettes like it was a bone with meat on it snapped one of the cigarettes in her smeared mouth and lit it sucking greedily on the smoke jetting it through her thin nostrils until she was a feverish dragon confronting them in a fireclouded room i got work to do make your pitch they looked at the magazines spilled like great catches of brightcolored fish on the linoleum floor the unwashed coffee cup near the broken rocking chair the tilted greasy thumbmarked lamps the smudged windowpanes the dishes piled in the sink under a steadily dripping dripping faucet the cobwebs floating like dead skin in the ceiling corners and over all of it the thickened smell of life lived too much too long with the window down they saw the wall thermometer temperature ninety degrees fahrenheit they gave each other a halfstartled look im mr foxe this is mr shaw were retired insurance salesmen we still sell occasionally to supplement our retirement fund most of the time however were taking it easy and you tryin to sell me insurance she cocked her head at them through the cigarette smoke theres no money connected with this no keep talking she said i hardly know how to begin may we sit down he looked about and decided there wasnt a thing in the room he would trust himself to sit on never mind he saw she was about to bellow again so went on swiftly we retired after forty years of seeing people from nursery to cemetery gate you might say in that time wed formulated certain opinions last year sitting in the park talking we put two and two together we realized that many people didnt have to die so young with the correct investigation a new type of customers information might be provided as a sideline by insurance companies im not sick said the woman oh hut you are cried mr foxe and then put two fingers to his mouth in dismay dont tell me what i am she cried foxe plunged headlong let me make it clear people die every day psychologically speaking some part of them gets tired and that small part tries to kill off the entire person for example he looked about and seized on his first evidence with what amounted to a vast relief there that light bulb in your bathroom hung right over the tub on frayed wire someday youll slip make a grab andpfft mrs albert j shrike squinted at the light bulb in the bathroom so people mr foxe warmed to his subject while mr shaw fidgeted his face now flushed now dreadfully pale edged toward the door people like cars need their brakes checked their emotional brakes do you see their lights their batteries their approaches and responses to life mrs shrike snorted your two minutes are up i havent learned a damned thing mr foxe blinked first at her then at the sun burning mercilessly through the dusty windowpanes perspiration was running in the soft lines of his face he chanced a look at the wall thermometer ninetyone he said whats eating you pop asked mrs shrike i beg your pardon he stared in fascination at the redhot line of mercury firing up the small glass vent across the room sometimessometimes we all make wrong turnings our choice of marriage partners a wrong job no money illness migraine headaches glandular deficiencies dozens of little prickly irritable things before you know it youre taking it out on everyone everywhere she was watching his mouth as if he were talking a foreign language she scowled she squinted she tilted her head her cigarette smoldering in one plump hand we run about screaming making enemies foxe swallowed and glanced away from her we make people want to see us gonesickdead even people want to hit us knock us down shoot us its all unconscious though you see god its hot in here he thought if there were only one window open just one just one window open mrs shrikes eyes were widening as if to allow in everything he said some people are not only accidentprones which means they want to punish themselves physically for some crime usually a petty immorality they think theyve long forgotten but their subconscious puts them in dangerous situations makes them jaywalk makes them he hesitated and the sweat dripped from his chin makes them ignore frayed electric cords over bathtubs theyre potential victims it is marked on their faces hidden like like tattoos you might say on the inner rather than the outer skin a murderer passing one of these accidentprones these wishersafterdeath would see the invisible markings turn and follow them instinctively to the nearest alley with luck a potential victim might not happen to cross the tracks of a potential murderer for fifty years thenone afternoonfate these people these deathprones touch all the wrong nerves in passing strangers they brush the murder in all our breasts mrs shrike mashed her cigarette in a dirty saucer very slowly foxe shifted his cane from one trembling hand to the other so it was that a year ago we decided to try to find people who needed help these are always the people who dont even know they need help whod never dream of going to a psychiatrist at first i said well make dryruns shaw was always against it save as a hobby a harmless little quiet thing between ourselves i suppose youd say im a fool well weve just completed a year of dryruns we watched two men studied their environmental factors their work marriages at a discreet distance none of our business you say but each time the men came to a bad end one killed in a barroom another pushed out a window a woman we studied run down by a streetcar coincidence what about that old man accidentally poisoned didnt turn on the bathroom light one night what was there in his mind that wouldnt let him turn the light on what made him move in the dark and drink medicine in the dark and die in the hospital next day protesting he wanted nothing but to live evidence evidence we have it we have it two dozen cases coffins nailed to a good half of them in that little time no more dryruns its time for action preventative use of data time to work with people make friends before the undertaker slips in the side door mrs shrike stood as if he had struck her on the head quite suddenly with a large weight then just her blurred lips moved and you came here well youve been watching me we only following me in order to get out she said we can get out she said if youll only listen oh i said this would happen whispered shaw shutting his eyes dirty old men get out she shouted theres no money involved ill throw you out ill throw you out she shrieked clenching her fists gritting her teeth her face colored insanely who are you dirty old grandmas coming here spying you old cranks she yelled she seized the straw hat from mr foxes head he cried out she tore the lining from it cursing get out get out get out get out she hurled it to the floor she crunched one heel through the middle she kicked it get out get out oh but you need us foxe stared in dismay at the hat as she swore at him in a language that turned corners blazing that flew in the air like great searing torches the woman knew every language and every word in every language she spoke with fire and alcohol and smoke who do you think you are god god and the holy ghost passing on people snooping prying you old jerks you old dirtyminded grandmas you you she gave them further names names that forced them toward the door in shock recoiling she gave them a long vile list of names without pausing for breath then she stopped gasped trembled heaved in a great suction of air and started a further list of ten dozen even viler names see here said foxe stiffening shaw was out the door pleading with his partner to come along it was over and done it was as he expected they were fools they were everything she said they were oh how embarrassing old maid shouted the woman ill thank you to keep a civil tongue old maid old maid somehow this was worse than all the really vile names foxe swayed his mouth clapped open shut open shut old woman she cried woman woman woman he was in a blazing yellow jungle the room was drowned in fire it clenched upon him the furniture seemed to shift and whirl about the sunlight shot through the rammedshut windows firing the dust which leaped up from the rug in angry sparks when a fly buzzed a crazy spiral from nowhere her mouth a feral red thing licked the air with all the obscenities collected just behind it in a lifetime and beyond her on the baked brown wallpaper the thermometer said ninetytwo and he looked again and it said ninetytwo and still the woman screamed like the wheels of a train scraping around a vast iron curve of track fingernails down a blackboard and steel across marble old maid old maid old maid foxe drew his arm back cane clenched in fist very high and struck no cried shaw in the doorway but the woman had slipped and fallen aside gibbering clawing the floor foxe stood over her with a look of positive disbelief on his face he looked at his arm and his wrist and his hand and his fingers each in turn through a great invisible glaring hot wall of crystal that enclosed him he looked at the cane as if it was an easily seen and incredible exclamation point come out of nowhere to the center of the room his mouth stayed open the dust fell in silent embers dead he felt the blood drop from his face as if a small door had banged wide into his stomach i she frothed scrabbling about every part of her seemed a separate animal her arms and legs her hands her head each was a loppedoff bit of some creature wild to return to itself but blind to the proper way of making that return her mouth still gushed out her sickness with words and sounds that were not even faintly words it had been in her a long time a long long time foxe looked upon her in a state of shock himself before today she had spat her venom out here there another place now he had loosed the flood of a lifetime and he felt in danger of drowning here he sensed someone pulling him by his coat he saw the door sills pass on either side he heard the cane fall and rattle like a thin bone far away from his hand which seemed to have been stung by some terrible unseen wasp and then he was out walking mechanically down through the burning tenement between the scorched walls her voice crashed like a guillotine down the stair get out get out get out fading like the wail of a person dropped down an open well into darkness at the bottom of the last flight near the street door foxe turned himself loose from this other man here and for a long moment leaned against the wall his eyes wet able to do nothing but moan his hands while he did this moved in the air to find the lost cane moved on his head touched at his moist eyelids amazed and fluttered away they sat on the bottom hall step for ten minutes in silence drawing sanity into their lungs with every shuddering breath finally mr foxe looked over at mr shaw who had been staring at him in wonder and fright for the full ten minutes did you see what i did oh oh that was close close close he shook his head im a fool that poor poor woman she was right theres nothing to be done i see that now it had to fall on me here wipe your face thats better do you think shell tell mr shrike about us no no do you think we could talk to him they considered this and shook their heads they opened the front door to a gush of furnace heat and were almost knocked down by a huge man who strode between them look where youre going he cried they turned and watched the man move ponderously in fiery darkness one step at a time up into the tenement house a creature with the ribs of a mastodon and the head of an unshorn lion with great beefed arms irritably hairy painfully sunburnt the face they had seen briefly as he shouldered past was a sweating raw sunblistered pork face salt droplets under the red eyes dripping from the chin great smears of perspiration stained the mans armpits coloring his teeshirt to the waist they shut the tenement door gently thats him said mr foxe thats the husband they stood in the little store across from the tenement it was fivethirty the sun tilting down the sky the shadows the color of hot summer grapes under the rare few trees and in the alleys what was it hanging out of the husbands back pocket longshoremans hook steel sharp heavylooking like those claws onearmed men used to wear on the end of their stumps years ago mr foxe did not speak whats the temperature asked mr foxe a minute later as if he were too tired to turn his head to look store thermometer still reads ninetytwo ninetytwo right on the nose foxe sat on a packing crate making the least motion to hold an orange soda bottle in his fingers cool off he said yes i need an orange pop very much right now they sat there in the furnace looking up at one special tenement window for a long time waiting waiting the small assassin just when the idea occurred to her that she was being murdered she could not tell there had been little subtle signs little suspicions for the past month things as deep as sea tides in her like looking at a perfectly calm stretch of tropic water wanting to bathe in it and finding just as the tide takes your body that monsters dwell just under the surface things unseen bloated manyarmed sharpfinned malignant and inescapable a room floated around her in an effiuvium of hysteria sharp instruments hovered and there were voices and people in sterile white masks my name she thought what is it alice leiber it came to her david leibers wife but it gave her no comfort she was alone with these silent whispering white people and there was great pain and nausea and deathfear in her i am being murdered before their eyes these doctors these nurses dont realize what hidden thing has happened to me david doesnt know nobody knows except me andthe killer the little murderer the small assassin i am dying and i cant tell them now theyd laugh and call me one in delirium theyll see the murderer and hold him and never think him responsible for my death but here i am in front of god and man dying no one to believe my story everyone to doubt me comfort me with lies bury me in ignorance mourn me and salvage my destroyer where is david she wondered in the waiting room smoking one cigarette after another listening to the long tickings of the very slow clock sweat exploded from all of her body at once and with it an agonized cry now now try and kill me she screamed try try but i wont die i wont there was a hollowness a vacuum suddenly the pain fell away exhaustion and dusk came around it was over oh god she plummeted down and struck a black nothingness which gave way to nothingness and nothingness and another and still another footsteps gentle approaching footsteps far away a voice said shes asleep dont disturb her an odor of tweeds a pipe a certain shaving lotion david was standing over her and beyond him the immaculate smell of dr j effers she did not open her eyes im awake she said quietly it was a surprise a relief to be able to speak to not be dead alice someone said and it was david beyond her closed eyes holding her tired hands would you like to meet the murderer david she thought i hear your voice asking to see him so theres nothing but for me to point him out to you david stood over her she opened her eyes the room came into focus moving a weak hand she pulled aside a coverlet the murderer looked up at david leiber with a small redfaced blueeyed calm its eyes were deep and sparkling why cried david leiber smiling hes a fine baby dr jeffers was waiting for david leiber the day he came to take his wife and new child home he motioned leiber to a chair in his office gave him a cigar lit one for himself sat on the edge of his desk puffing solemnly for a long moment then he cleared his throat looked david leiber straight on and said your wife doesnt like her child dave what its been a hard thing for her shell need a lot of love this next year i didnt say much at the time but she was hysterical in the delivery room the strange things she saidi wont repeat them all ill say is that she feels alien to the child now this may simply be a thing we can clear up with one or two questions he sucked on his cigar another moment then said is this child a wanted child dave why do you ask its vital yes yes it is a wanted child we planned it together alice was so happy a year ago when mmmmthat makes it more difficult because if the child was unplanned it would be a simple case of a woman hating the idea of motherhood that doesnt fit alice dr jeffers took his cigar from his lips rubbed his hand across his jaw it must be something else then perhaps something buried in her childhood thats coming out now or it might be the simple temporary doubt and distrust of any mother whos gone through the unusual pain and neardeath that alice has if so then a little time should heal that i thought id tell you though dave itll help you be easy and tolerant with her if she says anything aboutwellabout wishing the child had been born dead and if things dont go well the three of you drop in on me im always glad to see old friends eh here take another cigar along forahfor the baby it was a bright spring afternoon their car hummed along wide treelined boulevards blue sky flowers a warm wind dave talked a lot lit his cigar talked some more alice answered directly softly relaxing a bit more as the trip progressed but she held the baby not tightly or warmly or motherly enough to satisfy the queer ache in daves mind she seemed to be merely carrying a porcelain figurine well he said at last smiling whatll we name him alice leiber watched green trees slide by lets not decide yet id rather wait until we get an exceptional name for him dont blow smoke in his face her sentences ran together with no change of tone the last statement held no motherly reproof no interest no irritation she just mouthed it and it was said the husband disquieted dropped the cigar from the window sorry he said the baby rested in the crook of his mothers arm shadows of sun and tree changing his face his blue eyes opened like fresh blue spring flowers moist noises came from the tiny pink elastic mouth alice gave her baby a quick glance her husband felt her shiver against him cold he asked a chill better raise the window david it was more than a chill he rolled the window slowly up suppertime dave had brought the child from the nursery propped him at a tiny bewildered angle supported by many pillows in a newly purchased high chair alice watched her knife and fork move hes not highchair size she said fun having him here anyway said dave feeling fine everythings fun at the office too orders up to my nose if i dont watch myself ill make another fifteen thousand this year hey look at junior will you drooling all down his chin he reached over to wipe the babys mouth with his napkin from the corner of his eye he realized that alice wasnt even watching he finished the job i guess it wasnt very interesting he said back again at his food but one would think a motherd take some interest in her own child alice jerked her chin up dont speak that way not in front of him later if you must later he cried in front of in back of whats the difference he quieted suddenly swallowed was sorry all right okay i know how it is after dinner she let him carry the baby upstairs she didnt tell him to she let him coming down he found her standing by the radio listening to music she didnt hear her eyes were closed her whole attitude one of wondering selfquestioning she started when he appeared suddenly she was at him against him soft quick the same her lips found him kept him he was stunned now that the baby was gone upstairs out of the room she began to breathe again live again she was free she was whispering rapidly endlessly thank you thank you darling for being yourself always dependable so very dependable he had to laugh my father told me son provide for your family wearily she rested her dark shining hair against his neck youve overdone it sometimes i wish we were just the way we were when we were first married no responsibilities nothing but ourselves nono babies she crushed his hand in hers a supernatural whiteness in her face oh dave once it was just you and me we protected each other and now we protect the baby but get no protection from it do you understand lying in the hospital i had time to think a lot of things the world is evil is it yes it is but laws protect us from it and when there arent laws then love does the protecting youre protected from my hurting you by my love youre vulnerable to me of all people hut love shields you i feel no fear of you because love cushions all your irritations unnatural instincts hatreds and immaturities butwhat about the baby its too young to know love or a law of love or anything until we teach it and in the meantime be vulnerable to it vulnerable to a baby he held her away and laughed gently does a baby know the difference between right and wrong she asked no but itll learn but a baby is so new so amoral so consciencefree she stopped her arms dropped from him and she turned swiftly that noise what was it leiber looked around the room i didnt hear she stared at the library door in there she said slowly leiber crossed the room opened the door and switched the library lights on and off not a thing he came back to her youre worn out to bed with youright now turning out the lights together they walked slowly up the soundless hall stairs not speaking at the top she apologized my wild talk darling forgive me im exhausted he understood and said so she paused undecided by the nursery door then she fingered the brass knob sharply walked in he watched her approach the crib much too carefully look down and stiffen as if shed been struck in the face david leiber stepped forward reached the crib the babys face was bright red and very moist his small pink mouth opened and shut opened and shut his eyes were a fiery blue his hands leapt about on the air oh said dave hes just been crying has he alice leiber seized the cribrailing to balance herself i didnt hear him the door was closed is that why he breathes so hard why his face is red sure poor little guy crying all alone in the dark he can sleep in our room tonight just in case he cries youll spoil him his wife said leiber felt her eyes follow as he rolled the crib into their bedroom he undressed silently sat on the edge of the bed suddenly he lifted his head swore under his breath snapped his fingers damn it forgot to tell you i must fly to chicago friday oh david her voice was lost in the room ive put this trip off for two months and now its so critical i just have to go im afraid to be alone well have the new cook by friday shell be here all the time ill only be gone a few days im afraid i dont know of what you wouldnt believe me if i told you i guess im crazy he was in bed now she darkened the room he heard her walk around the bed throw back the cover slide in he smelled the warm womansmell of her next to him he said if you want me to wait a few days perhaps i could no she said unconvinced you go i know its important its just that i keep thinking about what i told you laws and love and protection love protects you from me but thebaby she took a breath what protects you from him david before he could answer before he could tell her how silly it was speaking of infants she switched on the bed light abruptly look she said pointing the baby lay wideawake in its crib staring straight at him with deep sharp blue eyes the lights went out again she trembled against him its not nice being afraid of the thing you birthed her whisper lowered became harsh fierce swift he tried to kill me he lies there listens to us talking waiting for you to go away so he can try to kill me again i swear it sobs broke from her please he kept saying soothing her stop it stop it please she cried in the dark for a long time very late she relaxed shakingly against him her breathing came soft warm regular her body twitched its worn reflexes and she slept he drowsed and just before his eyes lidded wearily down sinking him into deeper and yet deeper tides he heard a strange little sound of awareness and awakeness in the room the sound of small moist pinkly elastic lips the baby and thensleep in the morning the sun blazed alice smiled david leiber dangled his watch over the crib see baby something bright something pretty sure sure something bright something pretty alice smiled she told him to go ahead fly to chicago shed be very brave no need to worry shed take care of baby oh yes shed take care of him all right the airplane went east there was a lot of sky a lot of sun and clouds and chicago running over the horizon dave was dropped into the rush of ordering planning banqueting telephoning arguing in conference but he wrote letters each day and sent telegrams to alice and the baby on the evening of his sixth day away from home he received the longdistance phone call los angeles alice no dave this is jeff ers speaking doctor hold onto yourself son alice is sick youd better get the next plane home its pneumonia ill do everything i can boy if only it wasnt so soon after the baby she needs strength leiber dropped the phone into its cradle he got up with no feet under him and no hands and no body the hotel room blurred and fell apart alice he said blindly starting for the door the propellers spun about whirled fluttered stopped time and space were put behind under his hand david felt the doorknob turn under his feet the floor assumed reality around him flowed the walls of a bedroom and in the lateafternoon sunlight dr jeffers stood turning from a window as alice lay waiting in her bed something carved from a fall of winter snow then dr jeffers was talking talking continuously gently the sound rising and falling through the lamplight a soft flutter a white murmur of voice your wifes too good a mother dave she worried more about the baby than herself somewhere in the paleness of alices face there was a sudden constriction which smoothed itself out before it was realized then slowly halfsmiling she began to talk and she talked as a mother should about this that and the other thing the telling detail the minutebyminute and hourbyhour report of a mother concerned with a dollhouse world and the miniature life of that world but she could not stop the spring was wound tight and her voice rushed on to anger fear and the faintest touch of revulsion which did not change dr jeffers expression but caused daves heart to match the rhythm of this talk that quickened and could not stop the baby wouldnt sleep i thought he was sick he just lay staring in his crib and late at night hed cry so loud hed cry and hed cry all night and all night i couldnt quiet him and i couldnt rest dr jeffers head nodded slowly slowly tired herself right into pneumonia but shes full of sulfa now and on the safe side of the whole damn thing david felt ill the baby what about the baby fit as a fiddle cock of the walk thanks doctor the doctor walked off away and down the stairs opened the front door faintly and was gone david he turned to her frightened whisper it was the baby again she clutched his hand i try to lie to myself and say that im a fool but the baby knew i was weak from the hospital so he cried all night every night and when he wasnt crying hed be much too quiet i knew if i switched on the light hed be there staring up at me david felt his body close in on itself like a fist he remembered seeing the baby feeling the baby awake in the dark awake very late at night when babies should be asleep awake and lying there silent as thought not crying but watching from its crib he thrust the thought aside it was insane alice went on i was going to kill the baby yes i was when youd been gone only a day on your trip i went to his room and put my hands about his neck and i stood there for a long time thinking afraid then i put the covers up over his face and turned him over on his face and pressed him down and left him that way and ran out of the room he tried to stop her no let me finish she said hoarsely looking at the wall when i left his room i thought its simple babies smother every day no onell ever know but when i came back to see him dead david he was alive yes alive turned over on his back alive and smiling and breathing and i couldnt touch him again after that i left him there and i didnt come back not to feed him or look at him or do anything perhaps the cook tended to him i dont know all i know is that his crying kept me awake and i thought all through the night and walked around the rooms and now im sick she was almost finished now the baby lies there and thinks of ways to kill me simple ways because he knows i know so much about him i have no love for him there is no protection between us there never will be she was through she collapsed inward on herself and finally slept david leiber stood for a long time over her not able to move his blood was frozen in his body not a cell stirred anywhere anywhere at all the next morning there was only one thing to do he did it he walked into dr jeff ers office and told him the whole thing and listened to jeff ers tolerant replies lets take this thing slowly son its quite natural for mothers to hate their children sometimes we have a label for itambivalence the ability to hate while loving lovers hate each other frequently children detest their mothers leiber interrupted i never hated my mother you wont admit it naturally people dont enjoy admitting hatred for their loved ones so alice hates her baby better say she has an obsession shes gone a step further than plain ordinary ambivalence a caesarian operation brought the child into the world and almost took alice out of it she blames the child for her neardeath and her pneumonia shes projecting her troubles blaming them on the handiest object she can use as a source of blame we all do it we stumble into a chair and curse the furniture not our own clumsiness we miss a golfstroke and damn the turf or our club or the make of ball if our business fails we blame the gods the weather our luck all i can tell you is what i told you before love her finest medicine in the world find little ways of showing your affection give her security find ways of showing her how harmless and innocent the child is make her feel that the baby was worth the risk after awhile shell settle down forget about death and begin to love the child if she doesnt come around in the next month or so ask me ill recommend a good psychiatrist go on along now and take that look off your face when summer came things seemed to settle become easier dave worked immersed himself in office detail but found much time for his wife she in turn took long walks gained strength played an occasional light game of badminton she rarely burst out any more she seemed to have rid herself of her fears except on one certain midnight when a sudden summer wind swept around the house warm and swift shaking the trees like so many shining tambourines alice wakened trembling and slid over into her husbands arms and let him console her and ask her what was wrong she said somethings here in the room watching us he switched on the light dreaming again he said youre better though havent been troubled for a long time she sighed as he clicked off the light again and suddenly she slept he held her considering what a sweet weird creature she was for about half an hour he heard the bedroom door sway open a few inches there was nobody at the door no reason for it to come open the wind had died he waited it seemed like an hour he lay silently in the dark then far away wailing like some small meteor dying in the vast inky gulf of space the baby began to cry in his nursery it was a small lonely sound in the middle of the stars and the dark and the breathing of this woman in his arms and the wind beginning to sweep through the trees again leiber counted to one hundred slowly the crying continued carefully disengaging alices arm he slipped from bed put on his slippers robe and moved quietly from the room hed go downstairs he thought fix some warm milk bring it up and the blackness dropped out from under him his foot slipped and plunged slipped on something soft plunged into nothingness he thrust his hands out caught frantically at the railing his body stopped falling he held he cursed the something soft that had caused his feet to slip rustled and thumped down a few steps his head rang his heart hammered at the base of his throat thick and shot with pain why do careless people leave things strewn about a house he groped carefully with his fingers for the object that had almost spilled him headlong down the stairs his hand froze startled his breath went in his heart held one or two beats the thing he held in his hand was a toy a large cumbersome patchwork doll he had bought as a joke for for the baby alice drove him to work the next day she slowed the car halfway downtown pulled to the curb and stopped it then she turned on the seat and looked at her husband i want to go away on a vacation i dont know if you can make it now darling but if not please let me go alone we can get someone to take care of the baby im sure but i just have to get away i thought i was growing out of thisthis feeling but i havent i cant stand being in the room with him he looks up at me as if he hates me too i cant put my finger on it all i know is i want to get away before something happens he got out on his side of the car came around motioned to her to move over got in the only thing youre going to do is see a good psychiatrist and if he suggests a vacation well okay but this cant go on my stomachs in knots all the time he started the car ill drive the rest of the way her head was down she was trying to keep back tears she looked up when they reached his office building all right make the appointment ill go talk to anyone you want david he kissed her now youre talking sense lady think you can drive home okay of course silly see you at supper then drive carefully dont i always bye he stood on the curb watching her drive off the wind taking hold of her long dark shining hair upstairs a minute later he phoned jeffers and arranged an appointment with a reliable neuropsychiatrist the days work went uneasily things fogged over and in the fog he kept seeing alice lost and calling his name so much of her fear had come over to him she actually had him convinced that the child was in some ways not quite natural he dictated long uninspired letters he checked some shipments downstairs assistants had to be questioned and kept going at the end of the day he was exhausted his head throbbed and he was very glad to go home on the way down in the elevator he wondered what if i told alice about the topthat patchwork dolli slipped on on the stairs last night lord wouldnt that back her off no i wont ever tell her accidents are after all accidents daylight lingered in the sky as he drove home in a taxi in front of the house he paid the driver and walked slowly up the cement walk enjoying the light that was still in the sky and the trees the white colonial front of the house looked unnaturally silent and uninhabited and then quietly he remembered this was thursday and the hired help they were able to obtain from time to time were all gone for the day he took a deep breath of air a bird sang behind the house traffic moved on the boulevard a block away he twisted the key in the door the knob turned under his fingers oiled silent the door opened he stepped in put his hat on the chair with his briefcase started to shrug out of his coat when he looked up late sunlight streamed down the stairwell from the window near the top of the hall where the sunlight touched it took on the bright color of the patchwork doll sprawled at the bottom of the stairs but he paid no attention to the toy he could only look and not move and look again at alice alice lay in a broken grotesque pallid gesturing and angling of her thin body at the bottom of the stairs like a crumpled doll that doesnt want to play any more ever alice was dead the house remained quiet except for the sound of his heart she was dead he held her head in his hands he felt her fingers he held her body but she wouldnt live she wouldnt even try to live he said her name out loud many times and he tried once again by holding her to him to give her back some of the warmth she had lost but that didnt help he stood up he must have made a phone call he didnt remember he found himself suddenly upstairs he opened the nursery door and walked inside and stared blankly at the crib his stomach was sick he couldnt see very well the babys eyes were closed but his face was red moist with perspiration as if hed been crying long and hard shes dead said leiber to the baby shes dead then he started laughing low and soft and continuously for a long time until dr jeff ers walked in out of the night and slapped him again and again across his face snap out of it pull yourself together she fell down the stairs doctor she tripped on a patchwork doll and fell i almost slipped on it the other night myself and now the doctor shook him doc doc doc said dave hazily funny thing funny ii finally thought of a name for the baby the doctor said nothing leiber put his head back in his trembling hands and spoke the words im going to have him christened next sunday know what name im giving him im going to call him lucifer it was eleven at night a lot of strange people had come and gone through the house taking the essential flame with themalice david leiber sat across from the doctor in the library alice wasnt crazy he said slowly she had good reason to fear the baby jeffers exhaled dont follow after her she blamed the child for her sickness now you blame it for her death she stumbled on a toy remember that you cant blame the child you mean lucifer stop calling him that leiber shook his head alice heard things at night moving in the halls you want to know what made those noises doctor they were made by the baby four months old moving in the dark listening to us talk listening to every word he held to the sides of the chair and if i turned the lights on a baby is so small it can hide behind furniture a door against a wallbelow eyelevel i want you to stop this said jeffers let me say what i think or ill go crazy when i went to chicago who was it kept alice awake tiring her into pneumonia the baby and when alice didnt die then he tried killing me it was simple leave a toy on the stairs cry in the night until your father goes downstairs to fetch your milk and stumbles a crude trick but effective it didnt get me but it killed alice dead david leiber stopped long enough to light a cigarette i should have caught on id turn on the lights in the middle of the night many nights and the babyd be lying there eyes wide most babies sleep all the time not this one he stayed awake thinking babies dont think he stayed awake doing whatever he could do with his brain then what in hell do we know about a babys mind he had every reason to hate alice she suspected him for what he wascertainly not a normal child somethingdifferent what do you know of babies doctor the general run yes you know of course how babies kill their mothers at birth why could it be resentment at being forced into a lousy world like this one leiber leaned toward the doctor tiredly it all ties up suppose that a few babies out of all the millions born are instantaneously able to move see hear think like many animals and insects can insects are born selfsufficient in a few weeks most mammals and birds adjust but children take years to speak and learn to stumble around on their weak legs but suppose one child in a billion isstrange born perfectly aware able to think instinctively wouldnt it be a perfect setup a perfect blind for anything the baby might want to do he could pretend to be ordinary weak crying ignorant with just a little expenditure of energy he could crawl about a darkened house listening and how easy to place obstacles at the top of stairs how easy to cry all night and tire a mother into pneumonia how easy right at birth to be so close to the mother that a few deft maneuvers might cause peritonitis for gods sake jeffers was on his feet thats a repulsive thing to say its a repulsive thing im speaking of how many mothers have died at the birth of their children how many have suckled strange little improbabilities who cause death one way or another strange red little creatures with brains that work in a bloody darkness we cant even guess at elemental little brains as warm with racial memory hatred and raw cruelty with no more thought than selfpreservation and selfpreservation in this case consisted of eliminating a mother who realized what a horror she had birthed i ask you doctor what is there in the world more selfish than a baby nothing jeffers scowled and shook his head helplessly leiber dropped his cigarette down im not claiming any great strength for the child just enough to crawl around a little a few months ahead of schedule just enough to listen all the time just enough to cry late at night thats enough more than enough jeffers tried ridicule call it murder then but murder must be motivated what motive had the child leiber was ready with the answer what is more at peace more dreamfully content at ease at rest fed comforted unbothered than an unborn child nothing it floats in a sleepy timeless wonder of nourishment and silence then suddenly it is asked to give up its berth is forced to vacate rushed out into a noisy uncaring selfish world where it is asked to shift for itself to hunt to feed from the hunting to seek after a vanishing love that once was its unquestionable right to meet confusion instead of inner silence and conservative slumber and the child resents it resents the cold air the huge spaces the sudden departure from familiar things and in the tiny filament of brain the only thing the child knows is selfishness and hatred because the spell has been rudely shattered who is responsible for this disenchantment this rude breaking of the spell the mother so here the new child has someone to hate with all its unreasoning mind the mother has cast it out rejected it and the father is no better kill him too hes responsible in his way jeffers interrupted if what you say is true then every woman in the world would have to look on her baby as something to dread something to wonder about and why not hasnt the child a perfect alibi a thousand years of accepted medical belief protects him by all natural accounts he is helpless not responsible the child is born hating and things grow worse instead of better at first the baby gets a certain amount of attention and mothering but then as time passes things change when very new a baby has the power to make parents do silly things when it cries or sneezes jump when it makes a noise as the years pass the baby feels even that small power slip rapidly forever away never to return why shouldnt it grasp all the power it can have why shouldnt it jockey for position while it has all the advantages in later years it would be too late to express its hatred now would be the time to strike leibers voice was very soft very low my little boy baby lying in his crib nights his face moist and red and out of breath from crying no from climbing slowly out of his crib from crawling long distances through darkened hallways my little boy baby i want to kill him the doctor handed him a water glass and some pills youre not killing anyone youre going to sleep for twentyfour hours sleepll change your mind take this leiber drank down the pills and let himself be led upstairs to his bedroom crying and felt himself being put to bed the doctor waited until he was moving deep into sleep then left the house leiber alone drifted down down he heard a noise whatswhats that he demanded feebly something moved in the hall david leiber slept very early the next morning dr jeffers drove up to the house it was a good morning and he was here to drive leiber to the country for a rest leiber would still be asleep upstairs jeffers had given him enough sedative to knock him out for at least fifteen hours he rang the doorbell no answer the servants were probably not up jeffers tried the front door found it open stepped in he put his medical kit on the nearest chair something white moved out of sight at the top of the stairs just a suggestion of a movement jeff ers hardly noticed it the smell of gas was in the house jeffers ran upstairs crashed into leibers bedroom leiber lay motionless on the bed and the room billowed with gas which hissed from a released jet at the base of the wall near the door jeffers twisted it off then forced up all the windows and ran back to leibers body the body was cold it had been dead quite a few hours coughing violently the doctor hurried from the room eyes watering leiber hadnt turned on the gas himself he couldnt have those sedatives had knocked him out he wouldnt have wakened until noon it wasnt suicide or was there the faintest possibility jeffers stood in the hall for five minutes then he walked to the door of the nursery it was shut he opened it he walked inside and to the crib the crib was empty he stood swaying by the crib for half a minute then he said something to nobody in particular the nursery door blew shut you couldnt get back into your crib where it was safe you didnt plan on the door blowing shut a little thing like a slammed door can ruin the best of plans ill find you somewhere in the house hiding pretending to be something you are not the doctor looked dazed he put his hand to his head and smiled palely now im talking like alice and david talked but i cant take any chances im not sure of anything but i cant take chances he walked downstairs opened his medical bag on the chair took something out of it and held it in his hands something rustled down the hall something very small and very quiet jeffers turned rapidly i had to operate to bring you into this world he thought now i guess i can operate to take you out of it he took halfadozen slow sure steps forward into the hail he raised his hand into the sunlight see baby something brightsomething pretty a scalpel the crowd mr spallner put his hands over his face there was the feeling of movement in space the beautifully tortured scream the impact and tumbling of the car with wall through wall over and down like a toy and him hurled out of it thensilence the crowd came running faintly where he lay he heard them running he could tell their ages and their sizes by the sound of their numerous feet over the summer grass and on the lined pavement and over the asphalt street and picking through the cluttered bricks to where his car hung half into the night sky still spinning its wheels with a senseless centrifuge where the crowd came from he didnt know he struggled to remain aware and then the crowd faces hemmed in upon him hung over like the large glowing leaves of downbent trees they were a ring of shifting compressing changing faces over him looking down looking down reading the time of his life or death by his face making his face into a moondial where the moon cast a shadow from his nose out upon his cheek to tell the time of breathing or not breathing any more ever how swiftly a crowd comes he thought like the iris of an eye compressing in out of nowhere a siren a police voice movement blood trickled from his lips and he was being moved into an ambulance someone said is he dead and someone else said no hes not dead and a third person said he wont die hes not going to die and he saw the faces of the crowd beyond him in the night and he knew by their expressions that he wouldnt die and that was strange he saw a mans face thin bright pale the man swallowed and bit his lips very sick there was a small woman too with red hair and too much red on her cheeks and lips and a little boy with a freckled face others faces an old man with a wrinkled upper lip an old woman with a mole upon her chin they had all come from where houses cars alleys from the immediate and the accidentshocked world out of alleys and out of hotels and out of streetcars and seemingly out of nothing they came the crowd looked at him and he looked back at them and did not like them at all there was a vast wrongness to them he couldnt put his finger on it they were far worse than this machinemade thing that happened to him now the ambulance doors slammed through the windows he saw the crowd looking in looking in that crowd that always came so fast so strangely fast to form a circle to peer down to probe to gawk to question to point to disturb to spoil the privacy of a mans agony by their frank curiosity the ambulance drove off he sank back and their faces still stared into his face even with his eyes shut the car wheels spun in his mind for days one wheel four wheels spinning spinning and whirring around and around he knew it was wrong something wrong with the wheels and the whole accident and the running of feet and the curiosity the crowd faces mixed and spun into the wild rotation of the wheels he awoke sunlight a hospital room a hand taking his pulse how do you feel asked the doctor the wheels faded away mr spallner looked around finei guess he tried to find words about the accident doctor yes that crowdwas it last night two days ago youve been here since thursday youre all right though youre doing fine dont try and get up that crowd something about wheels too do accidents make people well alittle off temporarily sometimes he lay staring up at the doctor does it hurt your time sense panic sometimes does makes a minute seem like an hour or maybe an hour seem like a minute yes let me tell you then he felt the bed under him the sunlight on his face youll think im crazy i was driving too fast i know im sorry now i jumped the curb and hit that wall i was hurt and numb i know but i still remember things mostlythe crowd he waited a moment and then decided to go on for he suddenly knew what it was that bothered him the crowd got there too quickly thirty seconds after the smash they were all standing over me and staring at me its not right they should run that fast so late at night you only think it was thirty seconds said the doctor it was probably three or four minutes your senses yeah i knowmy senses the accident but i was conscious i remember one thing that puts it all together and makes it funny god so damned funny the wheels of my car upside down the wheels were still spinning when the crowd got there the doctor smiled the man in bed went on im positive the wheels were spinfling and spinning fastthe front wheels wheels dont spin very long friction cuts them down and these were really spinning youre confused said the doctor im not confused that street was empty not a soul in sight and then the accident and the wheels still spinning and all those faces over me quick in no time and the way they looked down at me i knew i wouldnt die simple shock said the doctor walking away into the sunlight they released him from the hospital two weeks later he rode home in a taxi people had come to visit him during his two weeks on his back and to all of them he had told his story the accident the spinning wheels the crowd they had all laughed with him concerning it and passed it off he leaned forward and tapped on the taxi window whats wrong the cabbie looked back sorry boss this is one helluva town to drive in got an accident up ahead want me to detour yes no no wait go ahead letslets take a look the cab moved forward honking funny damn thing said the cabbie hey you get that fleatrap out the way quieter funny thingmore damn people nosy people mr spallner looked down and watched his fingers tremble on his knee you noticed that too sure said the cabbie all the time theres always a crowd youd think it was their own mother got killed they come running awfully fast said the man in the back of the cab same way with a fire or an explosion nobody around boom lotsa people around i dunno ever seen an accidentat night the cabbie nodded sure dont make no difference theres always a crowd the wreck came in view a body lay on the pavement you knew there was a body even if you couldnt see it because of the crowd the crowd with its back toward him as he sat in the rear of the cab with its back toward him he opened the window and almost started to yell but he didnt have the nerve if he yelled they might turn around and he was afraid to see their faces i seem to have a penchant for accidents he said in his office it was late afternoon his friend sat across the desk from him listening i got out of the hospital this morning and first thing on the way home we detoured around a wreck things run in cycles said morgan let me tell you about my accident ive heard it heard it all but it was funny you must admit i must admit now how about a drink they talked on for half an hour or more all the while they talked at the back of spallners brain a small watch ticked a watch that never needed winding it was the memory of a few little things wheels and faces at about fivethirty there was a hard metal noise in the street morgan nodded and looked out and down whatd i tell you cycles a truck and a creamcolored cadillac yes yes spailner walked to the window he was very cold and as he stood there he looked at his watch at the small minute hand one two three four five secondspeople runningeight nine ten eleven twelvefrom all over people came runningfifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen secondsmore people more cars more horns blowing curiously distant spallner looked upon the scene as an explosion in reverse the fragments of the detonation sucked back to the point of impulsion nineteen twenty twentyone seconds and the crowd was there spallner made a gesture down at them wordless the crowd had gathered so fast he saw a womans body a moment before the crowd swallowed it up morgan said you look lousy here finish your drink im all right im all right let me alone im all right can you see those people can you see any of them i wish we could see them closer morgan cried out where in hell are you going spallner was out the door morgan after him and down the stairs as rapidly as possible come along and hurry take it easy youre not a well man they walked out on to the street spaliner pushed his way forward he thought he saw a redhaired woman with too much red color on her cheeks and lips there he turned wildly to morgan did you see her see who damn it shes gone the crowd closed in the crowd was all around breathing and looking and shuffling and mixing and mumbling and getting in the way when he tried to shove through evidently the redhaired woman had seen him coming and run off he saw another familiar face a little freckled boy but there are many freckled boys in the world and anyway it was no use before spallner reached him this little boy ran away and vanished among the people is she dead a voice asked is she dead shes dying someone else replied shell be dead before the ambulance arrives they shouldnt have moved her they shouldnt have moved her all the crowd facesfamiliar yet unfamiliar bending over looking down looking down hey mister stop pushing who you shovin buddy spailner came back out and morgan caught hold of him before he fell you damned fool youre still sick why in helld you have to come down here morgan demanded i dont know i really dont they moved her morgan someone moved her you should never move a traffic victim it kills them it kills them yeah thats the way with people the idiots spallner arranged the newspaper clippings carefully morgan looked at them whats the idea ever since your accident you think every traffic scramble is part of you what are these clippings of motorcar crackups and photos look at them not at the cars said spallner but at the crowds around the cars he pointed here compare this photo of a wreck in the wilshire district with one in westwood no resemblance but now take this westwood picture and align it with one taken in the westwood district ten years ago again he motioned this woman is in both pictures coincidence the woman happened to be there once in again in a coincidence once maybe but twelve times over a period of ten years when the accidents occurred as much as three miles from one another no here he dealt out a dozen photographs shes in all of these maybe shes perverted shes more than that how does she happen to be there so quickly after each accident and why does she wear the same clothes in pictures taken over a period of a decade ill be damned so she does and last of all why was she standing over me the night of my accident two weeks ago they had a drink morgan went over the files whatd you do hire a clipping service while you were in the hospital to go back through the newspapers for you spallner nodded morgan sipped his drink it was getting latethe street lights were coming on in the streets below the office what does all this add up to i dont know said spailner except that theres a universal law about accidents crowds gather they always gather and like you and me people have wondered year after year why they gathered so quickly and how i know the answer here it is he flung the clippings down it frightens me these peoplemightnt they be thrillhunters perverted sensationalists with a carnal lust for blood and morbidity spallner shrugged does that explain their being at all the accidents notice they stick to certain territories a brentwood accident will bring out one group a huntington park another but theres a norm for faces a certain percentage appear at each wreck morgan said theyre not all the same faces are they naturally not accidents draw normal people too in the course of time but these i find are always the first ones there who are they what do they want you keep hinting and never telling good lord you must have some idea youve scared yourself and now youve got me jumping ive tried getting to them but someone always trips me up im always too late they slip into the crowd and vanish the crowd seems to offer protection to some of its members they see me coming sounds like some sort of clique they have one thing in common they always show up together at a fire or an explosion or on the sidelines of a war at any public demonstration of this thing called death vultures hyenas or saints i dont know which they are i just dont know but im going to the police with it this evening its gone on long enough one of them shifted that womans body today they shouldnt have touched her it killed her he placed the clippings in a briefcase morgan got up and slipped into his coat spailner clicked the briefcase shut or i just happened to think what maybe they wanted her dead why who knows come along sorry its late see you tomorrow luck they went out together give my regards to the cops think theyll believe you oh theyll believe me all right good night spallner took it slow driving downtown i want to get there he told himself alive he was rather shocked but not surprised somehow when the truck came rolling out of an alley straight at him he was just congratulating himself on his keen sense of observation and talking out what he would say to the police in his mind when the truck smashed into his car it wasnt really his car that was the disheartening thing about it in a preoccupied mood he was tossed first this way and then that way while he thought what a shame morgan has gone and lent me his extra car for a few days until my other car is fixed and now here i go again the windshield hammered back into his face he was forced back and forth in several lightning jerks then all motion stopped and all noise stopped and only pain filled him up he heard their feet running and running and running he fumbled with the car door it clicked he fell out upon the pavement drunkenly and lay ear to the asphalt listening to them coming it was like a great rainstorm with many drops heavy and light and medium touching the earth he waited a few seconds and listened to their coming and their arrival then weakly expectantly he rolled his head up and looked the crowd was there he could smell their breaths the mingled odors of many people sucking and sucking on the air a man needs to live by they crowded and jostled and sucked and sucked all the air up from around his gasping face until he tried to tell them to move back they were making him live in a vacuum his head was bleeding very badly he tried to move and he realized something was wrong with his spine he hadnt felt much at the impact but his spine was hurt he didnt dare move he couldnt speak opening his mouth nothing came out but a gagging someone said give me a hand well roll him over and lift him into a more comfortable position spallners brain burst apart no dont move me well move him said the voice casually you idiots youll kill me dont but he could not say any of this out loud he could only think it hands took hold of him they started to lift him he cried out and nausea choked him up they straightened him out into a ramrod of agony two men did it one of them was thin bright pale alert a young man the other man was very old and had a wrinkled upper lip he had seen their faces before a familiar voice said isis he dead another voice a memorable voice responded no not yet but he will be dead before the ambulance arrives it was all a very silly mad plot like every accident he squealed hysterically at the solid wall of faces they were all around him these judges and jurors with the faces he had seen before through his pain he counted their faces the freckled boy the old man with the wrinkled upper lip the redhaired redcheeked woman an old woman with a mole on her chin i know what youre here for he thought youre here just as youre at all accidents to make certain the right ones live and the right ones die thats why you lifted me you knew it would kill you knew id live if you left me alone and thats the way its been since time began when crowds gather you murder much easier this way your alibi is very simple you didnt know it was dangerous to move a hurt man you didnt mean to hurt him he looked at them above him and he was curious as a man under deep water looking up at people on a bridge who are you where do you come from and how do you get here so soon youre the crowd thats always in the way using up good air that a dying mans lungs are in need of using up space he should be using to lie in alone tramping on people to make sure they die thats you i know all of you it was like a polite monologue they said nothing faces the old man the redhaired woman someone picked up his briefcase whose is this its mine its evidence against all of you eyes inverted over him shiny eyes under tousled hair or under hats faces somewherea siren the ambulance was coming but looking at the faces the construction the cast the form of the faces spallner saw it was too late he read it in their faces they knew he tried to speak a little bit got out itlooks like illbe joining up with you iguess ill be a member of yourgroupnow he closed his eyes then and waited for the coroner jackin thebox he looked through the cold morning windows with the jackinthebox in his hands prying the rusted lid but no matter how he struggled the jack would not jump to the light with a cry or slap its velvet mittens on the air or bob in a dozen directions with a wild and painted smile crushed under the lid in its jail it stayed crammed tight coil on coil with your ear to the box you felt pressure beneath the fear and panic of the trapped toy it was like holding someones heart in your hand edwin could not tell if the box pulsed or if his own blood beat against the lid he threw the box down and looked to the window outside the window the trees surrounded the house which surrounded edwin he could not see beyond the trees if he tried to find another world beyond them the trees wove themselves thick with the wind to still his curiosity to stop his eyes edwin behind him mothers waiting nervous breath as she drank her breakfast coffee stop staring come eat no he whispered what a stiffened rustle she must have turned which is more important breakfast or that window the window he whispered and sent his gaze running the paths and trails he had tried for thirteen years was it true that the trees flowed on ten thousand miles to nothingness he could not say his sight returned defeated to the lawn the steps his hands trembling on the pane he turned to eat his tasteless apricots alone with his mother in the vast and echoing breakfast room five thousand mornings at this table this window and no movement beyond the trees the two of them ate silently she was the pale woman that no one but the birds saw in old country houses in fourthfloor cupola windows each morning at six each afternoon at four each evening at nine and also passing by one minute after midnight there she would be in her tower silent and white high and alone and quiet it was like passing a deserted greenhouse in which one last wild white blossom lifted its head to the moonlight and her child edwin was the thistle that one breath of wind might unpod in a season of thistles his hair was silken and his eyes were of a constant blue and feverish temperature he had a haunted look as if he slept poorly he might fly apart like a packet of ladyfinger firecrackers if a certain door slammed his mother began to talk slowly and with great caution then more rapidly and then angrily and then almost spitting at him why must you disobey every morning i dont like your staring from the window do you hear what do you want do you want to see them she cried her fingers twitching she was blazingly lovely like an angry white flower do you want to see the beasts that run down paths and crush people like strawberries yes he thought id like to see the beasts horrible as they are do you want to go out there she cried like your father did before you were born and be killed as he was killed struck down by one of those terrors on the road would you like that no isnt it enough they murdered your father why should you even think of those beasts she motioned toward the forest well if you really want to die that much go ahead she quieted but her fingers kept opening and closing on the tablecloth edwin edwin your father built every part of this world it was beautiful for him it should be for you theres nothing nothing beyond those trees but death i wont have you near it this is the world theres no other worth bothering with he nodded miserably smile now and finish your toast she said he ate slowly with the window reflected in secret on his silver spoon mom he couldnt say it whats dying you talk about it is it a feeling to those who must live on after someone else a bad feeling yes she stood up suddenly youre late for school run he kissed her as he grabbed his books bye say hello to teacher he fled from her like a bullet from gun up endless staircases through passages halls past windows that poured down dark gallery panels like white waterfalls up up through the layercake worlds with the thick frostings of oriental rug between and bright candles on top from the highest stair he gazed down through four intervals of universe lowlands of kitchen dining room parlor two middle countries of music games pictures and locked forbidden rooms and herehe whirledthe highlands of picnics adventure and learning here he roamed idled or sat singing lonely child songs on the winding journey to school this then was the universe father had raised its mountains of wailpapered plaster long ago this was fathergods creation in which stars blazed at the flick of a switch and the sun was mother and mother was the sun about which all the worlds swung turning and edwin a small dark meteor spun up around through the dark carpets and shimmering tapestries of space you saw him rise to vanish on vast comet staircases on hikes and explorations sometimes he and mother picnicked in the highlands spread cool snow linens on redtuffed persian lawns on crimson meadows in a rarefied plateau at the summit of the worlds where flaking portraits of sallow strangers looked meanly down on their eating and their revels they drew water from silver taps in hidden tiled niches smashed the tumblers on hearthstones shrieking played hideandseek in enchanted upper countries in unknown wild and hidden lands where she found him rolled like a mummy in a velvet window drape or under sheeted furniture like a rare plant protected from some wind once lost he wandered for hours in insane foothills of dust and echoes where the hooks and hangers in closets were hung only with night but she found him and carried him weeping down through the leveling universe to the parlor where dust motes exact and familiar fell in showers of sparks on the sunlit air he ran up a stair here he knocked a thousand thousand doors all locked and forbidden here picasso ladies and dali gentlemen screamed silently from canvas asylums their gold eyes burning when he dawdled those things live out there his mother had said pointing to the dalipicasso families now running quickly past he stuck out his tongue at them he stopped running one of the forbidden doors stood op en sunlight slanted warm through it exciting him beyond the door a spiral stair screwed around up in sun and silence he stood gasping year after year he had tried the doors that were always found locked what would happen now if he shoved this one full open and climbed the stair was some monster hiding at the top hello his voice leapt up around the spiraled sunlight hello whispered a faint far lazy echo high high and gone he moved through the door please please dont hurt me he whispered to the high sunlit place he climbed pausing with each step to wait for his punishment eyes shut like a penitent faster now he leapt around and around and up until his knees ached and his breath fountained in and out and his head banged like a bell and at last he reached the terrible summit of the climb and stood in an open sundrenched tower the sun struck his eyes a blow never never so much sun he stumbled to the iron rail its there his mouth opened from one direction to another its there he ran in a circle there he was above the somber tree barrier for the first time he stood high over the windy chestnuts and elms and as far as he could see was green grass green trees and white ribbons on which beetles ran and the other half of the world was blue and endless with the sun lost and dropping away in an incredible deep blue room so vast he felt himself fall with it screamed and clutched the tower ledge and beyond the trees beyond the white ribbons where the beetles ran he saw things like fingers sticking up but he saw no dalipicasso terrors he saw only some small redandwhiteandblue handkerchiefs fluttering high on great white poles he was suddenly sick he was sick again turning he almost fell flat down the stairs he slammed the forbidden door fell against it youll go blind he crushed his hands to his eyes you shouldnt have seen you shouldnt you shouldnt he fell to his knees he lay on the floor twisted tight covered up he need wait but a momentthe blindness would come five minutes later he stood at an ordinary highlands window looking out at his own familiar garden world he saw once more the elms and hickory trees and the stone wall and that forest which he had taken to be an endless wall itself beyond which lay nothing but nightmare nothingness mist rain and eternal night now it was certain the universe did not end with the forest there were other worlds than those contained in highland or lowland he tried the forbidden door again locked had he really gone up had he really discovered those halfgreen halfblue vastnesses had god seen him edwin trembled god god who smoked mysterious black pipes and wielded magical walking sticks god who might be watching even now edwin murmured touching his cold face i can still see thank you thank you i can still see at ninethirty half an hour late he rapped on the school door good morning teacher the door swung open teacher waited in her tall gray thickclothed monks robe the cowl hiding her face she wore her usual silver spectacles her graygloved hands beckoned youre late beyond her the land of books burned in bright colors from the hearth there were walls bricked with encyclopedias and a fireplace in which you could stand without bumping your head a log blazed fiercely the door closed and there was a warm quiet here was the desk where god had once sat hed walked this carpet stuffing his pipe with rich tobacco and scowled out that vast stainedglass window the room smelled of god rubbed wood tobacco leather and silver coins here teachers voice sang like a solemn harp telling of god the old days and the world when it had shaken with gods determination trembled at his wit when the world was abuilding under gods hand a blueprint a cry and timber rising gods fingerprints still lay like halfmelted snowflakes on a dozen sharpened pencils in a locked glass display they must never never be touched lest they melt away forever here here in the highlands to the soft sound of teachers voice running on edwin learned what was expected of him and his body he was to grow into a presence he must fit the odors and the trumpet voice of god he must some day stand tall and burning with pale fire at this high window to shout dust off the beams of the worlds he must be god himself nothing must prevent it not the sky or the trees or the things beyond the trees teacher moved like a vapor in the room why are you late edwin i dont know ill ask you again edwin why are you late oneone of the forbidden doors was open he heard the hiss of teachers breath he saw her slowly slide back and sink into the large handcarved chair swallowed by darkness her glasses flashing light before they vanished he felt her looking out at him from shadow and her voice was numbed and so like a voice he heard at night his own voice crying just before he woke from some nightmare which door where she said oh it must be locked the door by the dalipicasso people he said in panic he and teacher had always been friends was that finished now had he spoiled things i climbed the stair i had to i had to im sorry im sorry please dont tell mother teacher sat lost in the hollow chair in the hollow cowl her glasses made faint firefly glitters in the well where she moved alone and what did you see up there she murmured a big blue room did you and a green one and ribbons with bugs running on them hut i didnt i didnt stay long i swear i swear green room ribbons yes ribbons and the little bugs running along them yes she said and her voice made him sad he reached out for her hand but it fell away to her lap and groped back in darkness to her breast i came right down i locked the door i wont go look again ever he cried her voice was so faint he could hardly hear what she said but now youve seen and youll want to see more and youll always he curious now the cowl moved slowly back and forth its deepness turned toward him questioning did youlike what you saw i was scared it was big big yes too big large large so large edwin not like our world big large uncertain oh why did you do this you knew it was wrong the fire bloomed and withered on the hearth while she waited for his answer and finally when he could not answer she said as if her lips were barely moving is it your mother i dont know is she nervous is she mean does she snap at you does she hold too tight do you want time alone is that it is that it is that it yes yes he sobbed wildly is that why you ran off she demands all your time all your thoughts lost and sad her voice tell me his hands had gone sticky with tears yes he bit his fingers and the backs of his hands yes it was wrong to admit such things but he didnt have to say them now she said them she said them and all he must do is agree shake his head bite his knuckles cry out between sobs teacher was a million years old we learn she said wearily rousing from her chair she moved with a slow swaying of gray robes to the desk where her gloved hand searched a long time to find pen and paper we learn oh god but slowly and with pain we learn we think we do right but all the time all the time we kill the plan she hissed hef breath jerked her head up suddenly the cowl looked completely empty shivering she wrote words on the paper give this to your mother it tells her you must have two full hours every afternoon to yourself to prowl where you wish anywhere except out there are you listening child yes he dried his face but go on did mother lie to me about out there and the beasts look at me she said ive been your friend ive never beaten you as your mother sometimes must were both here to help you understand and grow so you wont be destroyed as god was she arose and in rising turned the cowl such a way that color from the hearth washed over her face swiftly the firelight erased her many wrinkles edwin gasped his heart gave a jolting thump the fire teacher froze the fire edwin looked at the fire and back to her face the cowl jerked away from his gaze the face vanished in the deep well gone your face said edwin numbly you look like mother she moved swiftly to the books seized one down she talked to the shelves in her high singing monotonous voice women look alike you know that forget it here here and she brought him the book read the first chapter read the diary edwin took the book but did not feel its weight in his hands the fire rumbled and sucked itself brilliantly up the flue as he began to read and as he read teacher sank back down and settled and quieted and the more he read the more the gray cowl nodded and became serene the hidden face like a clapper gone solemn in its bell firelight ignited the gold animal lettering of the shelved books as he read and he spoke the words but was really thinking of these books from which pages had been razored and clipped certain lines erased certain pictures torn the leather jaws of some books glued tight others like mad dogs muzzled in hard bronze straps to keep him away all this he thought while his lips moved through the firequiet in the beginning was god who created the universe and the worlds within the universe the continents within the worlds and the lands within the continents and shaped from his mind and hand his loving wife and a child who in time would he god himself teacher nodded slowly the fire fell softly away to slumbering coals edwin read on down the banister breathless he slid into the parlor mom mom she lay in a plump maroon chair breathless as if she too had run a great way mom mom youre soaking wet am i she said as if it was his fault shed been rushing about so i am so i am she took a deep breath and sighed then she took his hands and kissed each one she looked at him steadily her eyes dilating well now listen here ive a surprise do you know whats coming tomorrow you cant guess your birthday but its only been ten months tomorrow it is do us wonders i say and anything i say is so is really so my dear she laughed and we open another secret room he was dazed the fourteenth room yes fifteenth room next year sixteenth seventeenth and so on and on till your twentyfirst birthday edwin then oh then well open up the triplelocked doors to the most important room and youll be man of the house father god ruler of the universe hey he said and hey he tossed his books straight up in the air they exploded like a great burst of doves whistling he laughed she laughed their laughter flew and fell with the books he ran to scream down the banister again at the bottom of the stairs she waited arms wide to catch him edwin lay on his moonlit bed and his fingers pried at the jackinthebox but the lid stayed shut he turned it in his hands blindly but did not look down at it tomorrow his birthdaybut why was he that good no why then should the birthday come so soon well simply because things had gotten what word could you use nervous yes things had begun to shimmer by day as well as by night he saw the white tremor the moonlight sifting down and down of an invisible snow in his mothers face it would take yet another of his birthdays to quiet her again my birthdays he said to the ceiling will come quicker from now on i know i know mom laughs so loud so much and her eyes are funny would teacher be invited to the party no mother and teacher had never met why not because said mom dont you want to meet mom teacher some day said teacher faintly blowing off like cobwebs in the hall some day and where did teacher go at night did she drift through all those secret mountain countries high up near the moon where the chandeliers were skinned blind with dust or did she wander out beyond the trees that lay beyond the trees that lay beyond the trees no hardly that he twisted the toy in his sweating hands last year when things began to tremble and quiver hadnt mother advanced his birthday several months too yes oh yes yes think of something else god god building cold midnight cellar sunbaked attic and all miracles between think of the hour of his death crushed by some monstrous beetle beyond the wall oh how the worlds must have rocked with his passing edwin moved the jackinthebox to his face whispered against the lid hello hello hello hello no answer save the sprungtight coiledin tension there ill get you out thought edwin just wait just wait it may hurt but theres only one way here here and he moved from bed to window and leaned far out looking down to the marbled walk in the moonlight he raised the box high felt the sweat trickle from his armpit felt his fingers clench felt his arm jerk he flung the box out shouting the box tumbled in the cold air down it took a long time to strike the marble pavement edwin bent still further over gasping well he cried well and again you there and you the echoes faded the box lay in the forest shadows he could not see if the crash had broken it wide he could not see if the jack had risen smiling from its hideous jail or if it bobbed upon the wind now this way that this way that its silver bells jingling softly he listened he stood by the window for an hour staring listening and at last went back to bed morning bright voices moved near and far in and out the kitchen world and edwin opened his eyes whose voices now whose could they he some of gods workmen the dali people but mother hated them no the voices faded in a humming roar silence and from a great distance a running running grew louder and still louder until the door burst open happy birthday they danced they ate frosted cookies they bit lemon ices they drank pink wines and there stood his name on a snowpowdered cake as mother chorded the piano into an avalanche of sound and opened her mouth to sing then whirled to seize him away to more strawberries more wines more laughter that shook chandeliers into trembling rain then a silver key flourished they raced to unlock the fourteenth forbidden door ready hold on the door whispered into the wall oh said edwin for disappointingly enough this fourteenth room was nothing at all but a dusty dullbrown closet it promised nothing as had the rooms given him on other anniversaries his sixth birthday present now had been the schoolroom in the highlands on his seventh birthday he had opened the playroom in the lowlands eighth the music room ninth the miraculous hellfired kitchen tenth was the room where phonographs hissed in a continuous exhalation of ghosts singing on a gentle wind eleventh was the vast green diamond room of the garden with a carpet that had to be cut instead of swept oh dont be disappointed move mother laughing pushed him in the closet wait till you see how magical shut the door she thrust a red button flush with the wall edwin shrieked no for the room was quivering working like a mouth that held them in iron jaws the room moved the wall slid away below oh hush now darling she said the door drifted down through the floor and a long insanely vacant wall slithered by like an endlessly rustling snake to bring another door and another door with it that did not stop but traveled on while edwin screamed and clutched his mothers waist the room whined and cleared its throat somewhere the trembling ceased the room stood still edwin stared at a strange new door and heard his mother say go on open it there now there and the new door gaped upon still further mystery edwin blinked the highlands this is the highlands how did we get here wheres the parlor mom wheres the parlor she fetched him out through the door we jumped straight up and we flew once a week youll fly to school instead of running the long way around he still could not move but only stood looking at the mystery of land exchanged for land of country replaced by higher and further country oh mother mother he said it was a sweet long time in the deep grass of the garden where they idled most deliciously sipped huge cupfuls of apple cider with their elbows on crimson silk cushions their shoes kicked off their toes bedded in sour dandelions sweet clover mother jumped twice when she heard monsters roar beyond the forest edwin kissed her cheek its all right he said ill protect you i know you will she said but she turned to gaze at the pattern of trees as if any moment the chaos out there might smash the forest with a blow and stamp its titans foot down and grind them to dust late in the long blue afternoon they saw a chromium bird thing fly through a bright rift in the trees high and roaring they ran for the parlor heads bent as before a green storm of lightning and rain feeling the sound pour blinding showers to drench them crackle cracklethe birthday burnt away to cellophane nothingness at sunset in the dim soft parlor country mother inhaled champagne with her tiny seedling nostrils and her pale summerrose mouth then drowsy wild herded edwin off to his room and shut him in he undressed in slowpantomimed wonder thinking this year next year and which room two years three years from today what about the beasts the monsters and being mashed and god killed what was killed what was death was death a feeling did god enjoy it so much he never came back was death a journey then in the hail on her way downstairs mother dropped a champagne bottle edwin heard and was cold for the thought that jumped through his head was thats how motherd sound if she fell if she broke youd find a million fragments in the morning bright crystal and clear wine on the parquet flooring thats all youd see at dawn morning was the smell of vines and grapes and moss in his room a smell of shadowed coolness downstairs breakfast was in all probability at this instant manifesting itself in a fingersnap on the wintry tables edwin got up to wash and dress and wait feeling fine now things would be fresh and new for at least a month today like all days thered be breakfast school lunch songs in the music room an hour or two at the electrical games thentea in the outlands on the luminous grass then up to school again for a late hour or so where he and teacher might prowl the censored library together and hed puzzle with words and thoughts about that world out there that had been censored from his eyes he had forgotten teachers note now he must give it to mother he opened the door the hall was empty down through the deeps of the worlds a soft mist floated through a silence which no footsteps broke the hills were quiet the silver fonts did not pulse in the first sunlight and the banister coiling up from the mists was a prehistoric monster peering into his room he pulled away from this creature looking to find mother like a white boat drifted by the dawn tides and vapors below she was not there he hurried down through the hushed lands calling mother he found her in the parlor collapsed on the floor in her shiny greengold party dress a champagne goblet in one hand the carpet littered with broken glass she was obviously asleep so he sat at the magical breakfast table he blinked at the empty white cloth and the gleaming plates there was no food all his life wondrous foods had awaited him here but not today mother wake up he ran to her shall i go to school wheres the food wake up he ran up the stairs the highlands were cold and shadowed and the white glass suns no longer glowed from the ceilings in this day of sullen fog down dark corridors through dim continents of silence edwin rushed he rapped and rapped at the school door it drifted in whining by itself the school lay empty and dark no fire roared on the hearth to toss shadows on the beamed ceiling there was not a crackle or a whisper teacher he poised in the center of the flat cold room teacher he screamed he slashed the drapes aside a faint shaft of sunlight fell through the stained glass edwin gestured he commanded the fire to explode like a popcorn kernel on the hearth he commanded it to bloom to life he shut his eyes to give teacher time to appear he opened his eyes and was stupefied at what he saw on her desk neatly folded was the gray cowl and robe atop which gleamed her silver spectacles and one gray glove he touched them one gray glove was gone a piece of greasy cosmetic chalk lay on the robe testing it he made dark lines on his hands he drew back staring at teachers empty robe the glasses the greasy chalk his hand touched a knob of a door which had always been locked the door swung slowly wide he looked into a small brown closet teacher he ran in the door crashed shut he pressed a red button the room sank down and with it sank a slow mortal coldness the world was silent quiet and cool teacher gone and mothersleeping down fell the room with him in its iron jaws machinery clashed a door slid open edwin ran out the parlor behind was not a door but a tall oak panel from which he had emerged mother lay uncaring asleep folded under her barely showing as he rolled her over was one of teachers soft gray gloves he stood near her holding the incredible glove for a long time finally he began to whimper he fled back up to the highlands the hearth was cold the room empty he waited teacher did not come he ran down again to the solemn lowlands commanded the table to fill with steaming dishes nothing happened he sat by his mother talking and pleading with her and touching her and her hands were cold the clock ticked and the light changed in the sky and still she did not move and he was hungry and the silent dust dropped down on the air through all the worlds he thought of teacher and knew that if she was in none of the hills and mountains above then there was only one place she could be she had wandered by error into the outlands lost until someone found her and so he must go out call after her bring her back to wake mother or she would lie here forever with the dust falling in the great darkened spaces through the kitchen out back he found late afternoon sun and the beasts hooting faintly beyond the rim of the world he clung to the garden wall not daring to let go and in the shadows at a distance saw the shattered box he had flung from the window freckles of sunlight quivered on the broken lid and touched tremblingly over and over the face of the jack jumped out and sprawled with its arms overhead in an eternal gesture of freedom the doll smiled and did not smile smiled and did not smile as the sun winked on the mouth and edwin stood hypnotized above and beyond it the doll opened its arms toward the path that led off between the secret trees the forbidden path smeared with oily droppings of the beasts but the path lay silent and the sun warmed edwin and he heard the wind blow softly in the trees at last he let go of the garden wall teacher he edged along the path a few feet teacher his shoes slipped on the animal droppings and he stared far down the motionless tunnel blindly the path moved under the trees moved over him teacher he walked slowly but steadily he turned behind him lay his world and its very new silence it was diminished it was small how strange to see it less than it had been it had always and forever seemed so large he felt his heart stop he stepped back but then afraid of that silence in the world he turned to face the forest path ahead everything before him was new odors filled his nostrils colors odd shapes incredible sizes filled his eyes if i run beyond the trees ill die he thought for thats what mother said youll die youll die but whats dying another room a blue room a green room far larger than all the rooms that ever were but wheres the key there far ahead a great halfopen iron door a wroughtiron gate beyond a room as large as the sky all colored green with trees and grass oh mother teacher he rushed stumbled fell got up ran again his numb legs under him were left behind as he fell down and down the side of a hill the path gone wailing crying and then not wailing or crying any more but making new sounds he reached the great rusted screaming iron gate leapt through the universe dwindled behind he did not look back at his old worlds but ran as they withered and vanished the policeman stood at the curb looking down the street these kids ill never be able to figure them hows that asked the pedestrian the policeman thought it over and frowned couple seconds ago a little kid ran by he was laughing and crying crying and laughing both he was jumping up and down and touching things things like lampposts the telephone poles fire hydrants dogs people things like sidewalks fences gates cars plateglass windows barber poles hell he even grabbed hold and looked at me and looked at the sky you should have seen the tears and all the time he kept yelling and yelling something funny what did he yell asked the pedestrian he kept yelling im dead im dead im glad im dead im dead im dead im glad im dead im dead im dead its good to be dead the policeman scratched his chin slowly one of them new kid games i guess the scythe quite suddenly there was no more road it ran down the valley like any other road between slopes of barren stony ground and live oak trees and then past a broad field of wheat standing alone in the wilderness it came up beside the small white house that belonged to the wheat field and then just faded out as though there was no more use for it it didnt matter much because just there the last of the gas was gone drew erickson braked the ancient car to a stop and sat there not speaking staring at his big rough farmers hands molly spoke without moving where she lay in the corner beside him we must of took the wrong fork back yonder drew nodded mollys lips were almost as white as her face only they were dry where her skin was damp with sweat her voice was flat with no expression in it drew she said drew what are we agoin to do now drew stared at his hands a farmers hands with the farm blown out from under them by the dry hungry wind that never got enough good loam to eat the kids in the back seat woke up and pried themselves out of the dusty litter of bundles and bedding they poked their heads over the back of the seat and said what are we stoppin for pa are we gonna eat now pa pa were awful hungry can we eat now pa drew closed his eyes he hated the sight of his hands mollys fingers touched his wrist very light very soft drew maybe in the house there theyd spare us somethin to eat a white line showed around his mouth beggin he said harshly aint none of us ever begged before aint none of us ever goin to mollys hand tightened on his wrist he turned and saw her eyes he saw the eyes of susie and little drew looking at him slowly all the stiffness went out of his neck and his back his face got loose and blank shapeless like a thing that has been beaten too hard and too long he got out of the car and went up the path to the house he walked uncertainly like a man who is sick or nearly blind the door of the house was open drew knocked three times there was nothing inside but silence and a white window curtain moving in the slow hot air he knew it before he went in he knew there was death in the house it was that kind of silence he went through a small clean living room and down a little hall he wasnt thinking anything he was past thinking he was going toward the kitchen unquestioning like an animal then he looked through an open door and saw the dead man he was an old man lying out on a clean white bed he hadnt been dead long not long enough to lose the last quiet look of peace he must have known he was going to die because he wore his grave clothesan old black suit brushed and neat and a clean white shirt and a black tie a scythe leaned against the wall beside the bed between the old mans hands there was a blade of wheat still fresh a ripe blade golden and heavy in the tassel drew went into the bedroom walking soft there was a coldness on him he took off his broken dusty hat and stood by the bed looking down the paper lay open on the pillow beside the old mans head it was meant to he read maybe a request for burial or to call a relative drew scowled over the words moving his pale dry lips to him who stands beside me at my death bed being of sound mind and alone in the world as it has been decreed i john buhr do give and bequeath this farm with all pertaining to it to the man who is to come whatever his name or origin shall be it will not matter the farm is his and the wheat the scythe and the task ordained thereto let him take them freely and without questionand re member that i john buhr am only the giver not the ordainer to which i set my hand and seal this third day of april john buhr kyrie elйison drew walked back through the house and opened the screen door he said molly you come in kids you stay in the car molly came inside he took her to the bedroom she looked at the will the scythe the wheat field moving in a hot wind outside the window her white face tightened up and she bit her lips and held onto him its too good to be true there must be some trick to it drew said our lucks changin thats all well have work to do stuff to eat somethin over our heads to keep rain off he touched the scythe it gleamed like a halfmoon words were scratched on its blade who wields mewields the world it didnt mean much to him right at that moment drew molly asked staring at the old mans clasped hands whywhys he holdin that wheatstalk so hard in his fingers just then the heavy silence was broken by the sound of the kids scrambling up the front porch molly gasped they lived in the house they buried the old man on a hill and said some words over him and came back down and swept the house and unloaded the car and had something to eat because there was food lots of it in the kitchen and they did nothing for three days but fix the house and look at the land and lie in the good beds and then look at one another in surprise that all this was happening this way and their stomachs were full and there was even a cigar for him to smoke in the evenings there was a small barn behind the house and in the barn a bull and three cows and there was a wellhouse a springhouse under some big trees that kept it cool and inside the wellhouse were big sides of beef and bacon and pork and mutton enough to feed a family five times their size for a year two years maybe three there was a churn and a box of cheese there and big metal cans for the milk on the fourth morning drew erickson lay in bed looking at the scythe and he knew it was time for him to work because there was ripe grain in the long field he had seen it with his eyes and he did not want to get soft three days sitting were enough for any man he roused himself in the first fresh smell of dawn and took the scythe and held it before him as he walked out into the field he held it up in his hands and swung it down it was a big field of grain too big for one man to tend and yet one man had tended it at the end of the first day of work he walked in with the scythe riding his shoulder quietly and there was a look on his face of a puzzled man it was a wheat field the like of which he had never seen it ripened only in separate clusters each set off from the others wheat shouldnt do that he didnt tell molly nor did he tell her the other things about the field about how for instance the wheat rotted within a few hours after he cut it down wheat shouldnt do that either he was not greatly worried after all there was food at hand the next morning the wheat he had left rotting cut down had taken hold and came up again in little green sprouts with tiny roots all born again drew erickson rubbed his chin wondered what and why and how it acted that way and what good it would be to himhe couldnt sell it a couple of times during the day he walked far up in the hills to where the old mans grave was just to be sure the old man was there maybe with some notion he might get an idea there about the field he looked down and saw how much land he owned the wheat stretched three miles in one direction toward the mountains and was about two acres wide patches of it in seedlings patches of it golden patches of it green patches of it fresh cut by his hand but the old man said nothing concerning this there were a lot of stones and dirt in his face now the grave was in the sun and the wind and silence so drew erickson walked back down to use the scythe curious enjoying it because it seemed important he didnt know just why but it was very very important he couldnt just let the wheat stand there were always new patches of it ripened and in his figuring out loud to no one in particular he said if i cut the wheat for the next ten years just as it ripens up i dont think ill pass the same spot twice such a damn big field he shook his head that wheat ripens just so never too much of it so i cant cut all the ripe stuff each day that leaves nothin hut green grain and the next mornin sure enough another patch of ripe stuff it was damned foolish to cut the grain when it rotted as quick as it fell at the end of the week he decided to let it go a few days he lay in bed late just listening to the silence in the house that wasnt anything like death silence but a silence of things living well and happily he got up dressed and ate his breakfast slowly he wasnt going to work he went out to milk the cows stood on the porch smoking a cigarette walked about the backyard a little and then came back in and asked molly what he had gone out to do milk the cows she said oh yes he said and went out again he found the cows waiting and full and milked them and put the milk cans in the springhouse hut thought of other things the wheat the scythe all through the morning he sat on the hack porch rolling cigarettes he made a toy boat for little drew and one for susie and then he churned some of the milk into butter and drew off the buttermilk hut the sun was in his head aching it burned there he wasnt hungry for lunch he kept looking at the wheat and the wind bending and tipping and ruffling it his arms flexed his fingers resting on his knee as he sat again on the porch made a kind of grip in the empty air itching the pads of his palms itched and burned he stood up and wiped his hands on his pants and sat down and tried to roll another cigarette and got mad at the mixings and threw it all away with a muttering he had a feeling as if a third arm had been cut off of him or he had lost something of himself it had to do with his hands and his arms he heard the wind whisper in the field by one oclock he was going in and out of the house getting underfoot thinking about digging an irrigation ditch but all the time really thinking about the wheat and how ripe and beautiful it was aching to be cut damn it to hell he strode into the bedroom took the scythe down off its wallpegs he stood holding it he felt cool his hands stopped itching his head didnt ache the third arm was returned to him he was intact again it was instinct illogical as lightning striking and not hurting each day the grain must be cut it had to be cut why well it just did that was all he laughed at the scythe in his big hands then whistling he took it out to the ripe and waiting field and did the work he thought himself a little mad hell it was an ordinaryenough wheat field really wasnt it almost the days loped away like gentle horses drew erickson began to understand his work as a sort of dry ache and hunger and need things built in his head one noon susie and little drew giggled and played with the scythe while their father lunched in the kitchen he heard them he came out and took it away from them he didnt yell at them he just looked very concerned and locked the scythe up after that when it wasnt being used he never missed a day scything up down up down and across back and up and down and across cutting up down up think about the old man and the wheat in his hands when he died down think about this dead land with wheat living on it up think about the crazy patterns of ripe and green wheat the way it grows down think about the wheat whirled in a full yellow tide at his ankles the sky blackened drew erickson dropped the scythe and bent over to hold his stomach his eyes running blindly the world reeled ive killed somebody he gasped choking holding to his chest falling to his knees beside the blade ive killed a lot the sky revolved like a blue merrygoround at the county fair in kansas but no music only a ringing in his ears molly was sitting at the blue kitchen table peeling potatoes when he blundered into the kitchen dragging the scythe behind him molly she swam around in the wet of his eyes she sat there her hands fallen open waiting for him to finally get it out get the things packed he said looking at the floor why were leaving he said dully were leaving she said that old man you know what he did here its the wheat molly and this scythe every time you use the scythe on the wheat a thousand people die you cut across them and molly got up and put the knife down and the potatoes to one side and said understandingly we traveled a lot and havent eaten good until the last month here and you been workin every day and youre tired i hear voices sad voices out there in the wheat he said tellin me to stop tellin me not to kill them drew he didnt hear her the field grows crooked wild like a crazy thing i didnt tell you but its wrong she stared at him his eyes were blue glass nothing else you think im crazy he said but wait til i tell you oh god molly help me i just killed my mother stop it she said firmly i cut down one stalk of wheat and i killed her i felt her dyin thats how i found out just now drew her voice was like a crack across the face angry and afraid now shut up he mumbled ohmolly the scythe dropped from his hands clamored on the floor she picked it up with a snap of anger and set it in one corner ten years i been with you she said sometimes we had nothin but dust and prayers in our mouths now all this good luck sudden and you cant bear up under it she brought the bible from the living room she rustled its pages over they sounded like the wheat rustling in a small slow wind you sit down and listen she said a sound came in from the sunshine the kids laughing in the shade of the large live oak beside the house she read from the bible looking up now and again to see what was happening to drews face she read from the bible each day after that the following wednesday a week later when drew walked down to the distant town to see if there was any general delivery mail there was a letter he came home looking two hundred years old he held the letter out to molly and told her what it said in a cold uneven voice mother passed awayone oclock tuesday afternoonher heart all that drew erickson had to say was get the kids in the car load it up with food were goin on to california drew said his wife holding the letter you know yourself he said this is poor grain land yet look how ripe it grows i aint told you all the things it ripens in patches a little each day it aint right and when i cut it it rots and next mornin it comes up without any help growin again last tuesday a week ago when i cut the grain it was like rippin my own flesh i heard somebody scream it sounded just likeand now today this letter she said were stayin here molly were stayin here where were sure of eatin and sleepin and livin decent and livin long im not starvin my children down again ever the sky was blue through the windows the sun slanted in touching half of mollys calm face shining one eye bright blue four or five water drops hung and fell from the kitchen faucet slowly shining before drew sighed the sigh was husky and resigned and tired he nodded looking away all right he said well stay he picked up the scythe weakly the words on the metal leaped up with a sharp glitter who wields mewields the world well stay next morning he walked to the old mans grave there was a single fresh sprout of wheat growing in the center of it the same sprout reborn that the old man had held in his hands weeks before he talked to the old man getting no answers you worked the field all your life because you had to and one day you came across your own life growin there you knew it was yours you cut it and you went home put on your grave clothes and your heart gave out and you died thats how it was wasnt it and you passed the land on to me and when i die im supposed to hand it over to someone else drews voice had awe in it how long a time has this been goin on with nobody knowin about this field and its use except the man with the scythe quite suddenly he felt very old the valley seemed ancient mummified secretive dried and bent and powerful when the indians danced on the prairie it had been here this field the same sky the same wind the same wheat and before the indians some cromagnon gnarled and shaghaired wielding a crude wooden scythe perhaps prowling down through the living wheat drew returned to work up down up down obsessed with the idea of being the wielder of the scythe he himself it burst upon him in a mad wild surge of strength and horror up who wields me down wields the world he had to accept the job with some sort of philosophy it was simply his way of getting food and housing for his family they deserved eating and living decent he thought after all these years up and down each grain a life he neatly cut into two pieces if he planned it carefullyhe looked at the wheatwhy he and molly and the kids could live forever once he found the place where the grain grew that was molly and susie and little drew he would never cut it and then like a signal it came quietly right there before him another sweep of the scythe and hed cut them away molly drew susie it was certain trembling he knelt and looked at the few grains of wheat they glowed at his touch he groaned with relief what if he had cut them down never guessing he blew out his breath and got up and took the scythe and stood back away from the wheat and stood for a long while looking down molly thought it awfully strange when he came home early and kissed her on the cheek for no reason at all at dinner molly said you quit early today doesdoes the wheat still spoil when it falls he nodded and took more meat she said you ought to write to the agriculture people and have them come look at it no he said i was just suggestin she said his eyes dilated i got to stay here all my life cant nobody else mess with that wheat they wouldnt know where to cut and not to cut they might cut the wrong parts what wrong parts nothin he said chewing slowly nothin at all he slapped his fork down hard who knows what they might want to do those government men they might evenmight even want to plow the whole field under molly nodded thats just what it needs she said and start all over again with new seed he didnt finish eating im not writin any goverment and im not handin this field over to no stranger to cut and thats that he said and the screen door banged behind him he detoured around that place where the lives of his children and his wife grew up in the sun and used his scythe on the far end of the field where he knew he would make no mistakes but he no longer liked the work at the end of an hour he knew he had brought death to three of his old loved friends in missouri he read their names on the cut grain and couldnt go on he locked the scythe in the cellar and put the key away he was done with the reaping done for good and all he smoked his pipe in the evening on the front porch and told the kids stories to hear them laugh but they didnt laugh much they seemed withdrawn tired and funny like they werent his children any more molly complained of a headache dragged around the house a little went to bed early and fell into a deep sleep that was funny too molly always stayed up late and was full of vinegar the wheat field rippled with moonlight on it making it into a sea it wanted cutting certain parts needed cutting now drew erickson sat swallowing quietly trying not to look at it whatd happen to the world if he never went in the field again whatd happen to people ripe for death who waited the coming of the scythe hed wait and see molly was breathing softly when he blew out the oil lamp and got to bed he couldnt sleep he heard the wind in the wheat felt the hunger to do the work in his arms and fingers in the middle of the night he found himself walking in the field the scythe in his hands walking like a crazy man walking and afraid halfawake he didnt remember unlocking the cellar door getting the scythe but here he was in the moonlight walking in the grain among these grains there were many who were old weary wanting so very much to sleep the long quiet moonless sleep the scythe held him grew into his palms forced him to walk somehow struggling he got free of it he threw it down ran off into the wheat where he stopped and went down on his knees i dont want to kill anymore he said if i work with the scythe ill have to kill molly and the kids dont ask me to do that the stars only sat in the sky shining behind him he heard a dull thumping sound something shot up over the hill into the sky it was like a living thing with arms of red color licking at the stars sparks fell into his face the thick hot odor of fire came with it the house crying out he got sluggishly hopelessly to his feet looking at the big fire the little white house with the live oaks was roaring up in one savage bloom of fire heat rolled over the hill and he swam in it and went down in it stumbling drowning over his head by the time he got down the hill there was not a shingle bolt or threshold of it that wasnt alive with flame it made blistering crackling fumbling noises no one screamed inside no one ran around or shouted he yelled in the yard molly susie drew he got no answer he ran close in until his eyebrows withered and his skin crawled hot like paper burning crisping curling up in tight little curls molly susie the fire settled contentedly down to feed drew ran around the house a dozen times all alone trying to find a way in then he sat where the fire roasted his body and waited until all the walls had sunken down with fluttering crashes until the last ceiling bent blanketing the floors with molten plaster and scorched lathing until the flames died and smoke coughed up and the new day came slowly and there was nothing but embering ashes and an acid smoldering disregarding the heat fanning from the leveled frames drew walked into the ruin it was still too dark to see much red light glowed on his sweating throat he stood like a stranger in a new and different land herethe kitchen charred tables chairs the iron stove the cupboards herethe hall here the parlor and then over there was the bedroom where where molly was still alive she slept among fallen timbers and angrycolored pieces of wire spring and metal she slept as if nothing had happened her small white hands lay at her sides flaked with sparks her calm face slept with a flaming lath across one cheek drew stopped and didnt believe it in the ruin of her smoking bedroom she lay on a glittering bed of sparks her skin intact her breast rising falling taking air molly alive and sleeping after the fire after the walls had roared down after ceilings had collapsed upon her and flame had lived all about her his shoes smoked as he pushed through piles of fuming litter it could have seared his feet off at the ankles he wouldnt have known molly he bent over her she didnt move or hear him and she didnt speak she wasnt dead she wasnt alive she just lay there with the fire surrounding her and not touching her not harming her in any way her cotton nightgown was streaked with ashes but not burnt her brown hair was pillowed on a tumble of redhot coals he touched her cheek and it was cold cold in the middle of hell tiny breaths trembled her halfsmiling lips the children were there too behind a veil of smoke he made out two smaller figures huddled in the ashes sleeping he carried all three of them out to the edge of the wheat field molly molly wake up kids kids wake up they breathed and didnt move and went on sleeping kids wake up your mother is dead no not dead but he shook the kids as if they were to blame they paid no attention they were busy with their dreams he put them back down and stood over them his face cut with lines he knew why theyd slept through the fire and continued to sleep now he knew why molly just lay there never wanting to laugh again the power of the wheat and the scythe their lives supposed to end yesterday may th had been prolonged simply because he refused to cut the grain they should have died in the fire thats the way it was meant to be but since he had not used the scythe nothing could hurt them a house had flamed and fallen and still they lived caught halfway not dead not alive simplywaiting and all over the world thousands more just like them victims of accidents fires disease suicide waited slept just like molly and her children slept not able to die not able to live all because a man was afraid of harvesting the ripe grain all because one man thought he could stop working with a scythe and never work with that scythe again he looked down upon the children the job had to be done every day and every day with never a stopping but going on with never a pause but always the harvesting forever and forever and forever all right he thought all right ill use the scythe he didnt say goodby to his family he turned with a slowfeeding anger and found the scythe and walked rapidly then he began to trot then he ran with long jolting strides into the field raving feeling the hunger in his arms as the wheat whipped and flailed his legs he pounded through it shouting he stopped molly he cried and raised the blade and swung it down susie he cried drew and swung the blade down again somebody screamed he didnt turn to look at the fireruined house and then sobbing wildly he rose above the grain again and again and hewed to left and right and to left and to right and to left and to right over and over and over slicing out huge scars in green wheat and ripe wheat with no selection and no care cursing over and over swearing laughing the blade swinging up in the sun and falling in the sun with a singing whistle down bombs shattered london moscow tokyo the blade swung insanely and the kilns of belsen and buchenwald took fire the blade sang crimson wet and mushrooms vomited out blind suns at white sands hiroshima bikini and up through and in continental siberian skies the grain wept in a green rain falling korea indochina egypt india trembled asia stirred africa woke in the night and the blade went on rising crashing severing with the fury and the rage of a man who has lost and lost so much that he no longer cares what he does to the world just a few short miles off the main highway down a rough dirt road that leads to nowhere just a few short miles from a highway jammed with traffic bound for california once in a while during the long years a jalopy gets off the main highway pulls up steaming in front of the charred ruin of a little white house at the end of the dirt road to ask instructions from the farmer they see just beyond the one who works insanely wildly without ever stopping night and day in the endless fields of wheat but they get no help and no answer the farmer in the field is too busy even after all these years too busy slashing and chopping the green wheat instead of the ripe and drew erickson moves on with his scythe with the light of blind suns and a look of white fire in his neversleeping eyes on and on and on uncle einar it will take only a minute said uncle einars sweet wife i refuse he said and that takes but a second ive worked all morning she said holding to her slender back and you wont help its drumming for a rain let it rain he cried morosely ill not be pierced by lightning just to air your clothes but youre so quick at it again i refuse his vast tarpaulin wings hummed nervously behind his indignant back she gave him a slender rope on which were tied four dozen freshwashed clothes he turned it in his fingers with distaste so its come to this he muttered bitterly to this to this to this he almost wept angry and acid tears dont cry youll wet them down again she said jump up now run them about run them about his voice was hollow deep and terribly wounded i say let it thunder let it pour if it was a nice sunny day i wouldnt ask she said reasonably all my washing gone for nothing if you dont theyll hang about the house that did it above all he hated clothes flagged and festooned so a man had to creep under on the way across a room he jumped up his vast green wings boomed only so far as the pasture fence whirl up he jumped his wings chewed and loved the cool air before youd say uncle einar has green wings he sailed low across his farmland trailing the clothes in a vast fluttering loop through the pounding concussion and backwash of his wings catch back from the trip he sailed the clothes dry as popcorn down on a series of clean blankets shed spread for their landing thank you she cried gahh he shouted and flew off under the apple tree to brood uncle einars beautiful silklike wings hung like seagreen sails behind him and whirred and whispered from his shoulders when he sneezed or turned swiftly he was one of the few in the family whose talent was visible all his dark cousins and nephews and brothers hid in small towns across the world did unseen mental things or things with witchfingers and white teeth or blew down the sky like fireleaves or loped in forests like moonsilvered wolves they lived comparatively safe from normal humans not so a man with great green wings not that he hated his wings far from it in his youth hed always flown nights because nights were rare times for winged men daylight held dangers always had always would but nights ah nights he had sailed over islands of cloud and seas of summer sky with no danger to himself it had been a rich full soaring an exhilaration but now he could not fly at night on his way home to some high mountain pass in europe after a homecoming among family members in mellin town illinois he had drunk too much rich crimson wine ill be all right he had told himself vaguely as he beat his long way under the morning stars over the moondreaming country hills beyond mellin town and thencrack out of the sky a hightension tower like a netted duck a great sizzle his face blown black by a blue sparkler of wire he fended off the electricity with a terrific backjumping percussion of his wings and fell his hitting the moonlit meadow under the tower made a noise like a large telephone book dropped from the sky early the next morning his dewsodden wings shaking violently he stood up it was still dark there was a faint bandage of dawn stretched across the east soon the bandage would stain and all flight would be restricted there was nothing to do but take refuge in the forest and wait out the day in the deepest thicket until another night gave his wings a hidden motion in the sky in this fashion he met his wife during the day which was warm for november first in illinois country pretty young brunilla wexley was out to udder a lost cow for she carried a silver pail in one hand as she sidled through thickets and pleaded cleverly to the unseen cow to please return home or burst her gut with unplucked milk the fact that the cow would have most certainly come home when her teats needed pulling did not concern brunilla wexley it was a sweet excuse for forestjourneying thistleblowing and flower chewing all of which brunilla was doing as she stumbled upon uncle einar asleep near a bush he seemed a man under a green shelter oh said brunilla with a fever a man in a camptent uncle einar awoke the camptent spread like a large green fan behind him oh said brunilla the cowsearcher a man with wings that was how she took it she was startled yes but she had never been hurt in her life so she wasnt afraid of anyone and it was a fancy thing to see a winged man and she was proud to meet him she began to talk in an hour they were old friends and in two hours shed quite forgotten his wings were there and he somehow confessed how he happened to be in this wood yes i noticed you looked banged around she said that right wing looks very bad youd best let me take you home and fix it you wont be able to fly all the way to europe on it anyway and who wants to live in europe these days he thanked her but he didnt quite see how he could accept but i live alone she said for as you see im quite ugly he insisted she was not how kind of you she said but i am theres no fooling myself my folks are dead ive a farm a big one all to myself quite far from mellin town and im in need of talking company but wasnt she afraid of him he asked proud and jealous would be more near it she said may i and she stroked his large green membraned veils with careful envy he shuddered at the touch and put his tongue between his teeth so there was nothing for it but that he come to her house for medicaments and ointments and my what a burn across his face beneath his eyes lucky you werent blinded she said howd it happen well he said and they were at her farm hardly noticing theyd walked a mile looking at each other a day passed and another and he thanked her at her door and said he must be going he much appreciated the ointment the care the lodging it was twilight and between now six oclock and five the next morning he must cross an ocean and a continent thank you goodby he said and started to fly off in the dusk and crashed right into a maple tree oh she screamed and ran to his unconscious body when he waked the next hour he knew hed fly no more in the dark again ever his delicate nightperception was gone the winged telepathy that had warned him where towers trees houses and hills stood across his path the fine clear vision and sensibility that guided him through mazes of forest cliff and cloud all were burnt forever by that strike across his face that blue electric fry and sizzle how he moaned softly how can i go to europe if i flew by day id be seen andmiserable jokemaybe shot down or kept for a zoo perhaps what a life thatd be brunilla tell me what shall i do oh she whispered looking at her hands well think of something they were married the family came for the wedding in a great autumnal avalanche of maple sycamore oak elm leaf they hissed and rustled fell in a shower of horsechestnut thumped like winter apples on the earth with an overall scent of farewellsummer on the wind they made in their rushing the ceremony the ceremony was brief as a black candle lit blown out and smoke left still on the air its briefness darkness upsidedown and backward quality escaped brunilla who only listened to the great tide of uncle einars wings faintly murmuring above them as they finished out the rite and as for uncle einar the wound across his nose was almost healed and holding brunillas arm he felt europe grow faint and melt away in the distance he didnt have to see very well to fly straight up or come straight down it was only natural that on this night of their wedding he take brunilla in his arms and fly right up into the sky a farmer five miles over glanced at a low cloud at midnight saw faint glows and crackles heat lightning he observed and went to bed they didnt come down till morning with the dew the marriage took she had only to look at him and it lifted her to think she was the only woman in the world married to a winged man who else could say it she asked her mirror and the answer was no one he on the other hand found great beauty behind her face great kindness and understanding he made some changes in his diet to fit her thinking and was careful with his wings about the house knocked porcelains and broken lamps were nervescrapers he stayed away from them he changed his sleeping habits since he couldnt fly nights now anyhow and she in turn fixed chairs so they were comfortable for his wings put extra padding here or took it out there and the things she said were the things he loved her for were in our cocoons all of us see how ugly i am she said but one day ill break out spread wings as fine and handsome as you you broke out long ago he said she thought it over yes she had to admit i know just which day it was too in the woods when i looked for a cow and found a tent they laughed and with him holding her she felt so beautiful she knew their marriage had slipped her from her ugliness like a bright sword from its case they had children at first there was fear all on his part that theyd be winged nonsense id love it she said keep them out from under foot then he exclaimed theyd be in your hair ow she cried four children were born three boys and a girl who for their energy seemed to have wings they popped up like toadstools in a few years and on hot summer days asked their father to sit under the apple tree and fan them with his cooling wings and tell them wild starlit tales of island clouds and ocean skies and textures of mist and wind and how a star tastes melting in your mouth and how to drink cold mountain air and how it feels to be a pebble dropped from mt everest turning to a green bloom flowering your wings just before you strike bottom this was his marriage and today six years later here sat uncle einar here he was festering under the apple tree grown impatient and unkind not because this was his desire but because after the long wait he was still unable to fly the wild night sky his extra sense had never returned here he sat despondently nothing more than a summer sunparasol green and discarded abandoned for the season by the reckless vacationers who once sought the refuge of its translucent shadow was he to sit here forever afraid to fly by day because someone might see him was his only flight to be as a drier of clothes for his wife or a fanner of children on hot august noons his one occupation had always been flying family errands quicker than storms a boomerang hed whickled over hills and valleys and like a thistle landed he had always had money the family had good use for their winged man but now bitterness his wings jittered and whisked the air and made a captive thunder papa said little meg the children stood looking at his thoughtdark face papa said ronald make more thunder its a cold march day therell soon be rain and plenty of thunder said uncle einar will you come watch us asked michael run on run on let papa brood he was shut of love the children of love and the love of children he thought only of heavens skies horizons infinities by night or day lit by star moon or sun cloudy or clear but always it was skies and heavens and horizons that ran ahead of you forever when you soared yet here he was sculling the pasture kept low for fear of being seen misery in a deep well papa come watch us its march cried meg and were going to the hill with all the kids from town uncle einar grunted what hill is that the kite hill of course they all sang together now he looked at them each held a large paper kite their faces sweating with anticipation and an animal glowing in their small fingers were balls of white twine from the kites colored red and blue and yellow and green hung caudal appendages of cotton and silk strips well fly our kites said ronald wont you come no he said sadly i mustnt be seen by anyone or thered be trouble you could hide and watch from the woods said meg we made the kites ourselves just because we know how how do you know youre our father was the instant cry thats why he looked at his children for a long while he sighed a kite festival is it yes sir im going to win said meg no im michael contradicted me me piped stephen god up the chimney roared uncle einar leaping high with a deafening kettledrum of wings children children i love you dearly father whats wrong said michael backing off nothing nothing nothing chanted einar he flexed his wings to their greatest propulsion and plundering whoom they slammed like cymbals the children fell flat in the backwash i have it i have it im free again fire in the flue feather on the wind brunilla einar called to the house his wife appeared im free he called flushed and tall on his toes listen brunilla i dont need the night any more i can fly by day i dont need the night ill fly every day and any day of the year from now onbut god i waste time talking look and as the worried members of his family watched he seized the cotton tail from one of the little kites tied it to his belt behind grabbed the twine ball held one end in his teeth gave the other end to his children and up up into the air he flew away into the march wind and across the meadows and over the farms his children ran letting out string to the daylit sky bubbling and stumbling and brunilla stood back in the farmyard and waved and laughed to see what was happening and her children marched to the far kite hill and stood the four of them holding the twine in their eager proud fingers each tugging and directing and pulling and the children from mellin town came running with their small kites to let up on the wind and they saw the great green kite leap and hover in the sky and exclaimed oh oh what a kite what a kite oh i wish id a kite like that where where did you get it our father made it cried meg and michael and stephen and ronald and gave an exultant pull on the twine and the humming thundering kite in the sky dipped and soared and made a great and magical exclamation mark across a cloud the wind the phone rang at fivethirty that evening it was december and long since dark as thompson picked up the phone hello hello herb oh its you allin is your wife home herb sure why damn it herb thompson held the receiver quietly whats up you sound funny i wanted you to come over

storms and hurricanes get another chapter done on your next travel book i might do that maybe i will i dont know maybe i will i might do that thanks a lot for letting me bother you thanks hell get off the line now you my wifes calling me to dinner herb thompson hung up he went and sat down at the supper table and his wife sat across from him was that allin she asked he nodded him and his winds that blow up and winds that blow down and winds that blow hot and blow cold she said handing him his plate heaped with food he did have a time in the himalayas during the war said herb thompson you dont believe what he said about that valley do you it makes a good story climbing around climbing up things why do men climb mountains and scare themselves it was snowing said herb thompson was it and raining and hailing and blowing all at once in that valley allins told me a dozen times he tells it well he was up pretty high clouds and all the valley made a noise i bet it did she said like a lot of winds instead of just one winds from all over the world he took a bite so says allin he shouldnt have gone there and looked in the first place she said you go poking around and first thing you know you get ideas winds start getting angry at you for intruding and they follow you dont joke hes my best friend snapped herb thompson its all so silly nevertheless hes been through a lot that storm in bombay later and the typhoon off new guinea two months after that and that time in cornwall i have no sympathy for a man who continually runs into wind storms and hurricanes and then gets a persecution complex because of it the phone rang just then dont answer it she said maybe its important its only allin again they sat there and the phone rang nine times and they didnt answer finally it quieted they finished dinner out in the kitchen the window curtains gently moved in the small breeze from a slightly opened window the phone rang again i cant let it ring he said and answered it oh hello allin herb its here it got here youre too near the phone back up a little i stood in the open door and waited for it i saw it coming down the highway shaking all the trees one by one until it shook the trees just outside the house and it dived down toward the door and i slammed the door in its face thompson didnt say anything he couldnt think of anything to say his wife was watching him in the hail door how interesting he said at last its all around the house herb i cant get out now i cant do anything but i fooled it i let it think it had me and just as it came down to get me i slammed and locked the door i was ready for it ive been getting ready for weeks have you now tell me about it allin old man herb thompson played it jovially into the phone while his wife looked on and his neck began to sweat it began six weeks ago oh yes well well i thought i had it licked i thought it had given up following and trying to get me but it was just waiting six weeks ago i heard the wind laughing and whispering around the corners of my house out here just for an hour or so not very long not very loud then it went away thompson nodded into the phone glad to hear it glad to hear it his wife stared at him it came back the next night it slammed the shutters and kicked sparks out of the chimney it came back five nights in a row a little stronger each time when i opened the front door it came in at me and tried to pull me out but it wasnt strong enough tonight it is glad to hear youre feeling better said thompson im not better whats wrong with you is your wife listening to us yes oh i see i know i sound like a fool not at all go on thompsons wife went back into the kitchen he relaxed he sat down on a little chair near the phone go on allin get it out of you youll sleep better its all around the house now like a great big vacuum machine nuzzling at all the gables its knocking the trees around thats funny theres no wind here allin of course not it doesnt care about you only about me i guess thats one way to explain it its a killer herb the biggest damnedest prehistoric killer that ever hunted prey a big sniffling hound trying to smell me out find me it pushes its big cold nose up to the house taking air and when it finds me in the parlor it drives its pressure there and when im in the kitchen it goes there its trying to get in the windows now but i had them reinforced and i put new hinges on the doors and bolts its a strong house they built them strong in the old days ive got all the lights in the house on now the house is all lighted up bright the wind followed me from room to room looking through all the windows when i switched them on oh whats wrong it just snatched off the front screen door i wish youd come over here and spend the night allin i cant god i cant leave the house i cant do anything i know this wind lord its big and its clever i tried to light a cigarette a moment ago and a little draft sucked the match out the wind likes to play games it likes to taunt me its taking its time with me its got all night and now god right now one of my old travel books on the library table i wish you could see it a little breeze from god knows what small hole in the house the little breeze is blowing the pages one by one i wish you could see it theres my introduction do you remember the introduction to my book on tibet herb yes this book is dedicated to those who lost the game of elements written by one who has seen but who has always escaped yes i remember the lights have gone out the phone crackled the power lines just went down are you there herb i still hear you the wind doesnt like all that light in my house it tore the power lines down the telephone will probably go next oh its a real party me and the wind i tell you just a second allin a silence herb leaned against the mouthpiece his wife glanced in from the kitchen herb thompson waited allin im back said the voice on the phone there was a draft from the door and i shoved some wadding under it to keep it from blowing on my feet im glad you didnt come out after all herb i wouldnt want you in this mess there it just broke one of the livingroom windows and a regular gale is in the house knocking pictures off the wall do you hear it herb thompson listened there was a wild sirening on the phone and a whistling and banging allin shouted over it do you hear it herb thompson swallowed drily i hear it it wants me alive herb it doesnt dare knock the house down in one fell blow thatd kill me it wants me alive so it can pull me apart finger by finger it wants whats inside me my mind my brain it wants my lifepower my psychic force my ego it wants intellect my wifes calling me allin i have to go wipe the dishes its a big cloud of vapors winds from all over the world the same wind that ripped the celebes a year ago the same pampero that killed in argentina the typhoon that fed on hawaii the hurricane that knocked the coast of africa early this year its part of all those storms i escaped it followed me from the himalayas because it didnt want me to know what i know about the valley of the winds where it gathers and plans its destruction something a long time ago gave it a start in the direction of life i know its feeding grounds i know where it is born and where parts of it expire for that reason it hates me and my books that tell how to defeat it it doesnt want me preaching any more it wants to incorporate me into its huge body to give it knowledge it wants me on its own side i have to hang up allin my wife what a pause the blowing of the wind in the phone distantly what did you say call me back in an hour allin he hung up he went out to wipe the dishes his wife looked at him and he looked at the dishes rubbing them with a towel whats it like out tonight he said nice not very chilly stars she said why nothing the phone rang three times in the next hour at eight oclock the company arrived stoddard and his wife they sat around until eightthirty talking and then got out and set up the card table and began to play gin herb thompson shuffled the cards over and over with a clittering shuttering effect and clapped them out one at a time before the three other players talk went back and forth he lit a cigar and made it into a fine gray ash at the tip and adjusted his cards in his hand and on occasion lifted his head and listened there was no sound outside the house his wife saw him do this and he cut it out immediately and discarded a jack of clubs he puffed slowly on his cigar and they all talked quietly with occasional small eruptions of laughter and the clock in the hall sweetly chimed nine oclock here we all are said herb thompson taking his cigar out and looking at it reflectively and life is sure funny eh said mr stoddard nothing except herз we are living our lives and some place else on earth a billion other people live their lives thats a rather obvious statement life he put his cigar back in his lips is a lonely thing even with married people sometimes when youre in a persons arms you feel a million miles away from them i like that said his wife i didnt mean it that way he explained not with haste because he felt no guilt he took his time i mean we all believe what we believe and live our own little lives while other people live entirely different ones i mean we sit here in this room while a thousand people are dying some of cancer some of pneumonia some of tuberculosis i imagine someone in the united states is dying right now in a wrecked car this isnt very stimulating conversation said his wife i mean to say we all live and dont think about how other people think or live their lives or die we wait until death comes to us what i mean is here we sit on our selfassured buttbones while thirty miles away in a big old house completely surrounded by night and godknowswhat one of the finest guys who ever lived is herb he puffed and chewed on his cigar and stared blindly at his cards sorry he blinked rapidly and bit his cigar is it my turn its your turn the playing went around the table with a flittering of cards murmurs conversation herb thompson sank lower into his chair and began to look ill the phone rang thompson jumped and ran to it and jerked it off the hook herb ive been calling and calling whats it like at your house herb what do you mean whats it like has the company come hell yes it has are you talking and laughing and playing cards christ yes but what has that got to do with are you smoking your tencent cigar god damn it yes but swell said the voice on the phone that sure is swell i wish i could be there i wish i didnt know the things i know i wish lots of things are you all right so far so good im locked in the kitchen now part of the front wall of the house blew in but i planned my retreat when the kitchen door gives im heading for the cellar if im lucky i may hold out there until morning itll have to tear the whole damned house down to get to me and the cellar floor is pretty solid i have a shovel and i may digdeeper it sounded like a lot of other voices on the phone whats that herb thompson demanded cold shivering that asked the voice on the phone those are the voices of twelve thousand killed in a typhoon seven thousand killed by a hurricane three thousand buried by a cyclone am i boring you thats what the wind is its a lot of people dead the wind killed them took their minds to give itself intelligence it took all their voices and made them into one voice all those millions of people killed in the past ten thousand years tortured and run from continent to continent on the backs and in the bellies of monsoons and whirlwinds oh christ what a poem you could write about it the phone echoed and rang with voices and shouts and whinings come on back herb called his wife from the card table thats how the wind gets more intelligent each year it adds to itself body by body life by life death by death were waiting for you herb called his wife damn it he turned almost snarling wait just a moment wont you back to the phone allin if you want me to come out there now i will i should have come earlier wouldnt think of it this is a grudge fight wouldnt do to have you in it now id better hang up the kitchen door looks bad ill have to get in the cellar call me back later maybe if im lucky i dont think ill make it i slipped away and escaped so many times but i think it has me now i hope i havent bothered you too much herb you havent bothered anyone damn it call me back ill try herb thompson went back to the card game his wife glared at him hows allin your friend she asked is he sober hes never taken a drink in his life said thompson sullenly sitting down i should have gone out there hours ago but hes called every night for six weeks and youve been out there at least ten nights to stay with him and nothing was wrong he needs help he might hurt himself you were just out there two nights ago you cant always be running after him first thing in the morning ill move him into a sanatorium didnt want to he seems so reasonable otherwise at tenthirty coffee was served herb thompson drank his slowly looking at the phone i wonder if hes in the cellar now he thought herb thompson walked to the phone called longdistance gave the number im sorry said the operator the lines are down in that district when the lines are repaired we will put your call through then the telephone lines are down cried thompson he let the phone drop turning he slammed open the closet door pulled out his coat oh lord he said oh lord lord he said to his amazed guests and his wife with the coffee urn in her hand herb she cried ive got to get out there he said slipping into his coat there was a soft faint stirring at the door everybody in the room tensed and straightened up who could that be asked his wife the soft stirring was repeated very quietly thompson hurried down the hall where he stopped alert outside faintly he heard laughter ill be damned said thompson he put his hand on the doorknob pleasantly shocked and relieved id know that laugh anywhere its allin he came on over in his car after all couldnt wait until morning to tell me his confounded stories thompson smiled weakly probably brought some friends with him sounds like a lot of other he opened the front door the porch was empty thompson showed no surprise his face grew amused and sly he laughed allin none of your tricks now come on he switched on the porchlight and peered out and around where are you allin come on now a breeze blew into his face thompson waited a moment suddenly chilled to his marrow he stepped out on the porch and looked uneasily and very carefully about a sudden wind caught and whipped his coat flaps disheveled his hair he thought he heard laughter again the wind rounded the house and was a pressure everywhere at once and then storming for a full minute passed on the wind died down sad mourning in the high trees passing away going back out to the sea to the celebes to the ivory coast to sumatra and cape horn to cornwall and the philippines fading fading fading thompson stood there cold he went in and closed the door and leaned against it and didnt move eyes closed whats wrong asked his wife the man upstairs he remembered how carefully and expertly grandmother would fondle the cold cut guts of the chicken and withdraw the marvels therein the wet shining loops of meat smelling intestine the muscled lump of heart the gizzard with the collection of seeds in it how neatly and nicely grandma would slit the chicken and push her fat little hand in to deprive it of its medals these would be segregated some in pans of water others in paper to be thrown to the dog later perhaps and then the ritual of taxidermy stuffing the bird with watered seasoned bread and performing surgery with a swift bright needle stitch after pulledtight stitch this was one of the prime thrills of douglass elevenyearold life span altogether he counted twenty knives in the various squeaking drawers of the magic kitchen table from which grandma a kindly gentlefaced whitehaired old witch drew paraphernalia for her miracles douglas was to be quiet he could stand across the table from grandmama his freckled nose tucked over the edge watching hut any loose boytalk might interfere with the spell it was a wonder when grandma brandished silver shakers over the bird supposedly sprinkling showers of mummydust and pulverized indian bones muttering mystical verses under her toothless breath grammy said douglas at last breaking the silence am i like that inside he pointed at the chicken yes said grandma a little more orderly and presentable but just about the same and more of it added douglas proud of his guts yes said grandma more of it grandpa has lots moren me his sticks out in front so he can rest his elbows on it grandma laughed and shook her head douglas said and lucie williams down the street she hush child cried grandma but shes got never you mind what shes got thats different but why is she different a darningneedle dragonfly is coming by some day and sew up your mouth said grandma firmly douglas waited then asked how do you know ive got insides like that grandma oh go way now the front doorbell rang through the frontdoor glass as he ran down the hall douglas saw a straw hat the bell jangled again and again douglas opened the door good morning child is the landlady at home cold gray eyes in a long smooth walnutcolored face gazed upon douglas the man was tall thin and carried a suitcase a briefcase an umbrella under one bent arm gloves rich and thick and gray on his thin fingers and wore a horribly new straw hat douglas backed up shes busy i wish to rent her upstairs room as advertised weve got ten boarders and its already rented go away douglas grandma was behind him suddenly how do you do she said to the stranger never mind this child unsmiling the man stepped stiffly in douglas watched them ascend out of sight up the stairs heard grandma detailing the conveniences of the upstairs room soon she hurried down to pile linens from the linen closet on douglas and send him scooting up with them douglas paused at the rooms threshold the room was changed oddly simply because the stranger had been in it a moment the straw hat lay brittle and terrible upon the bed the umbrella leaned stiff against one wall like a dead bat with dark wings folded douglas blinked at the umbrella the stranger stood in the center of the changed room tall tall here douglas littered the bed with supplies we eat at noon sharp and if youre late coming down the soupll get cold grandma fixes it so it will every time the tall strange man counted out ten new copper pennies and tinkled them in douglas blouse pocket we shall be friends he said grimly it was funny the man having nothing but pennies lots of them no silver at all no dimes no quarters just new copper pennies douglas thanked him glumly ill drop these in my dime bank when i get them changed into a dime i got six dollars and fifty cents in dimes all ready for my camp trip in august i must wash now said the tall strange man once at midnight douglas had wakened to hear a storm rumbling outsidethe cold hard wind shaking the house the rain driving against the window and then a lightning bolt had landed outside the window with a silent terrific concussion he remembered that fear of looking about at his room seeing it strange and awful in the instantaneous light so it was now in this room he stood looking up at the stranger this room was no longer the same but changed indefinably because this man quick as a lightning bolt had shed his light about it douglas backed up slowly as the stranger advanced the door closed in his face the wooden fork went up with mashed potatoes came down empty mr koberman for that was his name had brought the wooden fork and wooden knife and spoon with him when grandma called lunch mrs spaulding he said quietly my own cutlery please use it i will have lunch today but from tomorrow on only breakfast and supper grandma bustled in and out bearing steaming tureens of soup and beans and mashed potatoes to impress her new boarder while douglas sat rattling his silverware on his plate because he had discovered it irritated mr koberman i know a trick said douglas watch he picked a forktine with his fingernail he pointed at various sectors of the table like a magician wherever he pointed the sound of the vibrating forktine emerged like a metal elfin voice simply done of course he pressed the fork handle on the tabletop secretly the vibration came from the wood like a sounding board it looked quite magical there there and there exclaimed douglas happily plucking the fork again he pointed at mr kobermans soup and the noise came from it mr kobermans walnutcolored face became hard and firm and awful he pushed the soup bowl away violently his lips twisting he fell back in his chair grandma appeared why whats wrong mr koberman i cannot eat this soup why because i am full and can eat no more thank you mr koberman left the room glaring what did you do just then asked grandma at douglas sharply nothing grandma why does he eat with wooden spoons yours not to question when do you go back to school anyway seven weeks oh my land said grandma mr koberman worked nights each morning at eight he arrived mysteriously home devoured a very small breakfast and then slept soundlessly in his room all through the dreaming hot daytime until the huge supper with all the other boarders at night mr kobermans sleeping habits made it necessary for douglas to be quiet this was unbearable so whenever grandma visited down the street douglas stomped up and down stairs beating a drum bouncing golf balls or just screaming for three minutes outside mr kobermans door or flushing the toilet seven times in succession mr koberman never moved his room was silent dark he did not complain there was no sound he slept on and on it was very strange douglas felt a pure white flame of hatred burn inside himself with a steady unflickering beauty now that room was koberman land once it had been flowery bright when miss sadlowe lived there now it was stark bare cold clean everything in its place alien and brittle douglas climbed upstairs on the fourth morning halfway to the second floor was a large sunfilled window framed by sixinch panes of orange purple blue red and burgundy glass in the enchanted early mornings when the sun fell through to strike the landing and slide down the stair banister douglas stood entranced at this window peering at the world through the multicolored windows now a blue world a blue sky blue people blue streetcars and blue trotting dogs he shifted panes nowan amber world two lemonish women glided by resembling the daughters of fu manchu douglas giggled this pane made even the sunlight more purely golden it was eight am mr koberman strolled by below on the sidewalk returning from his nights work his cane looped over his elbow straw hat glued to his head with patent oil douglas shifted panes again mr koberman was a red man walking through a red world with red trees and red flowers and something else something aboutmr koberman douglas squinted the red glass did things to mr koberman his face his suit his hands the clothes seemed to melt away douglas almost believed for one terrible instant that he could see inside mr koberman and what he saw made him lean wildly against the small red pane blinking mr koberman glanced up just then saw douglas and raised his caneumbrella angrily as if to strike he ran swiftly across the red lawn to the front door young man he cried running up the stairs what were you doing just looking said douglas numbly thats all is it cried mr koberman yes sir i look through all the glasses all kinds of worlds blue ones red ones yellow ones all different all kinds of worlds is it mr koberman glanced at the little panes of glass his face pale he got hold of himself he wiped his face with a handkerchief and pretended to laugh yes all kinds of worlds all different he walked to the door of his room go right ahead play he said the door closed the hall was empty mr koberman had gone in douglas shrugged and found a new pane oh everythings violet half an hour later while playing in his sandbox behind the house douglas heard the crash and the shattering tinkle he leaped up a moment later grandma appeared on the back porch the old razor strop trembling in her hand douglas i told you time and again never fling your basketball against the house oh i could just cry i been sitting right here he protested come see what youve done you nasty boy the great colored window panes lay shattered in a rainbow chaos on the upstairs landing his basketball lay in the ruins before he could even begin telling his innocence douglas was struck a dozen stinging blows upon his rump wherever he landed screaming the razor strop struck again later hiding his mind in the sandpile like an ostrich douglas nursed his dreadful pains he knew whod thrown that basketball a man with a straw hat and a stiff umbrella and a cold gray room yeah yeah yeah he dribbled tears just wait just wait he heard grandma sweeping up the broken glass she brought it out and threw it in the trash bin blue pink yellow meteors of glass dropped brightly down when she was gone douglas dragged himself whimpering over to save out three pieces of the incredible glass mr koberman disliked the colored windows thesehe clinked them in his fingers would be worth saving grandfather arrived from his newspaper office each night shortly ahead of the other boarders at five oclock when a slow heavy tread filled the hall and a thick mahogany cane thumped in the canerack douglas ran to embrace the large stomach and sit on grandpas knee while he read the evening paper hi grampa hello down there grandma cut chickens again today its fun watching said douglas grandpa kept reading thats twice this week chickens shes the chickenist woman you like to watch her cut em eh coldblooded little pepper ha im just curious you are rumbled grandpa scowling remember that day when that young lady was killed at the rail station you just walked over and looked at her blood and all he laughed queer duck stay that way fear nothing ever in your life i guess you get it from your father him being a military man and all and you so close to him before you came here to live last year grandpa returned to his paper a long pause gramps yes what if a man didnt have a heart or lungs or stomach but still walked around alive that rumbled gramps would be a miracle i dont mean aa miracle i mean what if he was all different inside not like me well he wouldnt be quite human then would he boy guess not gramps gramps you got a heart and lungs gramps chuckled well tell the truth i dont know never seen them never had an xray never been to a doctor might as well be potatosolid for all i know have i got a stomach you certainly have cried grandma from the parlor entry cause i feed it and youve lungs you scream loud enough to wake the crumblees and youve dirty hands go wash them dinners ready grandpa come on douglas git in the rush of boarders streaming downstairs grandpa if he intended questioning douglas further about the weird conversation lost his opportunity if dinner delayed an instant more grandma and the potatoes would develop simultaneous lumps the boarders laughing and talking at the tablemr koberman silent and sullen among themwere silenced when grandfather cleared his throat he talked politics a few minutes and then shifted over into the intriguing topic of the recent peculiar deaths in the town its enough to make an old newspaper editor prick up his ears he said eying them all that young miss larson lived across the ravine now found her dead three days ago for no reason just funny kinds of tattoos all over her and a facial expression that would make dante cringe and that other young lady what was her name whitely she disappeared and never did come back them things happen alla time said mr britz the garage mechanic chewing ever peek inna missing peoples bureau file its that long he illustrated cant tell what happens to most of em anyone want more dressing grandma ladled liberal portions from the chickens interior douglas watched thinking about how that chicken had had two kinds of gutsgodmade and manmade well how about three kinds of guts eh why not conversation continued about the mysterious death of soandso and oh yes remember a week ago marion barsumian died of heart failure but maybe that didnt connect up or did it youre crazy forget it why talk about it at the dinner table so never can tell said mr britz maybe we got a vampire in town mr koberman stopped eating in the year said grandma a vampire oh go on now sure said mr britz kill em with silver bullets anything silver for that matter vampires hate silver i read it in a book somewhere once sure i did douglas looked at mr koberman who ate with wooden knives and forks and carried only new copper pennies in his pocket its poor judgment said grandpa to call anything by a name we dont know what a hobgoblin or a vampire or a troll is could be lots of things you cant heave them into categories with labels and say theyll act one way or another thatd be silly theyre people people who do things yes thats the way to put it people who do things excuse me said mr koberman who got up and went out for his evening walk to work the stars the moon the wind the clock ticking and the chiming of the hours into dawn the sun rising and here it was another morning another day and mr koberman coming along the sidewalk from his nights work douglas stood off like a small mechanism whirring and watching with carefully microscopic eyes at noon grandma went to the store to buy groceries as was his custom every day when grandma was gone douglas yelled outside mr kobermans door for a full three minutes as usual there was no response the silence was horrible he ran downstairs got the passkey a silver fork and the three pieces of colored glass he had saved from the shattered window he fitted the key to the lock and swung the door slowly open the room was in half light the shades drawn mr koberman lay atop his bedcovers in slumber clothes breathing gently up and down he didnt move his face was motionless hello mr koberman the colorless walls echoed the mans regular breathing mr koberman hello bouncing a golf ball douglas advanced he yelled still no answer mr koberman bending over mr koberman douglas picked the tines of the silver fork in the sleeping mans face mr koberman winced he twisted he groaned bitterly response good swell douglas drew a piece of blue glass from his pocket looking through the blue glass fragment he found himself in a blue room in a blue world different from the world he knew as different as was the red world blue furniture blue bed blue ceiling and walls blue wooden eating utensils atop the blue bureau and the sullen dark blue of mr kobermans face and arms and his blue chest rising falling also mr kohermans eyes were wide staring at him with a hungry darkness douglas felt back pulled the blue glass from his eyes mr kobermans eyes were shut blue glass againopen blue glass awayshut blue glass againopen awayshut funny douglas experimented trembling through the glass the eyes seemed to peer hungrily avidly through mr kobermans closed lids without the blue glass they seemed tightly shut but it was the rest of mr kobermans body mr kobermans bedclothes dissolved off him the blue glass had something to do with it or perhaps it was the clothes themselves just being on mr koberman douglas cried out he was looking through the wall of mr kobermans stomach right inside him mr koberman was solid or nearly so anyway there were strange shapes and sizes within him douglas must have stood amazed for five minutes thinking about the blue worlds the red worlds the yellow worlds side by side living together like glass panes around the big white stair window side by side the colored panes the different worlds mr koberman had said so himself so this was why the colored window had been broken mr koberman wake up no answer mr koberman where do you work at night mr koberman where do you work a little breeze stirred the blue window shade in a red world or a green world or a yellow one mr koberman over everything was a blue glass silence wait there said douglas he walked down to the kitchen pulled open the great squeaking drawer and picked out the sharpest biggest knife very calmly he walked into the hall climbed back up the stairs again opened the door to mr kobermans room went in and closed it holding the sharp knife in one hand grandma was busy fingering a piecrust into a pan when douglas entered the kitchen to place something on the table grandma whats this she glanced up briefly over her glasses i dont know it was square like a box and elastic it was bright orange in color it had four square tubes colored blue attached to it it smelled funny ever see anything like it grandma no thats what i thought douglas left it there went from the kitchen five minutes later he returned with something else how about this he laid down a bright pink linked chain with a purple triangle at one end dont bother me said grandma its only a chain next time he returned with two hands full a ring a square a triangle a pyramid a rectangle andother shapes all of them were pliable resilient and looked as if they were made of gelatin this isnt all said douglas putting them down theres more where this came from grandma said yes yes in a faroff tone very busy you were wrong grandma about what about all people being the same inside stop talking nonsense wheres my piggybank on the mantel where you left it thanks he tromped into the parlor reached up for his piggybank grandpa came home from the office at five grandpa come upstairs sure son why something to show you its not nice but its interesting grandpa chuckled following his grandsons feet up to mr kobermans room grandma mustnt know about this she wouldnt like it said douglas he pushed the door wide open there grandfather gasped douglas remembered the next few hours all the rest of his life standing over mr kobermans naked body the coroner and his assistants grandma downstairs asking somebody whats going on up there and grandpa saying shakily ill take douglas away on a long vacation so he can forget this whole ghastly affair ghastly ghastly affair douglas said why should it be bad i dont see anything bad i dont feel bad the coroner shivered and said kobermans dead all right his assistant sweated did you see those things in the pans of water and in the wrapping paper oh my god my god yes i saw them christ the coroner bent over mr kobermans body again this better be kept secret boys it wasnt murder it was a mercy the boy acted god knows what might have happened if he hadnt what was koberman a vampire a monster maybe i dont know somethingnot human the coroner moved his hands deftly over the suture douglas was proud of his work hed gone to much trouble he had watched grandmother carefully and remembered needle and thread and all all in all mr koberman was as neat a job as any chicken ever popped into hell by grandma i heard the boy say that koberman lived even after all those things were taken out of him the coroner looked at the triangles and chains and pyramids floating in the pans of water kept on living god did the boy say that he did then what did kill koberman the coroner drew a few strands of sewing thread from their bedding this he said sunlight blinked coldly off a halfrevealed treasure trove six dollars and seventy cents worth of silver dimes inside mr kobermans chest i think douglas made a wise investment said the coroner sewing the flesh back up over the dressing quickly there was an old woman no theres no lief arguin i got my mind fixed run along with your silly wicker basket land where you ever get notions like that you just skit out of here dont bother me i got my tattin and knittin to do and no never minds about tall dark gentlemen with fangled ideas the tall dark young man stood quietly not moving aunt tildy hurried on with her talk you heard what i said if you got a mind to talk to me well you can talk but meantime i hope you dont mind if i pour myself coffee there if youd been more polite id offer you some but you jump in here high and mighty and you never rapped on the door or nothin you think you own the place aunt tildy fussed with her lap now you made me lose count im makin myself a comforter these winters get on mighty chill and it aint fittin for a lady with bones like ricepaper to be settin in a drafty old house without warmin herself the tall dark man sat down thats an antique chair so be gentle warned aunt tildy start again tell me things you got to tell ill listen respectful but keep your voice in your shoes and stop starin at me with funny lights in your eyes land it gives me the collywobbles the boneporcelain flowered clock on the mantel finished chiming three out in the hail grouped around the wicker basket four men waited quietly as if they were frozen now about that wicker basket said aunt tildy its past six feet long and by the look it aint laundry and those four men you walked in with you dont need them to carry that basket why its light as thistles eh the dark young man was leaning forward on the antique chair something in his face suggested the basket wouldnt be so light after a while pshaw aunt tildy mused whereve i seen a wicker like that before seems it was only a couple years ago seems to me oh now i remember it was when mrs dwyer passed away next door aunt tildy set her coffee cup down sternly so thats what youre up to i thought you were workin to sell me somethin you just set there until my little emily trounces home from college this afternoon i wrote her a note last week not admittin of course that i wasnt feelin quite ripe and pert but sort of hintin i want to see her again its been a good many weeks her livin in new york and all almost like my own daughter emily is now shell take care of you young man shell shoo you outn this parlor so quick itll the dark young man looked at aunt tildy as if she were tired no im not she snapped he weaved back and forth on the chair halfshutting his eyes resting himself o wouldnt she like to rest too he seemed to murmur rest rest nice rest great sons of goshen on the gilberry dike i got a hunderd comforters two hundred sweaters and six hundred potholders in these fingers no matter theyre skinny you run off come back when im done maybe ill talk to you aunt tildy shifted subjects let me tell you about emily my sweet fair child aunt tildy nodded thoughtfully emily with hair like yellow corn tassels just as soft and fine i well remember the day her mother died twenty years ago leavin emily to my house thats why im mad at you and your wickers and such goingson who ever heard of people dyin for any good cause young man i dont like it why i remember aunt tildy paused a brief pain of memory touched her heart twentyfive years back her fathers voice trembled in the late afternoon tildy he whispered what you goin to do in life the way you act men dont walk much with you you kiss and skedaddle why dont you settle down marry raise children papa tildy shouted back at him i like laughin and playin and singin im not the marryin kind i cant find a man with my philosophy papa what philosophys that that death is ridiculous it run off with mama when we needed her most you call that

papa sadly we all stand alone in the world theres got to be a change sometime papa im startin my own philosophy here and now why its silly people live a couple years and are shoved like wet seeds in a hole but nothin sprouts what good do they do lay there a million years helpin no one most of them fine nice neat people or at least tryin but papa wasnt listening he bleached out faded away like a photo left lying in the sun she tried to talk him out of it hut he passed on anyway she spun about and ran she couldnt stay on once he was cold for his coldness denied her philosophy she didnt attend his burial she didnt do anything but set up this antique shop on the front of an old house and live alone for years that is until emily came tildy didnt want to take the girl in why because emily believed in dying but her mother was an old friend and tildy had promised help emily continued aunt tildy to the man in black was the first to live in this house with me in all the years i never got married i feared the idea of livin with a man twentythirty years and then have him up and die on me itd shake my convictions like a house of cards i shied off from the world i screamed at people if they so much as mentioned death the young man listened patiently politely then he lifted his hand he seemed to know everything with the dark cold shining of his eyes before she opened her mouth he knew about her and world war ii when she shut off her radio forever and stopped the newspapers and beat a mans head with an umbrella driving him from her shop when he insisted on describing the invasion beaches and the long slow tides of the dead drifting under the silent urgings of the moon yes the dark young man smiled from the antique rocker he knew how aunt tildy had stuck to her nice old phonograph records harry lauder singing roamin in the gloamin madame schumannheink and lullabies with no interruptions no foreign calamities murders poisonings auto accidents suicides music stayed the same each day every day so the years ran while aunt tildy tried to teach emily her philosophy but emilys mind was fixed on mortality she respected aunt tildys way of thinking however and never mentionedeternity all this the young man knew aunt tildy sniffed how do you know all those things well if you think you can talk me into that silly wicker basket youre way off the trestle you lay hands on me ill spit right in your face the young man smiled aunt tildy sniffed again dont simper like a sick dog im too old to be made love at thats all twisted dry like an old tube of paint and left behind in the years there was a noise the mantel clock chimed three aunt tildy flashed her eyes to it strange hadnt it chimed three oclock just five minutes ago she liked the bonewhite clock with gold angels dangling naked about its numeraled face and its tone like cathedral bells soft and far away are you just goin to sit there young man he was then you wont mind if i take a little cat nap now dont you stir off that chair dont come creepin around me just goin to close my eyes for a spell thats right thats right nice and quiet and restful time of day silence just the clock ticking away busy

cried aunt tildy get that old fool wicker away the four men trod heavily out the front door tildy studied the way they handled an empty basket yet staggered with its weight here now she rose in tremulous indignation did you steal my antiques my books the clocks what you got in that wicker the dark young man whistled jauntily turning his back to her walking along behind the four staggering men at the door he pointed to the wicker offered its lid to aunt tildy in pantomime he wondered if she would like to open it and gaze inside curious me pshaw no get out cried aunt tildy the dark young man tapped a hat onto his head saluted her crisply goodby aunt tildy slammed the door there there that was better gone darned fool men with their maggoty ideas no never minds about the wicker if they

and down the streets which ways the mortuary emily held to the step rail fumbling down whatre you going to do aunt tildy do cried aunt tildy tottering after her jowls shaking in a thin pale fury why get my body back of course get my body back go on the car roared emily clenched to the steering wheel staring straight ahead at the curved rainwet streets aunt tildy shook her parasol hurry child hurry before they squirt juices in my body and dice and cube it the way them persnickety morticians have a habit of doin they cut and sew it so it aint no good to no one oh auntie auntie let me go dont make me drive it wont do any good no good at all sighed the girl here we are emily pulled to the curb and collapsed over the wheel but aunt tildy had already popped from the car and trotted with mincing skirt up the mortuary drive around behind to where the shiny black hearse was unloading a wicker basket you she directed her attack at one of the four men with the wicker put that down the four men looked up one said step aside lady were doing our job thats my body tucked in there she brandished the parasol that i wouldnt know anything about said a second man please dont block traffic madam this thing is heavy sir she cried wounded ill have you know i weigh only one hundred and ten pounds he looked at her casually im not interested in your heft lady im due home for supper my wifell kill me if im late the four of them moved on aunt tildy in pursuit down a hall into a preparations room a whitesmocked man awaited the wickers arrival with a rather pleased smile on his long eagerlooking face aunt tildy didnt care for the avidity of that face or the entire personality of the man the basket was deposited the four men wandered off the man in the white smock glanced at auntie and said madam this is no fit place for a gentlewoman well she said gratified glad you feel that way its exactly what i tried to tell that darkclothed young man the mortician puzzled what darkclothed young man is that the one that came puddlin around my house thats who no one of that description works for us no matter as you just so intelligently stated this is no place for a lady i dont want me here i want me home cookin ham for sunday visitors its near easter i got emily to feed sweaters to knit clocks to wind you are quite philosophical and philanthropical no doubt of it madam but i have work a body has arrived this last he said with apparent relish and a winnowing of his knives tubes jars and instruments tildy bristled you put so much as a fingerprint on that body and ill he laid her aside like a little old moth george he called with a suave gentleness escort this lady out please aunt tildy glared at the approaching george show me your backside goin the other way george took her wrists this way please tildy extricated herself easily her flesh sort ofslipped it even amazed tildy such an unexpected talent to develop at this late day see she said pleased with her ability you cant budge me i want my body back the mortician opened the wicker lid casually then in a recurrent series of scrutinies he realized the body inside was it seemed could it be maybe yes no no it just couldnt be but ah he exhaled abruptly he turned his eyes were wide then they narrowed madam he said cautiously this lady here isarelative of yours a very dear relation be careful of her a sister perhaps he grasped at a straw of dwindling logic hopefully no you fool me do you hear me the mortician considered the idea no he said things like this dont happen he fumbled with his tools george get help from the others i cant work with a crank present the four men returned aunt tildy crossed her arms in defiance wont budge she cried as she was moved like a pawn on a chessboard from preparations room to slumber room to hall to waiting chamber to funeral parlor where she threw herself down on a chair in the very center of the vestibule there were pews going back into gray silence and a smell of flowers please maam said one of the men thats where the body rests for the service tomorrow im sittin right plumb here until i get what i want she sat pale fingers fussing with the lace at her throat jaw set one highbuttoned shoe tapping with irritation if a man got in whopping distance she gave him a parasol whop and when they touched her now she remembered toslip away mr carrington mortuary president heard the disturbance in his office and came toddling down the aisle to investigate here here he whispered to everyone finger to mouth more respect more respect what is this oh

mr carrington who hadnt correlated bodies yet he looked at her in blank helplessness hes got me in there on his table like a pigeon ready to be drawn and stuffed she told him mr carrington hustled off to check after fifteen minutes of waiting silence and horrified arguing comparing notes with the mortician behind closed doors carrington returned three shades whiter carrington dropped his glasses picked them up youre making it difficult for us i am raged aunt tildy saint vitus in the mornin looky here mister blood and bones or whatever you tell that were already draining the blood from the what yes yes i assure you yes so you just go away now theres nothing to be done he laughed nervously our mortician is also performing a brief autopsy to determine cause of death auntie jumped to her feet burning he cant do that only coroners are allowed to do that well we sometimes allow a little march straight in and tell that cutemup to pump all that fine new england blue blood right back into that fineskinned body and if hes taken anything out for him to attach it back in so itll function proper and then turn that body fresh as paint into my keepin you hear theres nothing i can do nothing tell you what im settin here for the next two hundred years you listenin and every time any of your customers come by ill spit ectoplasm right squirt up their nostrils carrington groped that thought around his weakening mind and emitted a groan youd ruin our business you wouldnt do that auntie smiled wouldnt i carrington ran up the dark aisle in the distance you could hear him dialing a phone over and over again half an hour later cars roared up in front of the mortuary three vicepresidents of the mortuary came down the aisle with their hysterical president what seems to be the trouble auntie told them with a few wellchosen infernalities they held a conference meanwhile notifying the mortician to discontinue his homework at least until such time as an agreement was reached the mortician walked from his chamber and stood smiling amiably smoking a big black cigar auntie stared at the cigar whered you put the ashes she cried in horror the mortician only grinned imperturbably and puffed the conference broke up madam in all fairness you wouldnt force us out on the street to continue our services would you auntie scanned the vultures oh i wouldnt mind at all carrington wiped sweat from his jowls you can have your body back ha shouted auntie then with caution intact intact no formaldehyde no formaldehyde blood in it blood my god yes blood if only youll take it and go a prim nod fair enough fix er up its a deal carrington snapped his fingers at the mortician dont stand there you mental incompetent fix it up and be careful with that cigar said the old woman easy easy said aunt tildy put the wicker on the floor where i can step in it she didnt look at the body much her only comment was naturallookin she let herself fall back into the wicker a biting sensation of arctic coldness gripped her followed by an unlikely nausea and a giddy whorling she was two drops of matter fusing water trying to seep into concrete slow to do hard like a butterfly trying to squirm back into a discarded husk of flinty chrysalis the vicepresidents watched aunt tildy with apprehension mr carrington wrung his fingers and tried to assist with boosting and pushing moves of his hands and arms the mortician frankly skeptical watched with idle amused eyes seeping into cold long granite seeping into a frozen and ancient statue squeezing all the way come alive damn ye shouted aunt tildy to herself raise up a bit the body halfrose rustling in the dry wicker fold your legs woman the body grabbled up blindly groping see shouted aunt tildy light entered the webbed blind eyes feel urged aunt tildy the body felt the warmth of the room the sudden reality of the preparations table on which to lean panting move the body took a creaking slow step hear she snapped the noises of the place came into the dull ears the harsh expectant breath of the mortician shaken the whimpering mr carrington her own crackling voice walk she said the body walked think she said the old brain thought speak she said the body spoke bowing to the morticians much obliged thank you now she said finally cry and she began to cry tears of utter happiness and now any afternoon about four if you want to visit aunt tildy you just walk around to her antique shop and rap theres a big black funeral wreath on the door dont mind that aunt tildy left it there thats how her humor runs you rap on the door its doublebarred and triplelocked and when you rap her voice shrills out at you is that the man in black and you laugh and say no no its only me aunt tildy and she laughs and says come on in quick and she whips the door open and slams it shut behind so no man in black can ever slip in with you then she sets you down and pours your coffee and shows you her latest knitted sweater shes not as fast as she used to be and cant see as good but she gets on and if youre specially good aunt tildy declares setting her coffee cup to one side ill give you a little treat whats that visitors will ask this says auntie pleased with her little uniqueness her little joke then with modest moves of her fingers she will unfasten the white lace at her neck and chest and for a brief moment show what lies beneath the long blue scar where the autopsy was neatly sewn together not bad sewin for a man she allows oh some more coffee there the cistern it was an afternoon of rain and lamps lighted against the gray for a long while the two sisters had been in the diningroom one of them juliet embroidered tablecloths the younger anna sat quietly on the window seat staring out at the dark street and the dark sky anna kept her brow pressed against the pane but her lips moved and after reflecting a long moment she said i never thought of that before of what asked juliet it just came to me theres actually a city under a city a dead city right here right under our feet juliet poked her needle in and out of the white cloth come away from the window that rains done something to you no really didnt you ever think of the cisterns before theyre all through the town theres one for every street and you can walk in them without bumping your head and they go everywhere and finally go down to the sea said anna fascinated with the rain on the asphalt pavement out there and the rain falling from the sky and vanishing down the gratings at each corner of the distant intersection wouldnt you like to live in a cistern i would not but wouldnt it be funi mean very secret to live in the cistern and peek up at people through the slots and see them and them not see you like when you were a child and played hideandseek and nobody found you and there you were in their midst all the time all sheltered and hidden and warm and excited id like that thats what it must be like to live in the cistern juliet looked slowly up from her work you are my sister arent you anna you were born werent you sometimes the way you talk i think mother found you under a tree one day and brought you home and planted you in a pot and grew you to this size and there you are and youll never change anna didnt reply so juliet went back to her needle there was no color in the room neither of the two sisters added any color to it anna held her head to the window for five minutes then she looked way off into the distance and said i guess youd call it a dream while ive been here the last hour i mean thinking yes juliet it was a dream now it was juliets turn not to answer anna whispered all this water put me to sleep a while i guess and then i began to think about the rain and where it came from and where it went and how it went down those little slots in the curb and then i thought about deep under and suddenly there they were a man and a woman down in that cistern under the road what would they be doing there asked juliet anna said must they have a reason no not if theyre insane no said juliet in that case no reasons are necessary there they are in their cistern and let them stay but they arent just in the cistern said anna knowingly her head to one side her eyes moving under the halfdown lids no theyre in love these two for heavens sake said juliet did love make them crawl down there no theyve been there for years and years said anna you cant tell me theyve been in that cistern for years living together protested juliet did i say they were alive asked anna surprised oh hut no theyre dead the rain scrambled in wild pushing pellets down the window drops came and joined with others and made streaks oh said juliet yes said anna pleasantly dead hes dead and shes dead this seemed to satisfy her it was a nice discovery and she was proud of it he looks like a very lonely man who never traveled in all his life how do you know he looks like the kind of man who never traveled but wanted to you know by his eyes you know what he looks like then yes very ill and very handsome you know how it is with a man made handsome by illness illness brings out the bones in the face and hes dead asked the older sister for five years anna talked softly with her eyelids rising and falling as if she were about to tell a long story and knew it and wanted to work into it slowly and then faster and then faster until the very momentum of the story would carry her on with her eyes wide and her lips parted but now it was slowly with only a slight fever to the telling five years ago this man was walking along a street and he knew hed been walking the same street on many nights and hed go on walking it so he came to a manhole cover one of those big iron waffles in the center of the street and he heard the river rushing under his feet under the metal cover rushing toward the sea anna put out her right hand and he bent slowly and lifted up the cistern lid and looked down at the rushing foam and the water and he thought of someone he wanted to love and couldnt and then he swung himself onto the iron rungs and walked down them until he was all gone and what about her asked juliet busy whend she die im not sure shes new shes just dead now but she is dead beautifully beautifully dead anna admired the image she had in her mind it takes death to make a woman really beautiful and it takes death by drowning to make her most beautiful of all then all the stiffness is taken out of her and her hair hangs up on the water like a drift of smoke she nodded her head amusedly all the schools and etiquettes and teachings in the world cant make a woman move with this dreamy ease supple and ripply and fine anna tried to show how fine how ripply how graceful with her broad coarse hand hed been waiting for her for five years but she hadnt known where he was till now so there they are and will be from now on in the rainy season theyll live but in the dry seasonsthats sometimes monthstheyll have long rest periods theyll lie in little hidden niches like those japanese water flowers all dry and compact and old and quiet juliet got up and turned on yet another little lamp in the corner of the diningroom i wish you wouldnt talk about it anna laughed but let me tell you about how it starts how they come back to life ive got it all worked out she bent forward held onto her knees staring at the street and the rain and the cistern mouths there they are down under dry and quiet and up above the sky gets electrical and powdery she threw back her dull graying hair with one hand at first all the upper world is pellets then theres lightning and then thunder and the dry season is over and the little pellets run along the gutters and get big and fall into the drains they take gum wrappers and theatre tickets with them and bus transfers come away from that window now anna made a square with her hands and imagined things i know just what its like under the pavement in the big square cistern its huge its all empty from the weeks with nothing but sunshine it echoes if you talk the only sound you can hear standing down there is an auto passing above far up above the whole cistern is like a dry hollow camel bone in a desert waiting she lifted her hand pointing as if she herself were down in the cistern waiting now a little trickle it comes down on the floor its like something was hurt and bleeding up in the outer world theres some thunder or was it a truck going by she spoke a little more rapidly now but held her body relaxed against the window breathing out and in the next words it seeps down then into all the other hollows come other seepages little twines and snakes tobaccostained water then it moves it joins others it makes snakes and then one big constrictor which rolls along on the flat papered floor from everywhere from the north and south from other streets other streams come and they join and make one hissing and shining coil and the water writhes into those two little dry niches i told you about it rises slowly around those two the man and the woman lying there like japanese flowers she clasped her hands slowly working finger into finger interlacing the water soaks into them first it lifts the womans hand in a little move her hands the only live part of her then her arm lifts and one foot and her hair she touched her own hair as it hung about her shoulders unloosens and opens out like a flower in the water her shut eyelids are blue the room got darker juliet sewed on and anna talked and told all she saw in her mind she told how the water rose and took the woman with it unfolding her out and loosening her and standing her full upright in the cistern the water is interested in the woman and she lets it have its way after a long time of lying still shes ready to live again any life the water wants her to have somewhere else the man stood up in the water also and anna told of that and how the water carried him slowly drifting and her drifting until they met each other the water opens their eyes now they can see but not see each other they circle not touching yet anna made a little move of her head eyes closed they watch each other they glow with some kind of phosphorus they smile theytouch hands at last juliet stiffening put down her sewing and stared at her sister across the gray rainsilent room anna the tidemakes them touch the tide comes and puts them together its a perfect kind of love with no ego to it only two bodies moved by water which makes it clean and all right its not wicked this way its bad youre saying it cried her sister no its all right insisted anna turning for an instant theyre not thinking are they theyre just so deep down and quiet and not caring she took her right hand and held it over her left hand very slowly and gently quavering and interweaving them the rainy window with the pale spring light penetrating put a movement of light and running water on her fingers made them seem submerged fathoms deep in gray water running one about the other as she finished her little dream him tall and quiet his hands open she showed with a gesture how tall and how easy he was in the water her small and quiet and relaxed she looked at her sister leaving her hands just that way theyre dead with no place to go and no one to tell them so there they are with nothing applying to them and no worries very secret and hidden under the earth in the cistern waters they touch their hands and lips and when they come into a crossstreet outlet of the cistern the tide rushes them together then later she disengaged her hands maybe they travel together hand in hand bobbling and floating down all the streets doing little crazy upright dances when theyre caught in sudden swirls she whirled her hands about a drenching of rain spatted the window and they go down to the sea all across the town past cross drain and cross drain street and street genesee avenue crenshaw edmond place washington motor city ocean side and then the ocean they go anywhere the water wants them all over the earth and come back later to the cistern inlet and float back up under the town under a dozen tobacco shops and four dozen liquor stores and six dozen groceries and ten theatres a rail junction highway under the walking feet of thirty thousand people who dont even know or think of the cistern annas voice drifted and dreamed and grew quiet again and thenthe day passes and the thunder goes away up on the street the rain stops the rain seasons over the tunnels drip and stop the tide goes down she seemed disappointed sad it was over the river runs out to the ocean the man and woman feel the water leave them slowly to the floor they settle she lowered her hands in little bobblings to her lap watching them fixedly longingly their feet lose the life the water has given them from outside now the water lays them down side by side and drains away and the tunnels are drying and there they lie up above in the world the sun comes out there they lie in the darkness sleeping until the next time until the next rain her hands were now upon her lap palms up and open nice man nice woman she murmured she bowed her head over them and shut her eyes tight suddenly anna sat up and glared at her sister do you know who the man is she shouted bitterly juliet did not reply she had watched stricken for the past five minutes while this thing went on her mouth was twisted and pale anna almost screamed the man is frank thats who he is and im the woman anna yes its frank down there but franks been gone for years and certainly not down there anna now anna was talking to nobody and to everybody to juliet to the window the wall the street poor frank she cried i know thats where he went he couldnt stay anywhere in the world his mother spoiled him for all the world so he saw the cistern and saw how secret and fine it was oh poor frank and poor anna poor me with only a sister oh julie why didnt i hold onto frank when he was here why didnt i fight to win him from his mother stop it this minute do you hear this minute anna slumped down into the corner by the window one hand up on it and wept silently a few minutes later she heard her sister say are you finished what if youre done come help me finish this ill be forever at it anna raised her head and glided over to her sister what do you want me to do she sighed this and this said juliet showing her all right said anna and took it and sat by the window looking at the rain moving her hands with the needle and thread but watching how dark the street was now and the room and how hard it was to see the round metal top of the cistern nowthere were just little midnight gleams and glitters out there in the black black late afternoon lightning crackled over the sky in a web half an hour passed juliet drowsed in her chair across the room removed her glasses placed them down with her work and for a moment rested her head back and dozed perhaps thirty seconds later she heard the front door open violently heard the wind come in heard the footsteps run down the walk turn and hurry along the black street what asked juliet sitting up fumbling for her glasses whos there anna did someone come in the door she stared at the empty window seat where anna had been anna she cried she sprang up and ran out into the hall the front door stood open rain fell through it in a fine mist shes only gone out for a moment said juliet standing there trying to peer into the wet blackness shell be right back wont you be right back anna dear anna answer me you will be right back wont you sister outside the cistern lid rose and slammed down the rain whispered on the street and fell upon the closed lid all the rest of the night homecoming here they come said cecy lying there flat in her bed where are they cried timothy from the doorway some of them are over europe some over asia some of them over the islands some over south america said cecy her eyes closed the lashes long brown and quivering timothy came forward upon the bare plankings of the upstairs room who are they uncle einar and uncle fry and theres cousin william and i see frulda and helgar and aunt morgiana and cousin vivian and i see uncle johann theyre all coming fast are they up in the sky cried timothy his little gray eyes flashing standing by the bed he looked no more than his fourteen years the wind blew outside the house was dark and lit only by starlight theyre coming through the air and traveling along the ground in many forms said cecy in her sleeping she did not move on the bed she thought inward on herself and told what she saw i see a wolflike thing coming over a dark riverat the shallowsjust above a waterfall the starlight shining up his pelt i see a brown oak leaf blowing far up in the sky i see a small bat flying i see many other things running through the forest trees and slipping through the highest branches and theyre all coming this way will they be here by tomorrow night timothy clutched the bedclothes the spider on his lapel swung like a black pendulum excitedly dancing he leaned over his sister will they all be here in time for the homecoming yes yes timothy yes sighed cecy she stiffened ask no more of me go away now let me travel in the places i like best thanks cecy he said out in the hail he ran to his room he hurriedly made his bed he had just awakened a few minutes ago at sunset and as the first stars had risen he had gone to let his excitement about the party run with cecy now she slept so quietly there was not a sound the spider hung on a silvery lasso about timothys slender neck as he washed his face just think spid tomorrow night is allhallows eve he lifted his face and looked into the mirror his was the only mirror allowed in the house it was his mothers concession to his illness oh if only he were not so afflicted he opened his mouth surveyed the poor inadequate teeth nature had given him no more than so many corn kernelsround soft and pale in his jaws some of the high spirit died in him it was now totally dark and he lit a candle to see by he felt exhausted this past week the whole family had lived in the fashion of the old country sleeping by day rousing at sunset to move about there were blue hollows under his eyes spid im no good he said quietly to the little creature i cant even get used to sleeping days like the others he took up the candleholder oh to have strong teeth with incisors like steel spikes or strong hands even or a strong mind even to have the power to send ones mind out free as cecy did but no he was the imperfect one the sick one he was evenhe shivered and drew the candle flame closerafraid of the dark his brothers snorted at him bion and leonard and sam they laughed at him because he slept in a bed with cecy it was different her bed was part of her comfort for the composure necessary to send her mind abroad to hunt but timothy did he sleep in the wonderful polished boxes like the others he did not mother let him have his own bed his own room his own mirror no wonder the family skirted him like a holy mans crucifix if only the wings would sprout from his shoulder blades he bared his back stared at it and sighed again no chance never downstairs were exciting and mysterious sounds the slithering black crape going up in all the halls and on the ceilings and doors the sputter of burning black tapers in the banistered stair well mothers voice high and firm fathers voice echoing from the damp cellar bion walking from outside the old country house lugging vast twogallon jugs ive just got to go to the party spid said timothy the spider whirled at the end of its silk and timothy felt alone he would polish cases fetch toadstools and spiders hang crape but when the party started hed be ignored the less seen or said of the imperfect son the better all through the house below laura ran the homecoming she shouted gaily the homecoming her footsteps everywhere at once timothy passed cecys room again and she was sleeping quietly once a month she went belowstairs always she stayed in bed lovely cecy he felt like asking her where are you now cecy and in who and whats happening are you beyond the hills and what goes on there but he went on to ellens room instead ellen sat at her desk sorting out many kinds of blonde red and black hair and little scimitars of fingernails gathered from her manicurist job at the mellin village beauty parlor fifteen miles over a sturdy mahogany case lay in one corner with her name on it go away she said not even looking at him i cant work with you gawking allhallows eve ellen just think he said trying to be friendly hunh she put some fingernail clippings in a small white sack labeled them what can it mean to you what do you know of it itll scare hell out of you go back to bed his cheeks burned im needed to polish and work and help serve if you dont go youll find a dozen raw oysters in your bed tomorrow said ellen matteroffactiy goodby timothy in his anger rushing downstairs he bumped into laura watch where youre going she shrieked from clenched teeth she swept away he ran to the open cellar door smelled the channel of moist earthy air rising from below father its about time father shouted up the steps hurry down or theyll be here before were ready timothy hesitated only long enough to hear the million other sounds in the house brothers came and went like trains in a station talking and arguing if you stood in one spot long enough the entire household passed with their pale hands full of things leonard with his little black medical case samuel with his large dusty ebon bound book under his arm bearing more black crape and bion excursioning to the car outside and bringing in many more gallons of liquid father stopped polishing to give timothy a rag and a scowl he thumped the huge mahogany box come on shine this up so we can start on another sleep your life away while waxing the surface timothy looked inside uncle einars a big man isnt he papa unh how big is he the size of the boxll tell you i was only asking seven feet tall you talk a lot about nine oclock timothy went out into the october weather for two hours in the nowwarm nowcold wind he walked the meadows collecting toadstools and spiders his heart began to beat with anticipation again how many relatives had mother said would come seventy one hundred he passed a farmhouse if only you knew what was happening at our house he said to the glowing windows he climbed a hill and looked at the town miles away settling into sleep the townhall clock high and round white in the distance the town did not know either he brought home many jars of toadstools and spiders in the little chapel belowstairs a brief ceremony was celebrated it was like all the other rituals over the years with father chanting the dark lines mothers beautiful white ivory hands moving in the reverse blessings and all the children gathered except cecy who lay upstairs in bed but cecy was present you saw her peering now from bions eyes now samuels now mothers and you felt a movement and now she was in you fleetingly and gone timothy prayed to the dark one with a tightened stomach please please help me grow up help me be like my sisters and brothers dont let me be different if only i could put the hair in the plastic images as ellen does or make people fall in love with me as laura does with people or read strange books as sam does or work in a respected job like leonard and bion do or even raise a family one day as mother and father have done at midnight a storm hammered the house lightning struck outside in amazing snowwhite bolts there was a sound of an approaching probing sucking tornado funneling and nuzzling the moist night earth then the front door blasted half off its hinges hung stiff and discarded and in trooped grandmama and grandpapa all the way from the old country from then on people arrived each hour there was a flutter at the side window a rap on the front porch a knock at the back there were fey noises from the cellar autumn wind piped down the chimney throat chanting mother filled the large crystal punch bowl with a scarlet fluid poured from the jugs bion had carried home father swept from room to room lighting more tapers laura and ellen hammered up more wolfsbane and timothy stood amidst this wild excitement no expression to his face his hands trembling at his sides gazing now here now there banging of doors laughter the sound of liquid pouring darkness sound of wind the webbed thunder of wings the padding of feet the welcoming bursts of talk at the entrances the transparent rattlings of casements the shadows passing coming going wavering well well and this must be timothy what a chilly hand took his hand a long hairy face leaned down over him a good lad a fine lad said the stranger timothy said his mother this is uncle jason hello uncle jason and over here mother drifted uncle jason away uncle jason peered back at timothy over his caped shoulder and winked timothy stood alone from off a thousand miles in the candled darkness he heard a high fluting voice that was ellen and my brothers they are clever can you guess their occupations aunt morgiana i have no idea they operate the undertaking establishment in town what a gasp yes shrill laughter isnt that priceless timothy stood very still a pause in the laughter they bring home sustenance for mama papa and all of us said laura except of course timothy an uneasy silence uncle jasons voice demanded well come now what about timothy oh laura your tongue said mother laura went on with it timothy shut his eyes timothy doesntwelldoesnt like blood hes delicate hell learn said mother hell learn she said very firmly hes my son and hell learn hes only fourteen but i was raised on the stuff said uncle jason his voice passing from one room on into another the wind played the trees outside like harps a little rain spatted on the windowsraised on the stuff passing away into faintness timothy bit his lips and opened his eyes well it was all my fault mother was showing them into the kitchen now i tried forcing him you cant force children you only make them sick and then they never get a taste for things look at bion now he was thirteen before he i understand murmured uncle jason timothy will come around im sure he will said mother defiantly candle flames quivered as shadows crossed and recrossed the dozen musty rooms timothy was cold he smelled the hot tallow in his nostrils and instinctively he grabbed at a candle and walked with it around and about the house pretending to straighten the crape timothy someone whispered behind a patterned wall hissing and sizzling and sighing the words timothy is afraid of the dark leonards voice hateful leonard i like the candle thats all said timothy in a reproachful whisper more lightning more thunder cascades of roaring laughter bangings and clickings and shouts and rustles of clothing clammy fog swept through the front door out of the fog settling his wings stalked a tall man uncle einar timothy propelled himself on his thin legs straight through the fog under the green webbing shadows he threw himself across einars arms einar lifted him youve wings timothy he tossed the boy light as thistles wings timothy fly faces wheeled under darkness rotated the house blew away timothy felt breezelike he flapped his arms einars fingers caught and threw him once more to the ceiling the ceiling rushed down like a charred wall fly timothy shouted einar loud and deep fly with wings wings he felt an exquisite ecstasy in his shoulder blades as if roots grew burst to explode and blossom into new moist membrane he babbled wild stuff again einar hurled him high the autumn wind broke in a tide on the house rain crashed down shaking the beams causing chandeliers to tilt their enraged candle lights and the one hundred relatives peered out from every black enchanted room circling inward all shapes and sizes to where einar balanced the child like a baton in the roaring spaces enough shouted einar at last timothy deposited on the floor timbers exaltedly exhaustedly fell against uncle einar sobbing happily uncle uncle uncle was it good flying eh timothy said uncle einar bending down patting timothys head good good it was coming toward dawn most had arrived and were ready to bed down for the daylight sleep motionlessly with no sound until the following sunset when they would shout out of their mahogany boxes for the revelry uncle einar followed by dozens of others moved toward the cellar mother directed them downward to the crowded row on row of highly polished boxes einar his wings like seagreen tarpaulins tented behind him moved with a curious whistling down the passageway where his wings touched they made a sound of drum heads gently beaten upstairs timothy lay wearily thinking trying to like the darkness there was so much you could do in darkness that people couldnt criticize you for because they never saw you he did like the night but it was a qualified liking sometimes there was so much night he cried out in rebellion in the cellar mahogany doors sealed downward drawn in by pale hands in corners certain relatives circled three times to lie heads on paws eyelids shut the sun rose there was a sleeping sunset the revel exploded like a bat nest struck full shrieking out fluttering spreading box doors banged wide steps rushed up from cellar damp more late guests kicking on front and back portals were admitted it rained and sodden visitors laid their capes their waterpelleted hats their sprinkled veils upon timothy who bore them to a closet the rooms were crowdpacked the laughter of one cousin shot from one room angled off the wall of another ricocheted banked and returned to timothys ears from a fourth room accurate and cynical a mouse ran across the floor i know you niece leibersrouter exclaimed father the mouse spiraled three womens feet and vanished into a corner moments later a beautiful woman rose up out of nothing and stood in the corner smiling her white smile at them all something huddled against the flooded pane of the kitchen window it sighed and wept and tapped continually pressed against the glass but timothy could make nothing of it he saw nothing in imagination he was outside staring in the rain was on him the wind at him and the taperdotted darkness inside was inviting waltzes were being danced tall thin figures pirouetted to outlandish music stars of light flickered off lifted bottles small clods of earth crumbled from casques and a spider fell and went silently legging over the floor timothy shivered he was inside the house again mother was calling him to run here run there help serve out to the kitchen now fetch this fetch that bring the plates heap the foodon and onthe party happened around him but not to him the dozens of towering people pressed in against him elbowed him ignored him finally he turned and slipped away up the stairs he called softly cecy where are you now cecy she waited a long while before answering in the imperial valley she murmured faintly beside the salton sea near the mud pots and the steam and the quiet im inside a farmers wife im sitting on a front porch i can make her move if i want or do anything or think anything the suns going down whats it like cecy you can hear the mud pots hissing she said slowly as if speaking in a church little gray heads of steam push up the mud like bald men rising in the thick syrup head first out in the boiling channels the gray heads rip like rubber fabric collapse with noises lilce wet lips moving and feathery plumes of steam escape from the ripped tissue and there is a smell of deep sulphurous burning and old times the dinosaur has been abroiling here ten million years is he done yet cecy yes hes done quite done cecys calm sleepers lips turned up the languid words fell slowly from her shaping mouth inside this womans skull i am looking out watching the sea that does not move and is so quiet it makes you afraid i sit on the porch and wait for my husband to come home occasionally a fish leaps falls back starlight edging it the valley the sea the few cars the wooden porch my rocking chair myself the silence what now cecy im getting up from my rocking chair she said yes im walking off the porch toward the mud pots planes fly over like primordial birds then it is quiet so quiet how long will you stay inside her cecy until ive listened and looked and felt enough until ive changed her life some way im walking off the porch and along the wooden boards my feet knock on the planks tiredly slowly and now now the sulphur fumes are all around me i stare at the bubbles as they break and smooth a bird darts by my temple shrieking suddenly i am in the bird and fly away and as i fly inside my new small glassbead eyes i see a woman below me on a boardwalk take one two three steps forward into the mud pots i hear a sound as of a boulder plunged into molten depths i keep flying circle back i see a white hand like a spider wriggle and disappear into the gray lava pool the lava seals over now im flying home swift swift swift something clapped hard against the window timothy started cecy flicked her eyes wide bright full happy exhilarated now im home she said after a pause timothy ventured the homecomings on and everybodys here then why are you upstairs she took his hand well ask me she smiled slyly ask me what you came to ask i didnt come to ask anything he said well almost nothing welloh cecy it came from him in one long rapid flow i want to do something at the party to make them look at me something to make me good as them something to make me belong but theres nothing i can do and i feel funny and well i thought you might i might she said closing her eyes smiling inwardly stand up straight stand very still he obeyed now shut your eyes and blank out your thought he stood very straight and thought of nothing or at least thought of thinking nothing she sighed shall we go downstairs now timothy like a hand into a glove cecy was within him look everybody timothy held the glass of warm red liquid he held up the glass so that the whole house turned to watch him aunts uncles cousins brothers sisters he drank it straight down he jerked a hand at his sister laura he held her gaze whispering to her in a subtle voice that kept her silent frozen he felt tall as the trees as he walked to her the party now slowed it waited on all sides of him watching from all the room doors the faces peered they were not laughing mothers face was astonished dad looked bewildered but pleased and getting prouder every instant he nipped laura gently over the neck vein the candle flames swayed drunkenly the wind climbed around on the roof outside the relatives stared from all the doors he popped toadstools into his mouth swallowed then beat his arms against his flanks and circled look uncle einar jean fly at last beat went his hands up and down pumped his feet the faces flashed past him at the top of the stairs flapping he heard his mother cry stop timothy far below hey shouted timothy and leaped off the top of the well thrashing halfway down the wings he thought he owned dissolved he screamed uncle einar caught him timothy flailed whitely in the receiving arms a voice burst out of his lips unbidden this is cecy this is cecy come see me all of you upstairs first room on the left followed by a long trill of high laughter timothy tried to cut it off with his tongue everybody was laughing einar set him down running through the crowding blackness as the relatives flowed upstairs toward cecys room to congratulate her timothy banged the front door open cecy i hate you i hate you by the sycamore tree in deep shadow timothy spewed out his dinner sobbed bitterly and threshed in a pile of autumn leaves then he lay still from his blouse pocket from the protection of the matchbox he used for his retreat the spider crawled forth spid walked along timothys arm spid explored up his neck to his ear and climbed in the ear to tickle it timothy shook his head dont spid dont the feathery touch of a tentative feeler probing his eardrum set timothy shivering dont spid he sobbed somewhat less the spider traveled down his cheek took a station under the boys nose looked up into the nostrils as if to seek the brain and then clambered softly up over the rim of the nose to sit to squat there peering at timothy with green gem eyes until timothy filled with ridiculous laughter go away spid timothy sat up rustling the leaves the land was very bright with the moon in the house he could heard the faint ribaldry as mirror mirror was played celebrants shouted dimly muffled as they tried to identify those of themselves whose reflections did not had not ever appeared in a glass timothy uncle einars wings spread and twitched and came in with a sound like kettledrums timothy felt himself plucked up like a thimble and set upon einars shoulder dont feel badly nephew timothy each to his own each in his own way how much better things are for you how rich the worlds dead for us weve seen so much of it believe me lifes best to those who live the least of it its worth more per ounce timothy remember that the rest of the black morning from midnight on uncle einar led him about the house from room to room weaving and singing a horde of late arrivals set the entire hilarity off afresh greatgreatgreatgreat and a thousand more greatgreats grandmother was there wrapped in egyptian cerements she said not a word but lay straight as a burnt ironing board against the wall her eye hollows cupping a distant wise silent glimmering at the breakfast at four in the morning onethousandoddgreats grandmama was stiffly seated at the head of the longest table the numerous young cousins caroused at the crystal punch bowl their shiny olivepit eyes their conical devilish faces and curly bronze hair hovered over the drinking table their hardsoft halfgirl halfboy bodies wrestling against each other as they got unpleasantly sullenly drunk the wind got higher the stars burned with fiery intensity the noises redoubled the dances quickened the drinking became more positive to timothy there were thousands of things to hear and watch the many darknesses roiled bubbled the many faces passed and repassed listen the party held its breath far away the town clock struck its chimes saying six oclock the party was ending in time to the rhythm of the striking clock their one hundred voices began to sing songs that were four hundred years old songs timothy could not know arms twined circling slowly they sang and somewhere in the cold distance of morning the town clock finished out its chimes and quieted timothy sang he knew no words no tune yet the words and tune came round and high and good and he gazed at the closed door at the top of the stairs thanks cecy he whispered youre forgiven thanks then he just relaxed and let the words move with cecys voice free from his lips goodbys were said there was a great rustling mother and father stood at the door to shake hands and kiss each departing relative in turn the sky beyond the open door colored in the east a cold wind entered and timothy felt himself seized and settled in one body after another felt cecy press him into uncle frys head so he stared from the wrinkled leather face then leaped in a flurry of leaves up over the house and awakening hills then loping down a dirt path he felt his red eyes burning his fur pelt rimed with morning as inside cousin william he panted through a hollow and dissolved away like a pebble in uncle einars mouth timothy flew in a webbed thunder filling the sky and then he was back for all time in his own body in the growing dawn the last few were embracing and crying and thinking how the world was becoming less a place for them there had been a time when they had met every year but now decades passed with no reconciliation dont forget someone cried we meet in salem in salem timothys numbed mind turned the words over salem and there would be uncle fry and a thousandtimesgreat grandmother in her withered cerements and mother and father and ellen and laura and cecy and all the rest but would he be there could he be certain of staying alive until then with one last withering blast away they all went so many scarves so many fluttery mammals so many sere leaves so many whining and clustering noises so many midnights and insanities and dreams mother shut the door laura picked up a broom no said mother well clean tonight now we need sleep and the family vanished down cellar and upstairs and timothy moved in the crapelittered hall his head down passing a party mirror he saw the pale mortality of his face all cold and trembling timothy said mother she came to touch her hand on his face son she said we love you remember that we all love you no matter how different you are no matter if you leave us one day she kissed his cheek and if and when you die your bones will lie undisturbed well see to that youll lie at ease forever and ill come visit every allhallows eve and tuck you in the more secure the house was silent far away the wind went over a hill with its last cargo of dark bats echoing chittering timothy walked up the steps one by one crying to himself all the way the wonderful death of dudley stone alive dead alive in new england damn it died twenty years ago pass the hat ill go myself and bring back his head thats how the talk went that night a stranger set it off with his mouthings about dudley stone dead alive we cried and shouldnt we know werent we the last frail remnants of those who had burnt incense and read his books by the light of blazing intellectual votives in the twenties the dudley stone that magnificent stylist that proudest of literary lions surely you recall the headpounding the cliffjumping the whistlings of doom that followed on his writing his publishers this note sirs today aged i retire from the field renounce writing burn all my effects toss my latest manuscript on the dump cry hail and fare thee well yrs affect dudley stone earthquakes and avalanches in that order why we asked ourselves meeting down the years in fine soapopera fashion we debated if it was women caused him to hurl his literary future away was it the bottle or horses that outran him and stopped a fine pacer in his prime we freely admitted to one and all that were stone writing now faulkner hemingway and steinbeck would be buried in his lava all the sadder that stone on the brink of his greatest work turned one day and went off to live in a town we shall call obscurity by the sea best named the past why that question forever lived with those of us who had seen the glints of genius in his piebald works one night a few weeks ago musing off the erosion of the years finding each others faces somewhat more pouched and our hairs more conspicuously in absence we became enraged over the typical citizens ignorance of dudley stone at least we muttered thomas wolfe had had a full measure of success before he seized his nose and jumped off the rim of eternity at least the critics gathered to stare after his plunge into darkness as after a meteor that made much fire in its passing but who now remembered dudley stone his coteries his frenzied followers of the twenties pass the hat i said ill travel three hundred miles grab dudley stone by the pants and say look here mr stone why did you let us down so badly why havent you written a book in twentyfive years the hat was lined with cash i sent a telegram and took a train i do not know what i expected perhaps to find a doddering and frail praying mantis whisping about the station blown by seawinds a chalkwhite ghost who would husk at me with the voices of grass and reeds blown in the night i clenched my knees in agony as my train chuffed into the station i let myself down into a lonely countryside a mile from the sea like a man foolishly insane wondering why i had come so far on a bulletin board in front of the boardedup ticket office i found a cluster of announcements inches thick pasted and nailed one upon another for uncountable years leafing under peeling away anthropological layers of printed tissue i found what i wanted dudley stone for alderman dudley stone for sheriff dudley stone for mayor on up through the years his photograph bleached by sun and rain faintly recognizable asked for ever more responsible positions in the life of this world near the sea i stood reading them hey and dudley stone plunged across the station platform behind me suddenly is that you mr douglas i whirled to confront this great architecture of a man big but not in the least fat his legs huge pistons thrusting him on a bright flower in his lapel a bright tie at his neck he crushed my hand looked down upon me like michelangelos god creating adam with a mighty touch his face was the face of those illustrated north winds and south winds that blow hot and cold in ancient mariners charts it was the face that symbolizes the sun in egyptian carvings ablaze with life my god i thought and this is the man who hasnt written in twentyodd years impossible hes so alive its sinful i can hear his heartbeat i must have stood with my eyes very wide to let the look of him cram in upon my startled senses you thought youd find marleys ghost he laughed admit it i my wifes waiting with a new england boiled dinner weve plenty of ale and stout i like the ring of those words to ale is not to sicken but to revive the flagging spirit a tricky word that and stout theres a nice ruddy sound to it stout a great golden watch bounced on his vestfront hung in bright chains he vised my elbow and charmed me along a magician well on his way back to his cave with a luckless rabbit glad to see you i suppose youve come as the others came to ask the same question eh well this time ill tell everything my heart jumped wonderful behind the empty station sat an opentop vintage modelt ford fresh air drive at twilight like this you get all the fields the grass the flowers coming at you in the wind i hope youre not one of those who tiptoe around shutting windows our house is like the top of a mesa we let the weather do our broomwork hop in ten minutes later we swung off the highway onto a drive that had not been leveled or filled in years stone drove straight on over the pits and bumps smiling steadily bang we shuddered the last few yards to a wild unpainted twostory house the car was allowed to gasp itself away into mortal silence do you want the truth stone turned to look me in the face and hold my shoulder with an earnest hand i was murdered by a man with a gun twentyfive years ago almost to this very day i sat staring after him as he leapt from the car he was solid as a ton of rock no ghost to him but yet i knew that somehow the truth was in what he had told me before firing himself like a cannon at the house this is my wife and this is the house and that is our supper waiting for us look at our view windows on three sides of the living room a view of the sea the shore the meadows we nail the windows open three out of four seasons i swear you get a smell of limes here midsummer and something from antarctica ammonia and ice cream come december sit down lena isnt it nice having him here i hope you like new england boiled dinner said lena now here now there a tall firmlybuilt woman the sun in the east father christmas daughter a bright lamp of a face that lit our table as she dealt out the heavy useful dishes made to stand the pound of giants fists the cutlery was solid enough to take a lions teeth a great whiff of steam rose up through which we gladly descended sinners into hell i saw the secondsplate skim by three times and felt the ballast gather in my chest my throat and at last my ears dudley stone poured me a brew he had made from wild concords that had cried for mercy he said the wine bottle empty had its green glass mouth blown softly by stone who summoned out a rhythmic onenote tune that was quickly done well ive kept you waiting long enough he said peering at me from that distance which drinking adds between people and which at odd turns in the evening seems closeness itself ill tell you about my murder ive never told anyone before believe me do you know john oatis kendall a minor writer in the twenties wasnt he i said a few books burnt out by died last week god rest him mr stone lapsed into a special brief melancholy from which he revived as he began to speak again yes john oatis kendall burnt out by the year a writer of great potentialities not as great as yours i said quickly well just wait we were boys together john oatis and i born where the shade of an oak tree touched my house in the morning and his house at night swam every creek in the world together got sick on sour apples and cigarettes together saw the same lights in the same blonde hair of the same young girl together and in our late teens went out to kick fate in the stomach and get heat on the head together we both did fair and then i better and still better as the years ran if his first book got one good notice mine got six if i got one bad notice he got a dozen we were like two friends on a train which the public has uncoupled there went john oatis on the caboose left behind crying out save me youre leaving me in tank town ohio were on the same track and the conductor saying yes but not the same train and myself yelling i believe in you john he of good heart ill come back for you and the caboose dwindling behind with its red and green lamps like cherry and lime pops shining in the dark and we yelling our friendship to each other john old man dudley old pal while john oatis went out on a dark siding behind a tin balingshed at midnight and my engine with all the flagwavers and brass bands boiled on toward dawn dudley stone paused and noticed my look of general confusion all this to lead up to my murder he said for it was john oatis kendall who in traded a few old clothes and some remaindered copies of his books for a gun and came out to this house and this room he really meant to kill you meant to hell he did bang have some more wine thats better a strawberry shortcake was set upon the table by mrs stone while he enjoyed my gibbering suspense stone sliced it into three huge chunks and served it around fixing me with his kindly approximation of the wedding guests eye there he sat john oatis in that chair where you sit now behind him outside in the smokehouse seventeen hams in our wine cellars five hundred bottles of the best beyond the window open country the elegant sea in full lace overhead a moon like a dish of cool cream everywhere the full panoply of spring and lena across the table too a willow tree in the wind laughing at everything i said or did not choose to say both of us thirty mind you thirty years old life our magnificent carousel our fingers playing full chords my books selling well fan mail pouring upon us in crisp white founts horses in the stables for moonlight rides to coves where either we or the sea might whisper all we wished in the night and john oatis seated there where you sit now quietly taking the little blue gun from his pocket i laughed thinking it was a cigar lighter of some sort said his wife but john oatis said quite seriously im going to kill you mr stone what did you do do i sat there stunned riven i heard a terrible slam the coffin lid in my face i heard coal down a black chute dirt on my buried door they say all your past hurtles by at such times nonsense the future does you see your face a bloody porridge you sit there until your fumbling mouth can say but why john what have i done to you done he cried and his eyes skimmed along the vast bookshelf and the handsome brigade of books drawn stiffly to attention there with my name on each blazing like a panthers eyes in the moroccan blackness done he cried mortally and his hand itched the revolver in a sweat now john i cautioned what do you want one thing more than anything else in the world he said to kill you and be famous get my name in headlines be famous as you are famous be known for a lifetime and beyond as the man who killed dudley stone you cant mean that i do ill be very famous far more famous than i am today in your shadow oh listen here no one in the world knows how to hate like a writer does god how i love your work and god how i hate you because you write so well amazing ambivalence but i cant take it any more not being able to write as you do so ill take my fame the easy way ill cut you off before you reach your prime they say your next book will be your finest your most brilliant they exaggerate my guess is theyre right he said i looked beyond him to lena who sat in her chair frightened but not frightened enough to scream or run and spoil the scene so it might end inadvertently calm i said calmness sit there john i ask only one minute then pull the trigger no lena whispered calmness i said to her to myself to john oatis i gazed out the open windows i felt the wind i thought of the wine in the cellar the coves at the beach the sea the night moon like a disc of menthol cooling the summer heavens drawing clouds of flaming salt the stars after it in a wheel toward morning i thought of myself only thirty lena thirty our whole lives ahead i thought of all the flesh of life hung high and waiting for me to really start banqueting i had never climbed a mountain i had never sailed an ocean i had never run for mayor i had never dived for pearls i had never owned a telescope i had never acted on a stage or built a house or read all the classics i had so wished to read all the actions waiting to be done so in that almost instantaneous sixty seconds i thought at last of my career the books i had written the books i was writing the books i intended to write the reviews the sales our huge balance in the bank and believe or disbelieve me for the first time in my life i got free of it all i became in one moment a critic i cleared the scales on one hand i put all the boats i hadnt taken the flowers i hadnt planted the children i hadnt raised all the hills i hadnt looked at with lena there goddess of the harvest in the middle i put john oatis kendall with his gunthe upright that held the balances and on the empty scale opposite i laid my pen my ink my empty paper my dozen books i made some minor adjustments the sixty seconds were ticking by the sweet night wind blew across the table it touched a curl of hair on lenas neck oh lord how softly softly it touched the gun pointed at me i have seen the moon craters in photographs and that hole in space called the great coal sack nebula but neither was as big take my word as the mouth of that gun across the room from me john i said at last do you hate me that much because ive been lucky and you not yes damn it he cried it was almost funny he should envy me i was not that much better a writer than he a flick of the wrist made the difference john i said quietly to him if you want me dead ill be dead would you like for me never to write again id like nothing better he cried get ready he aimed at my heart all right i said ill never write again what he said were old old friends weve never lied to each other have we then take my word from this night on ill never put pen to paper oh god he said and laughed with contempt and disbelief there i said nodding my head at the desk near him are the only original copies of the two books ive been working on for the last three years ill burn one in front of you now the other you yourself may throw in the sea clean out the house take everything faintly resembling literature burn my published books too here i got up he could have shot me then but i had him fascinated i tossed one manuscript on the hearth and touched a match to it no lena said i turned i know what im doing i said she began to cry john oatis kendall simply stared at me bewitched i brought him the other unpublished manuscript here i said tucking it under his right shoe so his foot was a paper weight i went back and sat down the wind was blowing and the night was warm and lena was white as appleblossoms there across the table i said from this day forward i will not write ever again at last john oatis managed to say how can you do this to make everyone happy i said to make you happy because well be friends again eventually to make lena happy because ill be just her husband again and no agents performing seal and myself happy because id rather be a live man than a dead author a dying man will do anything john now take my last novel and get along with you we sat there the three of us just as we three are sitting tonight there was a smell of lemons and limes and camellias the ocean roared on the stony coastland below god what a lovely moonlit sound and at last picking up the manuscript john oatis took it like my body out of the room he paused at the door and said i believe you and then he was gone i heard him drive away i put lena to bed that was one of the few nights in my life i ever walked down by the shore but walk i did taking deep breaths and feeling my arms and legs and my face with my hands crying like a child walking and wading in the surf to feel the cold salt water foaming about me in a million suds dudley stone paused time had made a stop in the room time was in another year the three of us sitting there enchanted with his telling of the murder and did he destroy your last novel i asked dudley stone nodded a week later one of the pages drifted up on the shore he must have thrown them over the cliff a thousand pages i see it in my minds eye a flock of white seagulls it might seem flying down to the water and going out with the tide at four in the black morning lena ran up the beach with that single page in her hand crying look look and when i saw what she handed me i tossed it back in the ocean dont tell me you honored your promise dudley stone looked at me steadily what would you have done in a similar position look at it this way john oatis did me a favor he didnt kill me he didnt shoot me he took my word he honored my word he let me live he let me go on eating and sleeping and breathing quite suddenly he had broadened my horizons i was so grateful that standing on the beach hipdeep in water that night i cried i was grateful do you really understand that word grateful he had let me live when he had had it in his hand to annihilate me forever mrs stone rose up the dinner was ended she cleared the dishes we lit cigars and dudley stone strolled me over to his officeathome a rolltop desk its jaws propped wide with parcels and papers and ink bottles a typewriter documents ledgers indexes it was all rolling to a boil in me john oatis simply spooned the froth off the top so i could see the brew it was very clear said dudley stone writing was always so much mustard and gallweed to me fidgeting words on paper experiencing vast depressions of heart and soul watching the greedy critics graph me up chart me down slice me like sausage eat me at midnight breakfasts work of the worst sort i was ready to fling the pack my trigger was set boom there was john oatis look here he rummaged in the desk and brought forth handbills and posters i had been writing about living now i wanted to live do things instead of tell about things i ran for the board of education i won i ran for alderman i won i ran for mayor i won sheriff town librarian sewage disposal official i shook a lot of hands saw a lot of life did a lot of things weve lived every way there is to live with our eyes and noses and mouths with our ears and hands weve climbed hills and painted pictures there are some on the wall weve been three times around the world i even delivered our baby son unexpectedly hes grown and married nowlives in new york weve done and done again stone paused and smiled come on out in the yard weve set up a telescope would you like to see the rings of saturn we stood in the yard and the wind blew from a thousand miles at sea and while we were standing there looking at the stars through the telescope mrs stone went down into the midnight cellar after a rare spanish wine it was noon the next day when we reached the lonely station after a hurricane trip across the jouncing meadows from the sea mr dudley stone let the car have its head while he talked to me laughing smiling pointing to this or that outcrop of neolithic stone this or that wild flower falling silent again only as we parked and waited for the train to come and take me away i suppose he said looking at the sky you think im quite insane no id never say that well said dudley stone john oatis kendall did me one other favor what was that stone hitched around conversationally in the patched leather seat he helped me get out when the going was good deep down inside i must have guessed that my literary success was something that would melt when they turned off the cooling system my subconscious had a pretty fair picture of my future i knew what none of my critics knew that i was headed nowhere but down the two books john oatis destroyed were very bad they would have killed me deader than oatis possibly could so he helped me decide unwittingly what i might not have had the courage to decide myself to how gracefully out while the cotillion was still on while the chinese lanterns still cast flattering pink lights on my harvard complexion i had seen too many writers up down and out hurt unhappy suicidal the combination of circumstance coincidence subconscious knowledge relief and gratitude to john oatis kendall to just be alive were fortuitous to say the least we sat in the warm sunlight another minute and then i had the pleasure of seeing myself compared to all the greats when i announced my departure from the literary scene few authors in recent history have bowed out to such publicity it was a lovely funeral i looked as they say natural and the echoes lingered his next book the critics cried would have been it a masterpiece i had them panting waiting little did they know even now a quartercentury later my readers who were college boys then make sooty excursions on drafty kerosenestinking shortline trains to solve the mystery of why ive made them wait so long for my masterpiece and thanks to john oatis kendall i still have a little reputation it has receded slowly painlessly the next year i might have died by my own writing hand how much better to cut your own caboose off the train before others do it for you my friendship with john oatis kendall it came back it took time of course but he was out here to see me in it was a nice day all around like old times and now hes dead and at last ive told someone everything what will you tell your friends in the city they wont believe a word of this but it is true i swear it as i sit here and breathe gods good air and look at the calluses on my hands and begin to resemble the faded handbills i used when i ran for county treasurer we stood on the station platform goodby and thanks for coming and opening your ears and letting my world crash in on you god bless to all your curious friends here comes the train ive got to run lena and i are going to a red cross drive down the coast this afternoon goodby i watched the dead man stomp and leap across the platform felt the plankings shudder saw him jump into his modelt heard it lurch under his bulk saw him bang the floorboards with a big foot idle the motor roar it turn smile wave to me and then roar off and away toward that suddenly brilliant town called obscurity by a dazzling seashore called the past about ray bradbury mr bradbury was born in waukegan illinois in his family moved to los angeles in and he was graduated from high school there in after graduation he supported himself by selling newspapers while he began to write and published his first story in among his recent productions is the screenplay of moby dick directed by john huston and starring gregory peck mr bradbury now resides in los angeles with his wife and children his first four books including the martian chronicles and the golden apples of the sun brought ray bradbury the kind of international acclaim of which the following quotation from punch is an example it is hard to speak with restraint of these extraordinary tales which raise ray bradbury to a secure place among the imaginative writers of today it is fair to say that fahrenheit took him a long step further forward in the critics and publics eyes gilbert highet called it a wonderderful story the nation said one of the most brilliant overall jobs of social satire to appear recently the times literary supplement said absorbing it has the tactile and immediate quality of very clear sight and the things seen are not ordinary the listener said bradburys style is an organic expression of personality supple incisive so moulded into his tale that matter and manner are one and indistinguishable simon and schuster will publish in mr bradburys new novel something wicked this way comes
