 chapter the pocketbook gag one of two pedestrians walking on a new york street turned pointed at the big bronze man they had just passed and said earnestly i wouldnt trade places with that bird for a million bucks the pedestrians companion also looked at the bronze man you said it he agreed i wouldnt last a day in his shoes if half of what ive heard is true if the bronze man was aware of their attention he gave no sign many persons turned to stare at him newsboys stopped shouting abruptly when they saw him but the bronze man merely went on with long elastic strides hes not often seen in public some one breathed and no wonder another exclaimed the newspapers say his enemies have made countless attempts to kill him the heads of the tallest individuals on the new york street did not top the bronze mans shoulders he was a giant yet it was only the manner in which he towered above the throng that made him seem as huge as he really was so symmetrically perfect was his great frame developed they say he can take a piece of building brick in one hand and squeeze it to dust offered a man huge cables of sinew enwrapped the bronze mans neck and enormous thews stood up as hard as bone on the backs of his hands there was a liquid smoothness about the way they flowed persons who saw the metallic mans eyes made haste in getting out of his path not that the eyes were threatening but there was something about them that compelled they were like pools of flakegold those eyes and the gold flakes were very fine and always in movement as if stirred by diminutive invisible whirlwinds strange eyes they held power and the promise of an ability to do weird things two policemen on a corner saluted the bronze giant enthusiastically hello doc savage they chorused tile mighty man who looked as if be were made of metal acknowledged the greeting with a nod and went on his features were strikingly regular unusually handsome in an emphatic muscular way more than one attractive young stenographer or clerk felt herself inexplicably moved to attempt a mild flirtation the instant she saw the big bronze fellow but the amazing giant had a manner of not seeming to see such incidents the bronze man came to a section where the sidewalk was almost deserted he stopped on the walk before him lay a small object of leather stooping be picked it up the article was a pocketbook of good quality and its plumpness hinted at a plentiful content the sinewy cables on the bronze mans hands flowed easily as he opened the purse there was a popping sound such a noise as might have been made by a stubborn cork being pulled from a bottle instantly after that the bronze man dropped the wallet and it slithered along the sidewalk for a few feet before coining to a rest the mans arms became slack his strikingly handsome head slumped forward and he began to weave slightly from side to side suddenly as if a master nerve controlling all of the muscles in his mighty frame had been severed he collapsed upon the street numerous individuals saw the bronze giant drop but one was nearer than the others this man was a bulky fellow with an extremely long nose a round puncture of a mouth and a skin which was flushed redly as if the fellow were very warm one thing particularly outstanding about the mans appearance was the manner in which he always seemed to be perspiring a little the man carried a small plain black leather case he ran toward the prone form of doc savage swooping enroute to pick up the pocketbook which the bronze man had been examining an instant before he collapsed this went into a pocket reaching doc savage the perspiring man sank to a knee as he placed his black leather case on the sidewalk it came open and those curious persons who ran up saw that it held a doctors equipment this man has been stricken by heart failure the man said loudly after a brief examination a taxicab swerved to the curb and the driver craned his neck the perspiring man stood erect and beckoned sharply at the hackman give me a hand he shouted weve got to rush this big fellow to an emergency hospital to save his life the taxi driver tumbled from his machine ran over and lent his aid to moving the recumbent doc savage the hackman was burly but the two of them grunted and strained so heavy was the giant bronze form they were carrying to the cab a cop pounded up puffing begorra whats goin on here heart trouble he was told the big bronze fellow had an overworked heart and it caved on him they managed to haul doc savage into the cab the longnosed man perspiring somewhat more freely dashed back got his bag of instruments and piled into the taxi begorra im goin along said the cop is that necessary snapped the sweating man this bronze lad be doc savage no less declared the officer the finest aint half good enough for him and im gonna see that he gets it the cop leaped into the machine behind the wheel the driver made a pass at the shift lever and the cab lunged forward the horn blared pedestrians dived aside and the cab volleyed down the street ride your horn and tromp on it called the cop tires howled as they took a corner skyscrapers shoved up close walls that shut out the sunlight so that the cab pitched through gloom on the sidewalks not many people could be seen the perspiring man dipped a hand into a coat pocket brought out a heavy blue automatic pistol and lifted it the policeman was occupied in examining doc savage and never saw the gun whip toward his own head there was the sound as of a football being kicked hard the officer let air out of his lungs and slumped head lolling the rear door of the cab opened and the cop toppled out driven by a lusty shove momentum of the car caused him to roll end over end and slam into a parked machine where he lay not seriously damaged the hack driver looked around he had freckles a loose lower lip and cigarettestained fingers when that cop piled in i figured we was sunk leaking be chuckled watch your driving growled leaking and dabbed at the perspiration on his forehead leaking now produced the billfold which had lain on the sidewalk once he had opened it there was disclosed a small flat metal phial the cork of which was yanked when the folding halves of the purse were separated neat the sinister longnosed man chuckled he never smelled a ratand when he opened it the gas in the metal phial got him before he knew what it was all about he passed the ingenious wallet forward to the freckled slacklipped driver stick this away somewhere sure the hacknian had been watching his rearview mirror to make sure there was no pursuit the cab swung west and streets became shabby a robe hung on the rack in the rear and leaking drew this over the slack form of doc savage to prevent casual observers from sighting the giant bronze man sure his nibs is alive asked the driver i dont care a hell of a lot said leaking but hes still breathing hallet wanted him alive didnt he sure any idea what that shyster has up his sleeve no said leaking shut lip and drive whose idea was that pocketbook trick mine leaking snapped and will you shut up and drive the cab passed a play street where grimy kids howled skirted tall gas tanks and a solid vast cube of bricks wherein generators wailed like banshees and from which hightension wires stretched in profusion streets became even more decrepit and the hack ran more swiftly a carbon knock tinkling under the hood they were going downtown toward the financial section now using streets which were almost deserted the machine slackened speed and turned into more populous streets after a time this is the joint said leaking the joint was a towering skyscraper of white brick modernistic impressive one of scores all resembling each other closely which shot up like cold thorns around wall street between the structure and the one adjacent was a narrow alleyway intended as a freight entrance the cab popped into this and dragged its tires to a halt the driver alighted and entered the skyscraper probably he engaged the attendant on the freight elevator in conversation for that worthy did riot appear to interfere with leaking as he unloaded doc savages great frame from the hack and not without some laboring conveyed the bronze man into the lift at the twentieth floor leaking unloaded his cargo and employed a large janitors closet for temporary storage while he returned the freight elevator to the ground level without any one being aware that he had taken it then the man rode up on a passenger lift to the twentieth floor swabbing at perspiration waited in the corridor until no one was in sight then picked doc savage up and staggered out of the janitors closet with him goldlettered on a frosted glass door was n beckell hallet attorneyatlaw leaking shoved this door open and walked in with his burden he dumped docs great frame in a swivel chair and the chair squeaked loudly across the office the sid wooden door of an inner sanctum flew open i knew it wailed the man who looked out i knew it leaking scowled and snapped you knew what hallet knew what doc savage would damage you or one of your men seriously groaned the other leakings scowl turned into a laugh as he realized that hallet was not standing where he could see docs features and had mistaken the identity of the bronze man hell chuckled leaking this is doc savage what hallet gulped incredulously then advanced gingerly to eye the bronze giant hallet was a fat man with the manners of a bird he was round and sleek and plump but there was a mincing daintiness to his movements his suit was sparrowcolored and added to his birdlike aspect as did his sharp beak of a nose it is doc savage hallet wrung his plump hands well you wanted him didnt you leaking growled yes but hallet slumped into a chair pulled a foaming square of silk handkerchief from his breast pocket and dabbed it at his neck how did you do it fake pocketbook with a doodad in it that threw gas into his face when he opened it grinned leaking i never thought you would secure him that easily hallet murmured restoring the handkerchief they say this bronze man is incredibly clever wrongdoers all over the world fear him does he look like something to be scared of now leaking jeered his name is synonymous for fear in the far corners of the earth hallet went on earnestly his life career is helping others out of trouble they say he has accomplished fabulous things feats that range from stopping a revolution in an european country to in your hat laughed leaking hes overrated here he is what do we do now tie him up hallet said hastily he minced into the other office and came back with thin stout braided cotton rope the two men grasped doc savage apparently with the idea of moving him from the chair to the floor where he could be bound with more facility but what happened was hardly the thing they anticipated there was blinding motion two slapping sounds leaking and hallet tried to cry out they made no sound for a great corded bronze hand had grasped each of them by the throat chapter thirtystory death the next few seconds offered a study in abject helplessness and an exhibition of incalculable strength the two seized men at first windmilled their arms but the awful agony of the grip on their necks seemed to surge like deadening poison through their bodies and they became limp around doc savages metallic fingers and between them the flesh of his victims all but oozed so terrific was the pressure the faces of the pair turned purple eyes ogled and tongue stuck out stiffly doc arose and the two were limp as rags hanging from his great hands they quivered a little and that was all the bronze man released them and although neither was fully unconscious they were too weak to do more than make croaking noises a search of their clothing brought the light small sums of money and billfolds containing cards leakings full name seemed to be manuel caesar dicer hallet carried a blue army automatic and leaking the slightly smaller gun with which he had clubbed the cop in the taxicab the outer office was fitted with a leather divan doc popped the two captives down on this bound their wrists and ankles securely with the same cord they had intended to use upon him and fell to eying them steadily i want to know what is behind this he said it is going to be very very unfortunate unless you start talking the captives glared exchanged glances and said nothing the globules of moisture on leakings forehead fattened broke from their moorings and chased each other downward forming little rivulets talk up doc said sharply the pair registered discomfort but held silence this was something of a feat in itself for there was a fierceness in the giant bronze mans weird flakegold eyes doc straightened suddenly swung around the office once then went into the inside room this was fitted with desk chairs ice water stand a large sheet metal clothes locker the color of grass and shelves holding innumerable law books atop a fat legal volume on torts perched a telephone scooping up the instrument doc unpronged the receiver and asked for a number his voice was low and traffic sounds from the street below the open window kept his words completely from the two in the other chamber monk doc asked when he got an answer sure said a mouselike voice doc savage now spoke rapidly but not in english the tongue he used was not unmusical composed of liquid gutturals and sharp clackings but it was doubtful if more than half a dozen people in the socalled civilized world would have understood it yet the language was the mother tongue of a race once among the most powerful and cultured the ancient mayans of central america his conversation completed doc hung up and went back to the prisoners they had been trying ineffectually to escape but desisted when they saw him i never saw either of you gentlemen before this afternoon he said in an ominously calm tone yet you go to great trouble to seize me off the street birdlike hallet trembled leaking perspired and neither let a word escape why did you seize me doc asked his voice vibrating a grim power what lid you intend to do with me this time leaking spoke hhow did you get rid of the effects of that gas so quick the gas never had any effect on me in the first place doc said wwhat leaking stuttered you underestimate the human powers of observation doc assured him dryly when you dropped that trick purse i saw you you picked it up knowing it was a trick the picking was done most carefully if you had noticed doc told him there were two logical things to suspect a poisoned needle and gas to avoid a needle i did not open the purse in the usual manner of a man who has found one and to checkmate the gas i merely held my breath until the breeze blew the vapor away but why why pretend to be overcome merely to find out what your game was and now any more questions leaking only glared then perhaps you will relieve my curiosity doc suggested why did you seize me leaking blew sweat off his upper lip and said you go to hell i violent action followed leakings profane suggestion doc savage lunged closed metallic hands upon the fellow and lifted him leaking grimaced in agony and opened his mouth wide to cry out doc corked a wadded handkerchief into the gaping maw and leaking could only squeal through his nose next doc gagged plump halet leaking was carried helplessly through the door into the inner office the door was slammed shut hallet the sparrowlike lawyer sprawled helpless on the divan and ogled the closed door he tried to move his ropes were drawn excruciatingly tight many of the strands almost buried in the fellows soft flesh and the gag distended his mouth to its greatest capacity suddenly his eyes flew wider and his jaw sagged in horror out of the inner office were coming awful thuds smackings and grunts it was as if a man were being horribly beaten you wont talk eh doc savages grim powerful voice came through the door the sound of more blows followed together with buzzing sounds that might have been a gagged man crying out in terrible pain hallet tried to scream hut his own gag made his best effort a whining and he desisted to lay panting through his nostrils round face draining of color until it had a clay hue he was the picture of a man scared out of his wits certainly the sounds emanating from the adjacent office were such as to strike horror again and again doc savages unusual voice put questions to which leaking only whizzed or whined through his nostrils or the gag removed cursed smashingly the blow thuddings always resumed more violent than before and finally there came the climax well if you wont talk out of the window you go doc boomed the window rattled up hallets face was white enough to he written upon with a pencil for he was visualizing that twentystory drop to the street and the hard sidewalk below many times he had looked down and visualized what would be the lot of one who fell hallet abruptly tried to scream through his gag he had heard a scuffling sound as of a living body pushed over the window sill a gruesome cry faintly receding followed that the connecting door leaped open doc savage came through his weird eyes hot aureate pools the tendons on his neck standing out like rifle barrels hallet sought to scream again he had never glimpsed anything which looked quite as terrible as did the bronze giant doc swept hallet up easily and carried him to the inner office the window was open and doc shoved hallet half outside look down he directed hallet looked and shook as if be had taken bold of a charged electric wire the crowd on the sidewalk below resembled flies around some dark speck of succulence while other flies came scudding across the street or climbed out of cars which were stopping a fly in blue ran for the spot tweetling a police whistle doc wrenched hallet back his great voice was a grim crashing theyll be up here to investigate in about two minutes he said you have that long to tell your story i ddont know anything hallet stuttered when his gag was out doc picked him up helplessly and ran him toward the open window and the man screeched out in chilling fright confident the bony hand of death was cupped to receive him down there in the street ill tell you everything he shrilled doc calmly carried him back into the outer office and tossed him on the leather divan why did you and our er unlucky friend leaking attempt to seize me the bronze man demanded hallet wet his lips we were hired we were to get ten thousand dollars for grabbing you and holding you where no one could find you for two weeks so some one wants me out of circulation for two weeks eh doc showed no great surprise at the news indeed now that hallet was talking the bronze features had settled into a metallic repose who hired you he continued i dont know hallet muttered doc grasped the man rumbling the window is still open fountain of youth inc hired me hallet shrieked fearfully who it was handled in a roundabout way hallet mumbled rapidly i was approached over the telephone with this proposition to seize you and hold you the party who called me said there was no need of us ever seeing each other and it would be better in fact if we didnt the only name i got was fountain of youth inc man or woman hallet squirmed i am not positive dont forget that window doc said meaningly you should know whether you talked to a man or a woman over the telephone it was a shrill unnatural voice hallet gulped i couldnt tell honestly i couldnt why did this fountain of youth inc want me held i havent the slightest idea i asked that question of course but was told that there was no necessity for me knowing docs strange eyes dwelled upon the frightened lawyer for a moment since you have no information of importance i shall have to consign you to that window it seems has fountain of youth inc got an office yes it is room the queen tower building what about a telephone yes it is in the queen tower office i had it traced so you tried on your own hook to learn something of this mysterious fountain of youth inc hallet had gotten some of his nerve back and was almost chirping birdlike when he spoke do you blame me for trying to get a line on them doc did not answer but considered although his features showed no expression there was a certain finality about his manner which indicated that he was sure hallet had no more information to reveal doc swung into the next office hallet could see the bronze man through the open door doc went to the big grassgreen clothes locker and opened it sight of the object which rolled out caused hallet to turn very purple in the face leaking had been in the locker bound and gagged he fell out when doc pulled the door ajar and his garments made moist squishings so profusely had he perspired leaking was uninjured i thought i thought the words choked hallet up and he could not finish the power of suggestion doc assured him dryly a few noises some words and you got the idea he had gone out of the window but the body on the street ever hear of my five assistants doc asked yyes hallet mumbled but wwhat one of them monk by name played the part of the body in the street doc explained shortly new yorkers are curious souls and they all ran to see what a man could be lying on the sidewalk for that naturally made monks trick very lifelike you see monk was summoned by telephone oh hallet swallowed i remember i did think i heard you phoning leaking when the gag was removed from his jaws swore choice profanity in a low voice that dripped rage when it was suggested that he tell what he knew he only snarled of a different caliber was this leaking a block of a jaw and ugly eyes showed determination offering a hint that to get information from him would take application of a more moving thirddegree method than had urged hallet to talk my assistant monk who played the dead man in the street will be up here shortly doc stated with him will be another of my group of five aides ham by the way ham is a lawyer of no little reputation and may want to take measures to have you hallet barred from practice hallet scowled leaking went on profaning in a guttural hoarse monotone the afternoon sun sloped through the both offices throwing shadows into the fear lines on hallets face and glistening on the wetness that filmed leakings features an elevator doer clanked in the corridor outside then feet tramped the hallway they approached the office door that will be my two men doc said he walked over and yanked the door ajar a man came in holding a revolver straight out in front of his chest aint i the lucky one savage he gritted get them hands high chapter mister santini the man with the gun was the freckled looselipped taxi driver who had helped leaking kidnap doc savage the automatic in his cigarettebrowned fingers was a large one behind the driver strolled half a dozen other men they were tough looking after the modern style too fancy of dress with a sleek unnatural manner about them the manner of men long accustomed to acting either very bad or very innocent all held weapons got rid of the hack and was comin back here with the boys growled the driver we saw some funny stuff downstairs a guy layin on the sidewalk that tipped us off to come up here with our rods ready watch that savage snarled hallet from the floor hes covered the driver snorted then much louder get back get back doc savage was advancing apparently heedless of the leveled pistol the taxi driver jabbed the gun threateningly it was pointed at docs chest ill plug you the man blustered sprawled on the divan leaking comprehended docs intention and tried to yell a warning the guys probably got a bulletproof vest he howled point your rod at his head too late doc leaped his arms were up clear of the line of fire and he twisted as he came in the gun smacked thunder and the bullet opened a long rip in the bronze mans coat below the left armpit then gouged stuffing out of the divan on which leaking and hallet sprawled doc by twisting had caused the slug merely to scrape across his bulletproof vest the driver swore tried to fire again there was a dull impact none present were quite sure they saw doc strike the blow but the hackmans nose was suddenly a flat scarlet stringing pulp and he was gagging to keep from swallowing dislodged teeth he fell down on all fours concerned exclusively with his own pain the other men were not yet inside doc banged the door it had a spring lock and would hold for a time swinging into the inner office he closed and locked that door behind him a pistol whooped in the corridor the bullet puncturing the door made a round daisy of splinters then scooped leaves out of a law book which lay on the reception desk you dopes leaking shrilled youll hit us bust the door down somebody kicked the frosted glass out of the outer door reached in and turned the spring lock which was better than breaking the panel down the six men came inside gingerly guns darting here and there so that they rather ridiculously resembled movie bad men except for the killer expressions on their faces the inner office hallet grated get him and tie us loose i mean turn us loose the excitement twisted his tongue hallet and leaking were freed by the use of sharp knives they had to be helped to their feet so taut had been their bindings the inner door resisted kicking they shouted angrily for doc to open up got no response then lighted on the great idea of picking up the reception desk and hurling it at the door this knocked the door off its hinges the catwalking across the threshold guns ready was repeated they peered about bewildered gone hallet gulped leaking mindful of his own incarceration sidled over and yanked open the grasscolored locker but it was empty and he stood cursing swiping at his moist forehead with first one coat sleeve then the other was there a rope or somethin in here that he couldve used to slide down to the ground he demanded the only rope was the one he used to tie us hallet disclaimed a man ran over to the window and looked out and down then drew back growling no sign of im leaking whipped to the window and gave close attention to the nature of the brick walls they were very smooth the bricks being set with a minimum of mortar and the mortar not grooved but smooth and flush with the masonry itd take a good fly to stick on that wall leaking growled i always did hear this doc savage wasnt quite human a man mumbled shut up leaking told him lets look around that bronze guy went somewhere the telephone rang loudly the men started as if something totally unexpected had happened then looked sheepish and hallet went over his gait more birdlike than usual to answer the instrument the conversation lasted for a long minute with hallet saying nothing except yes at intervals but finally he put in a complete sentence we got doc savage but be escaped he said explosives came from the receiver after which hallet hurriedly explained exactly what had occurred and judging from the way his neck turned red took a cursing he hung up and stood adjusting a sleeve of his sparrowcolored coat eying his companions the meanwhile that was fountain of youth inc he said but it wasnt the same voice that usually calls me i could tell this one was a man did this bird give his name leaking demanded he did said to call him santini santini eh any first handle none just santini he said to come to the office of fountain of youth inc at once and if he wasnt there to give us orders there would be an envelope under the blotter on his desk with our directions inside why didnt you tell him to go to hell leaking snarled and mopped sweat this is worth more than were getting santini said there would be seven onethousanddollar bills in the envelope hallet smirked i forgot to tell you gentlemen that the money is by way of a bonus leaking stopped mopping and laughed that makes it different lets set sail bozos they swung around apparently having decided to dismiss the problem of doc savages disappearance for the time being and made for the outer door but before they reached the aperture the wrecked panel swung ajar so forcibly that portions of the shattered glass fell out a man looked inside the office and said in a tiny mild voice im looking for a man named doc savage the newcomer was a study in evolution his height barely topped five feet but he would trip the scales at better than two hundred and sixty pounds his face was incredibly home only in a pleasant way and great beams of arms dangled well below his knees his eyes were small and bright big mouth was so large that it looked as if there had been an accident in its making exposed portions of his skin were stuck full of hairs which resembled lengths of rusty barbed wire hallet gulped flopped his arms like wings swallowed and got words out monk he squawled this is monk one of doc savages five men ive seen his picture in the newspapers pistol snouts leaped in monks direction like an ungainly ape the hairy fellow bounced back out of sight behind monk in the corridor crouched a slender wasp of a man whose clothing was sartorial perfection and who carried a black expensivelooking cane in leaping back monk bounced into this dandified gentleman and almost upset him drat you rapped the nattily clad man watch where youre going get outa the way ham monk grunted theres eight guys in there most of em with guns the two backed hastily down the corridor hands dipped into their coats and from carefully contrived armpit holsters drew strangelooking weapons which perhaps bore more of a resemblance to oversized automatics than anything else to the firing mechanisms of these were attached curled magazines any sign of doc ham demanded nope monk suddenly tightened on the trigger of his strange gun from the ejector empty brass cartridges climbed so rapidly that they looked like a brass wire simultaneously the weapon emitted an earsplitting roar a man had looked out of hallets law office and the fellow suddenly went limp and fell out into the hallway his companions grabbed his heels which were still in the office and hauled him out of sight voices came out of the office he aint dead barked the taxi drivers coarse tone he evidently referred to monks victim looks like the slugs flattened and burst when they got under his skin mercy bullets said hallets voice theyre hulls filled with a chemical which produces unconsciousness ive read about em in the papers them two guys must be usin the supermachine pistols that doc savage is supposed to have invented growled leaking after that there was more conversation but it was pitched so low that the words failed to reach monk and ham the latter two had stopped down the corridor and were exchanging compliments you dumb missing link the dapper ham advised you hairy freak you certainly stirred up something when you walked up and shoved your ugly face through that door i wanted to see if doc was in there said the smallvoiced monk and if you keep on callin me names im gonna shove you out where them redhots can get a shot at you the two glared at each other then as if each had been nauseated by sight of the other both spat on the floor where could doc have gone ham pondered suppose you dope it out with that great legal brain of yours monk invited out of hallets office sailed a metal canister this clankclankclanked down the corridor suddenly went plop and vanished in a wad of vile fumes of its own spewing tear gas monk howled his small voice abruptly vast roaring he and ham dived for the nearest stairway they stopped one flight down and exchanged black hateful looks if you had kept that noisy trap shut we could have heard em gettin ready to throw that crybaby gritted monk ham sneered expressively and his slenderfingered hands tugged at his black cane and it telescoped from a point near the handle thus disclosing that it was in reality a sword cane with a blade which looked razorsharp one of these days im gonna see if theres a man under that hairy hide he promised listen advised monk theres something going on upstairs they strained their ears catching numerous small sounds that probably were foot scufflings together with certain grunts and low words the meaning of these dawned sharply theyre takin the freight elevator down monk howled he sprinted down the hallway and sloped around a corner ham at his heels the fact that these two seemed continually on the point of coming to blows appeared to have little effect on their teamwork they reached the sliding freight elevator door this naturally could only be opened from inside the shaft ham tapped it with his sword cane the panel was of steel and sounded solid monk drew back and gave the panel a resounding kick but with no results he reached for hams sword cane gimme that tin toothpick no said ham what do you want to do ill do it see if you can loosen the locking device while i shove on the door monk directed at that point the cage passed downward with a noisy sigh this caused the two to redouble their efforts ham fishing through the crack between the halves of the door with his sword cane and monk shoving heavily the door came open far below the cage promptly stopped due to the safety device which cut off the current the instant the door was open monk shoved his nubbin of a head inside peered down and snapped back as a bullet climbed squealing in the shaft we got em he grinned theyre between floors and cant do a thing but shoot up through the grilled roof of the cage look down again and make sure ham suggested yeah and get shot monk hauled out his superfirer pistol examined the magazine indicator then leered at ham im a great big black cloud and im gonna rain on them guys you dont talk like you had good sense ham assured him but go ahead its not a bad idea monk prepared to fire but instead of doing so looked over his shoulder and started violently doc savage stood far enough down the corridor that distance made him seem less of the metallic giant than he was until his stature chanced to be compared with the nearby office doors let them go said the giant bronze man ham and monk promptly let the sliding doors of the freight elevators swish shut then they joined doc doc savage had a passenger elevator waiting and they entered this without delay at the bronze mans gesture the lift sank whistling a little whered you go doc monk demanded for answer the bronze man said no word but simply drew from a pocket a collapsible metal grappling hook to the shank of which was affixed a slender and very stout silken cord huh monk grunted slid from the office window down to the window below then loosened the grapple by flipping the cord doc explained were they puzzled plumb stunned from the sound of it monk grinned the passenger cage let them out in the lobby they ran around to the alleylike freight entrance but a swiftly receding taxi was all that they saw of their quarry that the cab carried hallet and the others they were sure due to the heavy way in which the machine was laden and because they saw hallets face against the rear window less than a minute later doc savage had secured another hack the queen tower building he directed monk began but doc no chance of trailing that gang doc explained anyway i think they will head for the queen tower building the office of fountain of youth inc is there whats fountain of youth inc monk demanded that is one thing i want to find out doc told the homely gorilla of a fellow the other puzzle is why did that gang seize me fountain of youth inc whatever that is seems to have hired them but why they mulled over the enigma in silence as their cab jerked and honked its way through downtown new york traffic but after a few moments monk and ham gave up the problem and fell to glowering at each other an onlooker would have sworn they were about to fly at each others throats the manner they bore toward each other was deceptive however for each would risk his life to preserve the other and both had done so on occasion their cab finally groaned to a stop queen tower building gents said the driver the queen tower was one of the newer structures in lower manhattan which meant its front was a symphony in black and white and shiny metals its lobby was spouting humanity for the quitting hour of office workers was at hand doc slid out of the cab then he seemed to explode so suddenly was he back in the machine a man had stepped from the throng he presented a startling appearance due largely to his amazing mustache this was extremely black no thicker than a pencil at the base and each wing was fully three inches long it resembled a pair of oversize cat whiskers the man wore a brilliant red ribbon slantwise across his shirt front and his afternoon garb was faultless a pearlgray derby topped off the ensemble even in new york his appearance commanded attention but what interested doc savage and his two aides was the flat automatic the stranger was plucking from under the tails of his afternoon coat the weapon glinted pearl and gold inlay as it came up the gun whacked two windows fell out of the cab as the bullet passed through oh damn me shrieked the driver he spilled out of the front seat and ran down the middle of the street not looking back doc and his two men got out almost as quickly hitting the sidewalk on the side opposite the gunman monk and ham had their superfirer pistols out docs hands were empty for he never carried a firearm depending rather upon his wits and his scientific devices monk tried to shoot under the cab at the man with the unique mustache but the fellow was running jumping high a poor target the next instant he popped into the queen tower dang jackrabbit monk grunted doc savage and his two men reached the queen tower entrance together and surged inside a wake of howling excited office workers showed the route their quarry had taken toward the rear the chase led past the elevators through a small door down unfinished stairs and out a rear door which gave upon an odorous side street a heavy fast coupe was swerving away from the curb the mustached gunman was at the wheel monk lifted his machine pistol and it moaned the bullets only flattened against the coupe glass the homely chemist tried for the tires he knocked off bits of rubber but the tires did not go down the coupe roiled on reeled around a distant corner and vanished they sought to find a taxi in which to push a pursuit but the quarry was hopelessly gone before they got a hack lined out on the trail that mug had the coupe waitin for a getaway monk grumbled it was some boat had bulletproof glass and solid rubber tires wonder who be was ham pondered that question was answered in the lobby of the queen tower for it developed that the proprietor of the lobby cigar stand had not only seen the running gunman but knew his identity that was mr santini the proprietor explained and who is mr santini doc queried the president of fountain of youth inc chapter the unseen message an elevator let them out on the fourteenth floor of the queen tower building and they walked toward a door which bore the legend they were seeking fountain of youth inc mr santini seemed to know us by sight monk said grimly his homely face solemn that doesnt mean anything you accident of nature ham pointed out sharply docs picture appears often in newspapers and magazines sure shyster monk sneered nobody but you would think of that doc savage studying the door of the office put in the thing which puzzles me most is why these men should be so anxious to get us out of the way doc was listening his sense of hearing was fabulously keen due to a scientific device an apparatus emitting sound waves of a frequency above and below the audible range with which he attuned his ears for a certain period each day as a part of a twohour exercise routine that he had not missed taking each twentyfour hours for many years seems to be no one inside he said he tried the knob found the door locked and employed a small curved metal device which he removed from a pocket this was an especially designed lock picker and opened the door within a few moments the offices beyond outer reception chamber and two inner rooms were sumptuous to an extreme the furniture being of genuine mahogany the upholstery leather soft and rich and the carpeting deep and silky the latest in automatic typewriters dictaphones and announcing devices were installed doc savage made one rapid circuit and ascertained that do one was present then began a slower and more intensive scrutiny his strange golden eyes missed little there were words emblazoned on the door of one of the inner offices q santini president in that room alongside a rich desk doc picked up a crumpled envelope to which he gave particular attention although outwardly it seemed little different from much other wadded paper whats so interesting about that monk wanted to know doc produced a magnifying glass that the homely chemist might discern what the bronze mans highly developed eyes had noticed the paper was moist as if crumpled in a perspiring palm one of the fellows who grabbed me was called leaking probably because of some strange affliction which makes him perspire a great deal he explained only a man who sweats freely would have damp palms on a day like this the bronze man now gave attention to the desk in a drawer was a pad of plain white paper together with a package of envelopes which matched the one he had found on the floor if there had been a message in the envelope it was logical to suspect that it might have been written on the pad out of docs clothing came a tiny metal device the principal gadget on which was a small reservoir filled with a liquid the color of coagulated blood doc held the paper pad over this and flicked a lever causing the apparatus to give off a vapor after a moment doc examined the pad the vapor had caused it to change color slightly vague but clearly readable writing had appeared this is the message which was written on the top leaf of the pad he explained ham fumbled his sword cane and looked bewildered but how did you bring it out doc returned his apparatus to a pocket in a special toolcarrying vest which he wore a vest cleverly enough padded that its presence was not noticeable to the chance observer the application of iodine vapor to bring out impressions left by a pencil point is not exactly new he said lets read this monk and ham came close to read what the paper held the penmanship was firm rounded very readable hallet kel avery in on eight oclock plane from florida and must be prevented from communicating with doc savage better grab and hold for me santini oh oh monk grinned now were getting places leaking and hallet and their gang beat us here and got the message doc decided then the bronze man continued his search of the office suite of fountain of youth inc aint we gonna do nothin about this message monk questioned using a type of grammar that gave little hint that he was one of the most highly educated industrial chemists living its twenty minutes after five doc replied that gives us two hours and forty minutes before this florida plane bearing kel avery arrives at docs words ham surreptitiously eyed an expensive wrist watch which he wore the time was exactly twenty after five a fact which caused ham to sheath and unsheath his sword cane thoughtfully for he knew doc carried no watch and there was no clock in sight in the office to hams recollection they had not passed a clock within half an hour docs uncanny ability to judge the passage of time was something at which the dapper lawyer had never ceased to marvel doc came to a filing cabinet of metal painted to resemble mahogany and unearthed cards which held his attention the cards were large indexed alphabetically and each bore a name look here the big man of metal suggested monk came over and riffled through the index for the love of mud he said smallvoiced this looks like a whos who of the towns moneybags an index of the richest men in new york city doc agreed and drew out a second drawer and here are other files of wealthy individuals their names listed by states ham joined them tucked his sword cane under an arm and inspected the files every rich man in america he murmured then he pointed at a small silver star which had been pasted on a card wonder what this means docs supple fingers traveled back and forth through the cards a few times he found more silver stars and gold one as well youll notice the cards give not only the mans name and the probable size of his fortune but also his age and the state of his health the old and feeble men rate gold stars while those around fifty are marked with silver stars the younger and more healthy men are not marked ham twirled his innocentlooking black stick get it doc doc nodded im afraid i do get it get what monk demanded ill explain hairy stupid ham began the men marked with gold stars are the phone rang doc savage swung to the instrument scooped it up seemed to hesitate and consider for the briefest of intervals then spoke from his lips came an astoundingly exact reproduction of the brisk birdlike voice of attorney hallet monk and ham grinned in appreciation although they had heard the bronze mans unusual command of voice mimicry exercised on other occasions the office of fountain of youth inc doc said quietly kel avery can be found at fish lane said a mans voice over the wire the voice was surprising it sounded youthful and as full of bubbling life as a mountain brook a voice which suggested a rather ridiculous vision of a boy joyfully turning handsprings as he spoke doc savage began in hallets tones but i thought kel avery was on a plane bound foah new yawk said the spontaneous voice you are mistaken kel avery is at fish lane so exuberant was the voice that the pronounced accent of the south had not been noticeable at first but as the informant spoke this second time the twist of speech was more apparent on certain words who is this doc demanded impersonating hallet the receiver does not seem to bring your voice clearly enough for me to recognize it you nevah heard mah voice before mistah hallet said the tone of youth then who are you you know my voice you take care of kel avery advised the other ill explain who ah am later the distant receiver went clank on its hook doc savage put his own instrument down slowly eyes on his two men that was the strangest voice he said it sounded indescribably young and joyful as if it belonged to an irresponsible lad whatd he say monk queried that kel avery was at fish lane fish lane is out in them flushing marshes monk said slowly the district is not so hot ham brandished his sword cane and put in but i thought this mysterious kel avery was on a plane to arrive from florida at eight oclock instead of commenting doc savage lifted the phone again and requested a number to be found only in private lists which never went beyond the walls of the telephone company offices it was the number of docs officelaboratoryiibrary on the eightysixth floor of the citys most impressive skyscraper a gentleman with a scholastic voice and a remarkable command of big words answered doc gave him a brief synopsis of what had occurred lookit habeas monk exploded howd that hog get down here habeas corpus was galloping toward them great ears flopping like wings the shoat no larger than a small dog presented such a grotesque picture that pedestrians halted and rubbered ham leveled his sword cane what do you know about that he was indicating a long somberlooking sedan parked at the curb this machine he had recognized as belonging to doc savage there could be no mistake for he had ridden in it numerous times and moreover it bore the distinctive license plates which the bronze man was permitted to use a young woman got out of the sedan habeas corpus squealing delightedly pawed at monk like a dog cut that out or ill kick you out from between your ears grunted monk who was interested in the girl pretty girls always intrigued monk greatly and this one was a knockout doc savage ordinarily did not let his features register much expression but now he was looking a little astounded doc had a fixed policy which he had adhered to for a long time and that was to steer clear of feminine entanglements the life he led was too perilous to permit such for enemies would not hesitate to strike at him through any young woman upon whom he might permit his affections to dwell that a young woman should be alighting from his car was entirely surprising then she turned and they saw her face pat savage monk howled patricia savage tall exquisitely moulded had the same remarkable bronze hair as doc savage himself they were cousins and doc had last seen her in western canada months before when he and his five aides had gone through some perilous adventures in tracking down a gang who had slain patricias father doc went forward eagerly which was something unusual for the bronze man ordinarily he felt uncomfortable in the presence of young women especially girls as entrancing as patricia but pat was an exception pat was something of a twofisted scrapper herself and almost as unique in her way as the big doc was in his tell renny and long tom the yarn johnny the bronze man directed then the three of you head for fish lane investigate this kel avery report monk and ham and myself will be here for ten or fifteen minutes longer will you join us later at this piscatorial thoroughfare of fish lane asked the bigworded johnny right exactly what is your present whereabouts doc gave him the address of fountain of youth inc then asked why it was a rare thing when johnny laughed but he laughed now you are going to get a surprise doc he chuckled and with that he hung up doc savage was thoughtful as be replaced the receiver johnny does not go in for playful mysteries as a usual thing be pondered aloud i wonder what is on his mind maybe his big words finally made him dizzy monk grinned more likely his association with you has gotten him down you hairy mistake ham said unkindly the pleasantly ugly monk scowled and registered injury im gonna tell habeas on you he muttered seriously hams grip on his sword cane tightened habeas corpus was monks pet pig a bigeared longlegged shoat which was fully as ridiculous a looking member of the pork family as monk was of the human race doc went through the file containing the data on americas most wealthy men one card was dogeared with thumb marks as if it had been handled more than the others the card bore the name of thackeray hutchinson a banker who was among the wealthiest and whom the united states government had once tried to convict of illegal practices in connection with the failure of a public utilities project the charge had been defeated by clever lawyers doc got thackeray hutchinson on the telephone then stated that he wished information on fountain of youth inc never heard of it snapped the pompous banker and hung up he was lying said doc who was a judge of voice expression well investigate him more thoroughly a bit later they rode an elevator down to the street on the sidewalk they halted and stared i got tired of the woods pat smiled johnny and the others told me i could catch you here if i hurried there was no gushing display of affection she and doc merely shook hands warmly i brought habeas along pat told monk laughingly monk took in her smart frock her chic hat and the slender silk of her ankles golly pat he said grinning from one ear to the other you sure make these city gals look rusty thanks for bringing habeas ham here will appreciate that ham scowled at monk bowed graciously to pat havent you two settled your quarrel yet pat laughed one of these days ill lose my temper ham said grimly then theyll be hunting for a coffin wide enough to hold that ape doc savage indicated the car well talk on the way uptown pat but im afraid well have to drop you at the office until we get a matter settled a matter pat asked curiously sounds interesting theres a plot afoot monk imparted or rather some other cookies are plotting something im going along pat declared firmly ive missed all the excitement we had while you fellows were up in my country to tell the truth it was in hopes of seeing some action that i came down to visit you doc shook his head its dangerous or may be aw doc monk grumbled pats regular what we went through in canada proves that doc surrendered all right they entered the sedan doc taking the wheel the machine did not look new or particularly efficient but the motor came to life under the hood with scarcely a sound and the quiet power of their departure from the curb indicated costly gears and great power the yearning to hunt trouble must run in the savage blood said pat gentlemen i yearn for some action here it is doc rapped abruptly and stepped heavily on the power brakes a taxi had sloughed crosswise of the narrow street it was the same cab which had been used a bit earlier by leaking to kidnap doc men materialized with sinister abruptness out of the crowds on the sidewalk some carried trombone cases and others long hand bags they snapped them open out came sawedoff rifles shotguns a machine gun or two patricia savage slid off the seat onto the floorboards opening her chic hand bag as she did so out of the bag came an enormous muchworn singleaction sixshooter the gun had neither trigger nor sights and a fanning spur had been welded onto the hammer monk and ham wrenched out superfirer pistols theres that santini bird monk rapped ham squinting at the gunmen rushing toward the car added and theres hallet and leaking santini resplendent in red chest ribbon and catwhisker mustache was one of the attackers who depended only on a hand weapon he held his pearlandgold inlaid automatic tutto ad un tratto he howled all at once let them have it the close confines of the street quaked thundered and echoed with the crash of guns fully a dozen men had surrounded the sedan and all fired simultaneously machine gun and automatic pistol ejectors sprayed empty cartridges on the pavement it seemed impossible that those in the sedan could live under that storm of powderdriven metal chapter the hanging man fish lane was an unpaved rut which ran out into the bog that was the upper end of flushing bay this bog was furred with tall coarse salt water grass and along the lane stood a few shacks of wood tar paper and tin most of these structural materials apparently having come from neighboring junk heaps a car crawled quietly into fish lane a long streamlined machine with a fishtail back and pants over the wheels it stopped the man who first alighted from the machine had hands of startling size huge and knobby they eclipsed the other proportions of their owner who would weight in excess of two hundred and fifty pounds and who was gaunt and bony wearing a long solemn funerealgoing expression he asked of some one still in the car fish lane is where doc said to come wasnt it johnny eminently correct renny said johnnys scholastic voice johnny was a scarecrow of bones except that the garments were hung on his frame were of excellent quality nowhere on his skeleton did there seem to be even a normal muscle far less any surplus flesh dangling from his shirt lapel was a monocle on a ribbon they were a strange pair these two renny was known all over the world for his ability and accomplishments as an engineer having constructed bridges dams power plants railroads in many countries the bony johnny was equally famous in his field of archaeology and geology and he had formerly been the head of the natural science research department of a famous university an environment which perhaps had given him his love of big words bigfisted rennys engineer associates knew him as colonel john renwick while scholastic gentlemen knew johnny as william harper littlejohn gaunt johnny peered into the car and advised alight electrophobia the man who now got out of the car stuffing a tangle of wires and delicate electrical apparatus into a door pocket as he did so looked pale and almost feeble alongside the great bigfisted renny he seemed almost an invalid a fact that was deceptive however for the giant renny would have hesitated about mixing in a fight with the puny looking one knowing him as he did the apparent invalid was major thomas j roberts long tom to his intimates an electrical wizard extraordinary these three were the other members of doc savages group of five remarkable assistants and each was an expert a socalled genius in his line although in their case as in most others genius and hard work and protracted study renny pointed with his huge fist theres the place where this kel avery is supposed to be fish lane the building at fish lane was grayishly shabby and resembled a barred rock hen nested in a tangle of brush shingles were scabbing off the roof tin cans had been split and nailed over knotholes in the upanddown plank walls and sacks and old clothing were wadded in place of missing windowpanes the flushing elevated tracks were not far away and a train passed on it making much clank and rumble that joint isnt much renny rumbled we wont need to wait for doc lets take it they were all agreed on the idea and they went forward docs word had been to await his arrival but they knew the bronze man had made that statement in a general fashion rather than a literal one if there had been any apparent need for needing docs consummate skill in the present instance the three would have waited but to learn whether kel avery was in the shack or not seemed but a simple matter doc savages five men were not puppets who did the bronze mans bidding they were men of training of sharp mentality and had a habit of going ahead on their own initiative sometimes they made mistakes more often they did not turning into the ramshackle building they stepped over a fallen fence and trod a furrow through the brush and weeds where feet had trampled in one spot they noticed tracks the prints of long narrow shoes embedded in the moist loam seems to have been only the one guy walking in and out here rumbled bigfisted renny another train passed noisily on the nearby elevated gaining the door the three men knocked but there was no answer gaunt johnny shifted to a knothole uncovered by tin and pasted his right eye to the aperture his violent start was plainly visible to both renny and long tom and he used a pet ejaculation which he saved for occasions of supreme shock ill be superamalgamated he exploded renny and long tom reached his side in concerted leaps they clapped eyes in turn to the knothole and each tensed then renny bounded back to the door there was blurred motion a crash and splinters climbed in a cloud around renny with one blow he had sent an enormous fist through the door it was a remarkable exhibition of iron ruggedness but johnny and long tom showed no surprise for they had seen its equal and had heard rennys frequent boast that no wooden door was made with a panel so stout that he could not smash through with one swing of the monstrosities which he called fists weakened the door collapsed the three men dived inside they gazed upward the instant they were across the threshold horrible johnny breathed revolting damn bad agreed pale long tom the trash of years of abandonment lay about the room and from the rotting floor in one corner had sprouted a few toadstools paper had peeled from the walls long ago while marauding boys had belted glass out of the windows with stones and the glass reposed in shattered fragments over the floor the door of a closet hung askew half closed from the partition between the shacks two rooms the door was missing entirely only hinges that clung like rusty scabs showing that there had been one eyes of the three men remained fixed overhead where the ceiling lath had long since been torn away to leave the attic naked and exposed to its highest recess except for the twobyfour timbers to which the laths had been nailed they were not calloused men these five aides of docs although they had walked long in the shadow of violence and peril they were not beyond being gripped by a scene of horror they were gripped now from the roof peak stretched a rope which was a yard in length and terminated around the neck of a man the mans feet dangled off one of the twobyfours a distance of a foot or so the hanging man had a white beard which came nearly to his belt and it covered the front of his chest like the stiff front of a dress shirt his hair was white and very long snowy beard and hair lending him a most striking appearance his face was darkly purple from the throttling effect of the rope quick boomed renny he may be alive renny and johnny prepared to lift long tom the lighter of the three up to loosen the hanging one then their hair all but stood on end the hands of the man on the rope were crossed they moved with flashing speed darting inside his coat reappearing each hand held a blue revolver the bearded one squirmed and his feet found a twobyfour crosspiece he shook his head violently and loosened the rope from his neck it all happened in the space of a finger snap before the three men below could do a thing bettah keep yoah hands in sight the stranger advised chapter dan thunden very slowly so that the whitebearded man with the two blue guns could see each move renny and johnny lowered long tom back to the floor then rennys huge fists knotted and unknotted angrily take it easy long tom warned this guy took us in what i mean the whiskered one dropped down to the floor white hair flying there was a weird lightness and agility about his movements his features were unusual also they had the lines of a man of fifty yet the skin was clear and the eyes had a youthful sparkle stand still advised the gunman in a youthful drawling voice im going to search yoah pockets his bony but agile fingers brought to view from armpit holsters worn by docs three men a trio of the unique supermachine pistols which were the bronze mans invention he fumbled these obviously curious about their mechanism renny thought he saw his chance he lashed a big hand at the whitebearded one the results were choking to renny there was a whistling sound a bonki noise renny sat down heavily eyelids fluttering he had been hit between the eyes with one of the blue revolvers and the blow had come so swiftly that be had not even seen it long tom and johnny stared they had just witnessed speed such as they had imagined only one man could possess doc savage why didnt santini hallet and leaking come instead of sendin you gentlemen asked the remarkable whitehaired man dryly are you kel avery long tom demanded the other juggled the two blue guns slowly are you tryin to kid me are you kel avery repeated long tom the thatch of white hair shook no suh and you should know that hem in santinis gang the electrical wizard frowned wrong whiskers were not working for santini save that guff suh snapped the other ah dont believe you can talk fast enough to fool old dan thunden dan thunden long tom grunted that your name dan thunden laughed loudly boyishly just as if santini hadnt told you i tell you were not shut up the blue guns jutted angrily gaunt johnny put in calmvoiced would you condescend to answer a single interrogation dan thunden threw his white hair back with a headsnapping gesture what is yoah question how old are you johnny asked using small words for once one hundred and thirtyone yeahs old dan thunden said promptly rennys jaw sagged long tom and johnny looked little less shocked a dang lie long tom snapped nobody could be as spry as you are at that age dan thundens white whiskers bristled indignantly and he seemed on the point of putting up a vociferous argument instead he spun toward the door doc savage stood there his great bronze frame almost filling the opening behind him were the homely monk and swordcanecarrying ham the three of them had approached with great silence thunden leveled a gun at the door roared yoah hands up suh but doc was already hurtling forward thundens gun convulsed the shack quaked with powder roar doc was moving with the full coordination of his tremendous muscles and the bullet missed a wall board split as the lead clouted it there was no time for a second shot thunden ducked wildly as docs great hands grasped for him he got clear dancing aside johnny jumped for the whitehaired man who said his his age was a hundred and thirtyone thunden threw a blue gun it took johnny in the middle the bony geologist folded face distorted tongue protruding monk came in from the rear with the speed of a great cat thunden hurled his second gun monk wailed and wrapped both hands over the top of his bullet of a head where the weapon struck he sank to the floor his wail turning into a howl of rage and pain all of him but his vocal apparatus seemed paralyzed the next few seconds held action as docs five men had never before witnessed they had seen many fights but never one in which their bronze chief had been pitted against a man anywhere near his own equal in agility dan thunden could not possibly possess the herculean strength of the bronze giant but the whitehaired old fellow did move with an unearthly speed time after time doc seemed oh the point of grasping thunden only to have the strange fellow get clear they flashed to the ends of the room two men of superhuman abilities dan thunden did not have an easy time of it however at first when he had carelessly used his guns to lay out monk and johnny he had seemed supremely confident of his own ability a grin had been on his aged but remarkably healthy looking face but the grin faded he began to look worried you sho are no ordinary man he gulped and his expression was that of a man who had met something he did not believe existed leaping desperately he reached a window glass and aged wood exploded as he went through it headfirst surprisingly enough he managed to land on his feet outside and started running the window was too small to pass docs big frame in a hurry and he had to swing around and out through the door that lost him time thunden had gained yards renny and docs other men piled into the chase johnny bringing up the rear still had his arms across his middle and groaned with each jump it became evident that dan thunden was no match for doc in a straight race the bronze man overhauled the bearded fellow thunden stopped whirled a gun a tiny flat hideaway automatic came from inside the waistband of his trousers down doc rapped and flattened with his men thundens bullet made an ugly hissing as it cut through the brush and salt water grass shot echoes slammed then came jarring back in fainter echoes from the distant walls of flushing warehouses white whiskers seems to be a walkin armory monk growled and snapped the safety off on his machine pistol the superfirer hooted brush and grass toppled as if mowed the homely chemist emptied an entire drum then reared up to observe effects he slapped down again in wild haste dan thunden had crawled through the salt grass and now fired from a spot fifty yards from where he had last been seen despite monks mad speed in flattening he might well have been shot had it not been for bronzehaired patricia savage who sent a bullet snapping near thunden startling the white haired one into aiming badly pat was in the sedan parked a short distance up fish lane she had remained in the car as a lookout dan thunden got away reaching a paved street which abutted on the marsh ground and running up that until he had the good fortune to encounter a prowling taxi he paused an instant before leaping into the cab to yell at his pursuers if you dont believe im a hundred and thirtyone yeahs old look up the records on the skippah of the sea nymph a schoonah that sailed from new york in he shouted then menacing the driver of the taxi with his gun thunden forced the cab to carry him away in great haste farther up the street children were playing and that prevented doc and the others from using their superfirers or pat her singleaction sixgun pat plugging fresh shells into her big revolver as doc came up grinned widely two fights and ive only been with you half an hour she laughed talk about leading violent lives bigfisted renny overheard that and was puzzled two fights he demanded pat indicated the sedan with a slender capable hand the car windows had a frosty appearance and were pocked paint was knocked off the body renny nodded soberly comprehending windows and car body were of bulletproof construction indications were that the machine had recently been in the path of a barrage santini hallet and leaking and their gang jumped us pat explained for the benefit of renny long tom and johnny stopped our car by blocking the street with a taxi then they ran out with guns and cut loose what happened renny boomed i aged ten years wondering if the sedan was really bulletproof pat smiled and was it a good feeling when those bullets bounced off what about santinis gang they ran pat advised they had things all set for a fast getaway they were gone before we could get straightened out and follow them rennys puritanical face grew long and gloomy which meant contrary enough that he was delighted youre in awful bad company pat he said seriously i love this company pat assured him an hour later doc savage and his five men were going through ancient shipping records by way of complying with strange whitehaired dan thundens suggestion that they check up on his age here it is doc advised indicating yellowed papers the others gathered about and read the schooner sea nymph had sailed from new york in according to the aged documents and her skipper was a gentleman bearing the name of dan thunden whose age at that time was exactly forty gaunt johnny fingered his monocle and did some mental arithmetic computation indicates captain dan thunden of the sea nymph would be a hundred and thirtyone years of age if he had lived to this day advised nuts snorted the homely monk to whom are you attributing the qualities of a hardshelled fruit johnny asked in an injured tone not to you monk grunted but its silly to think any guy a hundred and thirtyone years old could be as spry as that old whitewhiskered gent doc riffled through more of the ancient papers he pointed look he advised again the other read holy cow gulped renny that voyage in was the sea nymphs last she was lost at sea and never heard from again shortly after the discovery that the sea nymph was listed as one of the mysteriously lost ships of the sea doc savage spoke without consulting a timepiece we have about thirty minutes to spare before heading for the airport to meet this kel avery who was ordered seized by santini do you think they will go through with the attempted capture pat asked curiously why not they do not know we intercepted santinis orders to hallet and leaking right pat admitted what about the half hour we have to spare well make a stab at learning what is behind this doc told her how recall the file of wealthy men in the offices of fountain of youth inc you told me about it i phoned one of the names in the file a banker by the name of thackeray hutchinson doc explained he acted very secretive and hung up on me which means he knows something pat said promptly right and were going to ask him questions we are chapter murder banker thackeray hutchinsons domicile was one befitting a man who was by way of being one of the nations wealthiest and most unscrupulously greedy moneybags it was a penthouse covering the entire roof of a costly building which thackeray hutchinson owned in the wall street sector i never did like this hutchinson octopus monk muttered as they unloaded before the building which supported the penthouse he should have been shot when he was born hes an orphan robber agreed pale long tom a private elevator gave admittance to the penthouse and this was operated by a rather toughlooking fellow in a gaudy uniform mr hutchinson is not in the operator advised harshly well go up anyway monk growled the attendant started to object but eyed the chemists gorilla hulk and changed his mind he ran them up in sour silence a butler put his nose in the air and also imparted that hutchinson was not in dont lie to us doc savage said shortly the flunky stared coldly at the bronze man then his haughty aplomb collapsed there was something about docs flakegold eyes and the quiet power of his voice that did not promise easy going to those who tried to resist his will in the library the butler mumbled banker thackeray hutchinson sprang wildly from his easy chair as they walked unceremoniously into his presence he stared at doc savage and his expression was that of a rabbit hunter who has just met a bear the moneybags had the jowls of a bulldog the eyes of a lizard and the body of a pelican along with the pelicans neck his head was utterly bald and an unpleasant white as if the top of his skull were showing damn you get out of here he yelled he wore a checkered suit with a ridiculously youthful cut a suit such as a college freshman might wear until his classmates laughed him into leaving it at home the effect was such that ham whose hobby was clothing made a face as he glimpsed the loud suit my name is savage mr hutchinson doc began we have called upon you to i know youre doc savage and a big shot with some fools the banker roared you may buffalo some people but you wont get to first base with me get out we have called to learn what you know of fountain of youth inc doc finished never heard of it the pelican man snarled that is not true doc charged your denial doesnt ring sound hutchinson ground his teeth and leaped for a telephone monk moved with a lazy speed and got there first the banker shrank away from the apish chemist help police he screamed help murder the police are here doc advised hutchinson snarled where we are the police myself and each of my men hold commissions on the new york police force the man whose manner of getting wealth had interested the federal government retreated scowling trembling a little he was the picture of a man in a panic doc savage studied the fellow during thackeray hutchinson trial in connection with the public utilities fiasco there had been much in the newspapers and little of it complimentary there was one angle worth remembering this man had an awful fear of going to jail it was rumored that he had spent over a million dollars in defeating the government charge you are under arrest doc said abruptly hutchinson blanched wwwhat fountain of youth inc has made repeated attempts to kill me within the last two hours doc told him quietly you have been connected with the concern and that means a trip to jail yyoure crazy the banker snarled accessory to murder or attempted murder is a criminal charge doc pointed out quietly your money wont keep you out of prison doc was bluffing but the utter calmness of his voice gave thackeray hutchinson no hint of that the threat of jail did what perhaps nothing else could have done the pelican man collapsed in a chair wwhat do yyou want to kknow he mumbled ill tell you at one side of the room dapper ham twirled his sword cane and masked a smile his law career had made ham a master of scaring unwilling witnesses into divulging the truth but even he could not have bested the job doc had just done the bronze man had hit on their victims one fear that of going to prison im only a ccustomer of fountain of youth inc hutchinson stuttered in his haste to get the information out a customer doc prompted the banker wrung his hands this is horrible if only fountain of youth had not gotten into trouble they had the secret the secret man has hunted for since he was able to think for himself and now theyve got in trouble and itll be lost the hand wringing became more violent i was to pay them a million dollars for the secret the moneybags went on it was cheap at the price a select list of other rich men was to receive the secret too we had been selected carefully because of our wealth anderer other qualifications by fountain of youth a million apiece we were all to pay wait doc put in this isnt making sense what is this secret for which you and other wealthy men of your type were to pay a million each thackeray hutchinson twisted his bald head to peer about uneasily theyve got a man here he mumbled they said they had to be sure we did not tell the secret or plot against them to get the weeds fountain of youth has a man here one of santinis gang the bulldogjowled capitalist shuddered yes one of santinis men who is he doc rapped thackeray hutchinson opened his mouth to reply he shut it before words came out he lifted half out of his chair gagging sounds escaped him as he tried to point at a door on the opposite side of the study the hardlooking elevator operator stood there lifting a revolver spill your insides will you he snarled his gun lipped flame the recoil kicked his arm up the room seemed to fly apart and come together again so earsplitting was the report thackeray hutchinson sat down loosely in his easy chair his eyes were closed tightly there was a round blue hole in the middle of his forehead then his mouth fell open and let a scarlet flood spill down the vest of his loud suit doc savage scooped an ornamental vase off an end table it was not an effective weapon but the handiest one he threw it the gunman tried to step aside he was far too slow the vase hit his gun arm enameled particles geysered the man dropped his revolver stooped to recover it saw there was no time for that and leaped backward he slammed the door the elevator doc rapped watch it bigfisted renny and homely monk dived to obey the gunman got the key turned in the lock they could hear it click doc hit the panel it was stout the bronze man blocked out one metallic hand and struck his knuckles drove completely through the wood a feat that seemed more than bone and tendons could stand yet when he withdrew his fist after turning the key there was no apparent damage doc plunged down a passage yells and curses indicated the killer had been cut off from the elevators hes makin for the terrace came rennys great rumble doc crashed through double glass doors the slayer was on the opposite side of the terrace peering over the parapet he looked around grimaced swore hoarsely then swung over the edge and vanished two long leaps took doc to the edge an ornamental fresco ran downward the carvings of this forming fairly substantial handholds the gunman was perhaps ten feet down doc swung over and started after him his movements were swift making those of the man below seem slow by comparison the killer glanced up discovering doc almost upon him he yelled a meaningless threat then he tried to increase his own pace it was no spot for a race the slayer missed his grip in his mad haste he clawed the air furiously but failed to recover and his body tilted outward arms windmilling at the beginning of his fall he turned over so that he faced the street some forty floors below the sight caused him to shriek long and horribly and the sound grew rapidly fainter as his fall carried him away from doc and the others on the street pedestrians looked up they ran away and made a place for the body to hit the sidewalk the concrete cracked a little from the impact doc climbed slowly back to the terrace ham came out of the penthouse and said grimly thackeray hutchinson died like that and snapped his fingers to illustrate chapter fast stuff the clock on the front of the main hangar was big enough that it could be seen from all parts of the flying field but it was dusk now and one had to be quite close to make out that the clock hands stood at eight monk got out of docs streamlined car saying in his small voice one thing is sure and that is we havent seen all the guys in this fountain of youth gang so we gotta be careful he jerked a thumb to take in the airport in general some of them mugs might be around here anywhere waitin for kel averys plane somewhat of a crowd was about the airport waiting room with its long telescoping canopy that could be hauled out to planes on little wheels the throng had a heterogeneous appearance some persons carried small books and others had cameras autograph hounds and photographers rumbled bigfisted renny which means a celebrity is arriving doesnt it patricia put in doc said pat yes can you change your appearance in a hurry if i had some dark glasses i could you cant imagine what a difference dark glasses make in a girls looks doc savage dropped a hand into a door pocket and brought out a small leather case here they are i do not think that fountain of youth crew got a good look at you this afternoon and if you alter your appearance slightly they might not recognize you the idea is that nobody is to think im with you pat queried exactly all right pat tapped ham on the arm lend me that snappy topcoat youre wearing hula ham was startled its cut like a ladies garment come on shed it the homely monk exploded stifled laughter and ham ears getting red slid out of his snappily tailored topcoat and passed it to the bronzehaired young woman keep your eyes open and be ready to grab any loose ends that we let slip pat doc directed i will pat faded into the gloom among the other parked cars a few moments later when they saw her again she had donned the smoked spectacles changed her hair and had draped the topcoat over her shoulders smart kid renny rumbled softly id hardly know her myself monk gurgling mirth moaned ecstatically i always did know something was wrong with that topcoat and now i see what it is the thing was made for a woman ham glared in the murk fumbled his sword cane and snarled for two cents id make hash out of you doc put in listen out of the southern twilight was coming the multiple drone of airplane engines thatll be the ship carrying kel avery decided the bronze man lets go they got out of the streamlined car six men so unusual as to attract more than one curious stare doc kept in the background he seldom wore a hat but he wore one now yanked low to help the murk hide his features he did not want to attract the cameras or the autograph hunters long tom so pale as to seem an ill man stopped an airport attendant asking why the excitement maureen darleen the movie actress is coming in on this plane from florida the attendant replied while the big passenger plane moaned closer long tom sauntered over to doc and spoke in a low voice the photographers and autograph grabbers are here to meet maureen darleen the picture queen he imparted but if i remember my movies this darleen is not such a big shot the best shes done is play opposite a well known actor or two and that makes me wonder why all the fuss havent you read your papers lately doc asked naw long tom shrugged i been busy working on my electrical invention to utilize sonic waves to kill insects and crop pests the papers yesterday and this morning were full of maureen darleen doc explained she was kidnaped in florida yesterday but escaped some of the newspapers hinted unkindly that it was a publicity stunt probably was long tom grunted skeptically these movie people will do anything for publicity they have to if the public does not know their names they have no box office pull and big box office pull means big salary you seem to be sticking up for this maureen darleen i do not know her personally doc replied but i do know that she spends most of her salary to support a home for orphans in her home town down in georgia that may be a publicity stunt too she does not advertise her connection with the home anyway there are less expensive methods of grabbing publicity long tom patted his armpit where reposed a supermachine pistol some of these cameramen and autograph hunters may belong to the fountain of youth gang he grunted doc nodded i was thinking of that the big plane circled the field once the motors decreased their clamor and the ship swung in sinking the pilot was good and touched his ponderous charge to the tarmac without a bounce then with whooping gusts from the propellers drove the craft toward the canopy field attendants yelled and grunted and shoved to keep the crowd out of range of the propellers and other flunkies ran the telescoping awning out the plane engines stopped and the cabin door opened the throng burst bounds and rushed for the door cameramen yelling and jumping up in an endeavor to get pictures the autograph fans shouting for maureen darleens signature doc savage and his five men kept in a group although they were jostled about they lost sight of patricia in her disguise of dark glasses and borrowed topcoat as she was submerged in the excited movie fans suddenly a voice yelled from the edge of the melee it was a shrill voice very loud and the words were plainly distinguishable as they knifed through the bedlam here is kel avery it cried instantly after that a man shrieked blows smacked men cursed help help bawled a voice doc savage pitched in the direction of the cries his great frame went through the crowd like a torpedo through water at his beck his five men were a flying wedge help bawled the voice leggo me doc sighted the fight several hardfaced roughly clad men had seized a fat stocky fellow and were hauling at him beating and kicking stop that doc rapped who the hell are you snarled a man and swung with a clubbed revolver doc was not where he had been when the blow descended but a yard to one side his fist lathed out there was a wet smack the man with the revolver threw lip his arms and floundered hack his lips a pulp and his teeth showing through splits where docs metallic knuckles had landed the others ran with the fat man they did not get far doc was upon them his five men close behind they struck grabbed twisted johnny who looked so incredibly gaunt grabbed a thug twice his own weight enwrapping the fellow spider fashion the victim shrieked terribly proving that johnny had a fighting ability that belied his professional appearance the brawl attracted a crowd a newspaper photographer began to jump about in his excitement and fumble his flashlight apparatus its doc savage in action he howled thell with the movie dame get this his flashlight gun made a whoosh and an eyehurting splash of white light other cameramen joined the outskirts of the fray and their flashes winked blindingly a man wearing an aviators helmet ran into the scrap fists swinging and was promptly knocked senseless falling at the feet of a woman who began screaming hysterically long tom bored into the middle of a large man with a gun his fists made a rapid drum roll and the man collapsed gurgling running for another foe the electrical wizard went out of his way to bump a camera from a photographers hands and step on it ruining the exposed plates long tom knew docs dislike for newspaper publicity and the camera belonged to the newspaper which the photographer worked for anyway quite suddenly the fight was over of the gang who had tried to seize the fat man all were helpless sprawled on the ground there were exactly seven of them and all had the earmarks of smalltime criminals doc helped the fat victim to his feet youre not hurt avery my name is not avery shrieked the fat man im joe smith and im a reporter on the morning comet doc beckoned other newspaper men to come close this man says hes joe smith sure hes joe smith of the morning comet said a journalist we all know him doc savages strange flakegold eyes roved from joe smith to the overpowered assailants and the bronze mans features were strangely fixed more metallic than ever there sounded unexpectedly a weird low mellow trilling note a fantastic sound which seemed to come from everywhere and yet from no definite source and which ran up and down the musical scale definitely rhythmatic yet adhering to no specific tune even those bystanders who heard the exotic trilling and looked at the bronze mans lips could not tell from whence it came yet doc savage authored the sound the trilling was a small unconscious thing which doc savage did when under sudden stress or when greatly surprised even he could not tell exactly how he made it but the sound always had great significance just now it meant that he was shocked and utterly disgusted with himself at docs signal the men who had attacked the reporter were hauled into the nearest hangar and the doors closed the thugs were scared and bewildered and entirely willing to talk hoping it would prevent them being charged with a worse crime than assault a guy named santini hired us to jump this bird kel avery when the plane came in and beat him up one of the men moaned santini pointed out kel avery to us we got fifty bucks apiece it was joe smith a reporter you attacked and not kel avery doc said grimly santini said that guy was named kel avery and for us to yell out his name insisted the frightened yegg doc savage turned the gang over to the airport officials and went outside to join his aides we fell for a trick he said grimly santini hired these cheap crooks to attack a man in the crowd and get our attention but why get our attention ham demanded puzzled bigfisted renny came up with the answer to that the engineer was excited doc doc he ejaculated during the fight another gang grabbed this maureen darleen and another woman and carried them off in a car according to people ive talked to in the crowd they slugged a bodyguard this maureen darleen had along a moment of silence followed the news and doc savages strange trilling sound seemed to echo but it was very low and hardly perceptible to the ear what beautiful dopes we turned out to be ham muttered that other fight was to get our attention while this gang grabbed maureen darleen but i thought it was somebody named kel avery that they were after renny rumbled where is this bodyguard of maureen darleens doc demanded over here renny led the way the bodyguard looked the part he was an athletic giant almost as impressive in physique as doc savage the fellows great muscles were more bulging even than docs which meant he was a trifle musclebound he had a square head a corded neck and square powerful fingers slung across his chest in plain sight was a harness for carrying two pistols in underarm holsters the man was sitting up shaking his head slowly when doc approached him he peered at the bronze man a bit vacantly then felt of the holsters attached to his harness they were empty doc knelt grasped the fellows shoulders and shook him are you kel avery the overmuscled one shook his head from side to side meester my name she is no kel avery my name is da clima yes his english was understandable enough but the words were put together in the manner of one who had learned the tongue in later life such accent as he had was that of southern europe you are maureen darleens bodyguard doc questioned her guard yes maybe was her guard da clima sighed she maybe it is wont want a guard who as a guard is not so hot no do you know a kel avery doc asked da clima squinted muscles as large as muskmelons bulged up under his coat as he lifted himself kel avery is maureen darleen he said you not know that no maureen darleen and kel avery the same person doc repeated as if to make sure da clima nodded kel avery or kelmina avery she dont use that name not so much the name avery she not so good on the movie picture no maureen darleen much better so the girl she use the name of avery not so much a lot of these movie actresses have stage names renny rumbled monk came up short legs taking great leaps pat aint around here anywhere he snapped doc gripped rennys thick arm you said that gang made off with two women didnt you yes lets go chapter kel averys story the car bearing the kidnapers and their two women prisoners was a long blue phaeton it had gone toward new york these two bits of information were forthcoming from members of the crowd who had seen the snatching da clima piled into docs streamlined car with the rest da clima he go along he growled we catch them and da clima he do them like this his muscular hands made pantomime of breaking things how about that doc monk questioned let him come of course we want to ask him questions the big engine came to life under the tapered hood but only sudden animation of ammeter and oil gauge showed that the machine was fitted with an automatic shifting device and doc thrust the lever which meshed the gears after which the shifting required no further attention tires threw gravel all the way out of the flying field shrieked on concrete as they swerved to the pavement and then there was only the hiss of exhausts and the wail of air past the streamlined curves the speedometer arm jumped around to seventy doc touched a switch and a siren started a banshee wail doc spoke to da clima without taking his eyes off the scudding concrete what do you know about this he demanded me i not know the much da clima disclaimed tell us what you do know yesterday i read about it in the papers the kidnap what is tried on maureen darleen said da clima i am in this florida then maybe you read about that no the kidnap what is try on maureen darleen call her miss avery so there will be no confusion doc suggested yes we read about the attempted kidnaping i go to her to mees avery da clima continued i am once the fighter not so hot now the nickel i pick up where i can i fight i shoot im plenty the tough guy me dont brag monk growled youre with guys who are tough now but you not so good in the head no da clima queried you run to the wrong fight while them fellows they get maureen mees avery they make of you the sap no monk scowled say you funnytalkin bundle of beef are you huntin a scrap stop it doc put in quietly da clima you went to miss avery after you heard of the attempt to kidnap her and offered your services as a bodyguard is that it thats her the idea da clima nodded i put up the talk and tell her that me i am the one she need so she hire me to watch out for her a swell job you done monk snorted da clima started to answer but caught sight of the speedometer and his eyes opened wide and black he wet his lips uneasily and muttered boy we travel no the speedometer read eightyfive buildings went by like pickets and cars frightened to the curb by the siren were blurred what else do you know doc asked me nothing said da clima dont you know anything about santini hallet leaking or a whitebearded man named dan thunden who claims he is a hundred and thirtyone years old or a company which calls itself fountain of youth inc nope said da clima never heard of any of them no what an information mine he turned out to be monk growled da clima scowled at the homely chemist and said da clima he not like you not much brother the affection is returned monk rapped look pale long tom shrieked doc savage had already applied the power brakes the heavy streamlined car squatted a little slithered straightened slithered again then as the bronze man alternately stamped and released the brake pedal the machine spun with tires screaming and stopped with its radiator pointing hack the way it had come da clima was pale frightened by the wildness of their stop and his hands were clenched his breath coming and going rapidly under the tread of the accelerator the big car lunged back upon their course then slackened speed and swerved off the pavement bounding over the packed shoulder and stopped a woman was standing in the ditch beside the road in water to her knees she was disheveled mud spattered her frock was torn at the shoulder as if she had pitched into the ditch from a rapidlymoving car she came toward them wiping mud off her face maureen mees avery da clima cried in astonishment kel avery was a tall young woman blonde blueeyed and even though she was swathed in mud and roadside grime it was not hard to see why as maureen darleen she was considered one of the upandcoming young movie actresses she got in the car and said back the way you were going gentlemen and step on it monk grinned as if he liked that and made room for her while doc jockeyed the car around skillfully they resumed their cometlike progress siren ahowl which one of you is doc savage kel avery asked monk pointed at the front seat but said nothing kel avery took in the bronze mans remarkable head his expanse of shoulders the metallic texture of his skin oh she said i didnt get a look at him or i would have known ask her questions monk doc directed this driving takes a lot of attention were getting into the city limits on the floorboards where he had been throughout the pig habeas corpus sniffed of the movie actresss drenched shapely ankles until monk kicked him lightly in the ribs they threw me out said kel avery after they went to all that trouble to seize you monk asked incredulously oh they thought i was my maid explained the blonde actress the other girl made them think she was kel avery what other girl the one who rushed to my side and acted as if she was one of my party when the trouble started hack at the airport say that young lady would go great in the movies shes got looks and how she can act she made them think she was kel avery and when she got her chance whispered to me to begin to scream and they might throw me out and if they did i should find doc savage and tell him my story so i screamed and they did throw me out doc tooled the plunging car past an intersection then threw a question over his shoulder what did this other girl look like she was beautiful as i said advised kel avery and she had bronzecolored hairhair like your own mr savage it was pat monk groaned there was unpleasant silence for a whilesilence if the whooping noise of the big cars progress could be excepted doc savage himself showed little expression for his command of his facial muscles was complete but his five men showed that the thought of patricia savage being in the hands of santinis crew was anything but pleasant da clima held on face white and seemed to shrink each time the speeding car careened i was coming to new york by plane to get your help mr savage volunteered blonde kel avery did you tell that to any one doc questioned nobody why because santini and his outfit learned you were coming to me and tried to grab me and put me where you could not find me doc told her or thats how it seems santini kel avery sounded puzzled ever hear of him or of fountain of youth inc what about hallet or leaking never heard the names that i recall the blondes voice had a ring of genuineness what about a whitehaired man named dan thunden who says he is a hundred and thirtyone years old oh doc lifted his eyes from the road and turned his head for a quick glance the girl looked startled you have heard of dan thunden doc asked yes said kel avery he is my greatgrandfather according to the letter i got from him my greatgrandfather on my mothers side his letter said what else did his letter say doc asked grimly it said for me to take the package that was with the letter and guard it with my life to be sure not to open it and to come to florida and i would be worth fifty million dollars within thirty days the blonde said all in one breath holy cow renny rumbled doc inquired you obeyed instructions oh it sounds silly but i did kel avery sighed you see the press agent of the movie company i work for thought it would be a great idea to get some newspaper space the company even paid me a salary to go to florida as instructed and the press agent was going to meet me there but before he came i was kidnaped that scared me i came north why come north the actress smiled to put the thing into your hands was that the press agents idea doc asked kel avery looked blank then color crept up in her cheeks under the mud and she glared indignantly at the back of docs head those men threatened to kill me and i was scared she snapped they told me they would kill me unless i got the package as a matter of fact i didnt escape they turned me loose to get the parcel and the press agent does not know where i am the press agent hadnt even gotten to florida doc was silent after the sharp answer his metallic features expressionless he made no movements except suck as were necessary in controlling the car a corner loomed ahead kel avery screamed softly da clima groaned and put big hands over his face the car reeled rubber shrieked then they were around the corner straightened out and going on safely where is the parcel now doc asked his great voice calm in the plane on which i arrived back at the airport said kel avery you see i sent it by air mail knowing it would come on the same plane why that precaution i was afraid to carry it maybe im not very brave youre brave enough doc assured her this is what i call a deep black mystery monk muttered doc slowed the streamlined car abruptly much to the relief of da clima who swelled proportionately as the machine slackened speed so that when they were traveling forty his chest was out his chin up his eyes bright and brave its no use doc said the car carrying pat has given us the slip bony johnny absently fitted his monocle into his left eye where it gave his optic a grotesque appearance for the monocle was in reality a powerful magnifying glass which the gaunt geologist and archaeologist found occasion to use in the course of his work this thing about pat is appalling he said appalling chapter the package trick many citizenz of new york city knew of the headquarters which doc savage maintained on the eightysixth floor of manhattans most impressive skyscraper for the newspapers had published that fact innumerable times but not many citizens had seen the establishment had they done so they would have been astounded the establishment consisted of an outer reception room and office which was sumptuously but not gaudily furnished beyond this was a library which for completeness in its assortment of scientific books could be equaled perhaps by but one other library its location unknown except to doc savage himself being in a mysterious and remote spot which the bronze man termed his fortress of solitude and to which he retired at intervals to study none knowing his whereabouts not even his five trusted aides connecting with the library was an experimental laboratory this also having an equal only in the second laboratory which the bronze man maintained at his fortress of solitude the city laboratory held apparatus for almost every conceivable scientific experiment as well as tools for the construction of the numerous devices for which doc savage found need monk stood in the outer office nudging habeas corpus gently in the ribs with a toe and spoke his mind that old yahoo dan thunden is sure a licksplitting freak the homely chemist declared imagine a gink a hundred and thirtyone years old being able to hop around like he can only beautiful blonde kel avery was listening but she was audience enough since monk would talk all day if it would keep him in the company of a girl as attractive as this one doc was issuing commands having just finished writing a number of names and addresses on slips of paper here are some of the wealthy men whose names were in that file which we found in the offices of fountain of youth inc the bronze man explained he distributed the slips to long tom renny ham and johnny investigate he directed those names were in the file for some reason just as was that banker thackeray hutchinson renny folded his paper slip with huge fingers some of these birds should give us information he said be careful doc admonished we do not want a repetition of what happened to thackeray hutchinson that guy got what was coming to him put in monk who had paused to overhear what happened to him blonde kel avery asked curiously he got shot between the eyes ham told her oh the young woman gasped and sank into a chair this hairy ape ham indicated monk with his sword cane thinks it was all right for a man to get killed aw he was an orphan robber monk said uncomfortably knowing very well ham had deliberately put him before the movie actress in a calloused light what about pat renny rumbled anxiously we havent a lead to go on doc pointed out well have to see what turns up the four men departed with their paper slips intent on running down some information about fountain of youth inc big da clima went to the water cooler drank deeply from the gurgling fountain then came back and stood in front of doc me i think i go out not for long he said why doc asked da clima shrugged musclebound shoulders and said business very well doc agreed da clima lumbered out toward the elevators doc nodded at monk follow him monk grinned and waved habeas corpus back boy do i hope this da clima gives me some excuse to tie into him leered the homely chemist i dont like him monk went out kel avery tried to wring muddy water out of her drying frock and asked you do not trust da clima just a precaution doc told her quietly and it gives monk something to do he would feel neglected if he wasnt doing something you have a remarkable group of men said the young woman doc bowed politely suggested it is not advisable for you to leave here since santini and his crew must know about this headquarters you can use the telephone and have fresh clothing sent up from a shop there is an excellent one in the building thank you doc savage retired to the library where there was a second telephone and while kel avery called the shop the bronze man put in a call of his own to the post office officials much talk ensued and he was transferred to several officials before he got full satisfaction he had to explain twice what he wanted and he found it necessary to give the mail officials the number on a small card which he drew from a pocket the card which doc used held the information that he was a fully commissioned postal investigator and bore the postmaster generals signature this was one of many honorary commissions which doc held doc went next to the laboratory where he switched on a shortwave radio telephone transmitterandreceiver this communicated to other shortwave sets in the automobiles used by his aides in their work doc called johnny long tom ham and renny in rapid succession but only johnny answered the others were evidently interviewing their rich men you have my unadulterated attention doc said bigworded johnny listen said doc then he spoke rapidly in the mayan dialect which he used to communicate with his men when conveying secret and important orders supermalagorgeous said johnny when the conversation ended doc went in and joined kel avery in the outer room you have arranged for my air mail package to come here asked the movie actress it will be here in not more than twenty minutes doc replied you took quite a bit of time the young woman pointed out did you experience any trouble the bronze man seemed on the point of informing her of something unusual about the call he had made to the mail officials but before the words formed the outer door opened and da clima came stamping in me i get two new ones said da clima and threw back his coat revealing in his shoulder harness a pair of heavy blue revolvers my other two ones them feller at the airport they get he added bought two new revolvers eh doc said slowly they are not easy to purchase here in new york for the feller with the money anything she easy grinned da cli ma at a hock shop i get them and i no need the license for to carry either monk ambled in shortly tossed a bundle of newspapers on the inlaid office table said there they are doc as if he had been sent out to get the papers instead of to follow da clima then he ambled into the laboratory doc joined monk as soon as he could do so without attracting da climas suspicions the mug went into a hock shop stayed a while then came back here monk grumbled he didnt do nothing else call the police and tell them to have that pawnbrokers license to do business taken away from him for selling firearms to unlicensed persons doc directed monk nodded any word from pat none doc went back into the outer office while monk used the inside phone to make his call about the pawnbroker who sold guns to unlicensed persons and who was therefore undoubtedly a source of firearms to the underworld the clothing which kel avery had ordered came up and a dressmaker accompanied the garments ready to make any alterations which might be necessary bedraggled and mudcaked the lighthaired young actress retired to the library and was out again shortly the frock having fitted her without changes now you look again like maureen darleen the movie queen monk grinned not that you looked bad before though thank you the young woman smiled then studied habeas corpus a remarkablelooking pet pig you have habeas is quite a guy monk admitted speak to the hollywood heartthrob habeas monk i think shes a queen said habeas entrancing kel avery looked somewhat stunned then realized monk had used ventriloquism to make the homely pig apparently speak and burst out laughing but she sobered very suddenly im worried about that other girl pat she said uneasily what do you think theyre doing to her probably trying to buffalo her into telling them where the box your greatgranddaddy dan thunden sent you can be found monk guessed ill give up that mysterious box in an instant if it will get her freedom kel avery said grimly the mailmen with the box should be here shortly doc put in kel avery eyed the bronze man curiously then said just as da clima came in you started to tell me something about the call which you made to the air mail officials about their sending my package here what was it or have you changed your mind doc savage smiled i havent changed my mind he said then before continuing went to the window and looked down from its tremendous height into the street he was silent a moment as if in thought then began what i was going to tell you he fell silent then pointed down through the window an armored mail truck is pulling up in front he said it must be bringing your package kel avery ran over to the window you told them to use an armored truck she asked of course then doc stiffened the young woman glanced down and also became rigid while monk and da clima came over quickly stared then grew slackjawed and attentive the street below was brightly lighted oh oh breathed kel avery in a small horrified voice an uniformed postal carrier carrying a package had gotten out of the truck and had started for the skyscraper entrance but at the same time three men had stood erect m an open touring car which was parked near by the men lifted their arms and threw what resembled glass bottles the containers struck the sidewalk at the feet of the postal men and burst making wet smears on the concrete these wet splashes seemed to evaporate with startling suddenness bright street lights made this visible gas breathed monk the chemist the vapor whatever its nature was potent for both postal men collapsed within a few moments another carrier springing out of the truck with a revolver apparently came under the spell of the gas for he also went down one of the men sprang out of the touring car and ran forward santinis gang monk groaned hes holding his breath doc cant we do something quiet doc rapped the man far below reached the recumbent postal carriers stooped and seized the package which one had been carrying then he galloped back to the touring car and dived inside the machine was moving almost as he hit the cushions there goes the package gritted monk them damn feller they sure the smart guys da clima growled and swung for the door wait doc barked there was a ring of authority to the bronze mans voice that brought the excited da clima up and caused him to return his expression puzzled to the window where he peered downward again the touring car was rolling more swiftly down the street monk wrenched up the window roaring i can hit em with my superfirer pistol no doc told him monk spun around doc have you gone nuts but before the bronze man could possibly make answer the homely chemist looked sheepish then began to grin doc you pulled a fast one he accused what was it have a look doc pointed down in the street a small undistinguished coupe was darting in and out through traffic in a manner that made it plain to the watchers above that it was following the touring car those in the open car could hardly tell they were trailed due to the intervening taxicabs and pleasure cars johnnys coupe monk barked exactly but how did he i got him on the shortwave radio at the time i called the postal officials doc explained johnny was to follow the mail truck and if anything came up he was to use his own judgment this may lead us to pat monk grinned let us hope chapter ii the seizure built into the skyscraper which housed doc savages headquarters was a special highspeed elevator which gave access not only to the ornate lobby downstairs but to a basement garage where the bronze man kept his assortment of cars the presence of this garage was known but to few persons outside docs immediate circle of five aides kel avery was made a bit breathless by the terrific speed with which the elevator lowered them to the basement while da clima who seemed brave enough in the face of everything but speed paled a little the fast moving you sure do a lot of heem no he mumbled as they got out in the passage that led to the garage there aint no crook ever moved fast enough to keep ahead of doc in the long run monk said they may outguess him once in a while but the first thing you know monk finished by making a gesture of catching something imaginary in the air kel avery put a hand on docs arm and asked it was about having johnny trail the truck that you were going to tell me doc nodded she smiled i am glad of that because if you had not told me it would have shown you did not trust me doc savage selected a car which santini or his followers would not be likely to recognize as they would if doc used the streamlined machine the machine he entered was a vehicle which resembled an ordinary delivery truck such as is used by small laundries or groceries bulletproof glass and armor plate construction made this virtually a fast tank the tires were filled with sponge rubber instead of air the cab portion was fitted with comfortable seats which swiveled before concealed portholes and there were racks holding supefiirer pistols body armor gas masks grenades canisters of gas and even a small field gun that could be carried by two strong men and which fired a two inch shell this she some bus da clima said admiringly a sloping ramp let them through the street door which opened automatically at their approach and closed behind them actuated by a hidden mechanism doc switched on the shortwave radio telephone and spoke into the mouthpiece johnny johnny going north on broadway came johnnys precise voice from the loudspeaker so far there has been no difficulty have they seen you doc asked emphatically a negative answere to that said johnny who hated to use a little word where a big one would do he means no monk advised kel avery the young woman was staring at doc savage as if fascinated for sight of the bronze mans remarkable skyscraper establishment had brought home to her the fact that he was no ordinary individual i begin to understand how you get the results which have made you famous she murmured you do not depend alone on your own personal skill and that of your men you use every scientific device possible in your work doc said nothing but gave his attention instead to the traffic he disliked talking about himself deviating eastward over the bridge to long island came johnnys scholastic voice from radio long toms tones came in over the air waves following the professorial johnnys information whats goin on here the electrical wizard demanded the different radio sets used by doc savage and his men were all fixed on the same wave length with crystal devices which prevented changes in frequency accordingly conversation could be carried on much as if they were all hooked to a party telephone line evidently long tom had just turned his set on and was puzzled at what he was hearing doc told the electrical expert about the theft of the air mall parcel head for long island the bronze man directed and tell me what information you received when you interviewed your rich man there was a pause while the distant long tom turned his ear in the direction of long island then he began speaking my rich man had flown the coop he advised unfortunate doc said what are the particulars he got a telephone call a little while before i arrived according to a maid long tom explained he acted excited grabbed some money out of his private safe snatched a few clothes and jammed them in a suitcase he ran out of the door and thats the last they saw of him sounds as if he were tipped off that you were coming doc hazarded you said it shortly afterward renny and ham both reported experiences similar to that of long tom they had not found their men at home and in both cases the fellows had fled hurriedly only a few moments before their arrival johnny interrupted to advise the men who appropriated that package are now traversing an unpopulated section of beach road careful doc warned him you are cautioning me johnny snorted there was silence except for the noise of traffic and the muffled sounds made by the cars johnny reported his position more exactly and doc marked his whereabouts on a map of long island the region into which johnny was following his quarry was one of the most thinly inhabited sections of the island renny rumbled over the radio doc its obvious santinis gang warned the rich men to skip out and they did it what puzzles me is what persuaded them to skip so promptly ham interjected they probably knew what happened to thackeray hutchinson doc stated the newspapers are on the street with news of his death by now fear of a like fate is enough to urge those wealthy men to do what they were told santini is sure taking plenty of trouble to keep us from learning what this is all about renny boomed brothers it must be big whatever is back of this a few minutes later johnny spoke he forgot his big words his voice was a rattle of haste theyve stopped their car and are getting out he exclaimed then he clipped off his exact location its on an old road near the beach it will take us fifteen or twenty minutes to get there doc advised youve been traveling faster than it seemed im going to trail them johnny said do that and watch your step johnny switched off the radio transmitter with a bony forefinger he had stopped the car after pulling into tall brush where the machine was fairly well hidden and he did not want the radio speaker to attract attention drawing his handkerchief from a pocket the gaunt geologist wrapped it carefully around his monocle then pocketed the padded glass where it was not likely to get broken this was a habitual precaution with johnny when he contemplated going into action the sand was so soft that it seemed alive under johnnys feet as he moved forward there was a brilliant moon which caused the scrawny beach shrubs to cast grotesque shadows somewhere a night bird piped and waves on the beach sounded as if some unseen person was pouring buckets of water upon the sand light from flashlights splattered ahead voices muttered laughter cackled that would be the quarry the way them mail carriers caved a man laughed sweet i call it it wont be so sweet if they croak growled another uncle sam is a tough monkey to have on your neck forget it he was told that gas just made em senseless for a while they went on and johnny hurrying got close enough that he could hear the mushmush of their feet in the soft sand if they posted a lookout he wanted to be close enough to hear the command johnny was puzzled about their destination this section of beach low and unhealthy was not even populated by summer cabins taken altogether it was as remote a spot as could be found in the immediate vicinity of new york city who the hells that challenged a harsh voice santa claus growled one of the trio who had robbed the mail carriers whos you think is his nibs here santini is said the one who bad challenge apparently a sentry hell do johnny mentally thanking his lucky star that he had been close enough to catch the challenge circled and evaded the watchman then continued after the trio they did not go much farther a haze of flickering red appeared resolved into a camp fire which burned before a tumbledown shed that was open on one side santini appeared in the fire glow then hallet and leaking the latter still perspiring despite the coolness of the night johnny stared steadily at something in the murk beyond the fire it stood in the edge of the water a few yards offshore some one threw wood on the fire and he made out the lines of the thing a plane it was a big ship massive of hull with great wing spread and two canvasswathed radial motors an amphibianfor the thin geologist could make out the streamlined humps which harbored the landing wheels flow cranked up out of the water santini mopped at a small cut on his chin and growled that damn pat savage is a cat she kicked me in the face and almost got away that snapped johnnys attention off the giant seaplane so they knew pat was not kel avery how had they learned that but most important of all pat was here we got it vouchsafed one of the three newcomers bueno santini pocketed the handkerchief with which he had been dabbing at his cut chin adjusted his sharp mustache points then extended a hand give me he was handed the parcel which had been taken from the mail men the breeze from the sea whipped in briskly causing the moored seaplane to bob and fine sand to whisper against beach grass and shrubs we will go inside where it is not windy santini decided the instant they were inside johnny started to advance he wanted to observe the contents of that parcel but the bony geologist stopped as if his spine had frozen and it did feel cold too from the chill metal object which had jabbed against the back of his neck unless you be proof against bullets youd bettah stand still a remarkably youthful voice breathed in johnnys ear chapter the disappointing parcel johnny stood as immobile as he could for he had recognized the juvenile tone as belonging to whitebearded dan thunden and common sense told him the cold thing against his neck was a gun snout hands slapped against his person and the superfirer pistol his only weapon was removed johnny wore a bulletproof vest a fact that dan thundens search disclosed ill shoot you in the head advised the boyishvoiced old man so youre still working with them johnny whispered back dan thunden cursed round seafaring oaths under his breath im wukkin on them not foah them he gritted i laid aboard the lookout back yondah and he wont set his sail foah some time to come then you and i had better work together johnny said hopefully his large words forgotten in the urgency of the situation old dan thunden is wukkin foah himself thunden whispered vehemently i didnt know who you was when i met you befoah but now i know you are one of doc savages outfit well i dont want any paht of you listen johnny began what belay yoah jaw an walk up to that shanty dan thunden grated we are gonna do some listenin johnny feeling discretion the better part of foolhardiness since the gun snout was a determined pressure against his neck ambled forward and stopped against the shack wall there were wide cracks between the boards which offered orifices for both eye and ear burning brightly on the open side of the ramshackle structure the fire spilled light over the interior and they could see plainly what went on within johnnys first look gave him a shock patricia savage was not in sight several men besides santini hallet and leaking were in the shack among them the killer of the banker thackeray hutchinson who had masqueraded as an elevator operator santini kicked litter aside on the floor and made a clean place on which he placed the mail parcel weve had fits over this he said fishing in a watch pocket beside the ribbon that crossed his chest so gaudily he brought out a penknife with which to cut the tyings on the bundle after the string and outer wrapper of paper was removed santini lifted a folded square of heavy paper he opened this it crackled and fluttered in the breeze that eddied inside the shanty verameilte santini exploded indeed dan thunden the old goat even sent his greatgranddaughter a map showing the islands whereabouts you are sure it is the island asked the man who had killed thackeray hutchinson yes here is the island said santini and placed a finger on the map johnny strained his eyes and made out the general location of the island it was in the caribbean some considerable distance from florida then dan thunden gave his head a push to prevent him from seeing more but johnny had fixed in his memory the approximate location of the isle inside the hut there was scuffling sound a low stifled cry the damn girl snarled leaking we no longer need her santini said callously shoot her the man who had killed thackeray hutchinson leered drew a revolver spun the cylinder then growled a knife wont make as much noise and drew a long hunting knife from a sheath sewed to the inside of his vest dan thundens gun nudged johnnys neck walk breathed the youngvoiced old man quick befoah they ham mah granddaughtah johnny found himself urged around to the open front of the structure dan thunden was going to use him as a shield and the fact that he wore a bulletproof vest failed to ease johnnys mind a great deal i couldnt miss yoahall from heah dan thunden called from the open end of the hut not a man inside the ancient building stood still at the unexpected words for it is human nature to start violently when surprised an inheritance probably from treedwelling ancestors who found it necessary to leap for their lives at sounds of danger but only one man was foolish enough to try resistance the killer of thackeray hutchinson held his knife in hand he whipped back his arm to throw the blade dan thundens gun roared splittingly in johnnys ear and its muzzle flame seared his neck the knifeman let fall his blade took two or three bobblekneed steps then put both hands over the spot where the top of his skull seemed to be torn off and dived headfirst to the sandy floor he lay there a red flood spilling out of the top of his head hes dead dan thunden advised the others meaningly santini jutted his hands up and the others followed his example then johnny saw pat savage she had been lying against the wall through the cracks of which they had peered this accounting for the failure to discover her earlier ropes bound her arms and ankles and a strip torn from hams natty topcoat had been used to gag her dan thunden gave johnny a shove get ovah with them wheah i can watch you picking up the map which santini had dropped the whitehaired man hurled it out into the fire flames bundled it hungrily and it turned into a black crisp and a curl of yellow smoke i should nevah have sent that to mah greatgranddaughtah thunden growled but i didnt know but that we might find use foah it i guess all concerned can find the island if need be he paused to scowl at johnny except doc savage and his scuts and we dont want them in on it with that he continued unwrapping the package a box of thin light wood came into view it resembled a large cigar box except that there were no printing or labels on it expression expectant the youngold man flipped the lid back he tensed gulped something unintelligible under his breath his longfingered hand dipped into the contents turning up flakes of greenishgray leaves this heah aint it he howled suddenly this heah stuff is just plain sage so shocked was whitehaired dan thunden at the discovery that the box contained something other than he had expected that his attention left his prisoners look out johnny rapped he was too late santini leaped his foot collided with dan thundens gun arm the weapon spun away presto santini yelled haste grab him men piled on dan thunden they were met with a whirlwind of blows a dazzling display of fighting skill the old man was an amazing acrobat and a fighting cyclone johnny joined the fray by clouting a jaw with a bony fist he failed to drop his quarry due to his own haste and was clouted back for his pains a man jumped astride johnnys bony back locked legs around his middle and drubbed the back of johnnys head and neck with hard fists johnny fell backward on the fellow the man who had been hit on the jaw jumped on johnnys stomach with both feet pat savage began to flip about endeavoring to get rid of her bindings failing in that she managed to trip a man who was running at dan thunden thunden had felled three assailants with his bare fists then santini danced around behind the old fellow and struck him a terrific blow alongside the ear thundens knees hinged his eyelids fluttered santinis men took advantage of this weakness they rushed swarming over the whitehaired man and bearing him down in a moment he was beaten fiat gripped and held helpless grinning santini got up ran over and kicked johnny twice in the head after which the bony geologist was easily subdued santini stepped back and adjusted his ornate mustache the ribbon across his chest was loose and he carefully fitted it back in place bueno he exclaimed then his pleasure faded as his eye lighted on the box he went over and scooped up some of the greenish contents let the flakes sift through his fingers then straightened this is not the stuff he snarled dan thunden straining at the men who held lima growled this heah gal must have made a change santini swore pat made unintelligible noises through her gag dan thunden glared at pat what did you do with the package that i sent you santini started at that dan thunden had addressed pat as if she were his greatgranddaughter and this was a surprise to santini who had learned in some fashion that pat was not kel avery dan thundens mistake was no surprise to johnny had blonde kel avery not said that she had never seen her greatgrandfather old dan thunden did not know kel avery by sight and naturally had mistaken pat for kel santini took a full breath it was plain that he was going to advise dan thunden of his mistake johnny said loudly miss avery dont tell them a thing whatever you do dont tell them a thing instead of speaking santini blinked his expression showed that he bore half a conviction that pat was kel avery mummburrr said pat through her gag untie her and see what she says ordered santini a man started toward pat but stopped very suddenly for pat had whipped up a gun in her bound hands it was the weapon which had been kicked from dan thundens handat the start of the fight and which pat had managed to reach without being noticed mummmmwurrrah said pat it was not hard to understand what she meant and hands went up exquisite breathed johnny and sprang to undo the gag and free her wrists pat made hacking noises when the gag was out i came to new york for excitement she said man oh man am i getting it she stood erect stamping her feet to restore cramped circulation but keeping the gun level and determined why did you mail that package she asked dan thunden sharply the whitehaired man shrugged i was hopin you would see fit to become mah pahtnah what pat demanded incredulously you see i needed money said dan thunden i was goin to meet you in florida and tell you the whole story he paused to glare at santini and the others but these gentlemen must have got the telegram you sent me tellin me you would go to florida or did you send such a message the message was sent said pat evidently deciding she could get more out of him by pretending she was his greatgranddaughter i nevah got it said dan thunden and that explains why i did not meet you in florida did santini send a man down theah to santini suddenly took a long chance he stood near dan thunden at the moment leaping he got behind the whitehaired man and shoved with all of his strength dan thunden was hurled toward pat taken by surprise and not wishing to shoot the old man pat jumped aside that gave hallet and leaking their chance working with wits almost as deft as santinis they sprang quickly forward pat shrilled angrily and fired but her arm was knocked up and the bullet merely clouted rotten wood out of the ceiling santini ran in and got her gun johnny struck santini in the face whirling santini put the muzzle of the gun against johnnys chest and pulled the trigger until the gun was empty the reports were deafening in the shack johnny was knocked back spinning by the force of the slugs coat fabric over his chest smoked and dripped sparks he fell flat on his back and lay there eyes widely open all of his gaunt length immobile dan thunden still stumbling from the shove which had propelled him at pat got his balance and whirled but saw the odds were against him for santinis thugs already had their guns out head down dan thunden plunged outside a santini gunman shot at the whitewhiskered form flying through the firelight but thunden only leaped higher into the air and went the faster until he was lost in the darkness and the stunted brush of the beach four men struggling together held pat what a life santini gasped a man ran over to examine johnny let him go snapped santini i shot him many times in the heart leaking swabbed at perspiration running off his face in fast drops boss i move we shake the dust of this place he puffed things are getting too tough this skinny guy you shot is one of doc savages outfit and that means hell this doc savage will move the earth to get the guys who rubbed out his pal only too true put in hallet nervously kidnaping that bronze man was one thing killing one of his men is another savage is a wizard and the united states is going to be too warm for us pat said you birds are just getting wise to yourselves a man slapped her over the mouth she bit him the man cursed lifted a gun no yelled santini she is the one who knows where the other box is but she aint old thundens greatgranddaughter objected leaking maybe we make the mistake and she is kel avery said santini did you not see the old goat accuse her of making away with the parcel maybe leaking admitted but we got word never mind the buts santini rapped after that there was a brief pause during which no one seemed to know what to do next and it was obvious every one was thinking desperately santinis swarthy face lighted his sharp mustache ends shot up in the air as he grinned he swung a hand around his head and brought it down on a thigh with a great smack bueno he yelled good excellent wonderful i hope it is leaking said pessimistically it is santini laughed the one great idea i have we will take the plane and go to the island doing that we will be away from this doc savage we will get a supply of he stopped and eyed the surrounding night and did not finish what about the girl leaking questioned we take her along santini grinned we make her tell where that parcel go to it may be we do not find the he paused again and scowled at the night we do not find what we want on the island then this box be very valuable indeed not a bad idea leaking admitted with that pat was hauled kicking and striking out to the beach and thrust into the giant seaplane boss a man addressed santini si snapped the chief what eating you when we reach this island and find the storeroom do we get to use the stuff ourselves the man asked santini hesitated shrugged of course si si the man who had asked the question expanded visibly and slapped his chest solidly delightedly i feel like a guy who had just been promised a million he smirked the canvas jackets were wrenched off the motors selfstarters whirred clanked and the exhaust stacks spilled sparks smoke and noise with every one aboard the plane wallowed away from the beach hammering motors put the big craft on step and it took the air inside the tumbledown beach shack johnny stirred slightly he shut his eyes and moaned several times he sought to arise and at last succeeded propped up shakily he tore open his coat vest and shirt the bulletproof vest which he wore was of mail not rigid armor plate it was a vest designed by doc savage for himself and his men to wear continually and therefore it was light intended to save them only from an occasional bullet impact of the revolver slugs at close range had stunned johnny rendering him helpless and he had lain there at no time unconscious but unable to fight effectively and knowing it he had heard all that was said getting up on his јfeet he wavered outside fell down then got up and propped himself against the shack there was a roaring in his ears and he coughed a crimson spray but it was not until the roaring went away slowly that he realized it was motors of santinis enormous plane which he had been hearing and that the craft had seemed to recede to the southward over the atlantic ocean johnny peered around unsteady on his feet trying to find some trace of dan thunden but there was none and he was still peering fruitlessly when a fast car made noise on the beach road and headlights waved a white glare it was doc savages armored delivery truck and it stopped near by doc and the others unloaded monk ran up and stared curiously at johnny do you know any cuss words johnny asked thickly hell yes monk said then cuss some for me johnny mumbled and fell forward on his face chapter fear cay trail a thousand big noisy thunderbolts seemed to be making music for johnny while he sat on a cloud in sepia blackness the thunder music was steady and not nice to listen to nor to feel either because one of the cannonading thunderbolts occasionally flew off at a tangent and struck johnny heavily in the chest making him feel as if he wanted to open his eyes and jump except that the cloud which held him up was so soft and comfortable somebody said close the windows i think johnny is coming out of it johnny opened his eye and what he saw showed him that he was not on a cloud but on a comfortable berth in doc savages largest speedplane monk was closing the windows to shut out the motor noise which was terrific the silencers being cut off from the exhausts for greater power efficiency around about were kel avery burly da clima docs five men and doc himself the plane hit an air bump jumped a little then settled level again cloud scud scraped past the windows where are we asked johnny and was surprised at the strength of his own voice over the caribbean monk advised what a good many miles off the southern tip of florida monk elaborated but the last i remember is folding up on that long island beach johnny gulped how did you find out where santini went you talked monk assured him maybe you dont remember it doc shot some stuff into you to make you rest you told us a complete story johnny shut his eyes opened them i recall now it was like a dream how badly am i hurt a few cracked ribs said monk you can navigate all right now doc says unless you jump around too brisk ill be superamalgamated said johnny which means hes all right snorted ham who was on a berth opposite sword cane across his knees a sick man couldnt think of such words johnny sat up found himself fairly steady then asked how long have i been out of the picture you got slammed night before last monk explained the bony geologist asked hastily have i missed anything not a thing what about the patriarch with the alabaster locks dan thunden monk grunted believe it or not he hired one of the fastest planes in new york and lit out for this part of the world a bird named windy allen owned the plane and flew it how did you acquire that knowledge the pilot he hired windy allen was talkative and told around what a swell wad of coin he was to get for flying the old goat down to the caribbean doc checked up the airports as a matter of routine and got the dope there that windy allen sure lived up to his name johnny raised higher leaned over and peered down through gossamer puddles of cloud which were almost blindingly white because of the sun shining upon them perhaps a mile below was a finely riffled expanse of ultramarine a limitless vista of blue that slid away to the horizons in a panorama so vast that it was a bit breathtaking the caribbean johnny said right bring me a chart and ill point out the exact spot that santini indicated long tom had retired to the tiny soundproofed cubicle which held the radio apparatus he popped into view like a pale jackinabox i just got an sos he barked doc savage swung back to his side where is it coming from long tom the bird isnt giving his position advised the electrical expert from the sound of his fist hes sending the letters as he picks them off a code chart the bronze man bent over the instruments and adjusted the dials the signals from the loudspeaker were very weak and he turned on more volume irregular hesitant the dots and dashes whined out of the ether whoever is sending does not know the code doc agreed well try the directional antenna doc turned a larger knob and this swung a directional loop aerial mounted in the plane fuselage to the rear of the cabin possibly thirty seconds were required to pick the point at which the erratic signals were the loudest either northwest or southeast of us he decided kel avery wrinkled her brow but cant you tell nearer the directional loop only shows the plane of greatest intensity of radio signals doc explained the sending station is on a line drawn through our present position from the northwest to the southeast but the only way we can tell the exact direction is to take another bearing when we have gone on a few miles johnny came hobbling back favoring his injured chest holding a chart in both bony hands he pointed the place santini indicated is southeast of here he said the radio s s long tom barked i wonder he did not finish the radio speaker continued to buzz three dots three dashes three dots in monotonous succession the signals seemed to grow weaker as the minutes passed doc worked with dividers rule and pencil on the chart and some five minutes later when the great plane had hurtled through almost twentyfive miles of sunscorched sky he took a second radiocompass bearing and drew a line where this intersected the first bearing was the location of the wireless appeal for aid southeast he announced and promptly went forward to change the course of the plane johnny had fallen to studying the chart a puzzled expression overspread his long studious face ill be supermalgamated he muttered whats eating you renny wanted to know there is no island shown where santini had his finger on the map johnny muttered doc came back from the cockpit having turned the flying over to the ingenius mechanical robot johnny met the bronze man with a look of bewilderment the chart does not show an island doc he advised the bronze man considered for a moment then went on back to the radio cubicle he switched on the transmitter and alternately sent and received for some time there may be an island after all he said at last huh renny grunted but the map i got in touch by radio with the hydrographic office of the navy department doc explained they looked over old charts of this region for us and it seems some ancient maps did show the presence of an island did the island have a name renny asked fear cay doc said it was named that on the old maps returned to the wave length on which the s s call was being sent the radio speaker continued to buzz dots and dashes at no time however was anything received other than three dots three dashes three dots queer the guy dont give his position monk muttered anybody with gumption would know enough to do that long tom after listening intently glanced around that sender cannot be far away he said how can you tell kel avery asked curiously long tom shrugged oh when youre close to a station very close that is theres a noticeable difference you can almost hear the key close ham laid his sword cane aside got a pair of binoculars and began to use them through the scattered patches of cloud a slight quantity of oil from the engines had smeared the windows and he slid one of the panes back in order that he might see better the motor moan came in with whooping volume fear cay ham bawled suddenly every one in the plane crowded to cabin windows pretty kel avery was breathless she looked even more the cinema star now for she wore about what a movie director would request his star to affect when making an adventure picture her boots laced breeches and leather blouse were new but serviceable big overmuscled da clima hulked in the background his square face slightly purple as if he were straining mentally possibly trying to envision what not even hams powerful glasses could as yet reveal fear cay was still miles away but it seemed to rush toward them so terrific was the speed of the plane doc went to the pilots cockpit and tilted the plane downward the sea heaved up at them like a bloating green paunch and the cay climbing out of the haze took on definite contour i say ham pointed out excitedly it doesnt look like a place where a boat could land the lawyer was drawing attention to the coral reef around fear cay such reefs encircling islands of coral formation were a rule rather than an exception but usually they had one or more openings which gave access to the lagoon within but there were no apertures in the jagged band around this cay looking down from the height of the plane the reef resembled a necklace of ugly gray foam for the waves broke over the coral fangs with smashing violence the island itself was low a bog of mangrove swamp and jungle nowhere did it project more than a few yards above the sea couldnt be seen from a great distance renny boomed that helps explain why it isnt on the modern charts long tom jammed his head into the radio box then hauled it out again that s is being sent from fear cay he barked ham dropped the binoculars and scooped up his sword cane to point yes and i think i see where its being sent from he shouted look that wrecked plane the reef around fear cay was a foaming ring of stone but the isle itself had at most points a wide beach of silvercolored sand lined with tall royal and cocoanut palms the trees bobbed their bundled fronds contorting for there seemed to be considerable of a breeze the plane lay at the beach edge half buried in a tangle of mangroves both slender wings were wiped off the wind fluttered fabric around the edge of a great hole which gaped in the fuselage and the single engine was detached and lay deeper in the mangroves barely distinguishable ham called doc see any one no said the bronze man are we going to land we are doc banked the plane out over the reef where jade and emerald surf sloshed itself into an ivory suds then swooped over the lagoon with its kaleidoscopic coloring the hull touched so lightly that only the braking effect and the appearance of a long foam tail showed them they were down whooping motor gusts kicked them inshore the royal palms seemingly grew larger standing up like pillars of silver from the gaudiness of oleanders jessamine poinsettia gulls and a forktailed frigate bird sailed inquiringly about the plane the breeze was blowing inshore and the air above the beach was gray with fine driven coral sand the palm fronds convulsed steadily and palmetto leaves trembled to the wind doc cut the motors the plane was kicked around with its nose into the wind then sailed backward until the reinforced hull grounded on the beach the men unloaded eyes open doc warned they all ran toward the wrecked plane the windblown coral grains gnawed at their naked skin like sleet and the sun was brazen merciless with its heat they waded into palmettos sank ankledeep in soft ground then worked through mangroves doc stopped abruptly and pointed saying nothing holy cow renny gulped a long grisly object lay under a bush he was clad in khaki trousers boots a leather blouse an aviators helmet it bore the shape of a man vaguely but where face and hands should have been there was only grisly bare bone a skeleton renny rumbled but doc it takes years to turn a body into a skeleton and those clothes are not even weatherbeaten doc savage advanced while monk caught kel averys arm and guided her back so that she would not be unnecessarily upset the leather blouse of the thing on the ground was unbuttoned only rib bones were beneath they were bare and white almost polished a freshly made skeleton long tom decided aloud now i ask you brothers what do you make of that a brittle silence was his only answer doc picked up one of the boots shook it and bare white tibia fibula and metatarsal bones rattled out whew ham gulped and his knuckles whitened on his sword cane what dyou make of this long tom asked doc savage indicated the skull after removing the helmet the top of the head is caved in as if it might have been fractured when the plane crashed ill be superamalgamated johnny murmured you maintain this is the pilot of the demolished aircraft doc did not answer but arose and studied the tracks around the plane and the marks it had made when wrecked the ship was trying to take off probably just got into the air and a number of bullets put the motor out of commission he said the ship is full of bullet holes possibly it crashed trying to land doc came back and searched the leather jacket which had enclosed the bones he found papers and letters which bore a name this is windy allen old dan thundens flier he announced the bronze man gave attention to the wrecked plane inside there was a radio transmitter and receiver doc removed the metal shields and held a palm on the vacuum tubes on the transmitter side hot he said that means some one used them for sending probably up until the time our plane was sighted who asked renny the bigfisted engineer did not put the query with the manner of a man asking a question to which he does not expect an answer renny knew docs ability as a sign reader doc circled slowly the flakegold pools of his eyes seeming a bit more agitated more refulgent there were tracks in the soft earth prints which told the bronze man what had occurred he had seen the footprints of santini leaking hallet old dan thunden and the others on the south beach of long island all of those prints were here about the wrecked plane the ship seems to have been shot down by santini and his crowd doc announced thunden and his pilot were aboard dan thunden escaped into the jungle but the pilot got a fractured skull in the crash renny indicated the skeleton but what made the pilot like this they couldnt have been here more than a few hours what made him a skeleton so quickly doc savage did not reply and there was a somewhat breathless silence while the others waited hopefully then renny shivered knowing doc was not going to commit himself who used the radio the bigfisted engineer persisted thunden doc said renny boomed then the whole crooked crew santini thunden and everybody is on this island exactly doc said and that means it would not be a bad idea to locate santinis plane how from the air renny nodded and looked about monk and kel avery were somewhere back toward the beach ham johnny long tom and da clima had separated evidently to look over the vicinity wed better call our gang together and get in the air renny decided they moved toward the beach the whisper of windblown coral particles increasing palm fronds arattle above the small gale wailing faintly in the mangroves i wonder if pat is all right renny rumbled and made flinty blocks out of his massive fists say if theyve done anything to her his teeth ground audibly they gathered about the plane prepared to wade out and clamber aboard look doc said sharply and pointed down the beach some two hundred yards a man had popped out of the mangroves he was a wiry man with white beard that covered his chest like the front of a dress shirt and a great mane of snowy hair dan thunden monk breathed dan thunden threw out his chest fashioned a cup around his mouth with his hands and howled into the wind bomb in your plane he yelled had the bomb gone off at that point astonishment could not have been more complete kel avery and docs five men all of whom had come running at the call stood rigidly and stared at dan thunden da clima for once showed a nimble wit he leaped toward the plane big feet churning up water and sand he dived through the cabin door doc savage was on his heels they raked the plane interior with anxious glances doc worked aft for there was the most likely hiding place da clima went forward musclebound shoulders hunched eyes roving the bomb how she get in the plane he mumbled anxiously every damn minute some of us feller he watch the plane yes doc pounced abruptly he had discovered a cabin pocket which looked more plump than it had before his hand delved in gingerly and brought out a bundle of six or eight sticks of dynamite to which was attached a trio of flashlight batteries wired together a detonating coil and an alarm clock with a crude set of contacts rigged on the minute hand and the clock face da clima lumbered up and looked that meester she no so funny he gulped to go off in five minutes the clock she is fixed no doc clambered out of the plane with his explosive prize carefully adjusted the clock hands to close the contact earlier then flung the bomb far down the beach it bounced rolled close to a royal palm lay there an instant then detonated coral sand climbed in a great mushroom tiny seashells were mixed with the sand and whistled about like buckshot the silver bole of the royal palm split fronds fell out of the top then the palm upset slowly and majestically echoes coughed hollowly then subsided even the whine of the breeze the hissing of coral sand seemed to subside dan thunden still stood on the beach two hundred yards away abruptly down the beach in the opposite direction from there dan thunden stood there was a commotion behind a gum bush a man stepped out stood staring at the plane seeming surprised that it had not been blown into fragments the newcomer was santini and he was so far away that the red ribbon across his chest seemed small as a scarlet thread doc savage spoke rapidly in a low voice monk ham da clima and miss avery stay with the plane he directed johnny you and long tom and renny get hold of dan thunden if you can he and santini are fighting each other and id like to know why thunden wont throw in with us he warned us and probably saved our plane from that bomb renny rumbled what about you doc ill try to do business with santini doc said grimly chapter the island of death santini showed scant interest in doing business with the bronze mans party however the instant doc started toward him the mustached man dived a hand for the coat lapel under which his chest ribbon disappeared and brought out his ornate automatic evidently he no longer carried it under the tails of his coat the gun whacked powder noise and its echoes cackled among the tall palms the slug kicked up sand went on a hundred yards and kicked sand again monk unlimbered a superfirer pistol and blasted away at santini but santini had dived to cover in the opposite direction dan thunden scampered to shelter white beard flying doc ran in pursuit of santini the three men he had designated to chase thunder johnny long tom and renny set out dang it doc dont you want some help monk yelled if anything happens to that plane we might spend the rest of our lives here doc called not turning you stick there santini did not shoot again tracks showed that he had set out directly across the island the terrain was higher here with a growth of crotons calabash trees custard apples and even guavas cactus there was sand and enough grass that doc could follow santinis trail without great difficulty they crossed a low stretch where mangroves were a tangle a festering morass populated by humpbacked spiders and land leeches then came high ground again and large gnarled silk cotton trees and farther on jungle with lianas and grotesque aeriai roots entwining santini was following a definite trail one cleared through the jungle some months ago judging by the shrubs which had grown up in the path the swarthy man with the remarkable mustache was evidently running at a headlong pace for doc himself was going fast and had not yet sighted santini from the air the island had seemed entirely of coral formation but it now became apparent as the terrain lifted sharply that the central area was of more substantial construction the bronze mans casual glances discerned clayslates micaceous and talcose schists as well as crystalline and compact limestones a formation which his knowledge of geology told him constituted what geologists call the caribbean series doc paused frequently and listened he could judge santinis progress now by the occasional outcries of tropical birds these noises raucous at best might have sounded no different to an inexperienced ear but the bronze man could detect those that were alarmed abruptly doc turned aside santini had stopped a metallic phantom making no appreciable stir in the jungle doc circled until he caught sight of santini the man had halted to use his eyes and ears santini seemed satisfied that he was not followed the swell and collapse of his chest as he sighed his relief was visible santini went on more slowly breathing deeply to regain his wind mopping perspiration the breeze made soft noise in the foliage gulls going past overhead sailed sidewise in the small gale thrushes and banana birds flew through the trees when disturbed rather than above the foliage where the breeze was stronger voices came from ahead doc quickened his pace then halted to peer through a screen of vines santini had met the lawyer hallet the fat barrister seemed to be nervous his birdlike mannerisms more pronounced he had stripped to his undershirt and was fanning himself with a dry palm frond two heavy blue revolvers were belted about his middle cowboy style the belt loops stuffed with cartridges the pair consulted in voices so low that the words did not reach doc then they went on and the bronze man lost sight of them he followed their trail it was not more than four or five minutes later when weird things began to happen a loud cry rasped out guttural with an awful terror it was hallets voice and it ended in uncanny fashion ended suddenly as if the man who shrieked had been enveloped completely by the horror which had come upon him macabre silence followed then birds flew up calling harshly from all over the jungle making a frightened bedlam doc savage glided forward and soon caught sight of santini the swarthy man with the waxed mustaches was backing across an expanse of rock eyes fixed with hypnotic steadiness upon the stone a few yards distant the rock was smooth except for the undulations and tiny cracks made by the weather there was nothing to show what fascinated santini doc savage remained where he was ears straining and abruptly he caught a horrible moaning cry muffled until he could not tell from where it came the cry affected santini in grisly fashion for he sprang backward as if the sound was that of some voracious beast invisible in the scalding sunlight but which was menacing him santini veered to the left abruptly and ran across the expanse of weathercracked stone he vanished over a small ridge of rock doc ran forward swinging so as to pass near where santini had been when he evidenced such terror nothing out of the ordinary came to the attention of the bronze mans eyes what had happened to hallet was a profound mystery doc topped the rocky ridge he halted so suddenly that his feet skidded a little santini had vanished doc went forward a few yards flakegold eyes probing and alert then he circled warily lest there be a trap it was too much to believe that santini had sprinted far enough to get into the jungle beyond the rocky space doc went completely around the rocky area and nowhere did be find tracks left by the swarthy man who affected the waxed mustache and the scarlet chest ribbon going back to the starting point the bronze man began a painstaking process of following santinis trail over the smooth hard stone to do this he employed a small powerful magnifying glass santini had plunged through a small water puddle at one point deposited by a recent rain for the next few yards the trail was clear wetly defined doc ran ahead following it suddenly there was a low dull clanking noise down went the slab of rock on which doc stood there was no time to pitch clear doc plummeted downward eight or ten feet he judged his fall to be great muscles enabled him to land lightly on hard rock scufflings and scratchings came from one side a terrific blow smashed down on his head he sank as if struck by a gigantic hammer doc savage was twisting aside instinctively as the blow landed and the movement absorbed much of the violence his head remained clear on all fours he scuttled to the left encountered a rough stone wall and stood erect silence fell stone grated softly above probably the stone trapdoor closing more tightly it must have been made with diabolic exactness for docs sharp gaze had failed to detect it true part of his failure to notice the trap could be blamed on santinis wet tracks for they had progressed boldly across the slab which had tilted the blackness was almost eyehurting doc felt in a pocket found a coin and tossed it his opponent failed to fall for the trick the metallic tinkle echoed and reechoed indicating a large cavern with many passages doc wore his vest of many padded pockets containing the mechanical devices which he used frequently they were gems of scientific skill these gadgets they had saved his life on many occasions a tiny tubular container hardly as large as a talcum can came out of the vest doc opened it noiselessly then made several passes through the air a cloud of fine powder quite invisible in the intense murk was wafted in the direction in which he knew his foe to be doc replaced the container and more slowly deliberately waiting for the powder to settle he produced what an observer had there been one who could see in the dark would have mistaken for a flashlight but this had a lens that was so purple as to be almost black doc thumbed the button the flashlight device was a tiny powerful projector of ultraviolet rays the light which is commonly called black because the retina of the human eye is not sensitive to them the beams which cause certain substances such as ordinary vaseline to glow with weird colors a startling thing happened the figure of docs foe stood out in the darkness an eerie blue apparition the floor on which he stood and the contour of a stone wall behind him was also visible this was due to the fact that the powder which the bronze man had thrown was one which glowed when exposed to the ultraviolet beams the enemy could not see his bronze quarry he never knew doc was close to him until metallic fingers closed about his throat stifling an outcry clutching doc got hold of a short rifle with which the man had clubbed that first blow he wrenched and got the weapon then he crushed the fellow down to the floor the man struggled and kicked tried to cry out but his muscles might have been denuded of life for all the good it did him against the bronze giant who held him the attacker was helpless doc sought and found a certain spot on the back of the fellows head low down near its juncture with the top cervical the chain of small bones which comprised the neck he exerted pressure in a fashion taught him by his fabulous knowledge of surgery the victim promptly became rigid paralyzed he would remain helpless and speechless until doc or some one with equal skill and knowledge worked on his neck again after which he would have nothing more than a bad headache and a stiff neck to show for his experience doc used a conventional flashlight the man was one of santinis thugs the fellow had been a member of the party which had endeavored to kill doc and his companions in the car outside the office of fountain of youth inc in new york city roving his flash beam doc discerned a passage which led to the left and downward the floor was sandy and showed numerous tracks the bronze man advanced following the tracks a twist at the head of the flashlight caused the beam to narrow until it was no larger than a cigarette a long white string which roved ceaselessly the flash was one which operated from a spring generator rather than a battery which might exhaust itself the generator ran soundlessly details of the cavern became apparent the underground labyrinth was not the work of human hands but of the elements softer stratas of stone had been worn or dissolved by subterranean waters at spots there were chambers of considerable size again it was necessary to stoop and even crawl but nature had received assistance at some points on three different occasions docs light picked up spots where the passages had been widened by human hands to permit comfortable passage a strange odor not exactly pleasant soaked the stale air doc sampled the tang several times once stopping for several moments to give his nostrils a chance the smell was not animal nor was it of putrefaction it was vague baffling discovery of a light ahead caused doc to forget the aroma for the time being he doused his own illumination then glided forward the other lights came from electric lanterns several of them doc heard the thump of hammers on stone and the scraping of shovels santini and a number of his men were gathered in a long low chamber evidently they had not heard docs encounter with their fellow at the entrance stop making noise santini snarled fermate stop men who had been tapping the stone walls and shoveling in the sand floor ceased their efforts santini took a long breath shuddered and wiped his forehead with a silk handkerchief che vergogna he muttered what a shame our good friend hallet has met with misfortune hell said a thicknecked fellow and dropped his shovel you mean that doc savage got im worse than that replied santini whatcha mean worse there was a trapdoor in the rock of which we knew nothing explained santini hallet walked in advance and fell through he screamed and i saw what happened to him before the trapdoor closed again santini paused to shudder si signors i saw it was ghastly and after the trap closed i could bear him moan the man with the shovel cursed then asked it was he is a skeleton by now affirmed santini doc savage advanced a few paces more and stood well within the chamber but to one side in another passage which led off to the north or so it felt from the current of air against his neck the air was strong with the unexplained odor the men with the lights and the tools were silent for a time evidently they all understood what had happened to hallet and were thinking it over several looked uneasy its that damned old dan thundens work grated a man yeah another agreed the old rip hes sure caused us hell it mighta been better if we hadnt tried to doublecross im in the first place givin him his half split in the racket wouldve been better than goin through what were goin through santini sighed it is spilled milk how were we to know that old thunden would steal that package containing all of the product that we had and mail it to this relative of his kel avery kel avery a third man grunted damn it im still wonderin if the girl weve got is really kel avery or that doc savages cousin we shall know the answer to that before long i promise you santini declared the men stood in silence as if not knowing what to do doc occupied the interval with thinking over what he had heard dan thunden had once been a partner of santinis it seemed and they had split after a quarrel over thundens receiving half the proceeds of whatever nefarious scheme they had underfoot why did old thunden send the girl the package in the first place a man pondered aloud it was undoubtedly his first step in an effort to persuade her to furnish financial backing for his project said santini you mean that old whitewhiskers intended marketing the stuff himself si santini nodded that is my guess did you destroy savages plane santini swore round oaths of south europe non the bomb was in the plane but dan thunden was watching unknown to me he jumped out and yelled a warning and they got the bomb out in time the man with the shovel dug savagely into the sand but whyd thunden do that is he workin with savage now non santini shook his head his is the game of a mastermind he hopes for savage and his men to vanquish us then he will step in and eliminate savage give old thunden credit some one muttered hes got a brain he oughta have said another hes been around a hundred and thirtyone years a guy that old oughta have some gray matter again the conversation gave signs of getting nowhere and doc savage decided to try an expedient which he had used on other occasions the bronze man was a master of mimicry of voice imitation the last man to speak had been on the outskirts of the group in comparative darkness doc set himself to attempt a difficult feat that of using his skill as a mimic and as a ventriloquist to make it seem that the man had asked a question doc wanted to find out just what had happened to hallet santini interrupted at the wrong instant saying you had best resume the search we must find dan thundens supply of the material the old devil has hidden it well you think its in this mess of caves asked some one im not certain but it is likely santini replied it was in these caves that dan thunden dwelled for the ninetyone years since his ship was wrecked here in and only he alone of the crew reached shore it is reasonable to think that he would store it here right at that somebody agreed doc decided to try his ventriloquism trick what gets me is just how those bodies are turned into skeletons so quickly he said assuming the voice of the man on the outskirts of the crowd just how is it done the bronze man got a bad break from the direction of the entrance feet pounded leaking appeared adrip with perspiration excited doc savage is in here he howled the instant he heard that doc savage moved silently along the wall intending to get past leaking unobserved if he could how do you know savage is in here santini roared the guard at the door was laid out leaking barked hes paralyzed or somethin only that bronze guy couldve done it flashlights and electric lanterns which had not been in use by santinis party were now turned on their glow flooded the confines of the cavern and outlined docs great bronze frame leaking saw doc the fellows pores seemed literally to squirt water as terror struck him there he is he squawled guns roared lead spaded at the hard stone knocking off fragments leaving metallic smears only one avenue of flight was open doc took it back into the side passage he whipped behind him weapons continued to thunder the rap of pistols intermingling with the whoop of repeating shotguns a machine gun let loose a staccato bedlam bullets squawled and ricocheted and seemed to pursue doc like invisible bees doc used his flashlight for haste was more desirable than concealment he rounded an angle in the underground channel vaulted over a slab of stone which had fallen from the roof and slid down a steep slope next came a large room and beyond that a narrow passage again doc scuttled along this for a hundred feet then a door barred his way the door was of timbers very solid and nowhere could be discerned a fastener doc threw a shoulder against it the panel held like gibraltar did not as much as squeak under his hammering bulk he stood still his flashlight roving the timbers a shouting shooting tumult the pursuit came closer it looked very much as if doc were trapped chapter the net trap doc savage kept his flashlight beam on the door he had twisted the lens assembly again making the beam wide and brilliant and as he stared he gave the spring wind of the generator another twist an act which might possibly have been attributed to nervousness but in no other way did he show that he was in peril of imminent death his bronze features were composed inscrutable he reached up abruptly and inserted his fingers in a narrow crack at the top of the door beyond barely in reach of his finger tips he found a small lever he threw this and the door came open docs eyes sharp beyond the average under ordinary circumstances had missed nothing in this moment of stress for he had discerned faint smudges at the top of the door a sufficient clue he pitched through the door and slammed it at his back santini and his men reached the panel cursing firing their guns the lead slugs dug dully at the hardwood but did not come through doc ran his flashlight beam about in search of fasteners but they were concealed in the stone wall in such a fashion that he could not get to them without a lengthy search fingers came through in search of the secret catch santini and his men obviously knew of it doc struck the fingers with a hardened metallike fist a man screamed and the fingers were withdrawn dripping crimson somebody thrust a machine gun snout through the hole and began to spray bullets methodically doc grasped the gun muzzle pulled but the weapon was too large to come through it continued firing and the barrel soon became too hot to hold doc released it a second rapidfirer joined the first then some one began to fish for the catch with a bent ramrod doc clutched the ramrod and jerked it through getting a scream from the fellow who had his finger hooked in the loop at the rod end badate yelled santini take care signor we are getting nowhere this way ive got a grenade a man barked come bello santini squawled relapsing into his native tongue in his excitement how beautiful datemi give me doc retreated hastily from the door the grenade would blow down the panel and it was safer for him to attempt to find an exit he was a score of yards down the passage and rounding an angle when he heard the door grate open they had discovered they could reach the catch hence had not used the grenade preceded by a storm of angry bullets santini and his gang charged in pursuit weve got im now a man bawled fool grated santini we do not know but that there may be another exit from this passage havent you explored all of this place some one demanded non said santini on my first visit here when we found the old man dan thunden living here we did not pry into this place it was not healthy doc crossed a chamber dived into another underground channel and a moment later the voices of his pursuers were echoing behind him didnt old dan thunden trust you when you was here the first time a man grunted looks like hed have been so glad to see his first white man in over ninety years that hed have fallen over himself to show you around santini said nothing to that except to snarl presto make haste and doc savage with his pursuers close behind him came to a sudden stop his flakegold eyes aghast and faintly unbelieving rested upon the macabre thing before him he had come upon a vision to impel horror in the most strongwilled of men completely forgotten for the moment were the words which the bronze giant had overheard words which had told him that dan thunden had been a castaway upon this island since the wrecking of the schooner of which the man was captain in and that the first visitors to the island had been santinis party how santini had arrived at the island remained to be seen but it was probably by air for the ugly reef completely around the island was an impassable barrier to any surface vessel wrinkled trousers a shirt open at the throat costly shoes now mudstained lay on the floor before docs eyes the garments were wrinkled wrinkled but not entirely collapsed for there were bones inside the skeleton of hallet the birdlike lawyer that the skeleton had belonged to hallet was not to be doubted for doc had seen the garments on the living man the jungle muck on the shoes was still damp and overhead was the mechanism of the trapdoor which had precipitated the shyster lawyer to his death docs eyes roved over the floor his flash beam probed but there was nothing to indicate the nature of the fantastic fate which had overtaken the birdmannered barrister the floor bore no stains no prints there was a minor fracture on hallets skull as if he might have fallen upon his head and been knocked unconscious or perhaps mortally hurt but what had turned him into a skeleton remained an unearthly mystery a yell pealed behind doc flashlights splattered their beams upon him santini and his gang had arrived a gun bellowed in the cavern all but rupturing eardrums and doc felt the cold snap of the slug past his head the bronze man aimed his flashlight beam at the men and it raced an incandescent rod against their eyes they cursed blinded fate presto santini yelled make haste seize him but santini did not take the lead and his men showed no desire for a fight at close quarters there was nothing to prevent them shooting however their guns sounded as loud as cannons in the underground labyrinth one man was canny enough to throw up a hand and drag his black hair down over his eyes serving to shut off some of the glare so that he could tell about where docs flashlight lens was he emptied an automatic luck was with him a bullet collided with docs flash glass geysered and the white funnel of the beam collapsed magically bueno howled santini good doc whirled and glided down the passage he was handicapped he had no other light except the one which utilized ultraviolet rays and the powder which glowed and that was of no use just now running was difficult moreover and slow since each yard of progress had to be felt out the subterranean way being full of stony outthrusts which snagged face and limbs at the most unexpected moments with his best speed and a reckless disregard of physical pain in smashing into jutting rocks doc barely managed to keep ahead of the baying pack at his rear he covered what seemed to be at least a hundred yards side passages were everywhere this portion of fear cay was virtually an underground honeycomb the bronze man halted suddenly his ears alert ahead there was sound he listened and the skin at his nape felt an absurd tendency to crawl in spite of his power of control for the sound from in front of him was weird a noise which resembled nothing so much as a great pan of frying fat it was louder at moments a crackling and popping such as is heard when an egg is broken into a skillet of hot grease santini and the others heard it too they stopped hastily strained silence held them for an instant hells bells a man mumbled a scoltate breathed santini listen im draggin it outa here another wailed in terror they fled in abject fear doc savage stood and listened to the flight of the men who had been stricken with stark terror by the sound that was like grease in a pan on a hot stove the strange noise came closer as the bronze man delayed and he could tell that it was close to the cavern floor as if it might be flowing in the fashion of liquid out of his pocketed vest doc brought the canister holding the powder he flung some of the stuff in the direction of the sound then he used the ultraviolet projector what he saw made him feel as if cold fingers had grabbed at his nape and rimed up through his hair standing it on end there was no beast no monster nothing of physical size coming toward him the cave floor however seemed to be alive and undulating as if it were a river indeed some fantastic fluid might have been flowing toward him the powder landing on top of such a sinister stream and floating there until it was made phosphorescent by the ultraviolet beams would have caused such a phenomenon as he saw now but it was very dark and the eerie sheen of the powder did not reveal details doc backed away the frying sound seemed to grow louder and the animation on the cavern floor more boisterous it was as if the incredible menace was angered by his retreat the bronze man put on speed in his retreat santini and his gang had fled and were not menacing him so there was no sense in risking his life just to learn the nature of the mystery on the cavern floor the crackling and popping was left behind whatever made it did not seem capable of traveling swiftly doc found himself wandering through the tangle of underground tunnels he still retained his sense of direction but the course over which he had come was blocked by the mysterious horror which flowed on the cavern floor so there was nothing to do but prowl cautiously in an effort to locate another exit santini and his men were still in the subterranean passage from time to time doc heard echoing shouts the words unintelligible the sounds were ghostly in the inky darkness the bronze man searched through his pockets and that was a sign that he was worried for he knew very well that the pockets held no matches true there was a pair of tiny bottles holding chemicals which when exposed to the air and mixed would burn brilliantly and with great heat but their light would last for only a moment it would not be wise to waste them unexpectedly he saw light ahead it was the unmistakable glow of the hot tropical sun doc ran forward there was a rectangular aperture overhead perfectly square it had been evidently hewn out by human hands a ladder led up to it a stout ladder that was almost a staircase the bronze man was examining the ladder when an excited shout bawled out behind him heres the bronze guy the voice howled it was one of santinis men his voice echoes bounced hollowly then santini himself shouted from near by buena santini barked do not let him escape feet scuffled as men ran forward a gun roared the bullet chopped at the stone doc leaped for the ladder three steps he mounted with dazzling speed then four but something happened there was a grinding the ladder dropped downward carrying the bronze man with it too late doc realized this was another of the traps which the fantastic underground realm held there was no time to leap clear he fell fifteen or twenty feet was torn off the ladder by the shock of landing and slammed down on hard stone leaping up not greatly damaged he felt around him there was only smooth stone circular some eight feet in diameter with no opening as far up as he could reach a man threw a flashlight beam into the rock pit from above and doc saw that his prison was a welllike cavity capped by a trap on which the ladder had rested the man with the flash was leaking leaking mopped at his face shifted his flashlight to his left hand and used the right to draw a revolver heres where i fix everything he snarled and leveled his weapon santini lunged knocking at the gun it roared and the bullet deflected flattened near docs feet wait signor santini said grimly i have the big idea huh growled leaking we will make this bronze man do a job for us chuckled santini ah great wonderful majestic superb this idea of mine she is the swell one itd better be good leaking muttered doubtfully chapter the trail sinister leakings gun in firing the shot which santini had knocked aside had made a good deal of noise and the sound had volleyed through the hole toward which doc savage had been climbing when the trick ladder collapsed the report had carried some distance through the tropical sunlight the bigfisted engineer renny heard it he promptly halted cupped big hands behind his ears and listened hey gang did you get that he rumbled a percussion with the characteristics of a firearm admitted the gaunt johnny lets look into that snapped long tom renny dropped his oversized paws from his ears started forward then hesitated doc set us to hunting old dan thunden he pointed out long tom shrugged his weaklooking shoulders and said sourly a fine lot of luck weve had the old geezer gave us the slip like a ghost were wasting time prowling around here lets see what that shot was a recommendation of acumen said johnny and promptly threw his bony frame at the tangled jungle johnny was the freshest of the three for they had put forth no small effort in endeavoring to overhaul whitebearded dan thunden the heat and the density of the vegetation was a combination to sap vitality the huge renny was perspiring and bedraggled while long tom although far from exhausted seemed a bit paler than usual johnnys fortitude was remarkable considering the fact that another man would have been in a hospital from those cracked ribs in johnnys incredibly thin frame there seemed to repose an unlimited resistance to fatigue johnnys outstanding physical quality in fact was his endurance he seemed never to get tired they came out upon a comparatively level expanse of weathered stone the shot came from about here said long tom i think it was farther on renny rumbled the electrical wizard shook his head in a violent negative it was muffled as if fired in a hole or something lets look around and see if theres a pit or a cave in these rocks they advanced eyes busy johnny lifting his tower of bones on tiptoe peered around and got himself located ill be superamalgamated he said quietly eh long tom queried it was right around here that we last saw dan thunden said johnny the fellow traversed a convolutionary course prior to his evanescence eh said long tom i didnt get that last he means that thunden prowled around a lot before he vanished explained renny youre going to choke on those words some day long tom warned the bony johnny they continued their search for the source of the shot as a measure of safety they carried their small supermachine pistols in their hands and made sure that spare magazine drums fully loaded with the mercy bullets which produced quick unconsciousness were handy in coat pockets renny thumped something unintelligible lifted his machine pistol and sent an earsplitting bawl of sound over the cay long tom gulped what the dan thunden renny rumbled over there he pointed and his two companions looking saw a thatch of white hair a snowy beard an oldyoung face vanish behind the thick bole of a cocoanut palm he flattened before i could line up that first burst of bullets renny growled the bigfisted engineer fired again the machine pistol was charged every third cartridge with a tracer bullet and a grayish thread seemed to stretch from the muzzle to the distant palm where a shower of cocoanuts were kicked down renny corrected his aim but dan thunden had reached more substantial cover forgotten was the investigation of the shot they had heard the three men raced in pursuit of dan thunden they crashed headlong into brush tore at lianas and entwining plants knee deep in slime where the ground was low they kicked and wallowed knocking off the big land leeches avoiding the hideous looking spiders a cayman an alligator not much longer than one of johnnys bony arms fled madly at the uproar for a time they lost their quarry then they saw him peering at them from a tangle of mangroves and they set out again but once more dan thunden distanced them with an ease that was disgusting he must know every inch of this island to get around like that renny grumbled the fellow has the agility of an acrobat complained johnny then they saw thunden again he was leaning from behind an upthrust of coral this time he ran before they could fire renny and his two companions following came near enough to the beach that they could hear the surf grumbling in sea coves of coral out on the reef thunden had vanished once more but only for a few moments for they saw him a third time far down the beach running easily for a lad a hundred and thirtyone years old he takes the cake long tom snapped and increased his speed renny stopped booming wait whats the idea long tom pulled up yes elucidate johnny invited i just got wise to something renny rumbled old snowy whiskers is pulling a fast one on us he is showing himself deliberately to lead us where he wants us to go johnny absently drew his monocle out unwrapped it from the protecting handkerchief saw it was unbroken then replaced it seeming at no time to be aware of what he was doing eminently correct he admitted we are being decoyed long tom plunged on calling over his shoulder k now that we know what hes doing well keep our eyes open but im in favor of giving him a chase the other two reached the same decision and ran after the electrical wizard but they were more cautious now at times barely trotting that dan thunden was leading them to some spot which he wished them to visit was evident for he was careful not to let them lose his trail strange way for him to act grumbled renny no stranger than his warning us of that bomb in our plane long tom countered renny nodded id like to get my hands on him hed tell things you said it long tom agreed and the first thing he would explain would be just what turned that aviator into a skeleton the conversation ended sharply for dan thunden had halted and was making strange gestures with his hands one finger was to his lips he patted the air with the other hand seems to be asking us to be careful renny decided aloud dan thunden now stepped off the beach into the jungle and did not reappear renny and the other two went forward cautiously nearing a headland where the mangrove swamp jutted out beyond was a junglewalled cove with a beach of black manganese instead of white coral sand but they did not progress far from the jungle a revolver bawled the bullet squawked over their heads and chopped up water out near the reef the shot had come from the jungle the three men pitched for the undergrowth johnny grimacing a little the racing about heedless of his fractured ribs was beginning to have its effect they opened up with their superfirer pistols the slugs mowed down leaves splattered against hard palm boles and cut away vines a man howled in fright and they could bear him running away through the tropical labyrinth i recognize that voice johnny groaned its one of santinis gang the agony in the gaunt geologists voice caused long tom to eye him anxiously the ribs he queried no said johnny thats a dang lie long tom snapped youre about played out blast it you oughta be in a hospital yet stay behind johnny obeyed that command as they rushed forward but not from choice he was simply too weak to hold up his end of the charge they sighted a man fleeing through the growth he was making for the cove renny sighted deliberately his superfirer moaned the runner threw up his arms tossing a revolver high into the air then his head went down and he stumbled turned a perfect somersault after which he lay and squirmed with decreasing vigor until by the time doc savages three aides had reached him the man was limp and unconscious from the effects of the mercy bullets the flesh was torn slightly across his shoulders but he was not greatly damaged unless infection set in from the wounds which was unlikely since the mercy bullets carried their own antiseptic agent and even the tracer chemicals were of a type which did not produce infection lets see where he was goin renny boomed they plunged on caught the blue wink of sun from water ahead and came out on the cove beach gasoline smell met their nostrils holy cow renny exploded the three of them pitched backward for the shelter of the jungle the cove was a narrow shallow indentation and at one end the mangroves grew out into the water a plane santinis great seaplane was beached near this point green boughs had been cut and spread over the cabin and wings of the plane others longer cut and thrust into the soft black manganese sand around the ship the result was a perfect job of camouflaging which explained why they had not sighted the plane from the air under the concealment of wideflung palm fronds near the plane there was a hut also of green fronds thatched so that its presence had escaped notice from above three men stood near the hut each held a submachine gun at sight of docs men they began firing rennys superfirer bawling sent back a hail of lead one of the enemy trio went down the other pair dived behind palm trunks the fight which followed was short santinis men were at a disadvantage being outnumbered now three to two nor were they as good marksmen as their foes they had to plant bullets in vulnerable spots and that was difficult because of the bulletproof vests which docs men wore the decisive factor in the fray however was the fact that the slightest wound from one of the mercy bullets would put the man who received it out of commission as the last of the pair fell from behind his palm tree squirming with the delirium that preceded the quick stupor of the mercy chemical renny darted forward johnny tried to follow stumbled and went to his knees grimacing he tried to get up but failed ill be superamalgamated he gritted i seem to have folded up bigfisted renny went back scooped the bony geologist up easily and bore him along they reached the plane under his covering of green limbs and long tom tearing the boughs aside burst in to inspect the ship his feet sloshed through the water metallic thumps indicated he had stepped upon the floats a clatter showed he was in the cabin then his voice came out hollowly im a son of a gun he ejaculated what is it renny demanded come in here and look the electrical wizard invited renny carrying the vociferously objecting johnny worked to the plane and found long tom pointing at the wings more particularly at elongated punctures which gaped in the thin metal skin of the wings i first noticed the fuel tanks showed empty on the gauges then looked around for the reason said long tom theres the reason renny nodded soberly the cuts in the wings must have been made by a small ax or a knife wielded by a strong arm and they had penetrated the fuel tanks the strength of the gasoline odor moved renny to glance down and he saw in the black manganese sand the tiny pocks made by the dribbling fuel they stared at the evidence of vandalism in silence a jubilantly youthful voice said you gentlemen did a good job theah but youah work is not done the three men knocked down a length of camouflage wall in getting outside they stared in astonishment dan thunden stood some fifty yards distant beside a ridge of ragged gray coral renny snarled lifted his superfirer wait howled dan thunden youah boss doc savage santini has gotten hold of him renny lowered his gun what you had bettah help savage called thunden just tag along behind me and ill show you what to do renny yelled wait but thunden bobbed behind the coral ridge and vanished the three men started in pursuit but wrenched up as they heard a stirring in the hut near by a feminine voice came out of the shack of green boughs do i get any attention around here or not it asked chapter trouble underground pat renny howled and all three men whirled back and dived into the crudely constructed hut patricia savage sat on the black sand inside her face flushed and angry a length of stout piano wire evidently a spare piece from the plane repair kit had been fastened securely around her slender waist and the other end spiked to a palm which formed the rear brace of the hut renny lowered johnny and pounced upon the piano wire he wrenched at it but it held he began twisting it kinking and unkinking in an endeavor to break it you wont get anywhere that way pat advised i did that for hours renny nodded and put his huge hands to work on the knots they were tight and had evidently been fled with pincers you all right long tom asked pat they could see that she was im madder than a tomcat caught in a rat trap pat imparted violently what was that i heard the old whiskered goat yelling about doc something about santini having gotten doc renny said grimly oh said pat and shuddered i dont believe it renny informed her after freeing one strand of the piano wire doc has never yet been in a jam where he didnt have an ace up his sleeve this santini is the devil with a red ribbon across his chest pat murmured did they ever find out that you werent kel avery long tom asked her pat shook a negative with her bronze head i wouldnt be here if they had man those fellows are bad theyd have thrown me out of the plane if they had known who i was they very near did it anyway they kept you alive in hopes of making you tell them where the contents of that air mail parcel went to long tom questioned thats why where did it go to do you think i know pat asked sarcastically ask that other girl kel avery or maureen darleen or whatever she calls herself you dont seem to like her i dont like anybody who got me into what ive just gone through said pat long tom grinned i thought you wanted to be amused by a little excitement this has gone past the amusement stage pat said then grinned back at the electrical wizard but i dont mind much renny gave the piano wire a wrench it came free and he straightened advising there you are pat jumped up and ran out of the hut come on lets see if anything has really happened to doc outside they looked around hopefully it was johnny his eye unaffected by the weakness that came from his shattered ribs who leveled a pointing arm and declared there he is whitehaired dan thunden had waited they could see him through the jungle poised near a convenient palm bole that was bulletproof hey you cmere and tell us what this is all about renny roared dan thundens answer was a quick disappearance behind the palm for two cents id shoot him full of good hard lead bullets the next time he shows his nose long tom snarled i wouldnt pat advised why not hes on our side until we clean up on santinis outfit whered you learn that from santinis talk they set out after the elusive dan thunden holding their anger in check but vowing vengeance it was humiliating to be pawns maneuvered about by the old fellow but they were not so unwise as to fail to realize it was best that they follow him at such times as they lost the trail dan thunden showed his white head and made a noise to put them right toward the expanse of rock near the center of the cay their course led the same stony area where they had heard the shot which they had as yet no way of knowing had signaled doc savages capture by santinis crew did santinis talk tell you anything else renny asked pat as they worked through the tangled undergrowth plenty pat advised what the most fantastic story you ever heard pat explained this dan thunden was shipwrecked here in more than ninety years ago and was the only one from his ship to reach shore he has lived here since ive still got my doubts about that guy being a hundred and thirtyone years old long tom put in santini does not seem to doubt it pat retorted and santini is nobodys sucker well let that ride then renny grunted what else did you learn that santini found this island by accident said pat he was flying from south american in a stolen plane he had gotten into some trouble down there over killing a government official in venezuela and he was making for the united states after leading every one to believe he was flying south he could not take the usual air routes or fly over islands where there were settlements and radio or where he was likely to sight ships that explains why he happened to come over this outoftheway corner he was having motor trouble and landed then what then the mystery darkens pat replied they found dan thunden and something else something worth a great deal of money what search me renny came to a full stop in order to eye pat curiously do you mean to say you dont know yet what all this fighting is over he rumbled pat wrinkled a nose at the bigfisted engineer are you criticizing me no said renny but i had high hopes so did i pat told him i tried to pump santini but got precisely nowhere they were very glad to learn i did not know what was behind the trouble and i had to be careful not to get them to believing i was not kel avery johnny put in rather weakvoiced santini and his gang came to fear gay to get more of the stuff which was supposed to be in that air mail package but wasnt didnt they right pat said then looked anxiously at the bony geologist johnny had neglected his pet luxury his big words and that showed he was suffering johnny managed a twisted grin of reassurance pat continued santinis crowd shot down dan thundens plane when it arrived and killed the pilot since then theyve been trying to catch thunden to make him show them where the thing theyre after is hidden santini killed the pilot long tom asked slowly pat caught the strangeness in the electrical experts tone said curiously yes why the pilot was a skeleton when we found him said long tom pat shuddered and that reminds me of another thing theres some horror on the island of which santini and his men are in deadly terror they would not tell me what it is renny tossed tip a beam of an arm and advised theres that stretch of bare rock ahead where we heard the shot dan thunden vanished from sight of them a moment later and they drew their superfirers and haunted the jungle shrubs as they crept ahead aware that the strange oldyoung mans previous disappearance had marked the nearness of danger pat studied the expanse of naked stone then gasped oh softly eh long tom eyed her i heard santini and his men talk about this place said pat it is honeycombed underground with caves it was here that old dan thunden lived for more than ninety years santini and his gang thought the stuff whatever it is that they are searching for was hidden here there was silence while they peered through a bank of oleander and poinsettia in an effort to locate an opening but there was no sign of an aperture they advanced renny in the lead careful pat warned from santinis talk i think this place is a net of traps dan thunden rigged them up as a diversion while he lived here some idea of a pastime renny snorted they continued to go forward eyes busy on the rocky surface underfoot there were many cracks numerous tiny pits but none of them seemed to be a secret door unexpectedly dan thunden called to them from the jungle stamp on that square of reddish rock to youah right he advised thatll open the trapdoah renny hesitated then swung to the right a few moments later he was inspecting the panel of faintly rosecolored stone then he put his hands in his pockets and teetered thoughtfully on his heels removing the big hands from his pockets he dropped to his knees and began to feel over the dull vermilion stone the old goat said to stamp on it long tom snapped dry up renny said trying to keep his rumbling voice down to a whisper im going to get even with white whiskers for his little tricks renny fumbled with the cracks around the stone for a time then stood up he stamped to dan thunden it undoubtedly appeared that renny was slamming his heel down on the square of red stone but he was actually kicking a few inches to one side renny turned it dont work he called try it again suh yelled dan thunden renny stamped again missing the square panel something has gone wrong he shouted well get over to the other side of the place while you come and open it with that he guided johnny long tom and pat away they stopped some hundred and fifty yards from the stone turned and saw dan thunden scuttling for the rock the old man reached the panel and delivered a resounding blow with a heel the panel promptly flew open lid fashion dan thunden howled i told you to stamp then he sank down prone on the stone and seemed to go to sleep renny and his three companions reaching the whitehaired man found him snoring loudly unmoving the square of red stone was still open a black cavity was below pat looked puzzled for a moment then smiled understanding docs anesthetic bulbs she exclaimed good guess renny grinned he indicated the edges of the secret door where tiny particles of thin glass could be distinguished i put some of the bulbs around the slab and they broke when the lid opened the gas inside of them produces quick unconsciousness pat drew back instinctively the gas loses its strength in less than a minute renny advised her it wont overcome us now long tom who looked like a physical weakling stooped and picked up dan thundens frame with manifest ease the old goat wasnt so wise after all he grinned boy when he wakes up will his face be red there was a stir in the black void below the secret door a man cursed then queried whats goin on out there it was one of santinis men he must have heard the noise as the hidden panel opened and come to investigate he was canny they could tell by his voice that he was well back in the subterranean depths protected from a bullet renny tried a trick knowing that his voice would sound unnatural to the man below and hoping the fellow would fail to identify it weve got old dan thunden renny said come up and have a look yeah growled the man beneath whore you that stumped renny but pat came to the rescue tell him snicker she breathed thats the name of one of the three who were watching me snicker renny called the man in the cavern was silent still suspicious and finally said cmon down here where i can get a look at you i gotta be sure its you snicker rennys long puritanical face was very sober for an instant because he knew the santini gangster would become alarmed before long then the gloomylooking engineer dipped a huge hand into his coat and brought out some of the tiny glass globes which held more of the anaesthetic gas that had vanquished dan thunden taking careful aim renny lobbed three of the bulbs in quick succession hitting and breaking they made squishing sounds the gas was colorless odorless and victims were always unaware of the effects until it was too late to do anything there was a sound as of a bundle of old clothes being dropped and they knew the man below had collapsed after descending a series of steps cut in the native stone they found their victim a broad and squat man with a crooked nose and a pitted facesnoring lazily behind an outthrust in the cave wall they relieved the fellow of a submachine gun and a canvas knapsack containing extra ammunition drums johnny who had been receiving rennys assistance in traveling asked what impends now long tom who did not smoke but who carried a cigarette lighter in lieu of matches thumbed the tiny flame alight and squinted in the fitful glow which was cast over their surroundings he noted particularly the rugged nature of the cavern floor this is no place for you johnny he breathed the going will be too rough for those ribs of yours the thin geologist sighed that is regrettably true so you better stick here on guard you can watch dan thunden and this other guy they will be unconscious for at least an hour johnny pointed out then he groaned slightly and sat down but ill stay here sure you wont pass out renny asked positive johnny insisted they left him there a form as thin as death itself crouched above the two men who slept so weirdly his bony fingers held a superfirer pistol and handy it his right coat pocket were several of the anaesthetic bulbs a man who knew how could use those bulbs without a mask simply by holding his breath for the space of almost a minute during which time the vapor would have its effect on an enemy who breathed it then dissipate itself the stuff worked only when taken into the lungs pat whispered careful remember theres something on this cay that can turn a man into a skeleton whatever the thing is santini and his men are in deadly fear of it weve seen a sample of its work long tom replied quietly thinking of the skeleton of the aviator which they had found on the beach they endeavored to make as little noise as possible between the three of them only renny had a flashlight one of the instruments which got its current from a selfcontained spring generator the beam of this was played about cautiously once they heard a faint strange noise from some side avenue of nocturnal murk listening they were puzzled sounded like fat frying long tom mumbled when the sound did not come closer but continued low and barely audible as if coming from behind a closed door they went on to avoid becoming lost they daubed spots of a chemical mixture at intervals this stuff would glow when exposed to ultraviolet light and long tom the electrical genius carried a projector of the black light similar to the one which doc kept on his person thus their back trail would be marked plainly if needful they were crawling along a sandfloored tunnel when rennys huge hand stopped them get that breathed the engineer there were voices ahead hollow the words not understandable they advanced and a glow of light appeared men stood in a circle around a great metallic figure which lay on the sandy floor of a chamber doc renny gulped they did get him after all doc savage was bound with a stout rope woven from plant fibre literally hundreds of turns encircled his mighty frame he resembled a mummy santini and a part of his gang made up the circle of men they seemed still to fear the bronze giant securely though he was bound for they did not venture close and they were careful to keep their flashlight beams off the bronze mans eyes there was something about those flakegold orbs a hypnotic quality that chilled santini said youre probably wondering why we did not shoot you when we had the chance signor savage doc said nothing santini scowled you were kept alive to do a bit of work for us and if you do it well we will permit you to live long toms machine pistol clicked softly as he threw the safety renny gripping the electrical experts arm breathed lets listen to this first they could hear santini perfectly there is something on this island which is worth many millions of dollars signor savage santini continued it grows here but we do not know what it looks like when it grows we only know what it resembles after it is dried and treated this material is hidden somewhere and only old dan thunden knows of the hiding place when we visited this island the first time we learned of this thing and arranged with dan thunden to sell it to wealthy men who could afford to pay us millions for it we went to new york and made contact with a number of wealthy men the names in the file at the office of fountain of youth inc doc suggested and his powerful voice showed no strain exactly signor savage santini agreed they were very anxious to buy what we had to sell and pay a handsome price it was then that we decided to get rid of dan thunden that might have been a mistake he found out our intentions and seized a box containing our entire supply of this fabulously valuable substance the old man had very little money and he hit upon the idea of persuading a relative who had much money kel avery to finance him in selling the stuff he sent the box to kel avery and arranged a rendezvous in florida which we were fortunate enough to apprehend his mail and prevent him keeping we tried to kidnap the girl and get the box but failed and she became alarmed and decided to call on you for aid we tried to seize you before she got to you and there our troubles really started why the review doc demanded sharply santini smirked merely a foundation for telling you that we want your aid we will trade the safety of yourself and your party for your help how can i help you doc asked i know something of your ability santini said you will notice that we keep our flashlights off your eyes that is because we happen to know you are a skilled hypnotist you can hypnotize dan thunden and make him tell where this shall we call it a treasure is hidden you havent got dan thunden doc said dryly we will get him santini snapped now the man whirled with his flashlight and started for the exit so unexpected was the move that renny long tom and pat were caught unprepared santinis flashlight illuminated them holy cow renny boomed weve gotta make a fight of it his superfirer blared simultaneously he pitched into the cavern long tom trod his heels santinis gang taken by surprise reacted variously one cried out in fright mother dropped his flashlight others drew guns one fell from rennys blast of mercy bullets it was santini himself who showed the most presence of mind he sprang backward and vanished into the gloomy rear of the underground room it seemed that he had a definite destination long tom and renny were both shooting now they concentrated oil the flashlights the blinding beams of which were a menace with explosions of glass bowls from the men who held them the flashes went out more men dropped confusion grew weve got em goin renny roared and charged long tom and pat followed pat carried the submachine gun which they had taken from the man at the entrance but she did not use it knowing that it was the way of doc and his men never to take human life then something happened there was a rattling at the sides of the room the sand seemed to come alive exploding upward a net appeared a mesh woven of stout fibre it had been buried under the sand and was being pulled by ropes attached to the sides and hidden in recesses in the walls the motive force was evidently a great weight sliding in a pit for they could hear the rumble and jar of its descent renny and the other two were jerked from their feet the net mesh was large enough to pass their feet and their arms through and they hung there like fish caught by the gills the net trap was cleverly constructed it hauled them over and slammed them against one wall holding them there with an inexorable strength renny snarled and tore at the net his huge hands did manage to snap two of the strands he shot down a man who ran toward him then santinis gang was upon them santini appeared from where he had retreated to actuate the trap howling non non there is no need to kill them now clubbing guns reduced the prisoners to senselessness go see if they left a watcher at the entrance santini gritted chapter lots of luck all bad william harper littlejohn was sitting on the top step of the secret entrance when he heard men running through the caverns beneath him coming closer johnny was perspiring and pale absently fingering his monocle magnifier he was suffering from his injured chest he stood erect hastily an instant later he knew it was santinis men who approached he grasped some of the anesthetic bulbs took his time then threw them into the blackness below startled curses indicated he had downed at least one man there was a confab he could not catch the words some one tried to shoot him but had no luck johnny returned a blast from his superfirer for effect had there been only the one exit johnny might have held santini and his men prisoners below for an indefinite period but there were other openings a hundred yards distant a section of stone flew up two men popped out with sawedoff shotguns johnny did the only thing possible he got up and ran grasping dan thundens inert frame he attempted to carry the whitehaired oldyoung man along in dan thunden reposed the secret of fear cay and johnny wanted mightily to get at the bottom of that mystery santini himself put in an appearance and yelled non non do not shoot thunden johnny tightened his grip on thunden realizing that the presence of the whiteheaded man meant safety but the burden slowed his pace amazingly he staggered twice he went entirely down it dawned on johnny that he was never going to escape with his prisoner so reluctantly he dropped the form of thunden then sprinted into the jungle he reached the dense growth plams and gum trees sheltering him from a storm of lead head down johnny ran with a longlegged stride he was headed for the spot where docs plane had landed and he kept going in that direction at his back pursuit was steady but the enemy did not gain johnny was reeling and nearly out when he came upon monk and ham the apish monk was bristling eager for a fight his pet pig habeas trailing him ham had his sword cane in one hand his superfirer in the other we heard the shootin monk grunted whats goin on johnny waved a bony hand to indicate pursuit then sank down weakly on the most comfortablelooking spot an expanse of rank green plants he sat there while monk and ham dashed forward wheres kel avery and da clima he called in a feeble voice back at the plane ham called without stopping an instant later there was a bawling of machine pistols the slamming reports of repeating shotguns and the cackle of automatics lead made eerie noises in the jungle leaves were cut free and drifted with the breeze occasional cocoanuts dropped noisily frightened birds made a great uproar until they had all fled the scene of hostilities for perhaps five minutes the guerrilla warfare continued intermittently then ham and monk came creeping back through the jungle they had resumed their perpetual quarrel if youd throw that sticker away and learn to shoot wed have better luck monk growled eying hams sword cane how could i find anybody to shoot at when you charged around like an elephant and showed them where we were ham snapped nature had sure run out of brains when she got around to equipping you this was a slight exaggeration considering monks reputation as one of the greatest of living chemists they reached johnny and monk advised there was just a lot of leadthrowing and noise i dont think anybody was hit and they beat it now tell us whats happened johnny did not reply he was on all fours eyes close to the ground and he did not look up he seemed in the grip of some spell whats been going on monk asked johnny again the bony archaeologist and geologist did not lift his eyes he seemed frozen in his crouching position hey monk barked anxiously what ails you johnny lifted an arm beckoned look at this he requested and indicated one of the plants in the bed of which he had been seated monk came over and stared just a funnylookin weed he snorted johnny looked pained and pointed at the growth of plants weed he sniffed neither of you ever saw flora of that type before so what monk queried examine the confines of this area of vegetation johnny invited monk and ham complied with that request and the result was a surprising discovery the plants which had intrigued johnny grew in even rows as if cultivated somebodys garden patch monk grunted this is very strange johnny murmured not half as strange as some other things monk said for instance what is it that is making people into skeletons around here and what is santini after cmon lets go back to the plane before leaving the spot where he was seated johnny carefully plucked a few shoots of the plants which had so intrigued him and tucked the sprigs inside his hat band where they would not be crumpled by the time the men had reached the plane johnny had completed a rapid outline of what had occurred monk and ham grinned widely over the news that dan thunden had been seized but scowled darkly at word of the final outcome they stood on the white coral beach where the sand stung their faces and looked about there was no one in sight thought you said da clima and kel avery were here johnny suggested monk his expression suddenly anxious lifted his voice miss avery silence followed blazes ham muttered and nervously sheathed and unsheathed his sword cane monk called again once more there was no answer somethings happened he rapped da clima and kel avery had orders to stick right here a moment later habeas corpus began squealing and grunting off to one side the three men dived for the spot ham using his sword cane to knock aside the jungle vegetation monk and johnny with their machine pistols ready ill be superamalgamated johnny mumbled and all three stared at what habeas had found big da clima was piled slackly on his stomach in the leafage his legs crossed in a grotesque fashion one arm twisted under his chest the other flung up and over his head as if to protect it his head was askew the face up and a crimson rivulet had crawled down out of his hair trickled on down his face and over neck to redden his shirt collar look for kel ham barked and sank down to see how badly da clima was hurt monk dashed about johnny tottered both waved their rapidfirer pistols anxious to find a target and both had ragetensed faces but neither found a sign of the enemy when they went back ham looked up from his task of kneading da climas wrists got their disgusted head shakes then said hes coming out of it theres hardly any bump at all on his head da clima sat up at last his manner was remindful of the first time they had seen him back at the new york airport he blinked swayed his read from side to side and looked stupid wheres kel avery ham snapped da clima how he know the overmuscled man mumbled what happened to you da clima lid not seem quite positive on the subject for you feller i stand around and listen yes he said vaguely then all of a sudden the top of my head she go bane like the firecracker on the fourth of july then what how do i know da clima scowled the world she kind of stop for to go around then somebody sneaked up behind and kissed your bean with a gun barrel or something eh monk growled maybe da clima admitted i no see the soul not a soul the big man stood up glared at his knees which seemed inclined to buckle then hammered himself upon the chest weakly at first and erratically almost missing with his own fist then more accurately and soundly so that his great torso gave off hollow boomings show me the damn feller who is do this to da clima he roared i tear from him the arm and leg yes you sure do talk big boy monk growled but in action you aint been so hot da clima glowered what you mean by that the insult no ham put in placatingly dont mind the missing link da clima he fell out of the nest when he was little da clima laughed harshly and frowned at monk i might have known this feller he born in a nest in the tree like the monkey johnny snapped stop it this is no time for personalities what are we going to do take the plane and try to spot santinis men ham suggested maybe we can locate them before they get kel avery to their headquarters they ran for the plane clambered into the cabin and monk took the control bucket he threw starter switches nothing happened they clambered out and investigated santinis men took the carburetors off the motors ham groaned they unloaded held a brief conference and it was decided to head for the rocky area afoot just what they would do when they reached the scene of the underground caverns they were not sure but each man made a pack of equipment which he thought might be necessary johnny described the location of the expanse of stone and they concluded the place could be reached more quickly by taking the slightly circuitous route around the beach they could travel more swiftly especially johnny who was not equal to much more jungle boy youre gonna suffer for that crack about me fallin out of the nest monk promised ham in an undertone as they trotted along the white coral sand ham started some caustic retort held it back and pointed what is that all four men followed his indicating arm bits of timber aged and weatherbeaten projected above the sand close to the jungle an old wreck monk snorted and would have gone on wait johnny said sharply the skeletonthin geologist and archaeologist went forward eyed such of the timbers as were above the sand then kicked about uncovering others it was the frame of a ship not a large vessel the wood had once been carved in elaborate fashion whatre we killin time here for monk demanded impatiently johnny eyed him did you ever see a roman galley blazes no monk growled im not two thousand years old this johnny indicated the wreckage dramatically was once a roman galley i am sure of it the emphasis which the gaunt scientist put on the declaration was enough to impress the others they knew from past experience that johnny was not addicted to excitement without just cause a roman galley monk said slowly but how did it get here on this side of the atlantic drifted perhaps nix ocean currents are wrong for that then possibly it had sails which were set and the wind blew it acrosssaid johnny the thing is not impossible it could have happened this island is on the outskirts of the caribbean and a craft blown across the atlantic might conceivably have landed here or been wrecked as this one was undoubtedly monk nodded i still dont see why all the excitement johnny touched his hat band where the sprigs of weed reposed i have an astounding theory he said but we will go into it later yes said ham weve got kel avery and the rest to worry about now soon they turned into the jungle they went as quietly as possible but banana birds and noisy parakeets were stirred up while gulls and frigate birds sailed inquiringly overhead gonna be hard to get close without bein heard monk opined the expanse of smooth stone opened before their eyes the sun was nearing the horizon but still hot and the rock was like so much molten substance poured out still white with its own heat crouched behind a gnarled silkcotton tree at the edge of the stony area they used their eyes and small pocket telescopes but discerned no sign of life more important there was no trace of the secret entrances the flinty surface looked one solid mass can you find any of the trapdoors ham asked johnny johnny grimaced doubtfully i dont know i shall try they advanced weapons ready pausing frequently to sink down and jam ears to the hot stone to listen for sounds from below the heat waves danced and all but scorched their skins they were already red with sunburn their northern tan being little protection against this tropical inferno but they heard nothing suddenly da clima off to one side dropped to all fours and pawed at a crack me i find the hole he gulped da clima wrenched pounded with the heel of a hand and so suddenly that they all sprang backward a lid of stone flew up exposing a dark gullet that led downward monk extended a hand shake he smiled da clima glared at the hairy paw what for ill take it all back monk informed him you have finally performed a useful service ahrrr growled da clima and scrambled down into the black cavity which he had uncovered the others unlimbered flashlights which they had brought from the plane and followed the overmuscled da clima roughly hewn rock enclosed them so closely that monks massive shoulders rubbed and at times he had difficulty in passing da climas bulk was only slightly less the way widened for a time then narrowed again they passed a side tunnel a stout hardwood log which they tested carefully bridged a crack that cleft beneath them monk dropped a tiny pebble counted almost to twenty before it hit water nice place this monk whispered pipe down ham suggested monk picked up habeas who was following them and carried the bigeared pig tucked under an arm habeas was making no sound now not for nothing had monk spent innumerable hours in training the shoat da clima first into the depths was still in the lead and as they came to a point where it was necessary to get down on all fours and crawl he went ahead ugh da clima exploded unexpectedly the next instant his gun emitted a blast that all but ruptured their eardrums then the muscular giant scuttled forward reached a sizable chamber and reared erect he plunged on a man he see me he howled that guy santini i think it was i men shouted ahead they caught santinis foreign accent a gun lashed red flame they fired back their shots were not answered gonna be tough from now on monk growled they stood there in darkness their flashlights extinguished i said ham have an idea the dapper lawyer could be heard fumbling at the pack which held the stuff they had brought from the plane what is this idea monk whispered well use the lightspot cartridges on those birds ham said grimly that should give them something to think about boy you are bright monk admitted and dug into his own pack lightspot cartridges was the designation given by doc savages men to a special shell which the bronze man had designed for the superfirer doc had created many unusual bullet types for the remarkable guns from tracers and mercy slugs to explosives of such power that a single one could knock down a small house the lightspot pellets were among the most unique they were charged with a mixture of thermite and magnesium the exact ingredients known only to the bronze man and burned with a brilliant white light wherever they struck certain of the amino drums were charged alternately with five lightspot slugs and five mercy bullets an effective combination the new drums were fitted and the guns latched into singlefire position lets go monk growled they charged forward one of santinis men fired at them let em have the spots monk rapped a volley of metallic clicks followed utter silence ensued blazes groaned monk somethings wrong ham grated these ammo drums are duds monk snarled unintelligibly i know when those birds got to the plane they doctored the bullets he got no further santini must have heard their voices rush them he howled feet slammed a gun glared red lightning monk thumbed on his flashlight then tossed it to the floor where it would furnish illumination for the fight the next instant santinis men were upon them there was no shooting now the santini gang seemed confident they swung clubbed guns fists kicked and clawed a dozen seconds of desperate conflict told monk and the others that they were outnumbered they tried to retreat da clima got the retreat idea first he popped into the cramped tunnel through which they had just crawled in some fashion he seemed to stick there he began to bawl in terror monk pinched da clima shoved him but the big fellow did not budge although monks pinches must have been very painful danged if this mess of meat aint a jinx monk roared and gave da clima another terrific pinch three santini followers sprang upon monk and three guns bludgeoned together for his head for monk it seemed as if all of the lights went out suddenly and his surroundings became very still chapter the weeds monks eyes opened a little rolled until they were all whites then slowly assumed normalcy and he looked at doc savage the bronze man was some ten feet distant tied around and around mummy fashion with turns of fibre rope his head and his hands alone projected from his tyings and cloth had been lashed over his hands so that he could not use his fingers monk tried to move groaned blast it im paralyzed then realized he was tied in much the same fashion as doc they dont take many chances do they he mumbled are you all right doc asked his skull is thick hams voice said from somewhere squinting about monk saw that ham lay near by bound like himself johnny long tom and renny formed a row along the sandy floor da clima scowled at monk and strained against his ropes he lay just at the edge of the area lighted by an electric lantern pat savage and kel avery were opposite both tied and whitebearded dan thunden was between them thunden seemed to be slumbering yet from the effects of the anesthetic gas they were in a ragged stone chamber santini and his men stood about looking elated it is the big reunion eh signors santini inquired in your hat monk grunted santini laughed jubilantly came over and stood playfully on monks chest bouncing up and down a little monk rolled abruptly throwing santini and santini regaining his feet kicked monk in the side with great violence swearing the while in his native tongue monk showed his teeth and grunted loudly at each impact like an animal in distress this is the joyful occasion for me said santini then he went to renny and began to kick and abuse him as he had monk he treated long tom in like fashion and was standing on da climas massive torso when dan thunden rolled over and groaned dropping his diversion santini sprang forward and pointed at the whitebearded oldyoung man this is what i wait for he snapped take him somewhere and make him answer our questions two men picked up dan thunden head and heels do not go near that door with the secret lock santini warned apparently as an afterthought we do not want our friends here to turn into skeletons not yet signors the two who carried dan thunden started out with their burden but before they had gone far doc savage spoke his words were in the guttural not unmusical tongue of ancient maya the language which only the bronze man and his five aides spoke and understood excepting those in the lost central american valley to whom the language was native talk to me in this language doc directed in mayan make them think were cooking up something santini glared as he heard the unintelligible words then snarled non noi speak so that i understand go chase yourself monk advised him in mayan say doc whats the idea of this jabbering itll only start him kicking our ribs again i want them to separate us doc said in mayan if i can get by myself i have a scheme to try monk asked in mayan what is it he never got his answer santini sputtering his rage took the bait take this bronze man to another room he ordered two of you watch him shoot him at the least suspicion doc was promptly hauled out monk muttered in mayan i dont see what doc can do theyve searched him and hes tied up like nobodys business losing faith in doc ham asked sourly monk sighed and lay back brother hes the only hope weve got doc savage was carried into a circular recess in the stone a place from which there was only one egress and deposited on the sandy floor the two who had carried him straightened up puffing perspiration like a shiny grease on their foreheads the guy weighs a ton one captor grunted pipe down the other muttered and planted an electric hand lantern so that its beam bore upon the bronze man thats the idea said the first weve gotta watch im but doc savage did not want them scrutinizing him too closely and he discouraged their attention by the simple expedient of staring at them intently lids widened so that the full power of his flakegold eyes had effect cut it out snarled one of the two captors doc seemed not to hear and a moment later the hand lanterns were shifted so that the bronze man did not lie in direct brilliance nor yet in complete gloom but in a half light where he could not move appreciably without being observed the guy can hypnotize a feller with them eyes the more burly of the pair mumbled thats what santini said anyhow i aint takin no chances myself there was no apparent possibility of doc savage gaining his freedom so securely was he bound the bronze mans five aides knew something of his remarkable ability had seen him accomplish the seeming impossible in the past and even they had been skeptical about his chances mixed with the skepticism had been hope though for doc had a way of making the incredible seem simple santinis men had wrenched the heels off docs shoes to make sure no gadget was hidden there the nails which had held the heels projected the shoes were fitted with modern zipper fasteners instead of timehonored laces moving an imperceptible bit at a time doc hooked a heel nail in one zipper ring and stripped it down he did the same with the other shoe from somewhere down the passage that led from the room santinis voice ordered come here you two you mean us called a guard si si you snapped santinis voice but were watching canes snarled the voice dogs he will not escape in the minute i need you the two watchmen walked out of the stone cubicle doc savage kicked off his shoes his great frame seemed to turn to rubber for be doubled backward in the fashion of a skilled contortionist and his toes found the knots that secured his rope bindings there were no feet in his socks merely spatlike straps under the instep leaving his toes uncovered the bronze mans toes took on the prehensile deftness of fingers in fractional seconds the knots were untied he twisted about working with fabulous speed but making little noise he came to his feet down the stone passage the two guards were peering about in puzzled fashion for they had not found santini at the point from which the mans voice had apparently come boss one growled where the deuce did you go there sounded two dull thumps both men dropped senseless neither was ever exactly sure what had happened for they did not see or hear the metallic nemesis who loomed abruptly behind them and struck with both fists simultaneously nor did either guard realize at the moment that they were the victims of a skill at voice mimicry and ventriloquism santini had not called doc had done that doc went forward and looked into the room which held his five aides along with pat kel avery and da clima a number of santinis men were there alert and watchful an attempt to free the captives was sure to mean a fight noise an alarm from a nearby cavern emanated gruff words interspersed with angry explosives that would be santini questioning old dan thunden doc made for the sounds in addition to santini four men were with thunden four ropes had been tied to the whitehaired mans wrists and ankles and a man held the end of each rope pulling backward with all of his strength thundens finger tips were gory horrors santini held a pair of small pliers even as doc sighted the group the pincers were employed to yank another nail off one of thundens fingers thunden moaned writhed crimson crawled from lips into which he sank his own teeth that is all of the finger nails signor thunden santini said callously it seems that we will have to pull out an eye next i will do it slowly so that you can see with the other eye the knife as it cuts the muscles to free the orb from your head the recitation of grim details seemed to accomplish what the previous torture had not done what do you want to know he groaned i suppose you have no idea santini sneered doc advanced a little to be in a position to better catch the words his feet still bare contacted something he stooped and felt with sensitive fingers it was the packs which his aides monk ham johnny and da clima had brought from the plane the knapsacks made a little mound doc stepped around them and went on a few feet then stopped dan thunden said the stoahroom suh is just inside the wooden doah santini swore you mean that we have to take a chance with those with those with my little friends yes dan thunden growled and i do hope you have an accident how do we get in there santini demanded can you walk on stilts non i dont give a hoot how you get in dan thunden snapped i have told you wheah the stoahroom is just how is it opened santini asked theah is a black ledge in the rock said the whitehaired man you jam youah weight against that doc savage waited to hear no more but glided backward he paused to run deft fingers over the packs lying on the floor and thus managed to locate the one which monk had found monks pack was distinctive because it held a thing without which monk seldom ventured into action the apish chemists amazing portable laboratory which contained chemicals and apparatus for almost every purpose all nested in a marvelously compact space with monks pack doc raced along the passages the bronze man reached the massive wooden door with out incident he listened an ear against it there was no trace of the sound that was like fat frying his fingers found the secret catch and the timbered panel swung back grating softly docs movements in the passage beyond were silent monks pack held a spare flashlight and he used this the black ledge which dan thunden had mentioned was easily distingu ished doc started to plant weight against the dark stone then hesitated he drew back and searched for something with which to exert force without getting too near he was thinking of those many traps which old dan thunden had rigged in this strange subterranean place footsteps sounded beyond the door they were rapid running doc drifted silently into a patch of gloom a flashlight swayed close leaking appeared dripping perspiration his upper lip held between his teeth there was a desperate expression on his unlovely face a quivering eagerness in his plump hulk leakings look showed doc exactly what was up leaking had heard dan thundens words and was bound to inspect the storeroom ahead of santini such action could only mean treachery leaking must intend to doublecross his boss the flashlight which the perspiring man carried picked up the black tedge leakings time was evidently short for he threw his weight against the black ledge nothing happened the man stood back in his excitement he had failed to attach significance to finding the heavy wooden door open once more he plunged against the strip of dark stone mechanism grated steel flashed there was a hollow glug leaking reeled swayed he seemed to come apart in the middle and fall in a flood of scarlet the upper part of his torso fell forward and blocked the slender panel of stone which had opened doc advanced swiftly not looking at leakings body and examined the unholy mechanism inside the door it was of hardwood cleverly made actuated by a lever on which a heavy weight bore attached to the device was a great razorsharp cleaver roughly fashioned from some iron part of a sailing ship this was rigged so as to slash outward when pressure was placed upon the black stone it was this cleaver which had chopped leaking in two halves doc savage still carried monks pack he opened it using his flashlight the bronze man knew where every phial of chemical reposed he drew out bottles then walked into the storeroom eyes alert for other grisly traps the storeroom was not large and the walls were inset with crude shelves on these reposed jars of baked earthenware doc opened the handiest dipped in fingers and brought up some of the contents the bronze man did not seem surprised at what he saw leaves a bilious green in color dried and carefully packed the sprigs did not have the color and shape of tea nor yet of sage a botanist would have been intrigued by the leaves for they were of a type difficult to catalogue but doc savage who was ordinarily interested by anything new and strange gave them little attention he let them fall back and opened several more of the most convenient containers over the leaves in each jar he sprinkled a bit of the chemical which he had taken from monks portable laboratory his departure was as ghostly as his coming and executed none too soon for steps could be heard as a number of men came near they appeared santini and some of his followers they did not glimpse doc for he had concealed himself where they would walk past leaving him behind them at sight of the open door santini snarled profanely and sprang forward he discovered leakings decapitated form che he gulped what what is this then he burst into a roar of ugly mirth which bent him over and caused him to slap his beribboned chest to regain his breath leaking is try to pull the crooked deal on us si he chortled and old dan thunden is try the same thing leaking is fall into thundens trap come hello how beautiful they advanced into the storeroom and clutched up the handiest jars which were those that doc savage had opened and sprinkled with chemical at last we have the material santini murmured and waved an arm to take in the other jars there is enough of it here to make us all rich men a man eyed santini eagerly boss si youre going to keep your promise aint you asked the man you said back on long island that night that we would all be given the weed when we found the storeroom santini hesitated then nodded it is true later you can all the men were brighteyed with eagerness there was a near madness in their manner a strange spell woven by sight of the unusual weed in the jars now muttered the spokesman lets sample the stuff its supposed to make a guy feel better right off aint it santini nodded it is whats the word do we sample it now or not it must be mixed with water said santini we will try it at once all of us thats the idea the speaker was almost blubbering his joy and the others were like him excited to the point of incoherence the real fountain of youth one gulped you said it agreed another the stuff that makes you live forever chapter the fountain of youth santini and his men appeared shortly afterward at the long cavern which held the prisoners carrying the jars of the weed the captives stared at them and seemed puzzled with one exception johnny the bony geologist and archaeologist who also knew a great deal about botany was the only one of the prisoners who looked as if he had an inkling of what it was all about but he said nothing for the moment we have found it santini shouted bienc we shall all live forever my men and we will sell enough of the stuff to make us all millionaires santini retired to a nearby room which had it seemed been dan thundens living quarters in the past and where could be found utensils for mixing the strange leaves as well as a spring of fresh water in the excitement of the moment the guards forgot their charges there was little chance of the captives escaping unaided however laughing excited the men crowded to the point where the mixing was in progress and the room where renny and the others lay was left unwatched i dont get this atall monk muttered did you hear what they said the crazy dopes seem to think theyve found something that will give them everlasting life ham made a sudden tongue click of surprise i get it now fountain of youth inc remember the fountain of youth that history says ponce de leon hunted for it was supposed to be somewhere in florida youve gone as crazy as they have monk snapped the fountain of youth could be on this cay ham insisted maybe long ago the reef was passable and canoes came here the fountain of youth might not be a fountain at all but that funnylooking weed santini had maybe that plant does bring everlasting life nuts said monk i wont swallow such scatterbrained ideas not much stay stupid then ham retorted or have you a better explanation johnny had been holding his tongue with an apparent effort and now he spoke ham is eminently correct he said monk managed to roll over where he could eye johnny yeah remember the wreckage which we found that bore a pronounced resemblance to structural segments from an ancient roman galley johnny queried has that got something to do with this monk asked it has emphatically said the bigworded geologist that wrecked galley was the clue that made me think of a legend from history which explains the presence of this weed that brings everlasting life supposedly monk sniffed i still maintain thats hooey there isnt no ever hear of cirene johnny interrupted cirene cirene johnny spelled it out monk assumed a pained expression his habitual look when thinking was that a city that grew up about the time of old egypt and carthage right johnny nodded vehemently cirene stood on a plateau and its source of wealth was a fabulous medicinal herb known as silphium even the coins of cirene bore a design of the ruler watching his subjects weigh this remarkable plant legend gives this herb great powers claiming it cured every ailment wounds even disease from all over the ancient world ships came for this herb and it became extremely highpriced the romans came and put a tax on silphium an enormous tax the people of cirene were enraged and hating the romans tremendously they set about destroying the herb to rib themselves of the high taxes in time silphium became extinct men have searched for some sprigs of it even a single plant since that age only a year or two ago there was a newspaper story about an italian doctor who thought he had discovered silphium again in cirenaica i dont believe it monk grunted its in the history books dammit rapped johnny now it is foolish to think the people of ancient cirene would destroy a plant so valuable perhaps they loaded some on a galley and sent it out for an island or another part of the coast and the galley got lost and eventually wound up here on fear cay in his vehemence johnny had departed from his big words and his recitation was the more emphatic the others were silent after he finished two of santini men came in without a word they picked up big da clima and carried him out renny shuddered rumbled theyve started their killing poor da clima pat said sorrowfully a voice of quiet power came from the murk near by do not worry too much about da clima it said doc renny breathed the bronze man appeared admonishing silence and began untying them i was waiting for them to take da clima away he advised monk grunted you figured theyd take him why he is one of them monks jaw fell down on his barrel of a chest da clima is working with santini he is how long have you known that doc the homely chemist breathed wonderingly since santini was tipped so mysteriously that the air mail package was coming to my office in new york doc said only da clima had an opportunity to pass that information along kel avery still looking very much the motion picture actress in spite of all that she had been through overheard docs information and seemed deeply shocked when da clima came to me in florida and offered his services as a bodyguard santini had sent him she gasped doc nodded he had renny johnny and monk free of their bonds he went to work on pats ropes their situation was dangerous at any instant some of santinis men might return doc was i right about that silphium from cirene theory johnny questioned you were doc replied i saw the weed and it is unquestionably the highly medicinal species of silphium johnny glanced triumphantly at the doubter monk but monk appeared not to have heard being engaged in making fierce faces and rubbing his huge arms to unlimber muscles waitll i get that egg da clima he gritted i knew he was a phony all along he was responsible for us bein caught pretended to get himself wedged in a hole and blocked our retreat all were on their feet now doc opened a knapsack and passed out the superfirers which had been taken from his men and which he had found in the course of his prowling through the stone labyrinth receiving the guns reminded monk of something else some of our ammo drums were duds he growled ill bet da clima was responsible for that they grouped closely and started an advance they were they knew from words they had previously overheard their captors drop in a dead end of the caverns to escape it would be necessary to pass santini and his men either by violence or by stealth theres just one thing that aint cleared up monk said softly whats turnin men into skeletons on this island quiet doc breathed that will have to wait so you know what it is i saw the things after a fashion doc replied and did not elaborate that his glimpse had been by use of the powder which glowed under ultraviolet light misfortune walked with them it developed for santini and three of his men appeared laughing swabbing at their lips evidence that they had quaffed of the silphium brew santini emitted a startled bawl his hands clawing for his inlaid gun tore the bright ribbon loose from his chest he shot as he leaped backward his bullet fired hastily hit no one those with him sought cover one lifting a submachine gun storming lead from the rapidlirer drove doc and the others to cover they crouched behind stone bulwarks and it could not but dawn on them that their position was as dangerous as at any time hitherto blazes monk mumbled got any of those anaesthetic bulbs doc i could not find them the bronze man advised santini did not put them with the rest of our weapons santini began yelling again fate presto make haste bring me the bundle containing those glass balls which we took from these porcos hey boss you can hold your breath until the gas loses its punch said a member of the gang da clima here says to do so we will throw them one at the time snapped santini thus we will keep the cloud of gas fresh they cannot bold their breath forever that she is the big idea of mine yes da climas big voice chimed in da clima got the good head no tense uneasiness gripped docs party as they heard the words for they knew that their enemies had hit on a most effective way of capturing them that damn da clima hatched that one monk grated if i could have one wish before i kick off itd be to get that bird in my hands for once i can agree with you ham growled renny boomed doc im in favor of rushing em lets go out with fireworks wait doc advised blazes do you think theres another way out no we wont even waste time hunting for one then just wait doc advised lets see what happens during the next few moments it seemed that the future held nothing but trouble santini and his men fired occasionally to prevent a charge they were only waiting for the thinwalled glass balls which contained docs unusual anesthetic gas then santini in a strained uneasy voice said do you feel queer signors a man cursed another groaned that damned weed some one began and did not finish but fell to coughing and gagging these sounds of agony decreased in strength terminating in a thump which might have been a man falling doc and his party waited pat stood near enough to doc that the bronze man could hear her even breathing somewhere in the distant reaches of the cavern there was a piping forlorn squeal habeas said monk im glad hes all right come said doc and stepped out boldly monk clutched anxiously for the bronze giant thinking he was taking unnecessary chances in thrusting himself into the zone of fire but nothing happened gingerly half expectant of a bullet monk followed docs example they were not fired upon although they stood boldly outlined in the glare from the flashlights of santinis gang holy cow renny rumbled and leaped forward they found santini sprawled upon the stone floor limp but still breathing and the other members of the gang were near by all immobile on the sandy floor not one of the crew was conscious ive seen lots of unexpected things happen monk muttered wonderingly but this one comes nearer to magic than the rest how do you explain it the silphium tea that they drank doc told him huh is the stuff poison not that i know of doc elaborated you see monk i put some powerful narcotic from your chemical laboratory into the handiest containers of the siphium you drugged em monk exploded indirectly doc agreed yes kel avery emitted a sudden piercing shriek they whirled upon her startled she threw back her head and began to laugh wildly madly while tears ran from her eyes she trembled and beat her hands together shes hysterical now that its all over monk mumbled and went over to quiet the young actress as best he could lets get out of here suggested ham in single file the most convenient way of traversing the tortuous passages of the underground network they worked forward weve still got to find the parts they took off our plane long tom reminded sure renny agreed but even if we dont find them we can repair the fuel tanks in santinis plane and shift the gas from our ship reckon old dan thunden punctured santinis tanks monk stopped suddenly dan thunden what became of him i forgot all about the old goat the answer to monks query came from no member of the party but from the stone of fear cay itself the entire cay seemed to jump violently there was a roar that left their heads aching a torrent of air sand and small stone gushed upon them bowling long toni and johnny off their feet that came from one of the entrances doc rapped they ran forward but did not go far before a whoop of hateful laughter yanked them up the sound came from a passage to the left and it was dan thundens oldyoung voice ive got santinis grenades the strange character shrilled you just heard me close one entrance and ill get the othahs when i open the place up again theah wont be nothin of you but bones chapter the crawling terror it was difficult to locate the enraged voice in the hollowlyresounding passages doc led the rush for the spot from which it seemed to emanate he was tied up the last i saw of him the bronze man offered quietly he must have gotten loose he is tremendously strong a living example of how effective this fountain of youth is ham agreed dan thunden evidently had a gun for it roared in the cavern monk grunted loudly and fell down but heaved up again grimly silent are you hurt badly doc demanded my leg said monk i can still navigate dan thunden became terrified at their advance and fled knowing every cranny of the caverns as he did he traveled so swiftly that they barely managed to keep within earshot of his footsteps wheres he headin for renny pondered aloud theres a heavy wooden door which shuts off a part of the cavern doc explained he seems to be making for that whats behind the door the things which made that skeleton we found on the beach and turned hallet into one like it doc replied they found the bones of unfortunate hallet shortly afterward they were scattered for some of santinis gang had evidently given them a kick in passing johnny was weak and being helped along by renny pat kept close to docs side along with kel avery whose hysteria had subsided magically at the return of danger that old man is dangerous pat warned if we dont head him off hell entomb us in here and turn his pets or whatever is behind that door loose on us they soon caught sight of dan thunden he had opened the massive door with the secret fastener and was just passing through his form towered fully eight feet off the floor hes on stilts long tom barked what dyou think of that i think hes thinking fast doc said grimly and we havent much time get that door shut let him go if necessary but thunden had other plans for the door he spun facing the glare of their flashlights and thrust a hand into a coat pocket bringing out a small object of metal he threw it a hand grenade the thing arched toward them but not far docs hands as usual were empty of guns the only thing he held was a flashlight he threw that flashlight and grenade met in the air a little nearer them than dan thunden and almost in the big door there was a white flash a roar and the inevitable rush of air johnny and renny both upset as did pat and kel avery doc himself was staggered the door split and the massive timbers made a great noise falling to the floor dan thunden on his tall stilts was overbalanced he toppled tried to balance himself against one stone wall and in doing so bore his entire weight on one stilt the stilt snapped off the old man fell squarely on his whitethatched head a weird thing happened to the floor about him seemingly it came to life and began to undulate and crowd toward where thunden lay in fractional seconds the rustylooking floor spread over the prone form covering it until thundens body resembled only a rugged hump of reddishblack sand there was a great frying noise too late to help him doc rapped lets get out of here they ran back the way they had been coming fleeing from the horror on the cavern floor not until they had gone scores of yards did they discover that the concussion of the exploding grenades had in spots jarred great rock fragments from the ceiling farther on the way was entirely blocked blazes monk muttered resting his injured leg how are we gonna get to santinis outfit they were not to get to santini it developed for they could not find an opening large enough to crawl through and behind them grew the sound that was like the gentle popping of hot grease into which an egg had been broken they gave up the effort to reach santini found an exit and climbed out into the sunlight johnny was the last to leave the cavern he sat on the lip of the hole through which the others had scrambled squinting his eyes in the hot evening sunlight listening to the frying sound below what was that thing we saw kel avery asked thickly you mean the things that got your great yes the things that covered my greatgrandfather dali thunden said the actress carnivorous jormicoidea johnny told her monk glared at him and snapped i aint in a good humor use little words for once will you ants said johnny flesheating ants isnt that right doc the bronze man nodded they used one part of the cavern for their colony that is undoubtedly why dan thunden shut it off with that door monk leaned back and sighed so it was that simple and i had visioned a new menace that was threatening mankind the voracious ants literally millions of them were not a menace to be taken lightly they discovered in the days following it was necessary to be always on guard against the carnivorous insects for they traveled in armies and their bites induced a poison if suffered in sufficient number that would render a victim helpless woe to the man whom the insects came upon when asleep the ants were not doc explained repeatedly of a species new to science their stay at the island was to dig out the entombed santini and his men but they found only bones there had been cracks large enough to admit the voracious ants the store of siphium was intact and doc searching located growing plants on the cay these were carefully dug up packed and made ready for transportation to the united states monk tried out some of the silphium tea on his wounded leg and the results were remarkable the puncture began to heal almost at once boy weve got something monk insisted weve cornered the fountain of youth doc did not disillusion him at that moment the bronze man suspected that old dan thundens longevity was due to perfect health that of course the result of drinking silphium tea and the fact that thunden an exile on the isand had been kept away from the distractions and dissipations of civilization which might undermine health that the silphium was only a valuable medicinal herb proved correct for it was an amazingly efficient antiseptic and tonic a disease preventative but they did not learn that until months later after a number of scientists and doctors had made careful experiments doc and his party got their plane ready to leave fear cay they had found the missing motor parts i just thought of one thing that aint been cleared up yet monk said in sudden excitement as they were loading up what doc questioned the package of silphium that kel avery sent by air mail from florida explained monk that is in new york doc told him huh remember when i talked to the air mail officials doc countered sure but nobody heard you except the mail people i told them to open the package take out the real contents and substitute something which looked similar doc said they did pat looked at the bronze man and asked do you ever overlook anything the end
