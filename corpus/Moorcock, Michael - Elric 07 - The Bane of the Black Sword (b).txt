the bane of the black sword the fifth volume of the saga of elric of melnibone by michael moorcock book one the stealer of souls in which elric once again makes the ac quaintance of queen yishana of jharkor and theleb kaarna of pan tang and re ceives satisfaction at last one in a city called bakshaan which was rich enough to make all other cities of the north east seem poor in a talltowered tavern one night elric lord of the smoking ruins of melnibone smiled like a shark and dryly jested with four powerful merchant princes whom in a day or so he intended to pauperize moonglum the outlander elrics companion viewed the tall albino with admiration and concern for elric to laugh and joke was rarebut that he should share his good humour with men of the merchant stamp that was unprecedented moonglum congratulated himself that he was elrics friend and wondered upon the outcome of the meeting elric had as usual elaborated little of his plan to moonglum we need your particular qualities as swordsman and sorcerer lord elric and will of course pay well for them pilarmo overdressed intense and scrawny was main spokesman for the four and how shall you pay gentlemen inquired elric politely still smiling pilarmos colleagues raised their eyebrows and even their spokesman was slightly taken aback he waved his hand through the smoky air of the tavernroom which was occupied only by the six men in goldin gems answered pilarmo in chains said elric we free travellers need no chains of that sort moonglum bent forward out of the shadows where he sat his expression showing that he strongly disapproved of elrics statement pilarmo and the other merchants were plainly aston ished too then how shall we pay you i will decide that later elric smiled but why talk of such things until the timewhat do you wish me to do pilarmo coughed and exchanged glances with his peers they nodded pilarmo dropped his tone and spoke slowly you are aware that trade is highly competitive in this city lord elric many merchants vie with one an other to secure the custom of the people bakshaan is a rich city and its populace is comfortably off in the main this is well known elric agreed he was privately likening the welltodo citizens of bakshaan to sheep and himself to the wolf who would rob the fold because of these thoughts his scarlet eyes were full of a humour which moonglum knew to be malevolent and ironic there is one merchant in this city who controls more warehouses and shops than any other pilarmo contin ued because of the size and strength of his caravans he can afford to import greater quantities of goods into bakshaan and thus sell them for lower prices he is vir tually a thiefhe will ruin us with his unfair methods pilarmo was genuinely hurt and aggrieved you refer to nikorn of ilmar moonglum spoke from behind elric pilarmo nodded mutely elric frowned this man heads his own caravans braves the dangers of the desert forest and mountain he has earned his position that is hardly the point snapped fat tormiel be ringed and powdered his flesh aquiver no of course not smoothtongued kelos patted his colleagues arm consolingly but we all admire bravery i hope his friends nodded silent deinstaf the last of the four also coughed and wagged his hairy head he put his unhealthy fingers on the jewelled hilt of an or nate but virtually useless poignard and squared his shoulders but kelos went on glancing at deinstaf with approval nikorn takes no risks selling his goods cheaplyhes killing us with his low prices nikorn is a thorn in our flesh pilarmo elaborated unnecessarily and you gentlemen require myself and my compan ion to remove this thorn elric stated in a nutshell yes pilarmo was sweating he seemed more than a trifle wary of the smiling albino legends referring to elric and his dreadful doomfilled exploits were many and elaborately detailed it was only because of their desperation that they had sought his help in this matter they needed one who could deal in the nigro mantic arts as well as wield a useful blade elrics arrival in bakshaan was potential salvation for them we wish to destroy nikorns power pilarmo contin ued and if this means destroying nikorn then he shrugged and halfsmiled watching elrics face common assassins are easily employed particularly in bakshaan elric pointed out softly uhtrue pilarmo agreed but nikorn employs a sorcererand a private army the sorcerer protects him and his palace by means of magic and a guard of desertmen serve to ensure that if magic fails then natural methods can be used for the purpose assassins have attempted to eliminate the trader but unfortu nately they were not lucky elric laughed how disappointing my friends still assassins are the most dispensable members of the com munityare they not and their souls probably went to placate some demon who would otherwise have plagued more honest folk the merchants laughed halfheartedly and at this moonglum grinned enjoying himself from his seat in the shadows elric poured wine for the other five it was of a vin tage which the law in bakshaan forbade the populace from drinking too much drove the imbiber mad yet elric had already quaffed great quantities and showed no ill effects he raised a cup of the yellow wine to his lips and drained it breathing deeply and with satisfac tion as the stuff entered his system the others sipped theirs cautiously the merchants were already regretting their haste in contacting the albino they had a feeling that not only were the legends truebut they did not do justice to the strangeeyed man they wished to employ elric poured more yellow wine into his goblet and his hand trembled slightly and his dry tongue moved over his lips quickly his breathing increased as he allowed the beverage to trickle down his throat he had taken more than enough to make other men into mewling idi ots but those few signs were the only indication that the wine had any effect upon him at all this was a wine for those who wished to dream of dif ferent and less tangible worlds elric drank it in the hope that he would for a night or so cease to dream now he asked and who is this mighty sorcerer mas ter pilarmo his name is theleb kaarna pilarmo answered ner vously elrics scarlet eyes narrowed the sorcerer of pan tang ayehe comes from that island elric put his cup down upon the table and rose fingering his blade of black iron the runesword stormbringer he said with conviction i will help you gentlemen he had made up his mind not to rob them after all a new and more important plan was forming in his brain theleb kaarna he thought so you have made bakshaan your bolthole eh theleb kaarna tittered it was an obscene sound coming as it did from the throat of a sorcerer of no mean skill it did not fit with his sombre blackbearded countenance his tall scarletrobed frame it was not a sound suited to one of his extreme wisdom theleb kaarna tittered and stared with dreamy eyes at the woman who lolled on the couch beside him he whispered clumsy words of endearment into her ear and she smiled indulgently stroking his long black hair as she would stroke the coat of a dog youre a fool for all your learning theleb kaarna she murmured her hooded eyes staring be yond him at the bright green and orange tapestries which decorated the stone walls of her bedchamber she reflected lazily that a woman could not but help take ad vantage of any man who put himself so into her power yishana you are a bitch theleb kaarna breathed foolishly and all the learning in the world cannot com bat love i love you he spoke simply directly not un derstanding the woman who lay beside him he had seen into the black bowels of hell and had returned sane he knew secrets which would turn any ordinary mans mind into quivering jumbled jelly but in certain arts he was as unversed as his youngest acolyte the art of love was one of those i love you he repeated and wondered why she ignored him yishana queen of jharkor pushed the sorcerer away from her and rose abruptly swinging bare wellformed legs off the divan she was a handsome woman with hair as black as her soul though her youth was fading she had a strange quality about her which both repelled and attracted men she wore her multicoloured silks well and they swirled about her as with light grace she strode to the barred window of the chamber and stared out into the dark and turbulent night the sorcerer watched her through narrow puzzled eyes disappointed at this halt to their lovemaking whats wrong the queen continued to stare out at the night great banks of black cloud moved like predatory monsters swiftly across the windtorn sky the night was raucous and angry about bakshaan full of ominous portent theleb kaarna repeated his question and again re ceived no answer he stood up angrily then and joined her at the window let us leave now yishana before it is too late if el ric learns of our presence in bakshaan we shall both suffer she did not reply but her breasts heaved beneath the flimsy fabric and her mouth tightened the sorcerer growled gripping her arm forget your renegade freebooter elricyou have me now and i can do much more for you than any swordswinging medi cineman from a broken and senile empire yishana laughed unpleasantly and turned on her lover you are a fool theleb kaarna and youre much less of a man than elric three aching years have passed since he deserted me skulking off into the night on your trail and leaving me to pine for him but i still remember his savage kisses and his wild lovemaking gods i wish he had an equal since he left ive never found one to match himthough many have tried and proved better than youuntil you came skulking back and your spells drove them off or destroyed them she sneered mocking and taunting him youve been too long among your parchments to be much good to me the sorcerers face muscles tautened beneath his tanned skin and he scowled then why do you let me remain i could make you my slave with a potionyou know that but you wouldntand are thus my slave mighty wizard when elric threatened to displace you in my af fections you conjured that demon and elric was forced to fight it he won youll rememberbut in his pride re fused to compromise you fled into hiding and he went in search of youleaving me that is what you did youre in love theleb kaarna she laughed in his face and your love wont let you use your arts against meonly my other lovers i put up with you because you are often useful but if elric were to return theleb kaarna turned away pettishly picking at his long black beard yishana said i half hate elric aye but that is better than half loving you the sorcerer snarled then why did you join me in bakshaan why did you leave your brothers son upon your throne as regent and come here i sent word and you cameyou must have some affection for me to do that yishana laughed again i heard that a palefaced sor cerer with crimson eyes and a howling runesword was travelling in the north east that is why i came the leb kaarna theleb kaarnas face twisted with anger as he bent forward and gripped the womans shoulder in his taloned hand youll remember that this same palefaced sorcerer was responsible for your own brothers death he spat you lay with a man who was a slayer of his kin and yours he deserted the fleet which he had led to pillage his own land when the dragon masters retaliated dharmit your brother was aboard one of those ships and he now lies scorched and rotting on the ocean bed yishana shook her head wearily you always mention this and hope to shame me yes i entertained one who was virtually my brothers murdererbut elric had ghastlier crimes on his conscience and i still loved him in spite or because of them your words do not have the effect you require theleb kaarna now leave me i wish to sleep alone the sorcerers nails were still biting into yishanas cool flesh he relaxed his grip i am sorry he said his voice breaking let me stay go she said softly and tortured by his own weakness theleb kaarna sorcerer of pan tang left elric of melnibone was in bakshaanand elric had sworn several oaths of vengeance upon theleb kaarna on several separate occasionsin lormyr nadsokor and taueloru as well as in jharkor in his heart the black bearded sorcerer knew who would win any duel which might take place two the four merchants had left swathed in dark cloaks they had not deemed it wise for anyone to be aware of their association with elric now elric brooded over a fresh cup of yellow wine he knew that he would need help of a particular and powerful kind if he were going to capture nikorns castle it was virtually unstormable and with theleb kaarnas nigromantic protection a particularly potent sorcery would have to be used he knew that he was theleb kaarnas match and more when it came to wizardry but if all his energy were ex pended on fighting the other magician he would have none left to effect an entry past the crack guard of desert warriors employed by the merchant prince he needed help in the forests which lay to the south of bakshaan he knew he would find men whose aid would be useful but would they help him he discussed the problem with moonglum i have heard that a band of my countrymen have re cently come north from vilmir where they have pillaged several large towns he informed the eastlander since the great battle of imrryr four years ago the men of melnibone have spread outwards from the dragon isle becoming mercenaries and freebooters it was because of me that imrryr felland this they know but if i offer them rich loot they might aid me moonglum smiled wryly i would not count on it el ric he said such an act as yours can hardly be forgot ten if youll forgive my frankness your countrymen are now unwilling wanderers citizens of a razed citythe oldest and greatest the world has known when imrryr the beautiful fell there must have been many who wished great suffering upon you elric emitted a short laugh possibly he agreed but these are my people and i know them we melni boneans are an old and sophisticated racewe rarely al low emotions to interfere with our general wellbeing moonglum raised his eyebrows in an ironic grimace and elric interpreted the expression rightly i was an exception for a short while he said but now cymoril and my cousin lie in the ruins of imrryr and my own torment will avenge any ill i have done i think my countrymen will realise this moonglum sighed i hope you are right elric who leads this band an old friend elric answered he was dragon master and led the attack upon the reaver ships after they had looted imrryr his name is dyvim tvar once lord of the dragon caves and what of his beasts where are they asleep in the caves again they can be roused only rarelythey need years to recuperate while their venom is redistilled and their energy revitalised if it were not for this the dragon masters would rule the world lucky for you that they dont moonglum comment ed elric said slowly who knows with me to lead them they might yet at least we could carve a new em pire from this world just as our forefathers did moonglum said nothing he thought privately that the young kingdoms would not be so easily vanquished melnibone and her people were ancient cruel and wisebut even their cruelty was tempered with the soft disease which comes with age they lacked the vitality of the barbarian race who had been the ancestors of the builders of imrryr and her longforgotten sister cities vitality was often replaced by tolerancethe tolerance of the aged the ones who have known past glory but whose day is done in the morning said elric we will make contact with dyvim tvar and hope that what he did to the reaver fleet coupled with the consciencepangs which i have personally suffered will serve to give him a properly objective attitude to my scheme and now sleep i think moonglum said i need it anywayand the wench who awaits me might be growing impatient elric shrugged as you will ill drink a little more wine and seek my bed later the black clouds which had huddled over bakshaan on the previous night were still there in the morning the sun rose behind them but the inhabitants were unaware of it it rose unheralded but in the fresh rain splashed dawn elric and moonglum rode the narrow streets of the city heading for the south gate and the forests beyond elric had discarded his usual garb for a simple jerkin of greendyed leather which bore the insignia of the royal line of melnibone a scarlet dragon rampant on a gold field on his finger was the ring of kings the single rare actorious stone set in a ring of runecarved silver this was the ring that elrics mighty forefathers had worn it was many centuries old a short cloak hung from his shoulders and his hose was also blue tucked into high black riding boots at his side hung stormbringer a symbiosis existed between man and sword the man without the sword could become a cripple lacking sight and energythe sword without the man could not drink the blood and the souls it needed for its existence they rode together sword and man and none could tell which was master moonglum more conscious of the inclement weather than his friend hugged a highcollared cloak around him and cursed the elements occasionally it took them an hours hard riding to reach the out skirts of the forest as yet in bakshaan there were only rumours of the imrryrian freebooters coming once or twice a tall stranger had been seen in obscure taverns near the southern wall and this had been remarked upon but the citizens of bakshaan felt secure in their wealth and power and had reasoned with a certain truth in their conviction that bakshaan could withstand a raid far more ferocious than those raids which had taken weaker vilmirian towns elric had no idea why his countrymen had driven northwards to bakshaan possibly they had come only to rest and turn their loot into food supplies in the bazaars the smoke of several large campfires told elric and moonglum where the melniboneans were entrenched with a slackening of pace they guided their horses in that direction while wet branches brushed their faces and the scents of the forest released by the lifebringing rain impinged sweetly upon their nostrils it was with a feeling akin to relaxation that elric met the outguard who suddenly appeared from the undergrowth to bar their way along the forest trail the imrryrian guard was swathed in furs and steel beneath the visor of an intricately worked helmet he peered at elric with wary eyes his vision was slightly impaired by the visor and the rain which dripped from it so that he did not immediately recognise elric halt what do you in these parts elric said impatiently let me passit is elric your lord and your emperor the guard gasped and lowered the longbladed spear he carried he pushed back his helmet and gazed at the man before him with a myriad of different emotions passing across his face among these were amazement reverence and hate he bowed stiffly this is no place for you my liege you renounced and betrayed your people five years ago and while i acknowledge the blood of kings which flows in your veins i cannot obey you or do you the homage which it would otherwise be your right to expect of course said elric proudly sitting his horse straightbacked but let your leadermy boyhood friend dyvim tvarbe the judge of how to deal with me take me to him at once and remember that my companion has done you no ill but treat him with re spect as befits the chosen friend of an emperor of melni bone the guard bowed again and took hold of the reins of elrics mount he led the pair down the trail and into a large clearing wherein were pitched the tents of the men of imrryr cooking fires flared in the centre of the great circle of pavilions and the finefeatured warriors of melnibone sat talking softly around them even in the light of the gloomy day the fabrics of the tents were bright and gay the soft tones were wholly melnibonean in texture deep smoky greens azure ochre gold dark blue the colours did not clashthey blended elric felt sad nostalgia for the sundered multi coloured towers of imrryr the beautiful as the two companions and their guide drew nearer men looked up in astonishment and a low muttering re placed the sounds of ordinary conversation please remain here the guard said to elric i will inform lord dyvim tvar of your coming elric nodded his acquiescence and sat firmly in his saddle conscious of the gaze of the gathered warriors none approached him and some whom elric had known personally in the old days were openly embarrassed they were the ones who did not stare but rather averted their eyes tending to the cooking fires or taking a sudden interest in the pol ish of their finelywrought longswords and dirks a few growled angrily but they were in a definite minority most of the men were simply shockedand also inquisi tive why had this man their king and their betrayer come to their camp the largest pavilion of gold and scarlet had at its peak a banner upon which was emblazoned a dormant dragon blue upon white this was the tent of dyvim tvar and from it the dragon master hurried buckling on his swordbelt his intelligent eyes puzzled and wary dyvim tvar was a man a little older than elric and he bore the stamp of melnibonean nobility his mother had been a princess a cousin to elrics own mother his cheekbones were high and delicate his eyes slightly slanting while his skull was narrow tapering at the jaw like elric his ears were thin near lobeless and coming almost to a point his hands the left one now folded around the hilt of his sword were longfingered and like the rest of his skin pale though not nearly so pale as the dead white of the albinos he strode towards the mounted emperor of melnibone and now his emotions were controlled when he was five feet away from elric dyvim tvar bowed slowly his head bent and his face hidden when he looked up again his eyes met those of elric and remained fixed dyvim tvar lord of the dragon caves greets elric master of melnibone exponent of her secret arts the dragon master spoke gravely the ageold ritual greeting elric was not as confident as he seemed as he replied elric master of melnibone greets his loyal subject and demands that he give audience to dyvim tvar it was not fitting by ancient melnibonean standards that the king should request an audience with one of his subjects and the dragon master understood this he now said i would be honoured if my liege would allow me to accompany him to my pavilion elric dismounted and led the way towards dyvim tvars pavilion moonglum also dismounted and made to follow but elric waved him back the two imrryrian noblemen entered the tent inside a small oillamp augmented the gloomy day light which filtered through the colourful fabric the tent was simply furnished possessing only a soldiers hard bed a table and several carved wooden stools dyvim tvar bowed and silently indicated one of these stools elric sat down for several moments the two men said nothing nei ther allowed emotion to register on their controlled fea tures they simply sat and stared at one another even tually elric said you know me for a betrayer a thief a murderer of my own kin and a slayer of my countrymen dragon master dyvim tvar nodded with my lieges permission i will agree with him we were never so formal in the old days when alone elric said let us forget ritual and tradition melnibone is broken and her sons are wanderers we meet as we used to as equalsonly now this is wholly true we are equals the ruby throne crashed in the ashes of imrryr and now no emperor may sit in state dyvim tvar sighed this is true elricbut why have you come here we were content to forget you even while thoughts of vengeance were fresh we made no move to seek you out have you come to mock you know i would never do that dyvim tvar i rarely sleep in these days and when i do i have such dreams that i would rather be awake you know that yyrkoon forced me to do what i did when he usurped the throne for the second time after i had trusted him as regent when again for the second time he put his sister whom i loved into a sorcerous slumber to aid that reaver fleet was my only hope of forcing him to undo his work and release cymoril from the spell i was moved by vengeance but it was stormbringer my sword which slew cymoril not i of this i am aware dyvim tvar sighed again and rubbed one jewelled hand across his face but it does not explain why you came here there should be no contact between you and your people we are wary of you elric even if we allowed you to lead us again you would take your own doomed path and us with you there is no future there for myself and my men agreed but i need your help for this one timethen our ways can part again we should kill you elric but which would be the greater crime failure to do justice and slay our be trayeror regicide you have given me a problem at a time when there are too many problems already should i attempt to solve it i but played a part in history elric said earnestly time would have done what i did eventually i but brought the day nearerand brought it when you and our people were still resilient enough to combat it and turn to a new way of life dyvim tvar smiled ironically that is one point of view elricand it has truth in it i grant you but tell it to the men who lost their kin and their homes because of you tell it to warriors who had to tend maimed com rades to brothers fathers and husbands whose wives daughters and sistersproud melnibonean womenwere used to pleasure the barbarian pillagers aye elric dropped his eyes when he next spoke it was quietly i can do nothing to replace what our people have lostwould that i could i yearn for imrryr often and her women and her wines and entertain ments but i can offer plunder i can offer you the richest palace in bakshaan forget the old wounds and follow me this once do you seek the riches of bakshaan elric you were never one for jewels and precious metal why elric elric ran his hands through his white hair his red eyes were troubled for vengeance once again dyvim tvar i owe a debt to a sorcerer from pan tangthe leb kaarna you may have heard of himhe is fairly powerful for one of a comparatively young race then were joined in this elric dyvim tvar spoke grimly you are not the only melnibonean who owes theleb kaarna a debt because of that bitchqueen yishana of jharkor one of our men was done to death a year ago in a most foul and horrible manner killed by theleb kaarna because he gave his embraces to yishana who sought a substitute for you we can unite to avenge that blood king elric and it will be a fitting excuse for those who would rather have your blood on their knives elric was not glad he had a sudden premonition that this fortunate coincidence was to have grave and unpre dictable outcomings but he smiled three in a smoking pit somewhere beyond the limitations of space and time a creature stirred all around it shadows moved they were the shadows of the souls of men and these shadows which moved through the bright darkness were the masters of the creature it allowed them to master itso long as they paid its price in the speech of men this creature had a name it was called quaolnargn and would answer to this name if called now it stirred it heard its name carrying over the barriers which normally blocked its way to the earth the calling of the name effected a temporary pathway through those intangible barriers it stirred again as its name was called for the second time it was unaware of why it was called or to what it was called it was only muzzily conscious of one fact when the pathway was opened to it it could feed it did not eat flesh and it did not drink blood it fed on the minds and the souls of adult men and women occasionally as an appetizer it enjoyed the morsels the sweetmeats as it were of the in nocent lifeforce which it sucked from children it ig nored animals since there was not enough awareness in an animal to savour the creature was for all its alien stupidity a gourmet and a connoisseur now its name was called for the third time it stirred again and flowed forward the time was approaching when it could once again feed theleb kaarna shuddered he was basically he felt a man of peace it was not his fault that his avaricious love for yishana had turned him mad it was not his fault that because of her he now controlled several powerful and malevolent demons who in return for the slaves and enemies he fed them protected the palace of nikorn the merchant he felt very strongly that none of it was his fault it was circumstance which had damned him he wished sadly that he had never met yishana never returned to her after that unfortunate episode outside the walls of tanelorn he shuddered again as he stood within the pentacle and summoned quaolnargn his embryonic talent for precognition had shown him a little of the nearfuture and he knew that elric was preparing to do battle with him theleb kaarna was taking the opportunity of summoning all the aid he could control quaolnargn must be sent to destroy elric if it could before the albino reached the castle theleb kaarna congratulated himself that he still retained the lock of white hair which had enabled him in the past to send another now deceased demon against elric quaolnargn knew that it was reaching its master it propelled itself sluggishly forward and felt a stinging pain as it entered the alien continuum it knew that its masters soul hovered before it but for some reason was disappointingly unattainable something was dropped in front of it quaolnargn scented at it and knew what it must do this was part of its new feed it flowed grate fully away intent on finding its prey before the pain which was endemic of a prolonged stay in the strange place grew too much elric rode at the head of his countrymen on his right was dyvim tvar the dragon master on his left moon glum of elwher behind him rode two hundred fighting men and behind them the wagons containing their loot their warmachines and their slaves the caravan was resplendent with proud banners and the gleaming longbladed lances of imrryr they were clad in steel with tapering greaves helmets and shoul derpieces their breastplates were polished and glinted where their long fur jerkins were open over the jerkins were flung bright cloaks of imrryrian fabrics scintillat ing in the watery sunshine the archers were immedi ately close to elric and his companions they carried unstrung bone bows of tremendous power which only they could use on their backs were quivers crammed with blackfletched arrows then came the lancers with their shining lances at a tilt to avoid the low branches of the trees behind these rode the main strengththe imrryrian swordsmen carrying longswords and shorter stabbing weapons which were too short to be real swords and too long to be named as knives they rode skirting bakshaan for the palace of nikorn which lay to the north of bakshaan they rode these men in silence they could think of nothing to say while elric their liege led them to battle for the first time in five years stormbringer the black hellblade tingled under el rics hand anticipating a new swordquenching moon glum fidgeted in his saddle nervous of the forthcoming fight which he knew would involve dark sorcery moon glum had no liking for the sorcerous arts or for the crea tures they spawned to his mind men should fight their own battles without help they rode on nervous and tense stormbringer shook against elrics side a faint moan emanated from the metal and the tone was one of warn ing elric raised a hand and the cavalcade reined to a halt there is something coming near which only i can deal with he informed the men i will ride on ahead he spurred his horse into a wary canter keeping his eyes before him stormbringers voice was louder sharp era muted shriek the horse trembled and elrics own nerves were tense he had not expected trouble so soon and he prayed that whatever evil was lurking in the forest was not directed against him arioch be with me he breathed aid me now and ill dedicate a score of warriors to you aid me arioch a foul odour forced itself into elrics nostrils he coughed and covered his mouth with his hands his eyes seeking the source of the stink the horse whinnied el ric jumped from the saddle and slapped his mount on the rump sending it back along the trail he crouched warily stormbringer now in his grasp the black metal quivering from point to pommel he sensed it with the witchsight of his forefathers be fore he saw it with his eyes and he recognised its shape he himself was one of its masters but this time he had no control over quaolnargnhe was standing in no pen tacle and his only protection was his blade and his wits he knew also of the power of quaolnargn and shud dered could he overcome such a horror singlehandedly arioch arioch aid me it was a scream high and desperate arioch there was no time to conjure a spell quaolnargn was before him a great green toadthing which hopped along the trail obscenely moaning to itself in its earth fostered pain it towered over elric so that the albino was in its shadow before it was ten feet away from him elric breathed quickly and screamed once more ari och blood and souls if you aid me now suddenly the toaddemon leapt elric sprang to one side but was caught by a long nailed foot which sent him flying into the undergrowth quaolnargn turned clumsily and its filthy mouth opened hungrily displaying a deep toothless cavity from which a foul odour poured arioch in its evil and alien insensitivity the toadthing did not even recognize the name of so powerful a demon god it could not be frightenedit had to be fought and as it approached elric for the second time the clouds belched rain from their bowels and a downpour lashed the forest halfblinded by the rain smashing against his face el ric backed behind a tree his runesword ready in ordi nary terms quaolnargn was blind it could not see el ric or the forest it could not feel the rain it could only see and smell mens soulsits feed the toaddemon blundered past him and as it did so elric leapt high holding his blade with both hands and plunged it to the hilt into the demons soft and quivering back fleshor whatever earthbound stuff formed the demons bodysquelched nauseatingly elric pulled at stormbringers hilt as the sorcerous sword seared into the hellbeasts back cutting down where the spine should be but where no spine was quaolnargn piped its pain its voice was thin and reedy even in such extreme agony it retaliated elric felt his mind go numb and then his head was filled with a pain which was not natural in any sense he could not even shriek his eyes widened in horror as he realised what was happening to him his soul was being drawn from his body he knew it he felt no physical weakness he was only aware of looking out into but even that awareness was fading everything was fading even the pain even the dreadful hellspawned pain arioch he croaked savagely he summoned strength from somewhere not from himself not even from stormbringerfrom somewhere something was aiding him at last giving him strengthenough strength to do what he must he wrenched the blade from the demons back he stood over quaolnargn above him he was floating somewhere not in the air of earth just floating over the demon with thoughtful deliberation he selected a spot on the demons skull which he somehow knew to be the only spot on his body where stormbringer might slay slowly and carefully he lowered stormbringer and twisted the runesword through quaolnargns skull the toadthing whimpered droppedand vanished elric lay sprawled in the undergrowth trembling the length of his aching body he picked himself up slow ly all his energy had been drained from him stormbringer too seemed to have lost its vitality but that elric knew would return and in returning bring him new strength but then he felt his whole frame tugged rigid he was astounded what was happening his senses began to blank out he had the feeling that he was staring down a long black tunnel which stretched into nowhere ev erything was vague he was aware of motion he was travelling howor where he could not tell for brief seconds he travelled conscious only of an unearthly feeling of motion and the fact that storm bringer his life was clutched in his right hand then he felt hard stone beneath him and he opened his eyesor was it he wondered that his vision re turnedand looked up at the gloating face above him theleb kaarna he whispered hoarsely how did you effect this the sorcerer bent down and tugged stormbringer from elrics enfeebled grasp he sneered i followed your commendable battle with my messenger lord el ric when it was obvious that somehow you had sum moned aidi quickly conjured another spell and brought you here now i have your sword and your strength i know that without it you are nothing you are in my power elric of melnibone elric gasped air into his lungs his whole body was painracked he tried to smile but he could not it was not in his nature to smile when he was beaten give me back my sword theleb kaarna gave a selfsatisfied smirk he chuck led who talks of vengeance now elric give me my sword elric tried to rise but he was too weak his vision blurred until he could hardly see the gloating sorcerer and what kind of bargain do you offertheleb kaarna asked you are not a well man lord elric and sick men do not bargain they beg elric trembled in impotent anger he tightened his mouth he would not begneither would he bargain in silence he glowered at the sorcerer i think that first theleb kaarna said smiling i shall lock this away he hefted stormbringer in his hand and turned towards a cupboard behind him from his robes he produced a key with which he unlocked the cupboard and placed the runesword inside carefully locking the door again when he had done so then i think ill show our virile hero to his exmistressthe sis ter of the man he betrayed four years ago elric said nothing after that theleb kaarna continued my em ployer nikorn shall be shown the assassin who thought he could do what others failed to achieve he smiled what a day he chuckled what a day so full so rich with pleasure theleb kaarna tittered and picked up a handbell he rang it a door behind elric opened and two tall desert warriors strode in they glanced at elric and then at theleb kaarna they were evidently amazed no questions theleb kaarna snapped take this refuse to the chambers of queen yishana elric fumed as he was hefted up between the two the men were darkskinned bearded and their eyes were deepset beneath shaggy brows they wore the heavy wooltrimmed metal caps of their race and their armour was not of iron but of thick leathercovered wood down a long corridor they lugged elrics weak ened body and one of them rapped sharply on a door elric recognised yishanas voice bid them enter be hind the desertmen and their burden came the titter ing fussing sorcerer a present for you yishana he called the desert men entered elric could not see yishana but he heard her gasp on the couch directed the sor cerer elric was deposited on yielding fabric he lay completely exhausted on the couch staring up at a bright lewd mural which had been painted on the ceil ing yishana bent over him elric could smell her erotic perfume he said hoarsely an unprecedented reunion queen yishanas eyes were for a moment concerned then they hardened and she laughed cynically ohmy hero has returned to me at last but id rather hed come at his own volition not dragged here by the back of his neck like a puppy the wolfs teeth have all been drawn and theres no one to savage me at nights she turned away disgust on her painted face take him away theleb kaarna you have proved your point the sorcerer nodded and now he said to visit nikorni think he should be expecting us by this time four nikorn of ilmar was not a young man he was well past fifty but had preserved his youth his face was that of a peasant firmboned but not fleshy his eyes were keen and hard as he stared at elric who had been mockingly propped in a chair so you are elric of melnibone the wolf of the snarl ing sea spoiler reaver and womanslayer i think that you could hardly slay a child now however i will say that it discomforts me to see any man in such a posi tionparticularly one who has been so active as you is it true what the spellmaker says were you sent here by my enemies to assassinate me elric was concerned for his men what would they do waitor go on if they stormed the palace now they were doomedand so was he is it true nikorn was insistent no whispered elric my quarrel was with theleb kaarna i have an old score to settle with him i am not interested in old scores my friend nikorn said not unkindly i am interested in preserving my life who sent you here theleb kaarna speaks falsely if he told you i was sent elric lied i was interested only in paying my debt it is not only the sorcerer who told me im afraid nikorn said i have many spies in the city and two of them independently informed me of a plot by local mer chants to employ you to kill me elric smiled faintly very well he agreed it was true but i had no intention of doing what they asked nikorn said i might believe you elric of melni bone but now i do not know what to do with you i would not turn anyone over to theleb kaarnas mer cies may i have your word that you will not make an attempt on my life again are we bargaining master nikorn elric said faintly we are then what do i give my word in return for sir your life and freedom lord elric and my sword nikorn shrugged regretfully im sorrynot your sword then take my life said elric brokenly come nowmy bargains good have your life and freedom and give your word that you will not plague me again elric breathed deeply very well nikorn moved away theleb kaarna who had been standing in the shadows put a hand on the merchants arm youre going to release him aye nikorn said hes no threat to either of us now elric was aware of a certain feeling of friendship in nikorns attitude towards him he too felt something of the same here was a man both courageous and clever butelric fought madnesswithout storm bringer what could he do to fight back the two hundred imrryrian warriors lay hidden in the undergrowth as dusk gave way to night they watched and wondered what had happened to elric was he now in the castle as dyvim tvar thought the dragon master knew something of the art of divining as did all members of the royal line of melnibone from what small spells he had conjured it seemed that elric now lay within the castle walls but without elric to battle theleb kaarnas power how could they take it nikorns palace was also a fortress bleak and un lovely it was surrounded by a deep moat of dark stag nant water it stood high above the surrounding forest built into rather than on to the rock much of it had been carved out of the living stone it was sprawling and rambling and covered a large area surrounded by natural buttresses the rock was porous in places and slimy water ran down the walls of the lower parts spreading through dark moss it was not a pleasant place judging from the outside but it was almost cer tainly impregnable two hundred men could not take it without the aid of magic some of the melnibonean warriors were becoming im patient there were a few who muttered that elric had once again betrayed them dyvim tvar and moonglum did not believe this they had seen the signs of con flictand heard themin the forest they waited hoping for a signal from the castle it self they watched the castles great main gateand their patience at last proved of value the huge wood and metal gate swung inwards on chains and a whitefaced man in the tattered regalia of melnibone appeared be tween two desert warriors they were supporting him it seemed they pushed him forwardhe staggered a few yards along the causeway of slimy stone which bridged the moat then he fell he began to crawl wearily painfully forward moonglum growled what have they done to him i must help him but dyvim tvar held him back noit would not do to betray our presence here let him reach the forest first then we can help him even those who had cursed elric now felt pity for the albino as staggering and crawling alternately he dragged his body slowly towards them from the battle ments of the fortress a tittering laugh was borne down to the ears of those below they also caught a few words what now wolf said the voice what now moonglum clenched his hands and trembled with rage hating to see his proud friend so mocked in his weakness whats happened to him what have they done patience dyvim tvar said well find out in a short while it was an agony to wait until elric finally crawled on his knees into the undergrowth moonglum went forward to aid his friend he put a supporting arm around elrics shoulders but the albino snarled and shook it off his whole countenance aflame with terrible hatemade more terrible because it was impotent elric could do nothing to destroy that which he hated nothing dyvim tvar said urgently elric you must tell us what happened if were to help youwe must know what happened elric breathed heavily and nodded his agreement his face partially cleared of the emotion he felt and weakly he stuttered out the story so moonglum growled our plans come to noth ingand you have lost your strength for ever elric shook his head there must be a way he gasped there must what how if you have a plan elriclet me hear it now elric swallowed thickly and mumbled very well moonglum you shall hear it but listen carefully for i have not the strength to repeat it moonglum was a lover of the night but only when it was lit by the torches found in cities he did not like the night when it came to open countryside and he was not fond of it when it surrounded a castle such as nikorns but he pressed on and hoped for the best if elric had been right in his interpretation then the battle might yet be won and nikorns palace taken but it still meant danger for moonglum and he was not one deliberately to put himself into danger as he viewed the stagnant waters of the moat with dis taste he reflected that this was enough to test any friend ship to the utmost philosophically he lowered himself down into the water and began to swim across it the moss on the fortress offered a flimsy handhold but it led to ivy which gave a better grip moonglum slowly clambered up the wall he hoped that elric had been right and that theleb kaarna would need to rest for a while before he could work more sorcery that was why elric had suggested he make haste moonglum clambered on and eventually reached the small un barred window he sought a normal size man could not have entered but moonglums small frame was proving useful he wriggled through the gap shivering with cold and landed on the hard stone of a narrow staircase which ran both up and down the interior wall of the fortress moonglum frowned and then took the steps leading up wards elric had given him a rough idea of how to reach his destination expecting the worst he went softfooted up the stone steps he went towards the chambers of yishana queen of jharkor in an hour moonglum was back shivering with cold and dripping with water in his hands he carried stormbringer he carried the runesword with cautious carenervous of its sentient evil it was alive again alive with black pulsating life thank the gods i was right elric murmured weakly from where he lay surrounded by two or three imrryri ans including dyvim tvar who was staring at the al bino with concern i prayed that i was correct in my assumption and theleb kaarna was resting after his earlier exertions on my behalf he stirred and dyvim tvar helped him to sit up right elric reached out a long white handreached like an addict of some terrible drug towards the sword did you give her my message he asked as he gratefully seized the pommel aye moonglum said shakily and she agreed you were also right in your other interpretation elric it did not take her long to inveigle the key out of a weary theleb kaarna the sorcerer was tremendously tired and nikorn was becoming nervous wondering if an at tack of any kind would take place while theleb kaarna was incapable of action she went herself to the cup board and got me the blade women can sometimes be useful said dyvim tvar dryly though usually in matters like these theyre a hindrance it was possible to see that something other than immediate problems of taking the castle were worrying dyvim tvar but no one thought to ask him what it was that bothered him it seemed a personal thing i agree dragon master elric said almost gaily the gathered men were aware of the strength which poured swiftly back into the albinos deficient veins im buing him with a new hellborn vitality it is time for our vengeance but rememberno harm to nikorn i gave him my word he folded his right hand firmly around stormbringers hilt now for a swordquenching i believe i can obtain the help of just the allies we need to keep the sorcerer occupied while we storm the castle ill need no pentacle to summon my friends of the air moonglum licked his long lips so its sorcery again in truth elric this whole country is beginning to stink of wizardry and the minions of hell elric murmured for his friends ears no hellbeings thesebut honest elementals equally powerful in many ways curb your bellyfear moongluma little more simple conjuring and theleb kaarna will have no desire to retaliate the albino frowned remembering the secret pacts of his forefathers he took a deep breath and closed his painfilled scarlet eyes he swayed the runesword half loose in his grip his chant was low like the faroff moaning of the wind itself his chest moved quickly up and down and some of the younger warriors those who had never been fully initiated into the ancient lore of melnibone stirred with discomfort elrics voice was not addressing human folkhis words were for the invisible the intangiblethe supernatural an old and ancient rhyme began the casting of wordrunes hear the doomed ones dark decision let the wind giants wail be heard graoll and mishas mighty moaning send my enemy like a bird by the sultry scarlet stones by the bane of my black blade by the lasshaars lonely mewling let a mighty wind be made speed of sunbeams from their homeland swifter than the sundering storm speed of arrow deerwards shooting let the sorcerer so be borne his voice broke and he called high and clear misha misha in the name of my fathers i summon thee lord of the winds almost at once the trees of the forest suddenly bent as if some great hand had brushed them aside a terri ble soughing voice swam from nowhere and all but el ric deep in his trance shivered elric of melnibone the voice roared like a distant storm we knew your fathers i know thee the debt we owe the line of elric is forgotten by mortals but graoll and misha kings of the wind remember how may the lassahar aid thee the voice seemed almost friendlybut proud and aloof and aweinspiring elric completely in a state of trance now jerked his whole body in convulsions his voice shrieked piercingly from his throatand the words were alien unhuman vi olently disturbing to the ears and nerves of the human listeners elric spoke briefly and then the invisible wind giants great voice roared and sighed i will do as you desire then the trees bent once more and the forest was still and muted somewhere in the gathered ranks a man sneezed sharp ly and this was a sign for others to start talkingspecu lating for many moments elric remained in his trance and then quite suddenly he opened his enigmatic eyes and looked gravely around him puzzled for a second then he clasped stormbringer more firmly and leaned for ward speaking to the men of imrryr soon theleb kaarna will be in our power my friends and so also will we possess the loot of nikorns palace but dyvim tvar shuddered then im not so given skilled in the esoteric arts as you elric he said quietly but in my soul i see three wolves leading a pack to slaughter and one of those wolves must die my doom is near me i think elric said uncomfortably worry not dragon master youll live to mock the ravens and spend the spoils of bakshaan but his voice was not convincing five in his bed of silk and ermine theleb kaarna stirred and awoke he had a brooding inkling of coming trou ble and he remembered that earlier in his tiredness he had given more to yishana than had been wise he could not remember what it was and now he had a presentiment of dangerthe closeness of which over shadowed thoughts of any past indiscretion he arose hurriedly and pulled his robe over his head shrugging into it as he walked towards a strangelysilvered mirror which was set on one wall of his chamber and reflected no image with bleary eyes and trembling hands he began preparations from one of the many earthenware jars resting on a bench near the window he poured a sub stance which seemed like dried blood mottled with the hardened blue venom of the black serpent whose home land was in far dorel which lay on the edge of the world over this he muttered a swift incantation scooped the stuff into a crucible and hurled it at the mirror one arm shielding his eyes a crack sounded hard and sharp to his ears and bright green light erupt ed suddenly and was gone the mirror flickered deep within itself the silvering seemed to undulate and flicker and flash and then a picture began to form theleb kaarna knew that the sight he witnessed had taken place in the recent past it showed him elrics summoning of the wind giants theleb kaarnas dark features grinned with a terrible fear his hands jerked as spasms shook him halfgibber ing he rushed back to his bench and leaning his hands upon it stared out of the window into the deep night he knew what to expect a great and dreadful storm was blowingand he was the object of the lasshaars attack he had to retaliate else his own soul would be wrenched from him by the giants of the wind and flung to the air spirits to be borne for eternity on the winds of the world then his voice would moan like a banshee around the cold peaks of high iceclothed mountains for everlost and lonely his soul would be damned to travel with the four winds wherever their caprice might bear it knowing no rest theleb kaarna had a respect born of fear for the powers of the aeromancer the rare wizard who could control the wind elementalsand aeromancy was only one of the arts which elric and his ancestors possessed then theleb kaarna realised what he was battlingten thousand years and hundreds of generations of sorcerers who had gleaned knowledge from the earth and beyond it and passed it down to the albino whom he theleb kaarna had sought to destroy then theleb kaarna fully regretted his actions thenit was too late the sorcerer had no control over the powerful wind giants as elric had his only hope was to combat one ele ment with another the firespirits must be summoned and quickly all of theleb kaarnas pyromantic powers would be required to hold off the ravening supernatural winds which were soon to shake the air and the earth even hell would shake to the sound and the thunder of the wind giants wrath quickly theleb kaarna marshalled his thoughts and with trembling hands began to make strange passes in the air and promise unhealthy pacts with whichever of the powerful fire elementals would help him this once he promised himself to eternal death for the sake of a few more years of life with the gathering of the wind giants came the thunder and the rain the lightning flashed sporadi cally but not lethally it never touched the earth elric moonglum and the men of imrryr were aware of dis turbing movements in the atmosphere but only elric with his witch sight could see a little of what was hap pening the lasshaar giants were invisible to other eyes the war engines which the imrryrians were even now constructing from prefashioned parts were puny things compared to the wind giants might but victory depended upon these engines since the lasshaars fight would be with the supernatural not the natural battlerams and siege ladders were slowly taking shape as the warriors worked with frantic speed the hour of the storming came closer as the wind rose and thunder rattled the moon was blanked out by huge billowings of black cloud and the men worked by the light of torches surprise was no great asset in an attack of the kind planned two hours before dawn they were ready at last the men of imrryr elric dyvim tvar and moonglum riding high at their head moved towards the castle of nikorn as they did so elric raised his voice in an unholy shoutand thunder rumbled in answer to him a great gout of lightning seared out of the sky towards the palace and the whole place shook and trembled as a ball of mauve and orange fire suddenly appeared over the castle and absorbed the lightning the battle between fire and air had begun the surrounding countryside was alive with a weird and malignant shrieking and moaning deafening to the ears of the marching men they sensed conflict all round them and only a little was visible over most of the castle an unearthly glow hung wax ing and waning defending a gibbering wretch of a sor cerer who knew that he was doomed if once the lords of the flame gave way to the roaring wind giants elric smiled without humour as he observed the war on the supernatural plane he now had little to fear but there was still the castle and he had no extra super natural aid to help him take that swordplay and skill in battle was the only hope against the ferocious desert warriors who now crowded the battlements preparing to destroy the two hundred men who came against them up rose the dragon standards their clothofgold fab ric flashing in the eerie glow spread out walking slowly the sons of imrryr moved forward to do battle up also rose the siege ladders as captains directed war riors to begin the assault the defenders faces were pale spots against the dark stone and thin shouts came from them but it was impossible to catch their words two great battlerams fashioned the day before were brought to the vanguard of the approaching warriors the narrow causeway was a dangerous one to pass over but it was the only means of crossing the moat at ground level twenty men carried each of the great irontipped rams and now they began to run forward while arrows hailed downwards their shields protecting them from most of the shafts the warriors reached the causeway and rushed across it now the first ram con nected with the gate it seemed to elric as he watched this operation that nothing of wood and iron could withstand the vicious impact of the ram but the gates shivered almost imperceptiblyand held like vampires hungry for blood the men howled and staggered aside crabwise to let pass the log held by their comrades again the gates shivered more easily noticed this time but they yet held dyvim tvar roared encouragement to those now scaling the siege ladders these were brave almost des perate men for few of the first climbers would reach the top and even if they were successful they would be hardpressed to stay alive until their comrades arrived boiling lead hissed from great cauldrons set on spindles so that they could be easily emptied and filled quickly many a brave imrryrian warrior fell earth wards dead from the searing metal before he reached the sharp rocks beneath large stones were released out of leather bags hanging from rotating pulleys which could swing out beyond the battlements and rain bone crushing death on the besiegers but still the invaders advanced voicing halfahundred warshouts and steadily scaling their long ladders whilst their comrades using a shield barrier still to protect their heads concentrated on breaking down the gates elric and his two companions could do little to help the sealers or the rammers at that stage all three were handtohand fighters leaving even the archery to their rear ranks of bowmen who stood in rows and shot their shafts high into the castle defenders the gates were beginning to give cracks and splits appeared in them ever widening then all at once when hardly expected the right gate creaked on tor tured hinges and fell a triumphant roar erupted from the throats of the invaders and dropping their hold on the logs they led their companions through the breach axes and maces swinging like scythes and flails before themand enemy heads springing from necks like wheat from the stalk the castle is ours shouted moonglum running for ward and upward towards the gap in the archway the castles taken speak not too hastily of victory replied dyvim tvar but he laughed as he spoke and ran as fast as the others to reach the castle and where is your doom now elric called to his fellow melnibonean then broke off sharply when dyvim tvars face clouded and his mouth set grimly for a mo ment there was tension between them even as they ran then dyvim tvar laughed loud and made a joke of it it lies somewhere elric it lies somewherebut let us not worry about such things for if my doom hangs over me i cannot stop its descent when my hour arrives he slapped elrics shoulder feeling for the albinos unchar acteristic confusion then they were under the mighty archway and in the courtyard of the castle where savage fighting had de veloped almost into single duels enemy choosing enemy and fighting him to the death stormbringer was the first of the three mens blades to take blood and send a desert mans soul to hell the song it sang as it was lashed through the air in strong strokes was an evil oneevil and triumphant the darkfaced desert warriors were famous for their courage and skill with swords their curved blades were reaping havoc in the imrryrian ranks for at that stage the desert men far outnumbered the melnibonean force somewhere above the inspired sealers had got a firm foothold on the battlements and were closing with the men of nikorn driving them back forcing many over the unrailed edges of the parapets a falling still screaming warrior plummeted down to land almost on elric knocking his shoulder and causing him to fall heavily to the bloodandrainslick cobbles a badly scarred desert man quick to see his chance moved for ward with a gloating look on his travesty of a face his scimitar moved up poised to hack elrics neck from his shoulders and then his helmet split open and his fore head spurted a sudden gout of blood dyvim tvar wrenched a captured axe from the skull of the slain warrior and grinned at elric as the albino rose well both live to see victory yet he shouted over the din of the warring elementals above them and the sound of clashing arms my doom i will escape until he broke off a look of surprise on his fineboned face and elrics stomach twisted inside him as he saw a steel point appear in dyvim tvars right side behind the dragon master a maliciously smiling desert warrior pulled his blade from dyvim tvars body elric cursed and rushed forward the man put up his blade to de fend himself backing hurriedly away from the infuriat ed albino stormbringer swung up and then down it howled a deathsong and sheared right through the curved steel of elrics opponentand it kept on going straight through the mans shoulder blade splitting him half in two elric turned back to dyvim tvar who was still standing up but was pale and strained his blood dripped from his wound and seeped through his gar ments how badly are you hurt elric said anxiously can you tell that trollspawns sword passed through my ribs i thinkno vitals were harmed dyvim tvar gasped and tried to smile im sure id know if hed made more of the wound then he fell and when elric turned him he looked into a dead and staring face the dragon master lord of the dragon caves would never tend his beasts again elric felt sick and weary as he got up standing over the body of his kinsman because of me he thought an other fine man has died but this was the only conscious thought he allowed himself for the meantime he was forced to defend himself from the slashing swords of a couple of desert men who came at him in a rush the archers their work done outside came running through the breach in the gate and their arrows poured into the enemy ranks elric shouted loudly my kinsman dyvim tvar lies dead stabbed in the back by a desert warrioravenge him brethren avenge the dragon master of imrryr a low moaning came from the throats of the melni boneans and their attack was even more ferocious than before elric called to a bunch of axemen who ran down from the battlements their victory assured you men follow me we can avenge the blood that theleb kaarna took he had a good idea of the geog raphy of the castle moonglum shouted from somewhere one moment elric and ill join you a desert warrior fell his back to elric and from behind him emerged a grinning moonglum his sword covered in blood from point to pommel elric led the way to a small door set into the main tower of the castle he pointed at it and spoke to the axe men set to with your axes lads and hurry grimly the axemen began to hack at the tough tim ber impatiently elric watched as the wood chips started to fly the conflict was appalling theleb kaarna sobbed in frustration kakatal the fire lord and his minions were having little effect on the wind giants their power appeared to be increasing if anything the sor cerer gnawed his knuckles and quaked in his chamber while below him the human warriors fought bled and died theleb kaarna made himself concentrate on one thing onlytotal destruction of the lasshaar forces but he knew somehow even then that sooner or later in one way or another he was doomed the axes drove deeper and deeper into the stout tim ber at last it gave were through my lord one of the axemen indicated the gaping hole theyd made elric reached his arm through the gap and prised up the bar which secured the door the bar moved up wards and then fell with a clatter to the stone flagging elric put his shoulder to the door and pushed above them now two huge almosthuman figures had appeared in the sky outlined against the night one was golden and glowing like the sun and seemed to wield a great sword of fire the other was dark blue and silver writhing smokelike with a flickering spear of restless orange in his hand misha and kakatal clashed the outcome of their mighty struggle might well decide theleb kaarnas fate quickly elric said upwards they ran up the stairs the stairs which led to the leb kaarnas chamber suddenly the men were forced to stop as they came to a door of jetblack studded with crimson iron it had no keyhole no bolts no bars but it was quite secure elric directed the axemen to begin hewing at it all six struck at the door in unison in unison they screamed and vanished not even a wisp of smoke remained to mark where they had disap peared moonglum staggered backwards eyes wide in fear he was backing away from elric who remained firmly by the door stormbringer throbbing in his hand get out elricthis is a sorcery of terrible power let your friends of the air finish the wizard elric shouted halfhysterically magic is best fought by magic he hurled his whole body behind the blow which he struck at the black door stormbringer whined into it shrieked as if in victory and howled like a soul hungry demon there was a blinding flash a roaring in elrics ears a sense of weightlessness and then the door had crashed inwards moonglum witnessed thishe had remained against his will stormbringer has rarely failed me moonglum cried elric as he leapt through the aperture come we have reached theleb kaarnas den he broke off staring at the gibbering thing on the floor it had been a man it had been theleb kaarna now it was hunched and twistedsitting in the middle of a broken pentacle and tittering to itself suddenly intelligence came into its eyes too late for vengeance lord elric it said i have won you seei have claimed your vengeance as my own grimfaced and speechless elric stepped forward lifted stormbringer and brought the moaning runesword down into the sorcerers skull he left it there for several moments drink your fill hellblade he murmured we have earned it you and i overhead there was a sudden silence six its untrue you lie screamed the frightened man we were not responsible pilarmo faced the group of leading citizens behind the overdressed merchant were his three colleaguesthose who had earlier met elric and moonglum in the tavern one of the accusing citizens pointed a chubby finger towards the north and nikorns palace sonikorn was an enemy of all other traders in bakshaan that i accept but now a horde of bloody handed reavers attack his castle with the aid of demonsand elric of melnibone leads them you know that you were responsiblethe gossips all over the city you employed elricand this is whats happened but we didnt know he would go to such lengths to kill nikorn fat tormiel wrung his hands his face ag grieved and afraid you are wronging us we only were wronging you faratt spokesman for his fel low citizens was thicklipped and florid he waved his hands in angry exasperation when elric and his jackals have done with nikorntheyll come to the city fool that is what the albino sorcerer planned to begin with he was only mocking youfor you provided him with an excuse armed men we can fightbut not foul sorcery what shall we do what shall we do bakshaan will be razed within the day tormiel turned on pilarmo this was your ideayou think of a plan pilarmo stuttered we could pay a ransombribe themgive them enough money to satisfy them and who shall give this money asked faratt again the argument began elric looked with distaste at theleb kaarnas broken corpse he turned away and faced a blanchfeatured moonglum who said hoarsely lets away now elric yishana awaits you in bakshaan as she promised you must keep your end of the bargain i made for you elric nodded wearily ayethe imrryrians seem to have taken the castle by the sound of it well leave them to their spoiling and get out while we may will you allow me a few moments here alone the sword re jects the soul moonglum sighed thankfully ill join you in the courtyard within the quarter hour i wish to claim some measure of the spoils he left clattering down the stairs while elric remained standing over his enemys body he spread out his arms the sword dripping blood still in his hand dyvim tvar he cried you and our countrymen have been avenged let any evil one who holds the soul of dyvim tvar release it now and take instead the soul of theleb kaarna within the room something invisible and intangible but sensed all the sameflowed and hovered over the sprawled body of theleb kaarna elric looked out of the window and thought he heard the beating of dragon wingssmelled the acrid breath of dragonssaw a shape winging across the dawn sky bearing dyvim tvar the dragon master away elric halfsmiled the gods of melnibone protect thee wherever thou art he said quietly and turned away from the carnage leaving the room on the stairway he met nikorn of ilmar the merchants rugged face was full of anger he trembled with rage there was a big sword in his hand so ive found you wolf he said i gave you your lifeand you have done this to me elric said tiredly it was to be but i gave my word that i would not take your life and believe me i would not nikorn even had i not pledged my word nikorn stood two steps from the door blocking the exit then ill take yours comeengage he moved out into the courtyard halfstumbled over an imrryrian corpse righted himself and waited glowering for elric to emerge elric did so his runesword sheathed no defend yourself wolf automatically the albinos right hand crossed to his sword hilt but he still did not unsheath it nikorn cursed and aimed a welltimed blow which barely missed the whitefaced sorcerer he skipped back and now he tugged out stormbringer still reluctant and stood poised and wary waiting for the bakshaanites next move elric intended simply to disarm nikorn he did not want to kill or maim this brave man who had spared him when he had been entirely at the others mercy nikorn swung another powerful stroke at elric and the albino parried stormbringer was moaning softly shuddering and pulsating metal clanged and then the fight was on in full earnest as nikorns rage turned to calm possessed fury elric was forced to defend himself with all his skill and power though older than the al bino and a city merchant nikorn was a superb swords man his speed was fantastic and at times elric was not on the defensive only because he desired it but something was happening to the runeblade it was twisting in elrics hand and forcing him to make a counterattack nikorn backed awaya light akin to fear in his eyes as he realised the potency of elrics hell forged steel the merchant fought grimlyand elric did not fight at all he felt entirely in the power of the whining sword which hacked and cut at nikorns guard stormbringer suddenly shifted in elrics hand nikorn screamed the runesword left elrics grasp and plunged on its own accord towards the heart of his opponent no elric tried to catch hold of his blade but could not stormbringer plunged into nikorns great heart and wailed in demoniac triumph no elric got hold of the hilt and tried to pull it from nikorn the merchant shrieked in hellbrought agony he should have been dead he still halflived its taking methe thricedamned thing is taking me nikorn gurgled horribly clutching at the black steel with hands turned to claws stop it elrici beg you stop it please elric tried again to tug the blade from nikorns heart he could not it was rooted in flesh sinew and vitals it moaned greedily drinking into it all that was the being of nikorn of ilmar it sucked the lifeforce from the dy ing man and all the while its voice was soft and disgust ingly sensuous still elric struggled to pull the sword free it was impossible damn you he moaned this man was almost my friendi gave him my word not to kill him but stormbringer though sentient could not hear its master nikorn shrieked once more the shriek dying to a low lost whimper and then his body died it diedand the soulstuff of nikorn joined the souls of the countless others friends kin and enemies who had gone to feed that which fed elric of melnibone elric sobbed why is this curse upon me why he collapsed to the ground in the dirt and the blood minutes later moonglum came upon his friend lying face downward he grasped elric by his shoulder and turned him he shuddered when he saw the albinos ag onyracked face what happened elric raised himself on one elbow and pointed to where nikorns body lay a few feet away another moonglum oh curse this blade moonglum said uncomfortably he would have killed you no doubt do not think about it many a words been broken through no fault of he who gave it come my friend yishana awaits us in the tavern of the purple dove elric struggled upright and began to walk slowly towards the battered gates of the palace where horses awaited them as they rode for bakshaan not knowing what was troubling the people of that city elric tapped storm bringer which hung once more at his side his eyes were hard and moody turned inwards on his own feelings be wary of this devilblade moonglum it kills the foebut savours the blood of friends and kinfolk most moonglum shook his head quickly as if to clear it and looked away he said nothing elric made as if to speak again but then changed his mind he needed to talk then he needed tobut there was nothing to say at all pilarmo scowled he stared hurtfaced as his slaves struggled with his chests of treasure lugging them out to pile them in the street beside his great house in other parts of the city pilarmos three colleagues were also in various stages of heartbreak their treasure too was being dealt with in a like manner the burghers of bakshaan had decided who was to pay any possible ran som and then a ragged citizen was shambling down the street pointing behind him and shouting the albino and his companionat the north gate the burghers who stood near to pilarmo exchanged glances faratt swallowed he said elric comes to bargain quick open the treasure chests and tell the city guard to admit him one of the citizens scurried off within a few minutes while faratt and the rest worked frantically to expose pilarmos treasure to the gaze of the approaching albino elric was galloping up the street moonglum beside him both men were ex pressionless they knew enough not to show their puz zlement whats this elric said casting a look at pilarmo faratt cringed treasure he whined yours lord elricfor you and your men theres much more there is no need to use sorcery no need for your men to at tack us the treasure here is fabulousits value is enor mous will you take it and leave the city in peace moonglum almost smiled but he controlled his fea tures elric said coolly it will do i accept it make sure this and the rest is delivered to my men at nikorns castle or well be roasting you and your friends over open fires by the morrow faratt coughed suddenly trembling as you say lord elric it shall be delivered the two men wheeled their horses in the direction of the tavern of the purple dove when they were out of earshot moonglum said from what i gathered back there its master pilarmo and his friends who are pay ing that unasked for toll elric was incapable of any real humour but he half chuckled aye id planned to rob them from the startand now their own fellows have done it for us on our way back we shall take our pick of the spoils he rode on and reached the tavern yishana was wait ing there nervously dressed for travelling when she saw elrics face she sighed with satisfaction and smiled silkily so theleb kaarna is dead she said now we can resume our interrupted relationship elric the albino nodded that was my part of the bar gainyou kept yours when you helped moonglum to get my sword back for me he showed no emotion she embraced him but he drew back later he murmured but that is one promise i shall not break yishana he helped the puzzled woman mount her waiting horse they rode back towards pilarmos house she asked and what of nikornis he safe i liked that man he died elrics voice was strained how she asked because like all merchants elric answered he bar gained too hard there was an unnatural silence among the three as they made their horses speed faster towards the gates of bakshaan and elric did not stop when the others did to take their pick of pilarmos riches he rode on unsee ing and the others had to spur their steeds in order to catch up with him two miles beyond the city over bakshaan no breeze stirred in the gardens of the rich no winds came to blow cool on the sweating faces of the poor only the sun blazed in the heavens round and red and a shadow shaped like a dragon moved across it once and then was gone book two kings in darkness three kings in darkness lie gutheran of org and i under a bleak and sunless sky the third beneath the hill song of veerkad by james cawthorn one elric lord of the lost and sundered empire of melni bone rode like a fanged wolf from a trapall slavering madness and mirth he rode from nadsokor city of beggars and there was hate in his wake for he had been recognised as their old enemy before he could obtain the secret he had sought there now they hounded him and the grotesque little man who rode laughing at elrics side moonglum the outlander from elwher and the unmapped east the flames of brands devoured the velvet of the night as the yelling ragged throng pushed their bony nags in pursuit of the pair starvelings and tattered jackals that they were there was strength in their gaudy numbers and long knives and bone bows glinted in the brandlight they were too strong for a couple of men to fight too few to represent serious danger in a hunt so elric and moonglum had chosen to leave the city without dispute and now sped towards the full and rising moon which stabbed its sickly beams through the darkness to show them the dis turbing waters of the varkalk river and a chance of es cape from the incensed mob they had half a mind to stand and face the mob since the varkalk was their only alternative but they knew well what the beggars would do to them whereas they were uncertain what would become of them once they had entered the river the horses reached the sloping banks of the varkalk and reared with hooves lashing cursing the two men spurred the steeds and forced them down towards the water into the river the horses plunged snorting and spluttering into the river which led a roaring course towards the hellspawned forest of troos which lay within the borders of org country of necromancy and rotting ancient evil elric blew water away from his mouth and coughed theyll not follow us to troos i think he shouted at his companion moonglum said nothing he only grinned showing his white teeth and the unhidden fear in his eyes the horses swam strongly with the current and behind them the ragged mob shrieked in frustrated bloodlust while some of their number laughed and jeered let the forest do our work for us elric laughed back at them wildly as the horses swam on down the dark straight river wide and deep towards a sunstarved morning cold and spiky with ice scat tered slimpeaked crags loomed on either side of the flat plain through which the river ran swiftly greentinted masses of jutting blacks and browns spread colour through the rocks and the grass was waving on the plain as if for some purpose through the dawnlight the beg gar crew chased along the banks but eventually gave up their quarry to return shuddering to nadsokor when they had gone elric and moonglum made their mounts swim towards the banks and climb them stum bling to the top where rocks and grass had already given way to sparse forest land which rose starkly on all sides staining the earth with sombre shades the foliage waved jerkily as if alivesentient it was a forest of malignantly erupting blooms blood coloured and sicklymottled a forest of bending sinu ously smooth trunks black and shiny a forest of spiked leaves of murky purples and gleaming greenscertainly an unhealthy place if judged only by the odour of rot ting vegetation which was almost unbearable impinging as it did upon the fastidious nostrils of elric and moon glum moonglum wrinkled his nose and jerked his head in the direction they had come back now he inquired we can avoid troos and cut swiftly across a corner of org to be in bakshaan in just over a day what say you elric elric frowned i dont doubt theyd welcome us in bakshaan with the same warmth we received in nad sokor theyll not have forgotten the destruction we wrought thereand the wealth we acquired from their merchants no i have a fancy to explore the forest a little i have heard tales of org and its unnatural forest and should like to investigate the truth of them my blade and sorcery will protect us if necessary moonglum sighed elricthis once let us not court the danger elric smiled icily his scarlet eyes blazed out of his dead white skin with peculiar intensity danger it can bring only death death is not to my liking just yet moonglum said the fleshpots of bakshaan or if you preferjadmar on the other hand but elric was already urging his horse onward head ing for the forest moonglum sighed and followed soon dark blossoms hid most of the sky which was dark enough and they could see only a little way in all directions the rest of the forest seemed vast and sprawling they could sense this though sight of most of it was lost in the depressing gloom moonglum recognised the forest from descriptions he had heard from madeyed travellers who drank purpose fully in the shadows of nadsokors taverns this is the forest of troos sure enough he said to elric its told of how the doomed folk released tremendous forces upon the earth and caused terrible changes among men beasts and vegetation this forest is the last they created and the last to perish a child will always hate its parents at certain times elric said mysteriously children of whom to be extremely wary i should think moonglum retorted some say that when they were at the peak of their power they had no gods to frighten them a daring people indeed elric replied with a faint smile they have my respect now fear and the gods are back and that at least is comforting moonglum puzzled over this for a short time and then eventually said nothing he was beginning to feel uneasy the place was full of malicious rustlings and whis pers though no living animal inhabited it as far as they could tell there was a discomforting absence of birds rodents or insects and though they normally had no love for such creatures they would have appreciated their company in the disconcerting forest in a quavering voice moonglum began to sing a song in the hope that it would keep his spirits up and his thoughts off the lurking forest a grin and a word is my trade from these my profit is made though my bodys not tall and my courage is small my fame will take longer to fade so singing with his natural amiability returning moonglum rode after the man he regarded as a friend a friend who possessed something akin to mastery over him though neither admitted it elric smiled at moonglums song to sing of ones own lack of size and absence of courage is not an action designed to ward off ones enemies moonglum but this way i offer no provocation moonglum re plied glibly if i sing of my shortcomings i am safe if i were to boast of my talents then someone might con sider this to be a challenge and decide to teach me a lesson true elric assented gravely and wellspoken he began pointing at certain blossoms and leaves re marking upon their alien tint and texture referring to them in words which moonglum could not understand though he knew the words to be part of a sorcerers vo cabulary the albino seemed to be untroubled by the fears which beset the eastlander but often moonglum knew appearances with elric could hide the opposite of what they indicated they stopped for a short break while elric sifted through some of the samples he had torn from trees and plants he carefully placed his prizes in his beltpouch but would say nothing of why he did so to moonglum come he said trooss mysteries await us but then a new voice a womans said softly from the gloom save the excursion for another day strangers elric reined his horse one hand at stormbringers hilt the voice had had an unusual effect upon him it had been low deep and had for a moment sent the pulse in his throat throbbing incredibly he sensed that he was suddenly standing on one of fates roads but where the road would take him he did not know quickly he controlled his mind and then his body and looked towards the shadows from where the voice had come you are very kind to offer us advice madam he said sternly come show yourself and give explana tion she rode then very slowly on a blackcoated gelding that pranced with a power she could barely restrain moonglum drew an appreciative breath for although heavyfeatured she was incredibly beautiful her face and bearing was patrician her eyes were greygreen combining enigma and innocence she was very young for all her obvious womanhood and beauty moonglum aged her at seventeen or little more elric frowned do you ride alone i do now she replied trying to hide her obvious as tonishment at the albinos colouring i need aidpro tection men who will escort me safely to karlaak there they will be paid karlaak by the weeping waste it lies the other side of ilmiora a hundred leagues away and a weeks trav elling at speed elric did not wait for her to reply to this statement we are not hirelings madam then you are bound by the vows of chivalry sir and cannot refuse my request elric laughed shortly chivalry madam we come not from the upstart nations of the south with their strange codes and rules of behaviour we are nobles of older stock whose actions are governed by our own desires you would not ask what you do if you knew our names she wetted her full lips with her tongue and said al most timidly you are elric of melnibone madam called elric woman slayer in the west and this is moonglum of elwher he has no conscience she said there are legendsthe whitefaced reaver the helldriven sorcerer with a blade that drinks the souls of men aye thats true and however magnified they are with the retelling they cannot hint those tales at the darker truths which lie in their origin now madam do you still seek our aid elrics voice was gentle without menace as he saw that she was very much afraid al though she had managed to control the signs of fear and her lips were tight with determination i have no choice i am at your mercy my father the senior senator of karlaak is very rich karlaak is called the city of the jade towers as you will know and such rare jades and ambers we have many could be yours be careful madam lest you anger me warned elric although moonglums bright eyes lighted with avarice we are not nags to be hired or goods to be bought besides which he smiled disdainfully i am from crumbling imrryr the dreaming city from the isle of the dragon hub of ancient melnibone and i know what beauty really is your baubles cannot tempt one who has looked upon the milky heart of arioch upon the blinding iridescence that throbs from the ruby throne of the languorous and unnameable colours in the actorios stone of the ring of kings these are more than jewels madamthey contain the lifestuff of the universe i apologise lord elric and to you sir moonglum elric laughed almost with affection we are grim clowns lady but the gods of luck aided our escape from nadsokor and we owe them a debt well escort you to karlaak city of the jade towers and explore the forest of troos another time her thanks was tempered with a wary look in her eyes and now we have made introductions said elric perhaps you would be good enough to give your name and tell us your story i am zarozinia from karlaak a daughter of the voashoon the most powerful clan in south eastern il miora we have kinsmen in the trading cities on the coasts of pikarayd and i went with two cousins and my uncle to visit them a perilous journey lady zarozinia aye and there are not only natural dangers sir two weeks ago we made our goodbyes and began the journey home safely we crossed the straits of vilmir and there employed menatarms forming a strong caravan to journey through vilmir and so to ilmiora we skirted nadsokor since we had heard that the city of beggars is inhospitable to honest travellers here elric smiled and sometimes to dishonest trav ellers as we can appreciate again the expression on her face showed that she had some difficulty in equating his obvious good humour with his evil reputation having skirted nadsokor she continued we came this way and reached the borders of org wherein of course troos lies very warily we travelled knowing dark orgs reputation along the fringes of the forest and then we were ambushed and our hired menatarms deserted us ambushed eh broke in moonglum by whom madam did you know by their unsavoury looks and squat shapes they seemed natives they fell upon the caravan and my uncle and cousins fought bravely but were slain one of my cousins slapped the rump of my gelding and sent it galloping so that i could not control it i heardterrible screamsmad giggling shoutsand when i at last brought my horse to a halt i was lost later i heard you approach and waited in fear for you to pass thinking you also were of org but when i heard your accents and some of your speech i thought that you might help me and help you we shall madam said moonglum bowing gallantly from the saddle and i am indebted to you for convincing lord elric here of your need but for you we should be deep in this awful forest by now and experiencing strange terrors no doubt i offer my sorrow for your dead kinsfolk and assure you that you will be protected from now onwards by more than swords and brave hearts for sorcery can be called up if needs be lets hope therell be no need frowned elric you talk blithely of sorcery friend moonglumyou who hate the art moonglum grinned i was consoling the young lady elric and ive had occasion to be grateful for your horrid powers ill ad mit now i suggest that we make camp for the night and so refreshed be on our way at dawn ill agree to that said elric glancing almost with embarrassment at the girl again he felt the pulse in his throat and this time he had more difficulty in control ling it the girl also seemed fascinated by the albino there was an attraction between them which might be strong enough to throw both their destinies along wildly differ ent paths than any they had guessed night came again quickly for the days were short in those parts while moonglum tended the fire nervously peering around him zarozinia her richly embroidered clothofgold gown shimmering in the firelight walked gracefully to where elric sat sorting the herbs he had collected she glanced at him cautiously and then seeing that he was absorbed stared at him with open curiosity he looked up and smiled faintly his eyes for once un protected his strange face frank and pleasant some of these are healing herbs he said and others are used in summoning spirits yet others give unnatural strength to the imbiber and some turn men mad they will be useful to me she sat down beside him her thickfingered hands pushing her black hair back her small breasts lifted and fell rapidly are you really the terrible evilbringer of the legends lord elric i find it hard to credit i have brought evil to many places he said but usually there has already been evil to match mine i seek no excuses for i know what i am and i know what i have done i have slain malignant sorcerers and destroyed oppressors but i have also been responsible for slaying fine men and a woman my cousin whom i loved i killedor my sword did and you are master of your sword i often wonder without it i am helpless he put his hand around stormbringers hilt i should be grate ful to it once again his red eyes seemed to become deeper protecting some bitter emotion rooted at the core of his soul im sorry if i revived unpleasant recollection do not feel sorry lady zarozinia the pain is within meyou did not put it there in fact id say you relieve it greatly by your presence halfstartled she glanced at him and smiled i am no wanton sir she said but he got up quickly moonglum is the fire going well aye elric shell stay in for the night moonglum cocked his head on one side it was unlike elric to make such empty queries but elric said nothing further so the eastlander shrugged turned away to check his gear since he could think of little else to say elric turned and said quietly urgently im a killer and a thief not fit to lord elric i am you are infatuated by a legend that is all no if you feel what i feel then youll know its more you are young old enough beware i must fulfil my destiny your destiny it is no destiny at all but an awful thing called doom and i have no pity except when i see something in my own soul then i have pityand i pity but i hate to look and this is part of the doom which drives me not fate nor the stars nor men nor demons nor gods look at me zaroziniait is elric poor white chosen plaything of the gods of timeelric of melni bone who causes his own gradual and terrible destruc tion it is suicide aye i drive myself to slow death and those who go with me suffer also you speak falsely lord elricfrom guiltmadness because i am guilty lady and does sir moonglum go to doom with you he is unlike othershe is indestructible in his own selfassurance i am confident also lord elric but your confidence is that of youth it is different need i lose it with my youth you have strength you are as strong as we are ill grant you that she opened her arms rising then be reconciled el ric of melnibone and he was he seized her kissing her with a deeper need than that of passion for the first time cymoril of imrryr was forgotten as they lay down together on the soft turf oblivious of moonglum who polished away at his curved sword with wry jealousy they all slept and the fire waned elric in his joy had forgotten or not heeded that he had a watch to take and moonglum who had no source of strength but himself stayed awake for as long as he could but sleep overcame him in the shadows of the awful trees figures moved with shambling caution the misshapen men of org began to creep inwards towards the sleepers then elric opened his eyes aroused by instinct stared at zarozinias peaceful face beside him moved his eyes without turning his head and saw the danger he rolled over grasped stormbringer and tugged the runeblade from its sheath the sword hummed as if in anger at being awakened moonglum danger elric bellowed in fear for he had more to protect than his own life the little mans head jerked up his curved sabre was already across his knees and he jumped to his feet ran towards elric as the men of org closed in i apologise he said my fault i and then the men of org were at them elric and moonglum stood over the girl as she came awake saw the situation and did not scream instead she looked around for a weapon but found none she remained still where she was the only thing to do smelling like offal the gibbering creatures some dozen of them slashed at elric and moonglum with heavy blades like cleavers long and dangerous stormbringer whined and smote through a cleaver cut into a neck and beheaded the owner blood gurgled from the corpse as it slumped back across the fire moonglum ducked beneath a howling cleaver lost his balance fell slashed at his opponents legs and ham strung him so that he collapsed shrieking moonglum stayed on the ground and lunged upwards taking an other in the heart then he sprang to his feet and stood shoulder to shoulder with elric while zarozinia got up behind them the horses grunted elric if its safe try to get them there were still seven natives standing and moon glum groaned as a cleaver sliced flesh from his left arm retaliated pierced the mans throat turned slightly and sheared off anothers face they pressed forward taking the attack to the incensed foe his left hand covered with his own blood moonglum painfully pulled his long poignard from its sheath and held it with his thumb along the handle blocked an opponents swing closed in and killed him with a ripping upward thrust of the dagger the action of which caused his wound to pound with agony elric held his great runesword in both hands and swung it in a semicircle hacking down the howling mis shapen things zarozinia darted towards the horses leaped on to her own and led the other two towards the fighting men elric smote at another and got into his saddle thanking his own forethought to leave the equip ment on the horses in case of danger moonglum quickly joined him and they thundered out of the clearing the saddlebags moonglum called in greater agony than that created by his wound weve left the saddle bags what of it dont press your luck my friend but all our treasures in them elric laughed partly in relief partly from real hu mour well retrieve them friend never fear i know you elric youve no value for the realities but even moonglum was laughing as they left the en raged men of org behind them and slowed to a canter elric reached and hugged zarozinia you have the courage of your noble clan in your veins he said thank you she replied pleased with the compli ment but we cannot match such swordsmanship as that displayed by you and moonglum it was fantastic thank the blade he said shortly no i will thank you i think you place too much re liance upon that hell weapon however powerful it is i need it for what for my own strength and now to give strength to you im no vampire she smiled and need no such fear ful strength as that supplies then be assured that i do he told her gravely you would not love me if the blade did not give me what i need i am like a spineless seathing without it i do not believe that but will not dispute with you now they rode for a while without speaking later they stopped dismounted and zarozinia put herbs that elric had given her upon moonglums wound ed arm and began to bind it elric was thinking deeply the forest rustled with ma cabre sensuous sounds were in the heart of troos he said and our intention to skirt the forest has been forestalled i have it in mind to call on the king of org and so round off our visit moonglum laughed shall we send our swords along first and bind our own hands his pain was already eased by the herbs which were having quick effect i mean it we owe all of us much to the men of org they slew zarozinias uncle and cousins they wounded you and they now have our treasure we have many reasons for asking the king for recompense also they seem stupid and should be easy to trick aye the king will pay us back for our lack of com monsense by tearing our limbs off im in earnest i think we should go ill agree that id like our wealth returned to us but we cannot risk the ladys safety elric i am to be elrics wife moonglum therefore if he visits the king of org i shall come too moonglum lifted an eyebrow a quick courtship she speaks the truth however we shall all go to organd sorcery will protect us from the kings un calledfor wrath and still you wish for death and vengeance elric shrugged moonglum mounting well its all the same to me since your roads whatever else are profitable ones you may be the lord of bad luck by your own reckoning but you bring good luck to me ill say that no more courting death smiled elric but well have some revenge i hope dawn will be with us soon moonglum said the orgian citadel lies six hours ride from here by my work ing southsoutheast by the ancient star if the map i memorised in nadsokor was correct you have an instinct for direction that never fails moonglum every caravan should have such a man as you we base an entire philosophy on the stars in el wher moonglum replied we regard them as the mas ter plan for everything that happens on earth as they revolve around the planet they see all things past present and future they are our gods predictable gods at least said elric and they rode off towards org with light hearts considering the enor mity of their risk two little was known of the tiny kingdom of org save that the forest of troos lay within its boundaries and to that other nations felt it was welcome the people were unpleasant to look upon for the most part and their bodies were stunted and strangely altered legend had it that they were the descendants of the doomed folk their rulers it was said were shaped like normal men in so far as their outward bodily appearance went but their minds were warped more horribly than the limbs of their subjects the inhabitants were few and were generally scat tered ruled by their king from his citadel which was also called org it was for this citadel that elric and his companions rode and as they did so elric explained how he planned to protect them all from the natives of org in the forest he had found a particular leaf which when used with certain invocations which were harmless in that the invoker was in little danger of being harmed by the spirits he marshalled would invest that person and anyone else to whom he gave the drug distilled from the leaf with temporary invulnerability the spell somehow reknitted the skin and flesh struc ture so that it could withstand any edge and almost any blow elric explained in a rare garrulous mood how the drug and spell combined to achieve the effect but his archaicisms and esoteric words meant little to the other two they stopped an hours ride from where moonglum expected to find the citadel so that elric could prepare the drug and invoke the spell he worked swiftly over a small fire using an al chemists pestle and mortar mixing the shredded leaf with a little water as the brew bubbled on the fire he drew peculiar runes on the ground some of which were twisted into such alien forms that they seemed to disap pear into a different dimension and reappear beyond it bone and blood and flesh and sinew spell and spirit bind anew potent potion work the life charm keep its takers safe from harm so elric chanted as a small pink cloud formed in the air over the fire wavered reformed into a spiral shape which curled downwards into the bowl the brew splut tered and then was still the albino sorcerer said an old boyhood spell so simple that id near forgotten it the leaf for the potion grows only in troos and there fore it is rarely possible to perform the brew which had been liquid had now solidified and elric broke it into small pellets too much he warned taken at one time is poison and yet the effect can last for several hours not always though but we must accept that small risk he handed both of them a pellet which they received dubiously swallow them just before we reach the citadel he told them or in the event of the men of org finding us first then they mounted and rode on again some miles to the southeast of troos a blind man sang a grim song in his sleep and so woke himself they reached the brooding citadel of org at dusk guttural voices shouted at them from the battlements of the squarecut ancient dwelling place of the kings of org the thick rock oozed moisture and was corroded by lichen and sickly mottled moss the only entrance large enough for a mounted man to pass through was reached by a path almost a foot deep in evilsmelling black mud whats your business at the royal court of gutheran the mighty they could not see who asked the question we seek hospitality and an audience with your liege called moonglum cheerfully successfully hiding his nervousness we bring important news to org a twisted face peered down from the battlements enter strangers and be welcome it said unwelcom ingly the heavy wooden drawgate shifted upwards to allow them entrance and the horses pushed their way slowly through the mud and so into the courtyard of the cita del overhead the grey sky was a racing field of black tat tered clouds which streamed towards the horizon as if to escape the horrid boundaries of org and the disgusting forest of troos the courtyard was covered though not so deeply with the same foul mud as had unpaired their progress to the citadel it was full of heavy unmoving shadow on elrics right a flight of steps went up to an arched entrance which was hung partially with the same unhealthy lichen he had seen on the outer walls and also in the forest of troos through this archway brushing at the lichen with a pale beringed hand a tall man came and stood on the top step regarding the visitors through heavylidded eyes he was in contrast to the others handsome with a massive leonine head and long hair as white as elrics although the hair on the head of this great solid man was somewhat dirty tangled unbrushed he was dressed in a heavy jerkin of quilted embossed leather a yellow kit which reached to his ankles and he carried a wide bladed dagger naked in his belt he was older than el ric aged between forty and fifty and his powerful if somewhat decadent face was seamed and pockmarked he stared at them in silence and did not welcome them instead he signed to one of the battlement guards who caused the drawgate to be lowered it came down with a crash blocking off their way of escape kill the men and keep the woman said the massive man in a low monotone elric had heard dead men speak in that manner as planned elric and moonglum stood either side of zarozinia and remained where they were arms folded puzzled shambling creatures came warily at them their loose trousers dragging in the mud their hands hidden by the long shapeless sleeves of their filthy gar ments they swung their cleavers elric felt a faint shock as the blade thudded on to his arm but that was all moonglums experience was similar the men fell back amazement and confusion on their bestial faces the tall mans eyes widened he put one ringcovered hand to his thick lips chewing at a nail our swords have no effect upon them king they do not cut and they do not bleed what are these folk elric laughed theatrically we are not common folk little human be assured we are the messengers of the gods and come to your king with a message from our great masters do not worry we shall not harm you since we are in no danger of being harmed stand aside and make us welcome elric could see that king gutheran was puzzled and not absolutely taken in by his words elric cursed to himself he had measured their intelligence by those he had seen this king mad or not was much more intelli gent was going to be harder to deceive he led the way up the steps towards glowering gutheran greetings king gutheran the gods have at last returned to org and wish you to know this org has had no gods to worship for an eternity said gutheran hollowly turning back into the citadel why should we accept them now you are impertinent king and you are audacious how do i know you come from the gods he walked ahead of them leading them through the lowroofed halls you saw that the swords of your subjects had no ef fect upon us true ill take that incident as proof for the mo ment i suppose there must be a banquet in your honouri shall order it be welcome messengers his words were ungracious but it was virtually impossible to detect anything from gutherans tone since the mans voice stayed at the same pitch elric pushed his heavy riding cloak back from his shoulders and said lightly we shall mention your kindness to our masters the court was a place of gloomy halls and false laughter and although elric put many questions to gutheran the king would not answer them or did so by means of ambiguous phrases which meant nothing they were not given chambers wherein they could re fresh themselves but instead stood about for several hours in the main hall of the citadel and gutheran while he was with them and not giving orders for the banquet sat slumped on his throne and chewed at bis nails ignoring them pleasant hospitality whispered moonglum elrichow long will the effects of the drug last zarozinia had remained close to him he put his arm around her shoulders i do not know not much long er but it has served its purpose i doubt if they will try to attack us a second time however beware of other at tempts subtler ones upon our lives the main hall which had a higher roof than the oth ers and was completely surrounded by a gallery which ran around it well above the floor fairly close to the room was chilly and unwarmed no fires burned in the several hearths which were open and let into the floor and the walls dripped moisture and were undecorated damp solid stone timeworn and gaunt there were not even rushes upon the floor which was strewn with old bones and pieces of decaying food hardly houseproud are they commented moon glum looking around him with distaste and glancing at brooding gutheran who was seemingly oblivious of their presence a servitor shambled into the hall and whispered a few words to the king he nodded and arose leaving the great hall soon men came in carrying benches and tables and began to place them about the hall the banquet was at last due to commence and the air had menace in it the three visitors sat together on the right of the king who had donned a richly jewelled chain of king ship whilst his son and several palefaced female mem bers of the royal line sat on the left unspeaking even among themselves prince hurd a sullenfaced youth who seemed to bear a resentment against his father picked at the unappetis ing food which was served them all he drank heavily of the wine which had little flavour but was strong fiery stuff and this seemed to warm the company a little and what do the gods want of us poor folk of org hurd said staring hard at zarozinia with more than friendly interest elric answered they ask nothing of you but your recognition in return they will on occasions help you that is all hurd laughed that is more than those from the hill can offer eh father gutheran turned his great head slowly to regard his son yes he murmured and the word seemed to carry warning moonglum said the hillwhat is that he got no reply instead a highpitched laugh came from the entrance to the great hall a thin gaunt man stood there staring ahead with a fixed gaze his features though emaciated strongly resembled gutherans he carried a stringed instrument and plucked at the gut so that it wailed and moaned with melancholy insistence kurd said savagely look father tis blind veerkad the minstrel your brother shall he sing for us sing shall he sing his songs father gutherans mouth trembled and twisted and he said after a moment he may entertain our guests with an heroic ballad if he wishes but but certain other songs he shall not sing kurd grinned maliciously he seemed to be tormenting his fa ther deliberately in some way which elric could not guess kurd shouted at the blind man come uncle veerkadsing there are strangers present said veerkad hollowly above the wail of his own music strangers in org hurd giggled and drank more wine gutheran scowled and continued to tremble gnawing at his nails elric called wed appreciate a song minstrel then youll have the song of the three kings in darkness strangers and hear the ghastly story of the kings of org no shouted gutheran leaping from his place but veerkad was already singing three kings in darkness lie gutheran of org and i under a bleak and sunless sky the third beneath the hill when shall the third arise only when another dies stop gutheran got up in an obviously insane rage and stumbled across the table trembling in terror his face blanched striking at the blind man his brother two blows and the minstrel fell slumping to the floor and not moving take him out do not let him enter again the king shrieked and foam flecked his lips hurd sober for a moment jumped across the table scattering dishes and cups and took his fathers arm be calm father i have a new plan for our entertain ment you you seek my throne twas you who goaded veerkad to sing his dreadful song you know i cannot listen without he stared at the door one day the legend shall be realised and the hillking shall come then shall i you and org perish father hurd was smiling horribly let the female visitor dance for us a dance of the gods what let the woman dance for us father elric heard him by now the drug must have worn off he could not afford to show his hand by offering his companions further doses he got to his feet what sacrilege do you speak prince we have given you entertainment it is the custom in org for our visitors to give us entertainment also the hall was filled with menace elric regretted his plan to trick the men of org but there was nothing he could do he had intended to exact tribute from them in the name of the gods but obviously these mad men feared more immediate and tangible dangers than any the gods might represent he had made a mistake put the lives of his friends in danger as well as his own what should he do zarozinia murmured i have learned dances in ilmiora where all ladies are taught the art let me dance for them it might placate them and bedazzle them to make our work easier arioch knows our work is hard enough now i was a fool to have conceived this plan very well zarozinia dance for them but with caution he shouted at hurd our companion will dance for you to show you the beauty that the gods create then you must pay the tribute for our masters grow impatient the tribute gutheran looked up you mentioned nothing of tribute your recognition of the gods must take the form of precious stones and metals king gutheran i thought you to understand that you seem more like common thieves than uncom mon messengers my friends we are poor in org and have nothing to give away to charlatans beware of your words king elrics clear voice echoed warningly through the hall well see the dance and then judge the truth of what youve told us elric seated himself grasped zarozinias hand beneath the table as she arose giving her comfort she walked gracefully and confidently into the centre of the hall and there began to dance elric who loved her was amazed at her splendid grace and artistry she danced the old beautiful dances of ilmiora entrancing even the thickskulled men of org and as she danced a great golden guest cup was brought in kurd leaned across his father and said to elric the guest cup lord it is our custom that our guests drink from it in friendship elric nodded annoyed at being disturbed in his watching of the wonderful dance his eyes fixed on zaro zinia as she postured and glided there was silence in the hall kurd handed him the cup and absently he put it to his lips seeing this zarozinia danced on to the table and began to weave along it to where elric sat as he took the first sip zarozinia cried out and with her foot knocked the cup from his hand the wine splashed on to gutheran and hurd who half rose startled it was drugged elric they drugged it hurd lashed at her with his hand striking her across the face she fell from the table and lay moaning slightly on the filthy floor bitch would the messengers of the gods be harmed by a little drugged wine enraged elric pushed aside gutheran and struck sav agely at hurd so that the young mans mouth gushed blood but the drug was already having effect gutheran shouted something and moonglum drew his sabre glanc ing upwards elric was swaying his senses were jumbled and the scene had an unreal quality he saw servants grasp zarozinia but could not see how moonglum was faring he felt sick and dizzy could hardly control his limbs summoning up his last remaining strength elric dubbed hurd down with one tremendous blow then he collapsed into unconsciousness three there was the cold clutch of chains about his wrists and a thin drizzle was falling directly on to his face which stung where hurds nails had ripped it he looked about him he was chained between two stone menhirs upon an obvious burial barrow of gigan tic size it was night and a pale moon hovered in the heavens above him he looked down at the group of men below hurd and gutheran were among them they grinned at him mockingly farewell messenger you will serve us a good pur pose and placate the ones from the hill hurd called as he and the others scurried back towards the citadel which lay silhouetted a short distance away where was he what had happened to zaroziniaand moonglum why had he been chained thus uponreal isation and remembrance camethe hill he shuddered helpless in the strong chains which held him desperately he began to tug at them but they would not yield he searched his brain for a plan but he was confused by torment and worry for his friends safety he heard a dreadful scuttling sound from below and saw a ghastly white shape dart into the gloom wildly he struggled in the rattling iron which held him in the great hall of the citadel a riotous celebration was now reaching the state of an ecstatic orgy gutheran and hurd were totally drunk laughing insanely at their victory outside the hall veerkad listened and hated particu larly he hated his brother the man who had deposed and blinded him to prevent his study of sorcery by means of which he had planned to raise the king from beneath the hill the time has come at last he whispered to himself and stopped a passing servant tell mewhere is the girl kept in gutherans chamber master veerkad released the man and began to grope his way through the gloomy corridors up twisting steps until he reached the room he sought here he produced a key one of many hed had made without gutherans know ing and unlocked the door zarozinia saw the blind man enter and could do noth ing she was gagged and bound with her own dress and still dazed from the blow hurd had given her they had told her of elrics fate but moonglum had so far es caped them guards hunted him now in the stinking cor ridors of org ive come to take you to your companion lady smiled blind veerkad grasping her roughly with strength that his insanity had given him picked her up and fumbled his way towards the door he knew the passages of org perfectly for he had been born and grown up among them but two men were in the corridor outside gutherans chambers one of them was hurd prince of org who resented his fathers appropriation of the girl and desired her for himself he saw veerkad bearing the girl away and stood silent while his uncle passed the other man was moonglum who observed what was happening from the shadows where he had hidden from the searching guards as hurd followed veerkad on cautious feet moonglum followed him veerkad went out of the citadel by a small side door and carried his living burden towards the looming burial hill all about the foot of the monstrous barrow swarmed the leprouswhite ghouls who sensed the presence of el ric the folk of orgs sacrifice to them now elric understood these were the things that org feared more than the gods these were the livingdead ancestors of those who now revelled in the great hall perhaps these were actu ally the doomed folk was that their doom never to rest never to die just to degenerate into mindless ghouls elric shuddered now desperation brought back his memory his voice was an agonised wail to the brooding sky and the puls ing earth arioch destroy the stones save your servant ari ochmasteraid me it was not enough the ghouls gathered together and began to scuttle gibbering up the barrow towards the helpless albino arioch these are the things that would forsake your memory aid me to destroy them the earth trembled and the sky became overcast hid ing the moon but not the whitefaced bloodless ghouls who were now almost upon him and then a ball of fire formed in the sky above him and the very sky seemed to shake and sway around it then with a roaring crash two bolts of lightning slashed down pulverising the stones and releasing elric he got to his feet knowing that arioch would de mand his price as the first ghouls reached him he did not retreat but in his rage and desperation leapt among them smashing and flailing with the lengths of chain the ghouls fell back and fled gibber ing in fear and anger down the hill and into the bar row elric could now see that there was a gaping entrance to the barrow below him black against the blackness breathing heavily he found that his belt pouch had been left him from it he took a length of slim gold wire and began frantically to pick at the locks of the manacles veerkad chuckled to himself and zarozinia hearing him was almost mad with terror he kept drooling the words into her ear when shall the third arise only when other dies when that others blood flows red well hear the footfalls of the dead you and i we shall resurrect him and such vengeance will he wreak upon my cursed brother your blood my dear it will be that released him he felt that the ghouls were gone and judged them placated by their feast your lover has been useful to me he laughed as he began to enter the barrow the smell of death almost overpowered the girl as the blind madman bore her downwards into the heart of the hill hurd sobered after his walk in the colder air was horrified when he saw where veerkad was going the barrow the hill of the king was the most feared spot in the land of org hurd paused before the black en trance and turned to run then suddenly he saw the form of elric looming huge and bloody descending the barrow slope cutting off his escape with a wild yell he fled into the hill passage elric had not previously noticed the prince but the yell startled him and he tried to see who had given it but was too late he began to run down the steep in cline towards the entrance of the barrow another figure came scampering out of the darkness elric thank the stars and all the gods of earth you live thank arioch moonglum wheres zarozinia in therethe mad minstrel took her with him and hurd followed they are all insane these kings and princes i see no sense to their actions i have an idea that the minstrel means zarozinia no good quickly we must follow by the stars the stench of death i have breathed nothing like itnot even at the great battle of the esh mir valley where the armies of elwher met those of ka leg vogun usurper prince of the tanghensi and half a million corpses strewed the valley from end to end if youve no stomach i wish i had none it would not be so bad come they rushed into the passage led by the far away sounds of veerkads maniacal laughter and the some what nearer movements of a fearmaddened kurd who was now trapped between two enemies and yet more afraid of a third hurd blundered along in the blackness sobbing to himself in his terror in the phosphorescent central tomb surrounded by the mummified corpses of his ancestors veerkad chanted the resurrection ritual before the great coffin of the hillkinga giant thing half as tall again as veer kad who was tall enough veerkad was forgetful for his own safety and thinking only of vengeance upon his brother gutheran he held a long dagger over zarozinia who lay huddled and terrified upon the ground near the coffin the spilling of zarozinias blood would be the culmi nation of the ritual and then then hell would quite literally be let loose or so veerkad planned he finished his chanting and raised the knife just as hurd came screeching into the central tomb with his own sword drawn veerkad swung round his blind face working in thwarted rage savagely without stopping for a moment hurd ran his sword into veerkads body plunging the blade in up to the hilt so that its bloody point appeared sticking from his back but the other in his groaning death spasms locked his hands about the princes throat locked them immovably somehow the two men retained a semblance of life and struggling with each other in a macabre death dance swayed about the glowing chamber the coffin of the hillking began to tremble and shake slightly the movement hardly perceptible so elric and moonglum found veerkad and hurd seeing that both were near dead elric raced across the central tomb to where zarozinia lay unconscious mer cifully from her ordeal elric picked her up and made to return he glanced at the throbbing coffin quickly moonglum that blind fool has invoked the dead i can tell hurry my friend before the hosts of hell are upon us moonglum gasped and followed elric as he ran back towards the cleaner air of night where to now elric well have to risk going back to the citadel our horses are there and our goods we need the horses to take us quickly away for i fear theres going to be a ter rible bloodletting soon if my instinct is right there should not be too much opposition elric they were all drunk when i left that was how i man aged to evade them so easily by now if they continued drinking as heavily as when last i saw them theyll be unable to move at all then lets make haste the left the hill behind them and began to run towards the citadel four moonglum had spoken truth everyone was lying about the great hall in drunken sleep open fires had been lit in the hearths and they blazed sending shadows skip ping around the hall elric said softly moonglum go with zarozinia to the stables and prepare our horses i will settle our debt with gutheran first he pointed see they have heaped their booty upon the table gloating in their apparent victory stormbringer lay upon a pile of burst sacks and sad dlebags which contained the loot stolen from zarozinias uncle and cousins and from elric and moonglum zarozinia now conscious but confused left with moonglum to locate the stables and elric picked his way towards the table across the sprawled shapes of drunken men of org around the blazing fires and caught up thankfully his hellforged runeblade then he leaped over the table and was about to grasp gutheran who still had his fabulously gemmed chain of kingship around his neck when the great doors of the hall crashed open and a howling blast of icy air sent the torches dancing and leaping elric turned gutheran forgotten and his eyes widened framed in the doorway stood the king from beneath the hill the longdead monarch had been raised by veerkad whose own blood had completed the work of resur rection he stood in rotting robes his fleshless bones covered by tight tattered skin his heart did not beat for he had none he drew no breath for his lungs had been eaten by the creatures which feasted on such things but horribly he lived the king from the hill he had been the last great ruler of the doomed folk who had in their fury destroyed half the earth and created the forest of troos behind the dead king crowded the ghastly hosts who had been buried with him in a legendary past the massacre began what secret vengeance was being reaped elric could only guess atbut whatever the reason the danger was still very real elric pulled out stormbringer as the awakened horde vented their anger upon the living the hall became filled with the shrieking horrified screams of the unfor tunate orgians elric remained halfparalysed in his horror beside the throne aroused gutheran woke up and saw the king from the hill and his host he screamed almost thankfully at last i can rest and fell dying in a seizure robbing elric of his ven geance veerkads grim song echoed in elrics memory the three kings in darknessgutheran veerkad and the king from beneath the hill now only the last lived and he had been dead for millennia the kings cold dead eyes roved the hall and saw gutheran sprawled upon his throne the ancient chain of office still about his throat elric wrenched it off the body and backed away as the king from beneath the hill advanced and then his back was against a pillar and there were feasting ghouls everywhere else the dead king came nearer and then with a whis tling moan which came from the depths of his decay ing body launched himself at elric who found himself fighting desperately against the hillkings clawing abnormal strength cutting at flesh that neither bled nor suffered pain even the sorcerous runeblade could do nothing against this horror that had no soul to take and no blood to let frantically elric slashed and hacked at the hillking but ragged nails raked his flesh and teeth snapped at his throat and above everything came the almost overpow ering stench of death as the ghouls packing the great hall with their horrible shapes feasted on the living and the dead then elric heard moonglums voice calling and saw him upon the gallery which ran around the hall he held a great oil jar lure him close to the central fire elric there may be a way to vanquish him quickly man or youre fin ished in a frantic burst of energy the melnibonean forced the giant king towards the flames around them the ghouls fed off the remains of their victims some of whom still lived their screams calling hopelessly over the sound of carnage the hillking now stood unfeeling with his back to the leaping central fire he still slashed at elric moon glum hurled the jar it shattered upon the stone hearth spraying the king with blazing oil he staggered and elric struck with his full power the man and the blade combining to push the hillking backwards down went the king into the flames and the flames began to devour him a dreadful lost howling came from the burning giant as he perished flames licked everywhere throughout the great hall and soon the place was like hell itself an inferno of licking fire through which the ghouls ran about still feasting unaware of their destruction the way to the door was blocked elric stared around him and saw no way of escape save one sheathing stormbringer he ran a few paces and leaped upwards just grasping the rail of the gallery as flames engulfed the spot where he had been standing moonglum reached down and helped him to clamber across the rail im disappointed elric he grinned you forgot to bring the treasure elric showed him what he grasped in his left hand the jewelencrusted chain of kingship this bauble is some reward for our hardships he smiled holding up the glittering chain i stole nothing by arioch there are no kings left in org to wear it come lets join zarozinia and get our horses they ran from the gallery as masonry began to crash downwards into the great hall they rode fast away from the halls of org and look ing back saw great fissures appear in the walls and heard the roar of destruction as the flames consumed every thing that had been org they destroyed the seat of the monarchy the remains of the three kings in darkness the present and the past nothing would be left of org save an empty burial mound and two corpses locked to gether lying where their ancestors had lain for centuries in the central tomb they destroyed the last link with the previous age and cleansed the earth of an ancient evil only the dreadful forest of troos remained to mark the coming and the passing of the doomed folk and the forest of troos was a warning weary and yet relieved the three saw the outlines of troos in the distance behind the blazing funeral pyre and yet in his happiness elric had a fresh problem on his mind now that danger was past why do you frown now love asked zarozinia because i think you spoke the truth remember you said i placed too much reliance on my runeblade here yesand i said i would not dispute with you agreed but i have a feeling that you were partially right on the burial mound and in it i did not have stormbringer with meand yet i fought and won be cause i feared for your safety his voice was quiet perhaps in tune i can keep my strength by means of certain herbs i found in troos and dispense with the blade for ever moonglum shouted with laughter hearing these words elrici never thought id witness this you daring to think of dispensing with that foul weapon of yours i dont know if you ever shall but the thought is comfort ing it is my friend it is he leaned in his saddle and grasped zarozinias shoulders pulling her dangerously towards him as they galloped without slackening speed and as they rode he kissed her heedless of their pace a new beginning he shouted above the wind a new beginning my love and then they all rode laughing towards karlaak by the weeping waste to present themselves to enrich themselves and to attend the strangest wedding the northern lands had ever witnessed book three the flamebringers in which moonglum returns from the east lands with disturbing news one bloodybeaked hawks soared on the frigid wind they soared high above a mounted horde inexorably moving across the weeping waste the horde had crossed two deserts and three moun tain ranges to be there and hunger drove them onwards they were spurred on by remembrances of stories heard from travellers who had come to their eastern home land by the encouragements of their thinlipped leader who swaggered in his saddle ahead of them one arm wrapped around a tenfoot lance decorated with the gory trophies of bis pillaging campaigns the riders moved slowly and wearily unaware that they were nearing their goal far behind the horde a stocky rider left elwher the singing boisterous capital of the eastern world and came soon to a valley the hard skeletons of trees had a blighted look and the horse kicked earth the colour of ashes as its rider drove it fiercely through the sick wasteland that had once been gentle eshmir the golden garden of the east a plague had smitten eshmir and the locust had stripped her of her beauty both plague and locust went by the same nameterarn gashtek lord of the mount ed hordes sunkenfaced carrier of destruction terarn gashtek insane blooddrawer the shrieking flame bringer and that was his other nameflame bringer the rider who witnessed the evil that terarn gashtek had brought to gentle eshmir was named moonglum moonglum was riding now for karlaak by the weeping waste the last outpost of the western civilisation of which those in the eastlands knew little in karlaak moonglum knew he would find elric of melnibone who now dwelt permanently in his wifes graceful city moon glum was desperate to reach karlaak quickly to warn elric and to solicit his help he was small and cocky with a broad mouth and a shock of red hair but now his mouth did not grin and his body was bent over the horse as he pushed it on towards karlaak for eshmir gentle eshmir had been moonglums home province and with his ancestors had formed him into what he was so cursing moonglum rode for karlaak but so did terarn gashtek and already the flame bringer had reached the weeping waste the horde moved slowly for they had wagons with them which had at one time dropped far behind but now the supplies they carried were needed as well as provisions one of the wagons carried a bound prisoner who lay on his back cursing terarn gashtek and his slanteyed battle mongers drinij bara was bound by more than strips of leather that was why he cursed for drinij bara was a sorcerer who could not normally be held in such a manner if he had not succumbed to his weakness for wine and women just before the flame bringer had come down on the town in which he was staying he would not have been trussed so and terarn gashtek would not now have drinij baras soul drinij baras soul reposed in the body of a small black catthe cat which terarn gashtek had caught and carried with him always for as was the habit of eastern sorcerers drinij bara had hidden his soul in the body of the cat for protection because of this he was now slave to the lord of the mounted hordes and had to obey him lest the man slay the cat and so send his soul to hell it was not a pleasant situation for the proud sorcerer but he did not deserve less there was on the pale face of elric of melnibone some slight trace of an earlier haunting but his mouth smiled and his crimson eyes were at peace as he looked down at the young blackhaired woman with whom he walked in the terraced gardens of karlaak elric said zarozinia have you found your hap piness he nodded i think so stormbringer now hangs amid cobwebs in your fathers armoury the drugs i dis covered in troos keep me strong my eyesight clear and need to be taken only occasionally i need never think of travelling or fighting again i am content here to spend my time with you and study the books in kar laaks library what more would i require you compliment me overmuch my lord i would be come complacent he laughed rather that than you were doubting do not fear zarozinia i possess no reason now to jour ney on moonglum i miss but it was natural that he should become restless of residence in a city and wish to revisit his homeland i am glad you are at peace elric my father was at first reluctant to let you live here fearing the black evil that once accompanied you but three months have proved to him that the evil has gone and left no fuming berserker behind it suddenly there came a shouting from below them in the street a mans voice was raised and he banged at the gates of the house let me in damn you i must speak with your mas ter a servant came running lord elricthere is a man at the gates with a message he pretends friendship with you his name an alien onemoonglum he says moonglum his stay in elwher has been short let him in zarozinias eyes held a trace of fear and she held el rics arm fiercely elricpray he does not bring news to take you hence no news could do that fear not zarozinia he hur ried out of the garden and into the courtyard of the house moonglum rode hurriedly through the gates dismounting as he did so moonglum my friend why the haste naturally i am pleased to see you after such a short time but you have been riding hastilywhy the little eastlanders face was grim beneath its coating of dust and his clothes were filthy from hard rid ing the flame bringer comes with sorcery to aid him he panted you must warn the city the flame bringer the name means nothingyou sound delirious my friend aye thats true i am delirious with hate he destroyed my homeland killed my family my friends and now plans conquests in the west two years ago he was little more than an ordinary desert raider but then he began to gather a great horde of barbarians around him and has been looting and slaying his way across the eastern lands only elwher has not suffered from his at tacks for the city was too great for even him to take but he has turned two thousand miles of pleasant coun try into a burning waste he plans world conquest rides westwards with five hundred thousand warriors you mentioned sorcerywhat does this barbarian know of such sophisticated arts little himself but he has one of our greatest wizards in his powerdrinij bara the man was captured as he lay drunk between two wenches in a tavern in phum he had put his soul into the body of a cat so that no rival sorcerer might steal it while he slept but terarn gashtek the flame bringer knew of this trick seized the cat and bound its legs eyes and mouth so imprison ing drinij baras evil soul now the sorcerer is his slaveif he does not obey the barbarian the cat will be killed by an iron blade and drinij baras soul will go to hell these are unfamiliar sorceries to me said elric they seem little more than superstitions who knows that they may bebut so long as drinij bara believes what he believes he will do as terarn gashtek dictates several proud cities have been de stroyed with the aid of his magic how far away is this flame bringer three days ride at most i was forced to come hence by a longer route to avoid his outriders then we must prepare for a siege no elricyou must prepare to flee to fleeshould i request the citizens of karlaak to leave their beautiful city unprotected to leave their homes if they will notyou must and take your bride with you none can stand against such a foe my own sorcery is no mean thing but one mans sorcery is not enough to hold back half a million men also aided by sorcery and karlaak is a trading citynot a warriors fortress very well i will speak to the council of elders and try to convince them you must convince them quickly elric for if you do not karlaak will not stand half a day before terarn gashteks howling bloodletters they are stubborn said elric as the two sat in his private study later that night they refuse to realise the magnitude of the danger they refuse to leave and i cannot leave them for they have welcomed me and made me a citizen of karlaak then we must stay here and die perhaps there seems to be no choice but i have an other plan you say that this sorcerer is a prisoner of terarn gashtek what would he do if he regained his soul why he would take vengeance upon his captor but terarn gashtek would not be so foolish as to give him the chance there is no help for us there what if we managed to aid drinij bara how it would be impossible it seems our only chance does this barbarian know of me or my history not as far as i know would he recognise you why should he then i suggest we join him join himelric you are no more sane than when we rode as free travellers together i know what i am doing it would be the only way to get close to him and discover a subtle way to defeat him we will set off at dawn there is no time to waste very well lets hope your old luck is good but i doubt it now for youve forsaken your old ways and the luck went with them let us find out will you take stormbringer i had hoped never to have to make use of that hell forged blade again shes a treacherous sword at best ayebut i think youll need her in this business yes youre right ill take her elric frowned his hands clenched it will mean breaking my word to zarozinia better break itthan give her up to the mounted hordes elric unlocked the door to the armoury a pitch torch flaring in one hand he felt sick as he strode down the narrow passage lined with dulled weapons which had not been used for a century his heart pounded heavily as he came to another door and flung off the bar to enter the little room in which lay the disused regalia of karlaaks longdead war chieftainsand stormbringer the black blade be gan to moan as if welcoming him as he took a deep breath of the musty air and reached for the sword he clutched the hilt and his body was racked by an unholy sensation of awful ecstasy his face twisted as he sheathed the blade and he almost ran from the armoury towards cleaner air elric and moonglum mounted their plainly equipped horses and garbed like common mercenaries bade ur gent farewell to the councillors of karlaak zarozinia kissed elrics pale hand i realise the need for this she said her eyes full of tears but take care my love i shall and pray that we are successful in whatever we decide to do the white gods be with you nopray to the lords of the darks for it is their evil help ill need in this work and forget not my words to the messenger who is to ride to the southwest and find dyvim slorm ill not forget she said though i worry lest you succumb again to your old black ways fear for the momentill worry about my own fate later then farewell my lord and be lucky farewell zarozinia my love for you will give me more power even than this foul blade here he spurred his horse through the gates and then they were riding for the weeping waste and a troubled future two dwarfed by the vastness of the softly turfed plateau which was the weeping waste the place of eternal rains the two horsemen drove their hardpressed steeds through the drizzle a shivering desert warrior huddled against the weather saw them come towards him he stared through the rain trying to make out details of the riders then wheeled his stocky pony and rode swiftly back in the direction he had come within minutes he had reached a larger group of warriors attired like himself in furs and tasselled iron helmets they carried short bone bows and quivers of long arrows fletched with hawk feathers there were curved scimitars at their sides he exchanged a few words with his fellows and soon they were all lashing their horses towards the two riders how much further lies the camp of terarn gashtek moonglum elrics words were breathless for both men had ridden for a day without halt not much further elric we should belook moonglum pointed ahead about ten riders came swiftly towards them desert barbariansthe flame bringers men prepare for a fightthey wont waste time parleying stormbringer scraped from the scabbard and the heavy blade seemed to aid elrics wrist as he raised it so that it felt almost weightless moonglum drew both his swords holding the short one with the same hand with which he grasped his horses reins the eastern warriors spread out in a half circle as they rode down on the companions yelling wild war shouts elric reared his mount to a savage standstill and met the first rider with stormbringers point full in the mans throat there was a stink like brimstone as it pierced flesh and the warrior drew a ghastly choking breath as he died his eyes staring out in full realisation of his terrible fatefor stormbringer drank souls as well as blood elric cut savagely at another desertman lopping off his sword arm and splitting his crested helmet and the skull beneath rain and sweat ran down his white taut features and into his glowing crimson eyes but he blinked it aside halffell in his saddle as he turned to defend himself against another howling scimitar parried the sweep slid his own runeblade down its length turned the blade with a movement of his wrist and disarmed the warrior then he plunged his sword into the mans heart and the desert warrior yelled like a wolf at the moon a long baying shout before stormbringer took his soul elrics face was twisted in selfloathing as he fought intently with superhuman strength moonglum stayed clear of the albinos sword for he knew its liking for the lives of elrics friends soon only one opponent was left elric disarmed him and had to hold his own greedy sword back from the mans throat reconciled to the horror of his death the man said something in a guttural tongue which elric halfrecog nised he searched his memory and realised that it was a language close to one of the many ancient tongues which as a sorcerer he had been required to learn years before he said in the same language thou art one of the warriors of terarn gashtek the flame bringer that is true and you must be the whitefaced evil one of legends i beg you to slay me with a cleaner weapon than that which you hold i do not wish to kill thee at all we were coming hence to join terarn gashtek take us to him the man nodded hastily and clambered back on his horse who are you who speaks the high tongue of our people i am called elric of melnibonedost thou know the name the warrior shook his head no but the high tongue has not been spoken for generations save by shamansyet youre no shaman but by your dress seem a warrior we are both mercenaries but speak no more i will explain the rest to thy leader they left a jackals feast behind them and followed the quaking easterner in the direction he led them fairly soon the lowlying smoke of many campfires could be observed and at length they saw the sprawling camp of the barbarian war lords mighty army the camp encompassed over a mile of the great plateau the barbarians had erected skin tents on rounded frames and the camp had the aspect of a large primitive town roughly in the centre was a much larger construction decorated with a motley assortment of gaudy silks and brocades moonglum said in the western tongue that must be terarn gashteks dwelling see he has covered its halfcured hides with a score of eastern battleflags his face grew grimmer as he noted the torn standard of esh mir the lionflag of okara and the bloodsoaked pen nants of sorrowing changshai the captured warrior led them through the squatting ranks of barbarians who stared at them impassively and muttered to one another outside terarn gashteks tasteless dwelling was his great warlance decorated with more trophies of his conqueststhe skulls and bones of eastern princes and kings elric said such a one as this must not be allowed to destroy the reborn civilisation of the young kingdoms young kingdoms are resilient remarked moonglum but it is when they are old that they falland it is of ten terarn gashteks kind that tear them down while i live he shall not destroy karlaaknor reach as far as bakshaan moonglum said though in my opinion hed be welcome to nadsokor the city of beggars deserves such visitors as the flame bringer if we fail elric only the sea will stop himand perhaps not that with dyvim slorms aidwe shall stop him let us hope karlaaks messenger finds my kinsman soon if he does not we shall be hard put to fight off half a million warriors my friend the barbarian shouted oh conquerormighty flame bringerthere are men here who wish to speak with you a slurred voice snarled bring them in they entered the badly smelling tent which was lighted by a fire flickering in a circle of stones a gaunt man carelessly dressed in bright captured clothing lounged on a wooden bench there were several women in the tent one of whom poured wine into a heavy golden goblet which he held out terarn gashtek pushed the woman aside knocking her sprawling and regarded the newcomers his face was almost as fleshless as the skulls hanging outside his tent his cheeks were sunken and his slanting eyes narrow beneath thick brows who are these lord i know notbut between them they slew ten of our men and would have slain me you deserved no more than death if you let yourself be disarmed get outand find a new sword quickly or ill let the shamans have your vitals for divination the man slunk away terarn gashtek seated himself upon the bench once more so you slew ten of my bloodletters did yon and came here to boast to me about it whats the explana tion we but defended ourselves against your warriorswe sought no quarrel with them elric now spoke the cruder tongue as best he could you defended yourselves fairly well i grant you we reckon three softliving housedwellers to one of us you are a westerner i can tell that though your silent friend has the face of an elwherite have you come from the east or the west the west elric said we are free travelling war riors hiring our swords to those wholl pay or promise us good booty are all western warriors as skilful as you terarn gashtek could not hide his sudden realisation that he might have underestimated the men he hoped to con quer we are a little better than most lied moonglum but not much what of sorceryis there much strong magic here no said elric the art has been lost to most the barbarians thin mouth twisted into a grin half of relief half of triumph he nodded his head reached into his gaudy silks and produced a small black and white bound cat he began to stroke its back it wriggled but could do no more than hiss at its captor then we need not worry he said now why did you come here i could have you tor tured for days for what you did slaying ten of my best outriders we recognised the chance of enriching ourselves by aiding you lord flame bringer said elric we could show you the richest towns lead you to illdefended cit ies that would take little time to fall will you enlist us ive need of such men as you true enough ill enlist you readilybut mark this ill not trust you until youve proved loyal to me find yourselves quarters nowand come to the feast tonight there ill be able to show you something of the power i holdthe power which will smash the strength of the west and lay it waste for ten thousand miles thanks said elric ill look forward to tonight they left the tent and wandered through the haphaz ard collection of tents and cooking fires wagons and ani mals there seemed little food but wine was in abun dance and the taut hungry stomachs of the barbarians were placated with that they stopped a warrior and told him of terarn gashteks orders to them the warrior sullenly led them to a tent hereit was shared by three of the men you slew it is yours by right of battle as are the weapons and booty inside were richer already grinned elric with feigned de light in the privacy of the tent which was less clean than terarn gashteks they debated i feel uncommonly uncomfortable said moonglum surrounded by this treacherous horde and every time i think of what they made of eshmir i itch to slay more of them what now we can do nothing nowlet us wait until tonight and see what develops elric sighed our task seems impossiblei have never seen so great a horde as this they are invincible as they are said moonglum even without drinij baras sorcery to tumble down the walls of cities no single nation could withstand them and with the western nations squabbling among them selves they could never unite in time civilisation itself is threatened let us pray for inspirationyour dark gods are at least sophisticated elric and we must hope that theyll resent the barbarians intrusion as much as we do they play strange games with their human pawns elric replied and who knows what they plan terarn gashteks smokewreathed tent had been fur ther lighted by rush torches when elric and moonglum swaggered in and the feast consisting primarily of wine was already in progress welcome my friends shouted the flame bringer waving his goblet these are my captainscome join them elric had never seen such an evillooking group of barbarians they were all halfdrunk and like their leader had draped a variety of looted articles of cloth ing about themselves but their swords were their own room was made on one of the benches and they ac cepted wine which they drank sparingly bring in our slave i yelled terarn gashtek bring in drinij bara our pet sorcerer before him on the table lay the bound and struggling cat and beside it an iron blade grinning warriors dragged a morosefaced man close to the fire and forced him to kneel before the barbarian chief he was a lean man and he glowered at terarn gashtek and the little cat then his eyes saw the iron blade and his gaze faltered what do you want with me now he said sullenly is that the way to address your master spellmaker still no matter we have guests to entertainmen who have promised to lead us to fat merchant cities we re quire you to do a few minor tricks for them im no petty conjurer you cannot ask this of one of the greatest sorcerers in the world we do not askwe order come make the evening lively what do you need for your magicmaking a few slavesthe blood of virgins we shall arrange it im no mumbling shamani need no such trap pings suddenly the sorcerer saw elric the albino felt the mans powerful mind tentatively probing his own he had been recognised as a fellow sorcerer would drinij bara betray him elric was tense waiting to be denounced he leaned back in his chair and as he did so made a sign with his hand which would be recognised by western sorcerers would the easterner know it he did for a moment he faltered glancing at the barbarian leader then he turned away and began to make new passes in the air muttering to himself the beholders gasped as a cloud of golden smoke formed near the roof and began to metamorphose into the shape of a great horse bearing a rider which all recognised as terarn gashtek the barbarian leader leaned forward glaring at the image whats this a map showing great land areas and seas seemed to unroll beneath the horses hooves the western lands cried drinij bara i make a prophecy what is it the ghostly horse began to trample the map it split and flew into a thousand smoky pieces then the image of the horseman faded also into fragments thus will the mighty flame bringer rend the boun tiful nations of the west shouted drinij bara the barbarians cheered exultantly but elric smiled thinly the eastern wizard was mocking terarn gashtek and his men the smoke formed into a golden globe which seemed to blaze and vanish terarn gashtek laughed a good trick magic makerand a true prophecy you have done your work well take him back to his kennel as drinij bara was dragged away he glanced ques tioningly at elric but said nothing later that night as the barbarians drank themselves into a stupor elric and moonglum slipped out of the tent and made their way to the place where drinij bara was imprisoned they reached the small hut and saw that a warrior stood guard at the entrance moonglum produced a skin of wine and pretending drunkenness staggered towards the man elric stayed where he was what do you want outlander growled the guard nothing my friend we are trying to get back to our own tent thats all do you know where it is how should i know truehow should you have some wineits good from terarn gashteks own supply the man extended a hand lets have it moonglum took a swig of the wine no ive changed my mind its too good to waste on common warriors is that so the warrior took several paces towards moonglum well find out wont we and maybe well mix some of your blood with it to give it flavour my little friend moonglum backed away the warrior followed elric ran softly towards the tent and ducked into it to find drinij bara wrists bound lying on a pile of uncured hides the sorcerer looked up youwhat do you want weve come to aid you drinij bara aid me but why youre no friend of mine what would you gain you risk too much as a fellow sorcerer i thought id help you elric said i thought you were that but in my land sorcerers are not so friendly to one anotherthe opposite in fact ill tell you the truthwe need your aid to halt the barbarians bloody progress we have a common enemy if we can help you regain your soul will you help helpof course all i do is plan the way ill avenge myself but for my sake be carefulif he suspects that youre here to aid me hell slay the cat and slay us too well try to bring the cat to you will that be what you need yes we must exchange blood the cat and i and my soul will then pass back into my own body very well ill try to elric turned hearing voices outside whats that the sorcerer replied fearfully it must be terarn gashtekhe comes every night to taunt me wheres the guard the barbarians harsh voice came closer as he entered the little tent whats he saw elric standing above the sorcerer his eyes were puzzled and wary what are you doing here westernerand what have you done with the guard guard said elric i saw no guard i was looking for my own tent and heard this cur cry out so i entered i was curious anyway to see such a great sorcerer clad in filthy rags and bound so terarn gashteck scowled any more of such unwary curiosity my friend and youll be discovering what your own heart looks like now get hencewe ride on in the morning elric pretended to flinch and stumbled hurriedly from the tent a lone man in the livery of an official messenger of karlaak goaded his horse southwards the mount gal loped over the crest of a hill and the messenger saw a village ahead hurriedly he rode into it shouting at the first man he saw quickly tell meknow you ought of dyvim slorm and his imrryrian mercenaries have they passed this way ayea week ago they went towards rignariom by jadmars border to offer their services to the vilmirian pretender were they mounted or on foot both thanks friend cried the messenger behind him and galloped out of the village in the direction of rig nariom the messenger from karlaak rode through the nightrode along a recently made trail a large force had passed that way he prayed that it had been dyvim slorm and his imrryrian warriors in the sweetsmelling garden city of karlaak the at mosphere was tense as the citizens waited for news they knew they could not expect for some time they were relying on both elric and on the messenger if only one were successful there would be no hope for them both had to be successful both three the tumbling sound of moving men cut through the weeping morning and the hungry voice of terarn gashtek lashed at them to hurry slaves packed up his tent and threw it into a wagon he rode forward and wrenched his tall warlance from the soft earth wheeled his horse and rode westwards his captains elric and moonglum among them behind him speaking the western tongue elric and moonglum debated their problem the barbarian was expecting them to lead him to his prey his outriders were cover ing wide distances so that it would be impossible to lead him past a settlement they were in a quandary for it would be disgraceful to sacrifice another township to give karlaak a few days grace yet a little later two whooping outriders came galloping up to terarn gashtek a town lord a small one and easy to take at lastthis will do to test our blades and see how easy western flesh is to pierce then well aim at a big ger target he turned to elric do you know this town where does it lie asked elric thickly a dozen miles to the southwest replied the outrider in spite of the fact that the town was doomed elric felt almost relieved they spoke of the town of gorjhan i know it he said cavim the saddler riding to deliver a new set of horse furniture to an outlying farm saw the distant riders their bright helmets caught by a sudden beam of sunlight that the riders came from off the weeping waste was undoubtableand he recognised menace in their massed progress he turned his mount about and rode with the speed of fear back the way he had come to the town of gorjhan the flat hard mud of the street trembled beneath the thudding hooves of cavims horse and his high excited shout knifed through shuttered windows raiders come ware the raiders within a quarter of an hour the headmen of the town had met in hasty conference and debated whether to run or to fight the older men advised their neigh bours to flee the raiders other younger men preferred to stay ready armed to meet a possible attack some argued that their town was too poor to attract any raider the townspeople of gorjhan debated and quarrelled and the first wave of raiders came screaming to their walls with the realisation that there was no time for fur ther argument came the realisation of their doom and they ran to the ramparts with their pitiful weapons terarn gashtek roared through the milling barbari ans who churned the mud around gorjhan lets waste no time in siege fetch the sorcerer they dragged drinij bara forward from his gar ments terarn gashtek produced the small black cat and held an iron blade at its throat work your spell sorcerer and tumble the walls quickly the sorcerer scowled his eyes seeking elric but the albino averted his own eyes and turned his horse away the sorcerer produced a handful of powder from his belt pouch and hurled it into the air where it became first a gas then a flickering ball of flame and finally a face a dreadful unhuman face formed in the flame daggadden the destroyer intoned drinij bara you are sworn to our ancient pactwill you obey me i must therefore i will what do you command that you obliterate the walls of this town and so leave the men inside naked like crabs without their shells my pleasure is to destroy and destroy i shall the flaming face faded altered shrieked a searing course up ward and became a blossoming scarlet canopy which hid the sky then it swept down over the town and in the instant of its passing the walls of gorjhan groaned crumbled and vanished elric shudderedif daggadden came to karlaak such would be their fate triumphant the barbarian battlemongers swept into the defenceless town careful to take no part in the massacre elric and moonglum were also helpless to aid the slaughtered townspeople the sight of the senseless savage blood shed around them enervated them they ducked into a small house which seemed so far untouched by the pil laging barbarians inside they found three cowering chil dren huddled around an older girl who clutched an old scythe in her soft hands shaking with fear she prepared to stand them off do not waste our time girl elric said or youll be wasting your lives does this house have a loft she nodded then get to it quickly well make sure youre un harmed they stayed in the house hating to observe the slaughtermadness which had come upon the howling barbarians they heard the dreadful sounds of carnage and smelled the stench of dead flesh and running blood a barbarian covered in blood which was not his own dragged a woman into the house by her hair she made no attempt to resist her face stunned by the horror she had witnessed elric growled find another nest hawkweve made this our own the man said theres room enough here for what i want then at last elrics clenched muscles reacted almost in spite of him his right hand swung over to his left hip and the long fingers locked around stormbringers black hilt the blade leapt from the scabbard as elric stepped forward and his crimson eyes blazing his sick ened hatred he smashed his sword down through the mans body unnecessarily he clove again hacking the barbarian in two the woman remained where she lay conscious but unmoving elric picked up her inert body and passed it gently to moonglum take her upstairs with the others he said brusquely the barbarians had begun to fire part of the town their slaying all but done now they looted elric stepped out of the doorway there was precious little for them to loot but still hungry for violence they spent their energy on smash ing inanimate things and setting fire to the broken pil laged dwellings stormbringer dangled loosely in elrics hand as he looked at the blazing town his face was a mask of shadow and frisking light as the fire threw up still long er tongues of flame to the misty sky around him barbarians squabbled over the pitiful booty and occasionally a womans scream cut above the other sounds intermingled with rough shouts and the clash of metal then he heard voices which were pitched differently to those in the immediate vicinity the accents of the reavers mingled with a new tonea whining pleading tone a group led by terarn gashtek came into view through the smoke terarn gashtek held something bloody in his handa human hand severed at the wristand behind him swaggered several of his captains holding a naked old man between them blood ran over his body and gushed from his ruined arm spurting sluggishly terarn gashtek frowned when he saw elric then he shouted now westerner you shall see how we placate our gods with better gifts than meal and sour milk as this swine once did hell soon be dancing a pretty measure ill warrantwont you lord priest the whining note went out of the old mans voice then and he stared with feverbright eyes at elric his voice rose to a frenzied and highpitched shriek which was curiously repellent you dogs can howl over me he spat but mirath and taargano will be revenged for the ruin of their priest and their templeyou have brought flame here and you shall die by flame he pointed the bleeding stump of his arm at elric and youyou are a traitor and have been one in many causes i can see it written in you though now you are the priest drew breath elric licked his lips i am what i am he said and you are nothing but an old man soon to die your gods cannot harm us for we do not pay them any respect ill listen no more to your senile meanderings there was in the old priests face all the knowledge of his past torment and the torment which was to come he seemed to consider this and then was silent save your breath for screaming said terarn gashtek to the uncomprehending priest and then elric said its bad luck to kill a priest flame bringer you seem weak of stomach my friend his sacrifice to our own gods will bring us good luck fear not elric turned away as he entered the house again a wild shriek of agony seared out of the night and the laughter which followed was not pleasant later as the still burning houses lit the night elric and moonglum carrying heavy sacks on their shoulders clasping a woman each moved with a simulation of drunkenness to the edge of the camp moonglum left the sacks and the women with elric and went back re turning soon with three horses they opened the sacks to allow the children to climb out and watched the silent women mount the horses aiding the children to clamber up then they galloped away now said elric savagely we must work our plan tonight whether the messenger reached dyvim slorm or not i could not bear to witness another such sword quenching terarn gashtek had drunk himself insensible he lay sprawled in an upper room of one of the unburned houses elric and moonglum crept towards him while elric watched to see that he was undisturbed moonglum knelt beside the barbarian leader and lightfingered cau tiously reached inside the mans garments he smiled in selfapproval as he lifted out the squirming cat and re placed it with a stuffed rabbitskin he had earlier prepared for the purpose holding the animal tight he arose and nodded to elric together warily they left the house and made their way through the chaos of the camp i ascertained that drinij bara lies in the large wagon elric told his friend quickly now the main dangers over moonglum said when the cat and drinij bara have exchanged blood and the sorcerers soul is back in his bodywhat then elric together our powers may serve at least to hold the barbarians back but he broke off as a large group of warriors came weaving towards them its the westerner and his little friend laughed one where are you off to comrades elric sensed their mood the slaughter of the day had not completely satiated their bloodlust they were look ing for trouble nowhere in particular he replied the barbarians lurched around them encircling them weve heard much of your straight blade stranger grinned their spokesman and id a mind to test it against a real weapon he grabbed his own scimitar out of his belt what do you say id spare you that said elric coolly you are generousbut id rather you accepted my in vitation let us pass said moonglum the barbarians faces hardened speak you so to the conquerors of the world said the leader moonglum took a step back and drew his sword the cat squirming in his left hand wed best get this done said elric to his friend he tugged his runeblade from its scabbard the sword sang a soft and mocking tune and the barbarians heard it they were disconcerted well said elric holding the halfsentient blade out the barbarian who had challenged him looked uncer tain of what to do then he forced himself to shout clean iron can withstand any sorcery and launched himself forward elric grateful for the chance to take further ven geance blocked his swing forced the scimitar back and aimed a blow which sliced the mans torso just above the hip the barbarian screamed and died moonglum dealing with a couple more killed one but another came in swiftly and his sweeping sword sliced the little eastlanders left shoulder he howledand dropped the cat elric stepped in slew moonglums opponent stormbringer wailing a triumphant dirge the rest of the barbarians turned and ran off how bad is your wound gasped elric but moon glum was on his knees staring through the gloom quick elriccan you see the cat i dropped it in the struggle if we lose itwe too are lost frantically they began to hunt through the camp but they were unsuccessful for the cat with the dex terity of its kind had hidden itself a few moments later they heard the sounds of uproar coming from the house which terarn gashtek had com mandeered hes discovered that the cats been stolen ex claimed moonglum what do we do now i dont knowkeep searching and hope he does not suspect us they continued to hunt but with no result while they searched several barbarians came up to them one of them said our leader wishes to speak with you why hell inform you of that come on reluctantly they went with the barbarians to be con fronted by a raging terarn gashtek he clutched the stuffed rabbit skin in one clawlike hand and his face was warped with fury my hold over the sorcerer has been stolen from me he roared what do you know of it i dont understand said elric the cat is missingi found this rag in its place you were caught talking to drinij bara recently i think you were responsible we know nothing of this said moonglum terarn gashtek growled the camps in disorder it will take a day to reorganise my menonce loosed like this they will obey no one but when ive restored order i shall question the whole camp if you tell the truth then you will be released but meanwhile you will be given all the time you need to speak with the sorcerer he jerked his head take them away disarm them bind them and throw them in drinij baras kennel as they were led away elric muttered we must es cape and find that cat but meanwhile we need not waste this opportunity to confer with drinij bara drinij bara said in the darkness no brother sor cerer i will not aid you i will risk nothing until the cat and i are united but terarn gashtek cannot threaten you any more what if he recaptures the catwhat then elric was silent he shifted his bound body uncom fortably on the hard boards of the wagon he was about to continue his attempts at persuasion when the awning was thrown aside and he saw another trussed figure thrown towards them through the blackness he said in the eastern tongue who are you the man replied in the language of the west i do not understand you are you then a westerner asked elric in the com mon speech yesi am an official messenger from karlaak i was captured by these odorous jackals as i returned to the city what are you the man we sent to dyvim slorm my kinsman i am elric of melnibone my lord are we all then prisoners oh godskar laak is truly lost did you get to dyvim slorm ayei caught up with him and his band luckily they were nearer to karlaak than we suspected and what was his answer to my request he said that a few young ones might be ready but even with sorcery to aid him it would take some time to get to the dragon isle there is a chance a chance is all we needbut it will be no good unless we accomplish the rest of our plan somehow drinij baras soul must be regained so that terarn gashtek cannot force him to defend the barbarians there is one idea i havea memory of an ancient kin ship that we of melnibone had for a being called meer clar thank the gods that i discovered those drugs in troos and i still have my strength now i must call my sword to me he closed his eyes and allowed his mind and body first to relax completely and then concentrate on one single thingthe sword stormbringer for years the evil symbiosis had existed between man and sword and the old attachments lingered he cried stormbringer stormbringer unite with your brother come sweet runeblade come hellforged kinslayer your master needs thee outside it seemed that a wailing wind had suddenly sprung up elric heard shouts of fear and a whistling sound then the covering of the wagon was sliced apart to let in the starlight and the moaning blade quivered in the air over his head he struggled upwards already feeling nauseated at what he was about to do but he was reconciled that he was not this time guided by self interest but by the necessity to save the world from the barbarian menace give me thy strength my sword he groaned as his bound hands grasped the hilt give me thy strength and let us hope it is for the last time the blade writhed in his hands and he felt an awful sensation as its power the power stolen vampirelike from a hundred brave men flowed into his shuddering body he became possessed of a peculiar strength which was not by any means wholly physical his white face twisted as he concentrated on controlling the new power and the blade both of which threatened to possess him en tirely he snapped his bonds and stood up barbarians were even now running towards the wagon swiftly he cut the leather ropes binding the oth ers and unconscious of the nearing warriors called a different name he spoke a new tongue an alien tongue which nor mally he could not remember it was a language taught to the sorcerer kings of melnibone elrics ancestors even before the building of imrryr the dreaming city over ten thousand years previously meerclar of the cats it is i your kinsman elric of melnibone last of the line that made vows of friendship with you and your people do you hear me lord of the cats far beyond the earth dwelling within a world set apart from the physical laws of space and time which governed the planet glowing in a deep warmth of blue and amber a manlike creature stretched itself and yawned displaying tiny pointed teeth it pressed its head languidly against its furry shoulderand listened the voice it heard was not that of one of its people the kind he loved and protected but he recognised the language he smiled to himself as remembrance came and he felt the pleasant sensation of fellowship he remem bered a race which unlike other humans whom he dis dained had shared his qualitiesa race which like him loved pleasure cruelty and sophistication for its own sake the race of melniboneans meerclar lord of the cats protector of the feline kind projected himself gracefully towards the source of the voice how may i aid thee he purred we seek one of your folk meerclar who is some where close to here yes i sense him what do you want of him nothing which is hisbut he has two souls one of them not his own that is sohis name is fiarshern of the great family of trrechoww i will call him he will come to me outside the barbarians were striving to conquer their fear of the supernatural events taking place in the wagon terarn gashtek cursed them there are five hundred thousand of us and a few of them take them now his warriors began to move cautiously forward fiarshern the cat heard a voice which it knew in stinctively to be that of one which it would be foolish to disobey it ran swiftly towards the source of that voice lookthe catthere it is seize it quickly two of terarn gashteks men jumped forward to do his bidding but the little cat eluded them and leaped lightly into the wagon give the human back its soul fiarshern said meer clar softly the cat moved towards its human master and dug its delicate teeth into the sorcerers veins a moment later drinij bara laughed wildly my soul is mine again thank you great cat lord let me repay you there is no need smiled meerclar mockingly and anyway i perceive that your soul is already bartered goodbye elric of melnibone i was pleased to answer your call though i see that you no longer follow the an cient pursuits of your fathers still for the sake of old loyalties i do not begrudge you this service farewell i go back to a warmer place than this inhospitable one the lord of the cats faded and returned to the world of blue and amber warmth where he once more resumed his interrupted sleep come brother sorcerer cried drinij bara exul tantly let us take the vengeance which is ours he and elric sprang from the wagon but the two oth ers were not quite so quick to respond terarn gashtek and his men confronted them many had bows with long arrows fitted to them shoot them down swiftly yelled the flame bringer shoot them now before they have time to summon fur ther demons a shower of arrows whistled towards them drinij bara smiled spoke a few words as he moved his hands almost carelessly the arrows stopped in midflight turned back and each uncannily found the throat of the man who had shot it terarn gashtek gasped and wheeled back pushing past his men and as he retreated shouted for them to attack the four driven by the knowledge that if they fled they would be doomed the great mass of barbarians closed in dawn was bringing light to the cloudripped sky as moonglum looked upwards look elric he shouted pointing only five said the albino only fivebut perhaps enough he parried several lashing blades on his own sword and although he was possessed of superhuman strength all the power seemed to have left the sword so that it was only as useful as an ordinary blade still fighting he relaxed his body and felt the power leave him flowing back into stormbringer again the runeblade began to whine and thirstily sought the throats and hearts of the savage barbarians drinij bara had no sword but he did not need one he was using subtler means to defend himself all around him were the gruesome results boneless masses of flesh and sinew the two sorcerers and moonglum and the messenger forced their way through the halfinsane barbarians who were desperately attempting to overcome them in the confusion it was impossible to work out a coherent plan of action moonglum and the messenger grabbed scimi tars from the corpses of the barbarians and joined in the battle eventually they had reached the outer limits of the camp a whole mass of barbarians had fled spurring their mounts westwards then elric saw terarn gashtek holding a bow he saw the flame bringers in tention and shouted a warning to his fellow sorcerer who had his back to the barbarian drinij bara yelling some disturbing incantation halfturned broke off at tempted to begin another spell but the arrow pierced his eye he screamed no then he died seeing his ally slain elric paused and stared at the sky and the great wheeling beasts which he recognised dyvim slorm son of elrics cousin dyvim tvar the dragon master had brought the legendary dragons of imrryr to aid his kinsman but most of the huge beasts slept and would sleep for another centuryonly five dragons had been aroused as yet dyvim slorm could do nothing for fear of harming elric and his comrades terarn gashtek too had seen the magnificent beasts his grandiose plans of conquest were already fading and thwarted he ran towards elric you whitefaced filth he howled you have been re sponsible for all thisand you will pay the flame bringers price elric laughed as he brought up stormbringer to pro tect himself from the incensed barbarian he pointed to the sky these too can be called flame bringers ter arn gashtekand are better named than thou then he plunged the evil blade full into terarn gashteks body and the barbarian gave a choking moan as his soul was drawn from him destroyer i may be elric of melnibone he gasped but my way was cleaner than yours may you and all you hold dear be cursed for eternity elric laughed but his voice shook slightly as he stared at the barbarians corpse ive rid myself of such curses once before my friend yours will have little effect i think he paused by arioch i hope im right id thought my fate cleansed of doom and curses but per haps i was wrong the huge horde of barbarians were nearly all mount ed now and fleeing westwards they had to be stopped for at the pace they were travelling they would soon reach karlaak and only the gods knew what they would do when they got to the unprotected city above him he heard the flapping of thirtyfoot wings and scented the familiar smell of the great flying reptiles which had pursued him years before when he had led a reaver fleet on the attack of his homecity then he heard the curious notes of the dragon horn and saw that dyvim slorm was seated on the back of the leading beast a long spearlike goad in his gauntleted right hand the dragon spiralled downward and its great bulk came to rest on the ground thirty feet away its leathery wings folding back along its length the dragon master waved to elric greetings king elric we barely managed to arrive in time i see time enough kinsman smiled elric it is good to see the son of dyvim tvar again i was afraid you might not answer my plea old scores were forgotten at the battle of bakshaan when my father dyvim tvar died aiding you in the siege of nikorns fortress i regret only the younger beasts were ready to be awakened youll remember the others were used but a few years past i remember said elric may i beg another favour dyvim slorm what is that let me ride the chief dragon i am trained in the arts of the dragon master and have good reason for rid ing against the barbarianswe were forced to witness in sensate carnage a while ago and may perhaps pay them back in their own coinage dyvim slorm nodded and swung off his mount the beast stirred restlessly and drew back the lips of its ta pering snout to reveal teeth as thick as a mans arm as long as a sword its forked tongue flickered and it turned its huge cold eyes to regard elric elric sang to it in the old melnibonean speech took the goad and the dragon horn from dyvim slorm and carefully climbed into the high saddle at the base of the dragons neck he placed his booted feet into the great silver stirrups now fly dragon brother he sang up up and have your venom ready he heard the snap of displaced air as the wings began to beat and then the great beast was clear of the ground and soaring upwards into the grey and brooding sky the other four dragons followed the first and as he gained height sounding specific notes on the horn to give them directions he drew his sword from its scab bard centuries before elrics ancestors had ridden their dragon steeds to conquer the whole of the western world there had been many more dragons in the dragon caves in those days now only a handful re mained and of those only the youngest had slept suffi ciently long enough to be awakened high in the wintry sky climbed the huge reptiles and elrics long white hair and stained black cloak flew be hind him as he sang the exultant song of the dragon masters and urged his charges westwards wild windhorses soar the cloudtrails unholy horn doth sound its blast you and we were first to conquer you and we shall be the last thoughts of love of peace of vengeance even were lost in that reckless sweeping across the glowering skies which hung over that ancient age of the young king doms elric archetypal proud and disdainful in his knowledge that even his deficient blood was the blood of the sorcerer kings of melnibone became detached he had no loyalties then no friends and if evil possessed him then it was a pure brilliant evil untaint ed by human drivings high soared the dragons until below them was the heaving black mass marring the landscape the fear driven horde of barbarians who in their ignorance had sought to conquer the lands beloved of elric of melni bone ho dragon brothersloose your venomburnburn and in your burning cleanse the world stormbringer joined in the wild shout and diving the dragons swept across the sky down upon the crazed bar barians shooting streams of combustible venom which water could not extinguish and the stink of charred flesh drifted upwards through the smoke and flame so that the scene became a scene of helland proud elric was a lord of demons reaping awful vengeance he did not gloat for he had done only what was needed that was all he shouted no more but turned his dragon mount back and upward sounding his horn and summoning the other reptiles to him and as he climbed the exultation left him and was replaced by cold horror i am still a melnibonean he thought and cannot rid myself of what else i do and in my strength i am still weak ready to use this cursed blade in any small emergency with a shout of loathing he flung the sword away flung it into space it screamed like a woman and went plummeting downwards towards the distant earth there he said it is done at last then in calmer mood he returned to where he had left his friends and guided his reptilian mount to the ground dyvim slorm said where is the sword of your fore fathers king elric but the albino did not answer just thanked his kinsman for the loan of the dragon leader then they all remounted the dragons and flew back towards karlaak to tell them the news zarozinia saw her lord riding the first dragon and knew that karlaak and the western world were saved the eastern world avenged his stance was proud but his face was grave as he went to meet her outside the city she saw in him a return of an earlier sorrow which he had thought forgotten she ran to him and he caught her in his arms holding her close but saying nothing he bade farewell to dyvim slorm and his fellow imrryrians and with moonglum and the messenger fol lowing at a distance went into the city and thence to his house impatient of the congratulations which the cit izens showered upon him what is it my lord zarozinia said as with a sigh he sprawled wearily upon the great bed can speaking help im tired of swords and sorcery zarozinia that is all but at last i have rid myself once and for all of that hellblade which i had thought my destiny to carry al ways stormbringer you mean what else she said nothing she did not tell him of the sword which apparently of its own volition had come scream ing into karlaak and passed into the armoury to hang in its old place in darkness there he closed his eyes and drew a long sighing breath sleep well my lord she said softly with tearful eyes and a sad mouth she lay herself down beside him she did not welcome the morning epilogue to rescue tanelorn in which we learn of the further adventures of rackhir the red archer and other heroes and places elric has hitherto encountered only in what he chooses to consider his dreams epilogue to rescue tanelorn beyond the tall and ominous glassgreen forest of troos well to the north and unheard of in bakshaan elwher or any other city of the young kingdoms on the shift ing shores of the sighing desert lay tanelorn a lonely longago city loved by those it sheltered tanelorn had a peculiar nature in that it welcomed and held the wanderer to its peaceful streets and low houses came the gaunt the savage the brutalised the tormented and in tanelorn they found rest now most of these troubled travellers who dwelt in peaceful tanelorn had thrown off earlier allegiances to the lords of chaos who as gods took more than a mild interest in the affairs of men it happened therefore that these same lords grew to resent the unlikely city of tanelorn and not for the the first time decided to act against it they instructed one of their number more they could not then send lord narjhan to journey to nadsokor the city of beggars which had an old grudge against tanelorn and raise an army that would attack undefend ed tanelorn and destroy it and its inhabitants so he did this arming his ragged army and promising them many things then like a ferocious tide did the beggar rabble set off to tear down tanelorn and slay its residents a great torrent of men and women in rags on crutches blind maimed but moving steadily ominously implacably northwards towards the sighing desert in tanelorn dwelt the red archer rackhir from the eastlands beyond the sighing desert beyond the weep ing waste rackhir had been born a warrior priest a servant of the lords of chaos but had forsaken this life for the quieter pursuits of thievery and learning a man with harsh features slashed from the bone of his skull strong fleshless nose deep eyecavities a thin mouth and a thin beard he wore a red skullcap decorated with a hawks feather a red jerkin tightfitting and belted at the waist red breeks and red boots it was as if all the blood in him had transferred itself to his gear and left him drained he was happy however in tane lorn the city which made all such men happy and felt he would die there if men died there he did not know if they did one day he saw brut of lashmar a great blond headed noble of shamed name ride wearily yet ur gently through the low wallgate of the city of peace bruts silver harness and trappings were begrimed his yellow cloak torn and his broadbrimmed hat battered a small crowd collected around him as he rode into the city square and halted then he gave his news beggars from nadsokor many thousands move against our tanelorn he said and they are led by narjhan of chaos now all the men in there were soldiers of some kind good ones for the most part and they were confident warriors but few in number a horde of beggars led by such a being as narjhan could destroy tanelorn they knew should we then leave tanelorn said uroch of nieva a young wasted man who had been a drunkard we owe this city too much to desert her rackhir said we should defend herfor her sake and ours there will never be such a city again brut leaned forward in his saddle and said in prin ciple red archer i am in agreement with you but principle is not enough without deeds how would you suggest we defend this lowwalled city against siege and the powers of chaos we should need help rackhir replied supernatu ral help if need be would the grey lords help us zas the onehanded asked the question he was an old torn wanderer who had once gained a throne and lost it again ayethe grey lords several voices chorused this hopefully who are the grey lords said uroch but no one heard him they are not inclined to aid anyone at all zas the onehanded pointed out but surely tanelorn coming as it does under neither the forces of law nor the lords of chaos would be worth their while preserving after all they have no loyalties either im for seeking the grey lords aid brut nodded what of the rest of us there was general agreement then silence when they realised that they knew of no means of contacting the mysterious and insouciant beings at last zas pointed this out rackhir said i know a seera hermit who lives in the sighing desert perhaps he can help i think that after all we should not waste time look ing for supernatural assistance against this beggar rabble uroch said let us prepare instead to meet the attack with physical means you forget brut said wearily that they are led by narjhan of chaos he is not human and has the whole strength of chaos behind him we know that the grey lords are pledged neither to law nor to chaos but will sometimes help either side if the whim takes them they are our only chance why not seek the aid of the forces of law sworn en emies of chaos and mightier than the grey lords uroch said because tanelorn is a city owing allegiance to nei ther side we are all of us men and women who have broken our pledge to chaos but have made no new one to law the forces of law in matters of this kind will help only those sworn to them the grey lords only may protect us if they would so said zas i will go to find my seer rackhir the red archer said and if he knows how i may reach the domain of the grey lords then ill continue straight on for there is so little time if i reach them and solicit their help you will soon know i have done so if not you must die in tanelorns defence and if i live i will join you in that last battle very well brut agreed go quickly red archer let one of your own arrows be the measure of your speed and taking little with him save his bone bow and quiver of scarletfletched arrows rackhir set off for the sighing desert from nadsokor south west through the land of vil mir even through the squalid country of org which has in it the dreadful forest of troos there was flame and black horror in the wake of the beggar horde and inso lent disdainful of them though he led them rode a being completely clad in black armour with a voice that rang hollow in the helm people fled away at their ap proach and the land was made barren by their passing most knew what had happened that the beggar citizens of nadsokor had contrary to their traditions of cen turies vomited from their city in a wild menacing horde someone had armed themsomeone had made them go northwards and westwards towards the sighing desert but who was the one who led them ordinary folk did not know and why did they head for the sigh ing desert there was no city beyond karlaak which they had skirted only the signing desertand beyond that the edge of the world was that their destination were they heading lemminglike to their destruction everyone hoped so in their hate for the horrible horde rackhir rode through the mournful wind of the sigh ing desert his face and eyes protected against the parti cles of sand which flew about he was thirsty and had been riding a day ahead of him at last were the rocks he sought he reached the rocks and called above the wind lamsar the hermit came out in answer to rackhirs shout he was dressed in oiled leather to which sand clung his beard too was encrusted with sand and his skin seemed to have taken on the colour and texture of the desert he recognised rackhir immediately by his dress beck oned him into the cave and disappeared back inside rackhir dismounted and led his horse to the cave en trance and went in lamsar was seated on a smooth rock you are wel come red archer he said and i perceive by your manner that you wish information from me and that your mission is urgent i seek the help of the grey lords lamsar said rackhir the old hermit smiled it was as if a fissure had sud denly appeared in a rock to risk the journey through the five gates your mission must be important i will tell you how to reach the grey lords but the road is a difficult one im willing to take it rackhir replied for tane lorn is threatened and the grey lords could help her then you must pass through the first gate which lies in our own dimension i will help you find it and what must i do then you must pass through all five gates each gateway leads to a realm which lies beyond and within our own dimension in each realm you must speak with the dwell ers there some are friendly to men some are not but all must answer your question where lies the next gate though some may seek to stop you passing the last gate leads to the grey lords domain and the first gate that lies anywhere in this realm i will find it for you now lamsar composed himself to meditate and rackhir who had expected some sort of gaudy miracleworking from the old man was disappointed several hours went by until lamsar said the gate is outside memorise the following if x is equal to the spirit of humanity then the combination of the two must be of double power therefore the spirit of human ity always contains the power to dominate itself a strange equation said rackhir ayebut memorise it meditate upon it and then we will leave weyou as well i think so the hermit was old rackhir did not want him on the journey but then he realised that the hermits knowledge could be of use to him so did not object he thought upon the equation and as he thought his mind seemed to glitter and become diffused until he was in a strange trance and all his powers felt greater both those of mind and body the hermit got up and rackhir fol lowed him they went out of the cavemouth but in stead of the sighing desert there was a hazy cloud of blue shimmering light ahead and when they had passed through this in a second they found themselves in the foothills of a low mountainrange and below them in a valley were villages the villages were strangely laid out all the houses in a wide circle about a huge am phitheatre containing at its centre a circular dais it will be interesting to learn the reason why these villages are so arranged lamsar said and they began to move down into the valley as they reached the bottom and came close to one of the villages people came gaily out and danced joyfully towards them they stopped in front of rackhir and lamsar and jumping from foot to foot as he greeted them the leader spoke you are strangers we can telland you are welcome to all we have food accommodation and entertain ment the two men thanked them graciously and accompa nied them back to the circular village the amphithe atre was made of mud and seemed to have been stamped out hollowed into the ground encompassed by the houses the leader of the villagers took them to his house and offered them food you have come to us at a rest time he said but do not worry things will soon commence again my name is yerleroo we seek the next gate lamsar said politely and our mission is urgent you will forgive us if we do not stay long come said yerleroo things are about to com mence you will see us at our best and must join us all the villagers had assembled in the amphitheatre surrounding the platform in the centre most of them were lightskinned and lighthaired gay and smiling ex citedbut a few were evidently of a different race dark blackhaired and these were sullen sensing something ominous in what he saw rackhir asked the question directly where is the next gate yerleroo hesitated his mouth worked and then he smiled where the winds meet he said rackhir declared angrily thats no answer yes it is said lamsar softly behind him a fair an swer now we shall dance yerleroo said first you shall watch our dance and then you shall join in dance said rackhir wishing he had brought a sword or at least a dagger yesyou will like it everyone likes it you will find it will do you good what if we do not wish to dance you mustit is for your own good be assured and he rackhir pointed at one of the sullen men does he enjoy it it is for his own good yerleroo clapped his hands and at once the fairhaired people leapt into a frenetic senseless dance some of them sang the sullen people did not sing after a little hesitation they began to prance dully about their frowning features contrasting with their jerking bodies soon the whole village was dancing whirling singing a monotonous song yerleroo flashed by whirling come join in now we had better leave lamsar said with a faint smile they backed away yerleroo saw them noyou must not leaveyou must dance they turned and ran as fast as the old man could go the dancing villagers changed the direction of their dance and began to whirl menacingly towards them in a horrible semblance of gaiety theres nothing for it lamsar said and stood his ground observing them through ironic eyes the mountain gods must be invoked a pity for sorcery wea ries me let us hope their magic extends to this plane gordar words in an unusually harsh language issued from lamsars old mouth the whirling villagers came on lamsar pointed at them the villagers became suddenly petrified and slowly disturbingly their bodies caught in a hundred positions turned to smooth black basalt it was for their own good lamsar smiled grimly come to the place where the winds meet and he took rackhir there quite swiftly at the place where the winds met they found the sec ond gateway a column of ambercoloured flame shot through with streaks of green they entered it and in stantly were in a world of dark seething colour above them was a sky of murky red in which other colours shifted agitated changing ahead of them lay a forest dark blue black heavy mottled green the tops of its trees moving like a wild tide it was a howling land of unnatural phenomena lamsar pursed his lips on this plane chaos rules we must get to the next gate swiftly for obviously the lords of chaos will seek to stop us is it always like this rackhir gasped it is always boiling midnightbut the rest it changes with the moods of the lords there are no rules at all they pressed on through the bounding blossoming scenery as it erupted and changed around them once they saw a huge winged figure in the sky smoky yellow and roughly manshaped vezhan lamsar said lets hope he did not see us vezhan rackhir whispered the namefor it was to vezhan that he had once been loyal they crept on uncertain of their direction or even of their speed in that disturbing land at length they came to the shores of a peculiar ocean it was a grey heaving timeless sea a mysterious sea which stretched into infinity there could be no other shores beyond this rolling plain of water no other lands or rivers or dark cool woods no other men or women or ships it was a sea which led to nowhere it was com plete to itselfa sea over this timeless ocean hovered a brooding ochre sun which cast moody shadows of black and green across the water giving the whole scene something of the look of being enclosed in a vast cavern for the sky above was gnarled and black with ancient clouds and all the while the doomcarried crash of breakers the lonely fated monotony of the everrearing whitetopped waves the sound which portended neither death nor life nor war nor peacesimply existence and shifting inharmony they could go no further this has the air of our death about it rackhir said shivering the sea roared and tumbled the sound of it increas ing to a fury daring them to go on towards it welcom ing them with wild temptationoffering them nothing but achievementthe achievement of death lamsar said it is not my fate wholly to perish but then they were running back towards the forest feeling that the strange sea was pouring up the beach towards them they looked back and saw that it had gone no further that the breakers were less wild the sea more calm lamsar was little way behind rackhir the red archer gripped his hand and hauled him towards him as if he had rescued the old man from a whirlpool they remained there mesmerised for a long time while the sea called to them and the wind was a cold caress on their flesh in the bleak brightness of the alien shore under a sun which gave no heat their bodies shone like stars in the night and they turned towards the forest quietly are we trapped then in this realm of chaos rackhir said at length if we meet someone they will offer us harmhow can we ask our question then there emerged from the huge forest a great fig ure naked and gnarled like the trunk of a tree green as lime but the face was jovial greetings unhappy renegades it said where is the next gate said lamsar quickly you almost entered it but turned away laughed the giant that sea does not existit is there to stop travellers from passing through the gate it exists here in the realm of chaos rackhir said thickly you could say sobut what exists in chaos save the disorders of the minds of gods gone mad rackhir had strung his bone bow and fitted an arrow to the string but he did it in the knowledge of his own hopelessness do not shoot the arrow said lamsar softly not yet and he stared at the arrow and muttered the giant advanced carelessly towards them unhur ried it will please me to exact the price of your crimes from you it said for i am hionhurn the executioner you will find your death pleasantbut your fate unbear able and he came closer his clawed hands out stretched shoot croaked lamsar and rackhir brought the bowstring to his cheek pulled it back with might and released the arrow at the giants heart run cried lamsar and in spite of their forebodings they ran back down the shore towards the frightful sea they heard the giant groan behind them as they reached the edge of the sea and instead of running into water found them selves in a range of stark mountains no mortal arrow could have delayed him rackhir said how did you stop him i used an old charmthe charm of justice which when applied to any weapon makes it strike at the unjust but why did it hurt hionhurn an immortal rack hir asked there is no justice in the world of chaossomething constant and inflexible whatever its nature must harm any servant of the lords of chaos we have passed through the third gate rackhir said unstringing his bow and have the fourth and fifth to find two dangers have been avoidedbut what new ones will we encounter now who knows said lamsar and they walked on through the rocky mountain pass and entered a forest that was cool even though the sun had reached its ze nith and was glaring down through parts of the thick fo liage there was an air of ancient calm about the place they heard unfamiliar birdcalls and saw tiny golden birds which were also new to them there is something calm and peaceful about this placei almost distrust it rackhir said but lamsar pointed ahead silently rackhir saw a large domed building magnificent in marble and blue mosaic it stood in a clearing of yellow grass and the marble caught the sun flashing like fire they neared the domed construction and saw that it was supported by big marble columns set into a plat form of milky jade in the centre of the platform a stairway of bluestone curved upwards and disappeared into a circular aperture there were wide windows set into the sides of the raised building but they could not see inside there were no inhabitants visible and it would have seemed strange to the pair if there had been they crossed the yellow glade and stepped on to the jade platform it was warm as if it had been ex posed to the sun they almost slipped on the smooth stone they reached the blue steps and mounted them star ing upwards but they could still see nothing they did not attempt to ask themselves why they were so as suredly invading the building it seemed quite natural that they should do what they were doing there was no alternative there was an air of familiarity about the place rackhir felt it but did not know why inside was a cool shadowy hall a blend of soft darkness and bright sunlight which entered by the windows the floor was pearlpink and the ceiling deep scarlet the hall re minded rackhir of a womb partially hidden by deep shadow was a small doorway and beyond it steps rackhir looked questioningly at lamsar do we proceed in our exploration we mustto have our question answered if possible they climbed the steps and found themselves in a smaller hall similar to the one beneath them this hall however was furnished with twelve wide thrones placed in a semicircle in the centre against the wall near the door were several chairs upholstered in purple fabric the thrones were of gold decorated with fine silver padded with white cloth a door behind the throne opened and a tall fragile looking man appeared followed by others whose faces were almost identical only their robes were noticeably different their faces were pale almost white their noses straight their lips thin but not cruel their eyes were unhumangreenflecked eyes which stared out wards with sad composure the leader of the tall men looked at rackhir and lamsar he nodded and waved a pale longfingered hand gracefully welcome he said his voice was high and frail like a girls but beautiful in its modulation the other eleven men seated themselves in the thrones but the first man who had spoken remained standing sit down please he said rackhir and lamsar sat down on two of the purple chairs how did you come here enquired the man through the gates from chaos lamsar replied and were you seeking our realm nowe travel towards the domain of the grey lords i thought so for your people rarely visit us save by accident where are we asked rackhir as the man seated himself in the remaining throne in a place beyond time once our land was part of the earth you know but in the dim past it became sep arated from it our bodies unlike yours are immortal we choose this but we are not bound to our flesh as you are i dont understand frowned rackhir what are you saying i have said what i can in the simplest terms under standable to you if you do not know what i say then i can explain no further we are called the guardians though we guard nothing we are warriors but we fight nothing what else do you do enquired rackhir we exist you will want to know where the next gateway lies yes refresh yourselves here and then we shall show you the gateway what is your function asked rackhir to function said the man you are unhuman we are human you spend your lives chasing that which is within you and that which you can find in any other human beingbut you will not look for it there you must follow more glamorous pathsto waste your time in order to discover that you have wasted your time i am glad that we are no longer like youbut i wish that it were lawful to help you further this how ever we may not do ours is no meaningless quest said lamsar quietly with respect we go to rescue tanelorn tanelorn the man said softly does tanelorn still remain aye said rackhir and shelters tired men who are grateful for the rest she offers now he realised why the building had been familiarit had the same quality but intensified as tanelorn tanelorn was the last of our cities said the guardian forgive us for judging youmost of the trav ellers who pass through this plane are searchers restless with no real purpose only excuses imaginary reasons for journeying on you must love tanelorn to brave the dangers of the gateways we do said rackhir and i am grateful that you built her we built her for ourselves but it is good that others have used her welland she them will you help us rackhir said for tanelorn we cannotit is not lawful now refresh yourselves and be welcome the two travellers were given foods both soft and brittle sweet and sour and drink which seemed to enter the pores of their skin as they quaffed it and then the guardian said we have caused a road to be made fol low it and enter the next world but we warn you it is the most dangerous of all and they set off down the road that the guardians had caused to be made and passed through the fourth gateway into a dreadful realmthe ream of law nothing shone in the greylit sky nothing moved noth ing marred the grey nothing interrupted the bleak grey plain stretching on all sides of them forever there was no horizon it was a bright clean wasteland but there was a sense about the air a presence of something past something which had gone but left a faint aura of its passing what dangers could be here said rackhir shudder ing here where there is nothing the danger of the loneliest madness lamsar re plied their voices were swallowed in the grey expanse when the earth was very young lamsar continued his words trailing away across the wilderness things were like thisbut there were seas there were seas here there is nothing you are wrong rackhir said with a faint smile i have thoughthere there is law that is truebut what is law without something to decide between here is lawbereft of justice they walked on all about them an air of something intangible that had once been tangible on they walked through this barren world of absolute law eventually rackhir spied something something that flickered faded appeared again until as they neared it they saw that it was a man his great head was noble firm and his body was massively built but the face was twisted in a tortured frown and he did not see them as they approached him they stopped before him and lamsar coughed to at tract his attention he turned that great head and re garded them abstractedly the frown clearing at length to be replaced by a calmer thoughtful expression who are you asked rackhir the man sighed not yet he said not yet it seems more phantoms are we the phantoms smiled rackhir that seems to be more your own nature he watched as the man began slowly to fade again his form less definite melting the body seemed to make a great heave like a salmon attempting to leap a dam then it was back again in a more solid form i had thought myself rid of all that was superfluous save my own obstinate shape the man said tiredly but here is something back again is my reason failingis my logic no longer what it was do not fear said rackhir we are material beings that is what i feared for an eternity i have been stripping away the layers of unreality which obscure the truth i have almost succeeded in the final act and now you begin to creep back my mind is not what it was i think perhaps you worry lest we do not exist lamsar said slowly with a clever smile you know that is not soyou do not exist just as i do not exist the frown returned the features twisted the body began again to fade only to resume once more its earlier nature the man sighed even to reply to you is betraying myself but i suppose a little relax ation will serve to rest my powers and equip me for the final effort of will which will bring me to the ultimate truththe truth of nonbeing but nonbeing involves nonthought nonwill non action lamsar said surely you would not submit yourself to such a fate there is no such thing as self i am the only reason ing thing in creationi am almost pure reason a little more effort and i shall be what i desire to bethe one truth in this nonexistent universe that requires first ridding myself of anything extraneous around mesuch as yourselvesand then making the final plunge into the only reality what is that the state of absolute nothingness where there is nothing to disturb the order of things because there is no order of things scarcely a constructive ambition rackhir said construction is a meaningless wordlike all words like all socalled existence everything means nothing thai is the only truth but what of this world barren as it is it still has light and firm rock you have not succeeded in reason ing that out of existence lamsar said that will cease when i cease the man said slowly just as you will cease to be then there can be nothing but nothing and law will reign unchallenged but law cannot reignit will not exist either ac cording to your logic you are wrongnothingness is the law nothingness is the object of law law is the way to its ultimate state the state of nonbeing well said lamsar musingly then you had better tell us where we may find the next gate there is no gate if there were where would we find it rackhir said if a gate existed and it does not it would have been inside the mountain close to what was once called the sea of peace and where was that rackhir asked conscious now of their terrible predicament there were no landmarks no sun no starsnothing by which they could determine direction close to the mountain of severity which way do you go lamsar enquired of the man outbeyondto nowhere and where if you succeed in your object will we be consigned to some other nowhere i cannot truthfully answer but since you have never existed in reality therefore you can go on to no nonreality only i am realand i do not exist we are getting nowhere said rackhir with a smirk which changed to a frown it is only my mind which holds the nonreality at bay the man said and i must concentrate or else it will all come flooding back and i shall have to start from the beginning again in the beginning there was everythingchaos i created nothing with resignation rackhir strung his bow fitted an ar row to the string and aimed at the frowning man you wish for nonbeing he said i have told you so rackhirs arrow pierced his heart his body faded became solid and slumped to the grass as mountains forests and rivers appeared around them it was still a peaceful wellordered world and rackhir and lamsar as they strode on in search of the mountain of severity savoured it there seemed to be no animal life here and they talked in puzzled terms about the man they had been forced to kill until at length they reached a great smooth pyramid which seemed though it was of natural origin to have been carved into this form they walked around its base until they discovered an opening there could be no doubt that this was the mountain of severity and a calm ocean lay some distance away they went into the opening and emerged into a delicate landscape they were now through the last gateway and in the domain of the grey lords there were trees like stiffened spiderwebs here and there were blue pools shallow with shining water and graceful rocks balanced in them and around their shores above them and beyond them the light hills swept away towards a pastel yellow horizon which was tinted with red orange and blue deep blue they felt overlarge clumsy like crude gross giants treading on the fine short grass they felt as if they were destroying the sanctity of the place then they saw a girl come walking towards them she stopped as they came closer to her she was dressed in loose black robes which flowed about her as if in a wind but there was no wind her face was pale and pointed her black eyes large and enigmatic at her long throat was a jewel sorana said rackhir thickly you died i disappeared said she and this is where i came i was told that you would come to this place and decided that i would meet you but this is the domain of the grey lordsand you serve chaos i dobut many are welcome at the grey lords court whether they be of law chaos or neither come i will escort you there bewildered now rackhir let her lead the way across the strange terrain and lamsar followed him sorana and rackhir had been lovers once in yeshpo toomkahlai the unholy fortress where evil blossomed and was beautiful sorana sorceress adventuress was without conscience but had had high regard for the red archer since he had come to yeshpotoomkahlai one evening covered in his own blood survivor of a bizarre battle between the knights of tumbru and loheb bakras brigandengineers seven years ago that had been and he had heard her scream when the blue as sassins had crept into the unholy fortress pledged to murder evilmakers even then he had been in the process of hurriedly leaving yeshpotoomkahlai and had considered it unwise to investigate what was obviously a deathscream now she was hereand if she was here then it was for a strong reason and for her own con venience on the other hand it was in her interests to serve chaos and he must be suspicious of her ahead of them now they saw many great tents of shimmering grey which in the light seemed composed of all colours people moved slowly among the tents and there was an air of leisure about the place here sorana said smiling at him and taking his hand the grey lords hold impermanent court they wander about their land and have few artifacts and only temporary houses which you see they will make you welcome if you interest them but will they help us you must ask them you are pledged to eequor of chaos rackhir ob served and must aid her against us is that not so here she smiled is a truce i can only inform chaos of what i learn of your plans and if the grey lords aid you must tell them how if i can find out you are frank sorana here there are subtler hypocrisiesand the subtlest lie of all is the full truth she said as they entered the area of tall tents and made their way towards a certain one in a different realm of the earth the huge horde careered across the grasslands of the north screaming and singing behind the blackarmoured horseman their leader nearer and nearer they came to lonely tane lorn their motley weapons shining through the evening mists like a boiling tidal wave of insensate flesh the mob drove on hysterical with the hate for tanelorn which narjhan had placed in their thin hearts thieves murderers jackals scavengersa scrawny horde but huge and in tanelorn the warriors were grimfaced as their outriders and scouts flowed into the city with messages and estimates of the beggar armys strength brut in the silver armour of his rank knew that two full days had passed since rackhir had left for the sigh ing desert three more days and the city would be en gulfed by narjhans mighty rabbleand they knew there was no chance of halting their advance they might have left tanelorn to its fate but they would not even weak uroch would not for tanelorn the mysterious had given them all a secret power which each believed to be his only a strength which filled them where before they had been hollow men selfishly they stayedfor to leave tanelorn to her fate would be to become hollow again and that they all dreaded brut was the leader and he prepared the defence of tanelorna defence which might just have held against the beggar armybut not against it and chaos brut shuddered when he thought that if chaos had directed its full force against tanelorn they would be sobbing in hell at that moment dust rose high above tanelorn sent flying by the hooves of the scouts and messengers horses one came through the gate as brut watched he pulled his mount to a stop before the nobleman he was the messenger from kaarlak by the weeping waste one of the nearest major cities to tanelorn the messenger gasped i asked kaarlak for aid but as we supposed they had never heard of tanelorn and suspected that i was an emissary from the beggar army sent to lead their few forces into a trap i pleaded with the senators but they would do nothing was not elric therehe knows tanelorn no he was not there there is a rumour which says that he himself fights chaos now for the minions of chaos captured his wife zarozinia and he rides in pur suit of them chaos it seems gains strength everywhere in our realm brut was pale what of jadmarwill jadmar send warriors the messenger spoke urgently for many had been sent to the nearer cities to solicit aid i do not know replied brut and it does not mat ter nowfor the beggar army is not three days march from tanelorn and it would take two weeks for a jad marian force to reach us and rackhir i have heard nothing and he has not returned i have the feeling he will not return tanelorn is doomed rackhir and lamsar bowed before the three small men who sat in the tent but one of them said impa tiently do not humble yourselves before us friends we who are humbler than any so they straightened their backs and waited to be further addressed the grey lords assumed humility but this it seemed was their greatest ostentation for it was a pride that they had rackhir realised that he would need to use subtle flattery and was not sure that he could for he was a warrior not a courtier or a diplomat lamsar too re alised the situation and he said in our pride lords we have come to learn the sim pler truths which are only truthsthe truths which you can teach us the speaker gave us a selfdeprecating smile and re plied truth is not for us to define guest we can but offer our incomplete thoughts they might interest you or help you to find your own truths indeed that is so rackhir said not wholly sure with what he was agreeing but judging it best to agree and we wondered if you had any suggestions on a mat ter which concerns usthe protection of our tanelorn we would not be so prideful as to interfere our own comments we are not mighty intellects the speaker re plied blandly and we have no confidence in our own decisions for who knows that they may be wrong and based on wrongly assessed information indeed said lamsar judging that he must flatter them with their own assumed humility and it is lucky for us lords that we do not confuse pride with learn ingfor it is the quiet man who observes and says little who sees the most therefore though we realise that you are not confident that your suggestions or help would be useful none the less we taking example from your own demeanour humbly ask if you know of any way in which we might rescue tanelorn rackhir had hardly been able to follow the complexi ties of lamsars seemingly unsophisticated argument but he saw that the grey lords were pleased out of the corner of his eye he observed sorana she was smiling to herself and it seemed evident by the characteristics of that smile that they had behaved in the right way now sorana was listening intently and rackhir cursed to himself that the lords of chaos would know of every thing and might even if they did gain the grey lords aid still be able to anticipate and stop any action they took to save tanelorn the speaker conferred in a liquid speech with his fel lows and said finally rarely do we have the privilege to entertain such brave and intelligent men how may our insignificant minds be put to your advantage rackhir realised quite suddenly and almost laughed that the grey lords were not very clever after all their flattery had got them the help they required he said narjhan of chaos heads a huge army of human scuma beggar armyand is sworn to tear down tane lorn and kill her inhabitants we need magical aid of some kind to combat one so powerful as narjhan and defeat the beggars but tanelorn cannot be destroyed said a grey lord she is eternal said another but this manifestation murmured the third ah yes there are beetles in kaleef said a grey lord who had not spoken before which emit a peculiar venom beetles lord said rackhir they are the size of mammoths said the third lord but can change their sizeand change the size of their prey if it is too large for their gullets as for that matter the first speaker said there is a chimera which dwells in mountains south of hereit can change its shape and contains hate for chaos since chaos bred it and abandoned it with no real shape of its own then there are four brothers of himerscahl who are endowed with sorcerous power said the second lord but the first interrupted him their magic is no good outside our own dimension he said i had thought however of reviving the blue wizard too dangerous and anyway beyond our powers said his companion they continued to debate for a while and rackhir and lamsar said nothing but waited eventually the first speaker said the boatmen of xerlerenes we have decided will probably be best equipped to aid you in defence of tanelorn you must go to the mountains of xerlerenes and find their lake a lake said lamsar in a range of mountains i see no the lord said their lake lies above the moun tains we will find someone to take you there perhaps they will aid you you can guarantee nothing else nothingit is not our business to interfere it is up to them to decide whether they will aid you or not i see said rackhir thank you how much time had passed since he had left tane lorn how much time before narjhans beggar army reached the city or had it already done so suddenly he thought of something looked for sorana but she had left the tent where lies xerlerenes lamsar was asking not in our realm one of the grey lords replied come we will find you a guide sorana spoke the necessary word which took her im mediately into the blue halfworld with which she was so familiar there were no other colours in it but many many shades of blue here she waited until eequor noticed her presence in the timelessness she could not tell how long she had waited the beggar horde came to an undisciplined and slow halt at a sign from its leader a voice rang hollowly from the helm that was always closed tomorrow we march against tanelornthe time we have anticipated is almost upon us make camp now tomorrow shall tanelorn be punished and the stones of her little houses will be dust on the wind the million beggars cackled their glee and wetted their scrawny lips not one of them asked why they had marched so far and this was because of narjhans power in tanelorn brut and zas the onehanded discussed the nature of death in quiet overcontrolled tones both were filled with sadness less for themselves than for tanelorn soon to perish outside a pitiful army tried to place a cordon around the town but failed to fill the gaps between men there were so few of them lights in the houses burned as if for the last time and candles guttered moodily sorana sweating as she always did after such an ep isode returned to the plane occupied by the grey lords and discovered that rackhir lamsar and their guide were preparing to leave eequor had told her what to doit was for her to contact narjhan the rest the lords of chaos would accomplish she blew her exlover a kiss as he rode from the camp into the night he grinned at her defiantly but when his face was turned from her he frowned and they went in silence into the valley of the currents where they entered the world where lay the mountains of xerlerenes almost as soon as they arrived danger presented itself their guide a wanderer called timeras pointed into the night sky which was spiked by the outlines of crags this is a world where the air elementals are domi nant he said look flowing downwards in an ominous sweep they saw a flight of owls great eyes gleaming only as they came nearer did the men realise that these owls were huge al most as large as a man in the saddle rackhir strung his bow timeras said how could they have learned of our presence so soon sorana rackhir said busy with the bow she must have warned the lords of chaos and they have sent these dreadful birds as the first one homed in great claws grasping great beak gaping he shot it in its feathery throat and it shrieked and swept upwards many arrows fled from his humming bowstring to find a mark while timeras drew his sword and slashed at them ducking as they whistled downwards lamsar watched the battle but took no part seemed thoughtful at a time when action was desired of him he mused if the spirits of air are dominant in this world then they will resent a stronger force of other ele mentals and he racked his brain to remember a spell rackhir had but two arrows left in his quiver by the time they had driven the owls off the birds had not been used evidently to a prey which fought back and had put up a poor fight considering their superiority we can expect more danger said rackhir some what shakily for the lords of chaos will use other means to try and stop us how far to xerlerenes not far said timeras but its a hard road they rode on and lamsar rode behind them lost in his own thoughts now they urged their horses up a steep mountain path and a chasm lay below them dropping dropping dropping rackhir who had no love for heights kept as close to the mountainside as was possible if he had had gods to whom he could pray he would have prayed for their help then the huge fish came flyingor swimmingat them as they rounded a bend they were semiluminous big as sharks but with enlarged fins with which they planed through the air like rays they were quite evidently fish timeras drew his sword but rackhir had only two ar rows left and it would have been useless against the air fish to have shot them for there were many of the fish but lamsar laughed and spoke in a highpitched stac cato speech crackhorpishtasta salaflar huge balls of flame materialised against the black skyflaring balls of multicoloured fire which shaped themselves into strange warlike forms and streamed towards the unnatural fish the flameshapes seared into the big fish and they shrieked struck at the fireballs burned and fell flaming down the deep gorge fire elementals rackhir exclaimed the spirits of the air fear such beings lamsar said calmly the flamebeings accompanied them the rest of the way to xerlerenes and were with them when dawn came having frightened away many other dangers which the lords of chaos had evidently sent against them they saw the boats of xerlerenes in the dawn at an chor on a calm sky fluffy clouds playing around their slender keels their huge sails furled the boatmen live aboard their vessels timeras said for it is only their ships which deny the laws of nature not they timeras cupped his hands about his mouth and called through the still mountain air boatmen of xer lerenes freemen of the air guests come with a request for aid a black and bearded face appeared over the side of one of the redgold vessels the man shielded his eyes against the rising sun and stared down at them then he disappeared again at length a ladder of slim thongs came snaking down to where they sat their horses on the tops of the moun tains timeras grasped it tested it and began to climb rackhir reached out and steadied the ladder for him it seemed too thin to support a man but when he had it in his hands he knew that it was the strongest he had ever known lamsar grumbled as rackhir signalled for him to climb but he did so and quite nimbly rackhir was the last following his companions climbing up through the sky high above the crags towards the ship that sailed on the air the fleet comprised some twenty or thirty ships and rackhir felt that with these to aid him there was a good chance to rescue tanelornif tanelorn survived narjhan would anyway be aware of the nature of the aid he sought starved dogs barked the morning in and the beggar horde waking from where they had sprawled on the ground saw narjhan already mounted but talking to a newcomer a girl in black robes that moved as if in a windbut there was no wind there was a jewel at her long throat when he had finished conversing with the newcomer narjhan ordered a horse be brought for her and she rode slightly behind him when the beggar army moved onthe last stage of their hateful journey to tanelorn when they saw lovely tanelorn and how it was so poorly guarded the beggars laughed but narjhan and his new companion looked up into the sky there may be time said the hollow voice and gave the order to attack howling the beggars broke into a run towards tane lorn the attack had started brut rose in his saddle and there were tears flowing down his face and glistening in his beard his huge war axe was in one gauntleted hand and the other held a spiked mace across the saddle before him zas the onehanded gripped the long and heavy broadsword with its pommel of a rampant golden lion pointed downwards this blade had won him a crown in andlermaigne but he doubted whether it would suc cessfully defend his peace in tanelorn beside him stood uroch of nieva palefaced but angry as he watched the ragged hordes implacable approach then yelling the beggars met with the warriors of tanelorn and although greatly outnumbered the war riors fought desperately for they were defending more than life or lovethey were defending that which had told them of a reason for living narjhan sat his horse aside from the battle sorana next to him for narjhan could take no active part in the battle could only watch and if necessary use magic to aid his human pawns or defend his person the warriors of tanelorn incredibly held back the roaring beggar horde their weapons drenched with blood rising and falling in that sea of moving flesh flashing in the light of the red dawn sweat now mingled with the salt tears in bruts bris tling beard and with agility he leapt dear of his black horse as the screaming beast was cut from under him the noble warcry of his forefathers sang on his breath and although in his shame he had no business to use it he let it roar from him as he slashed about him with bit ing waraxe and rending mace but he fought hopelessly for rackhir had not come and tanelorn was soon to die his one fierce consolation was that he would die with the city his blood mingling with its ashes zas also acquitted himself very well before he died of a smashed skull his old body twitched as trampling feet stumbled over it as the beggars made for uroch of nieva the goldpommelled sword was still gripped in his single hand and his soul was fleeing for limbo as uroch too was slain fighting then the ships of xerlerenes suddenly materialised in the sky and brut looking upward for an instant knew that rackhir had come at lastthough it might be too late narjhan also saw the ships and was prepared for them they skimmed through the sky the fire elementals which lamsar had summoned flying with them the spirits of air and flame had been called to rescue weak ening tanelorn the boatmen prepared their wagons and made them selves ready for war their black faces had a concen trated look and they grinned in their bushy beards warharness clothed them and they bristled with weaponslong barbed tridents nets of steel mesh curved swords long harpoons rackhir stood in the prow of the leading ship his quiver packed with slim ar rows loaned him by the boatmen below him he saw tanelorn and was relieved that the city still stood he could see the milling warriors below but it was hard to tell from the air which were friends and which were foes lamsar called to the frisking fire elementals instructing them timeras grinned and held his sword ready as the ships rocked on the wind and dropped lower now rackhir observed narjhan with sorana beside him the bitch has warned himhe is ready for us rackhir said wetting his lips and drawing an arrow from his quiver down the ships of xerlerenes dropped coursing downwards on the currents of air their golden sails bil lowing the warrior crews straining over the side and keen for battle then narjhan summoned the kyrenee huge as a stormcloud black as its native hell the kyrenee grew from the surrounding air and moved its shapeless bulk forward towards the ships of xerlerenes sending out flowing tendrils of poison towards them boatmen groaned as the coils curled around their naked bodies and crushed them lamsar called urgently to his fire elementals and they rose again from where they had been devouring beggars came together in one great blossoming of flame which moved to do battle with the kyrenee the two masses met and there was an explosion which blinded the red archer with multicoloured light and sent the ships rocking and shaking so that several capsized and sent their crews hurtling downwards to death blotches of flame flew everywhere and patches of poi son blackness from the body of the kyrenee were flung about slaying those they touched before disappearing there was a terrible stink in the aira smell of bum ing a smell of outraged elements which had never been meant to meet the kyrenee died lashing about a wailing while the flame elementals dying or returning to their own sphere faded and vanished the remaining bulk of the great kyrenee billowed slowly down to the earth where it fell upon the scrabbling beggars and killed them leav ing nothing but a wet patch on the ground for yards around a patch glistening with the bones of beggars now rackhir cried quicklyfinish the fight before narjhan summons more horrors and the boats sailed downwards while the boatmen cast their steel nets pulling large catches of beggars aboard their ships and finishing the wriggling standings with their tridents or spears rackhir shot arrow after arrow and had the satisfac tion of seeing each one take a beggar just where he had aimed it the remaining warriors of tanelorn led by brut who was covered in sticky blood but grinning in his victory charged towards the unnerved beggars narjhan stood his ground while the beggars fleeing streamed past him and the girl sorana seemed frightened looked up and her eyes met rackhirs the red archer aimed an arrow at her thought better of it and shot instead at narjhan the arrow went into the black armour but had no effect upon the lord of chaos then the boatmen of xerlernes flung down their largest net from the vessel in which rackhir sailed and they caught lord narjhan in its coils and caught so rana too shouting their exhilaration they pulled the struggling bodies aboard and rackhir ran forward to inspect their catch sorana had received a scratch across her face from the nets wire but the body of narjhan lay still and dreadful in the mesh rackhir grabbed an axe from a boatman and knocked back the helm his foot upon the chest yield narjhan of chaos he cried in mindless mer riment he was near hysterical with victory for this was the first time a mortal had ever bested a lord of chaos but the armour was empty if it had ever been occu pied by flesh and narjhan was gone calm settled aboard the ships of xerlerenes and over the city of tanelorn the remnants of the warriors had gathered in the citys square and were cheering their vic tory friagho the captain of xerlerenes came up to rack hir and shrugged we did not get the catch we came forbut these will do thanks for the fishing friend rackhir smiled and gripped friaghos black shoulder thanks for the aidyou have done us all a great service friagho shrugged again and turned back to his nets his trident poised suddenly rackhir shouted no fri agholet that one be let me have the contents of that net sorana the contents to which hed referred looked anxious as if she had rather been transfixed on the prongs of friaghos trident friagho said very well red archerthere are plenty more people on the land pulled at the net to release her she stood up shakily looking at rackhir apprehen sively rackhir smiled quite softly and said come here so rana she went to him and stood staring up at his bony hawks face her eyes wide with a laugh he picked her up and flung her over his shoulder tanelorn is safe he shouted you shall learn to love its peace with me and he began to clamber down the trailing ladders that the boatmen had dropped over the side lamsar waited for him below i go now to my her mitage again i thank you for your aid said rackhir without it tanelorn would no longer exist tanelorn will always exist while men exist said the hermit it was not a city you defended today it was an ideal that is tanelorn and lamsar smiled
