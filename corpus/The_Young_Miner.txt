the young miner the young miner or tom nelson in california chapter i the goldseekers a dozen men provided with rockers were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt mingled with golddust on the banks of a small stream in california it was in the early days and this party was but one of hundreds who were scattered over the new eldorado seeking for the shining metal which throughout the civilized world exercises a sway potent and irresistible i have said there were a dozen men but this is a mistake one of the party was a wellgrown boy of sixteen with a goodhumored and even handsome face he was something more than goodhumored however there was an expression on his face which spoke of strength and resolution and patient endurance the readers of the young adventurer will at once recognize in our young hero tom nelson the oldest son of a poor new england farmer who finding no prospects at home had joined the tide of emigrants pouring from all parts of the country to the land of which so many marvelous stories were told tom had come to work and though he doubtless shared to some extent the extravagant anticipations of the great body of eastern visitors who hoped to make a fortune in a year he did not expect to succeed without hard toil his companions belonged to the same party with whom he had crossed the plains under the leadership of phineas fletcher a broadshouldered illinois farmer who had his family with him next to tom was donald ferguson a grave scotchman and toms special friend a man of excellent principles thoroughly reliable and held in high respect by all though not possessed of popular manners on the other side was lawrence peabody a young boston clerk who had spent several years behind a drygoods counter he was soft and effeminate with no talent for roughing it and wholly unfitted for the hard work which he had undertaken he was deeply disappointed in his first work at goldhunting having come out with the vague idea that he should pick up a big nugget within a short time that would make his fortune and enable him to go home a rich man the practical side of goldseeking this washing particles of dust from the dirt of the riverbed was in the highest degree unsatisfactory and discouraging he was not a bad fellow and his companions though they laughed at him were well disposed towards him among the rest mention may be made of john miles henry scott and chapman owner of a refractory donkey named after king solomon not far away from the river were the tents occupied by the miners there was but one house roughly built of logs this was occupied by captain fletcher and his family he had not had the trouble of building it but had found it ready for occupation having been constructed by a previous party who had wandered farther down the river in search of richer washings in fact it was this building which had decided our party to remain there isnt much difference in places said fletcher we may as well stay here then why was it deserted suggested john miles dubiously thats rather against it isnt it captain not necessarily miles youve been on berrying parties havent you when at home many a time youve noticed that many of the pickers leave good places just from love of novelty and wander about the field often faring worse than if they remained where they were thats so captain then let us give this place a try well make more working steady in a medium place than wandering here there and everywhere so the whole party agreed to give the place a try there had been no brilliant success as yet but fair luck in six days tom had washed out twentyfive dollars worth of golddust in spite of awkwardness and inexperience others had done better but poor lawrence peabody had barely five dollars worth to show it must be said however that he had not averaged more than two or three hours of real labor in every twentyfour he spent the rest of the time in wandering about aimlessly or sitting down and watching the labors of his companions while he enlivened them by pathetic lamentations over his unfortunate position so far away from boston and the refining influences of civilization a little transcript of a conversation between tom and himself will throw light upon the characters of both this is beastly work sighed peabody resting from his by no means arduous labors and looking over to tom i tell you it isnt fit for a gentleman it is rather hard to keep ones hands clean mr peabody said tom but you mustnt think of the present think of the time when you will go home your pockets full of gold i dont see any prospect of it tom sighed peabody here ive been hard at work for a week and i havent got over five dollars worth of dust i have five times as much said tom some people are lucky said peabody you havent worked like tom said the scotchman plainly you havent averaged over two hours a day while tom has worked eight or ten i have worked till my back was like to break said the young man from boston i am not accustomed to manual labor mr ferguson my friend tom has worked on a farm while i have been engaged in mercantile pursuits oh why did i leave boston i am sure i cant guess said ferguson dryly i never expected anything like this what did you expect if i may be so bold as to inquire i thought i should find the gold in big nuggets worth thousands of dollars apiece i was always reading in the papers about finding them i think its a great shame to deceive people by such stories i dont believe there are any nuggets oh yes there are but they are few and far between said fletcher a neighbor of mine found one worth three thousand dollars altogether he brought home five thousand dollars and invested it in a farm and sawmill he is doing a good business when he came to california he had nothing that is what i should like captain fletcher said tom if i could only manage to carry home five thousand dollars i could make my father comfortable for life i shouldnt be satisfied with five thousand dollars said peabody whose ideas were lofty how much would satisfy you about fifty thousand said the young bostonian his face lighting up at the thought of so large a sum and what would you do with it if i may make so bold asked ferguson i would buy a nice house at the south end furnish it handsomely and live in style i suppose you would marry suggested tom smiling i probably should answered peabody gravely perhaps you have the lady already selected i have who is she asked john mills come now peabody dont be bashful it is the daughter of a boston merchant does the lady love you we understand each other answered peabody loftily she would marry me poor as i am but for her purseproud mercenary sire it will be a happy day when with my pockets full of gold i enter his presence and claim his daughters hand i wish you success mr peabody said tom i hope you have no rivals yes there is one are you not afraid of him oh no he is a fellow of no style said peabody drawing up his slender form and looking as stylish as a very dirty shirt muddy boots and a soiled suit would allow i think i shall wait awhile before getting married said tom i am afraid i wouldnt stand any chance with an heiress mr peabody do you think i can ever be stylish the bostonian understood tom to be in earnest and told him he thought in time under proper training he might become fairly stylish the conversation was interrupted by the ringing of a bell from the loghouse mrs fletcher by an arrangement with the party prepared their meals and thus they fared better than most of the early pioneers their labor gave them a good appetite and they were more solicitous about quantity than quality slow as he was at his work there was no one who exhibited greater alacrity at mealtimes than lawrence peabody at such times he was even cheerful chapter ii missouri jack at the end of a month the settlement had considerably increased a large party from missouri went to work farther up stream and a few stray emigrants also added themselves to the miners at river bend for this was the name selected by captain fletcher for the location the new arrivals were a rougher and more disorderly class than fletcher and his companions already there was a saloon devoted to the double purpose of gambling and drinking and the proprietor missouri jack no one knew his last name was doing a thriving business indeed his income considerably exceeded that of any one in the settlement neither tom nor any of his party contributed much to missouri jacks profits in consequence they had to bear the illwill and sometimes open abuse of jack and his friends come in and take a drink stranger called out jack the day after the opening of the saloon to captain fletcher no thank you it shant cost you a cent it would cost me my health returned fletcher do you mean to say i sell bad whiskey demanded jack angrily emphasizing the inquiry by an oath i dont know anything about it then what do you mean i mean that all whiskey is bad for the health replied fletcher oh youre a temperance sneak exclaimed missouri jack contemptuously i am a temperance man you may leave out the other word calmly answered fletcher youre not a man exploded jack a man thats afraid of whiskey is a a isnt half a man he isnt fit to be a woman have it as you like said fletcher unruffled i shall not drink to please any man i had a younger brother a bright promising young man poor ben was who drank himself to death hed have been alive now but for whiskey oh dry up your pious talk you make me sick exclaimed missouri jack in deep disgust next he accosted john miles who curtly declined and received in return a volley of abuse now miles was a powerful man and not possessed of fletchers selfcontrol he paused and surveyed jack with a menacing look look here stranger he said sharply just have a care how you use that tongue of yours this is a free country and if i choose to decline your whiskey theres no law against it that i know of youre a whitelivered sneak missouri jack did not proceed with his remarks for john miles seizing him by the shoulder tripped him up and strode away leaving him prostrate and pouring out a volley of curses being a bully and cowardly as most bullies are he did not pursue his broadshouldered enemy but vowed vengeance whenever a good opportunity came in fact the only one of the original miners who accepted jacks invitation was lawrence peabody step in stranger and have a drink said jack a little dubiously having met with such poor luck heretofore the young bostonian paused he was not a drinker at home but in his discontent and disappointment he was tempted my dear sir you are very polite he said i hope you aint one of them temperance sneaks said jack his brow clouding in anticipation of a refusal i assure you i am not peabody hastened to say i have participated in convivial scenes more than once in boston i dont understand college talk said jack but if you want a glass of prime whiskey just say the word i dont care if i do said peabody following his new friend into the saloon the draught of prime whiskey scorched his throat as he swallowed it down but it was followed by a sense of exhilaration and peabodys tongue was loosened youre a gentleman said missouri jack you aint like them fellows youre with theyre sneaks really you compliment me mr what may i call your name missouri jack thats the peg i hang on to my dear mr jack i am glad to know you you are really quite an accession to our settlement well if i aint my saloon is how youve managed to live so long without liquor beats me why it aint civilized it was pretty dull admitted peabody no life no amusement for all the world like a parcel of methodists what luck have you met with stranger beastly luck answered peabody i tell you mr jack californias a fraud many a time ive regretted leaving boston where i lived in style and moved in the first circles for such a place as this positively mr jack i feel like a tramp and im afraid i look like one if my fashionable friends could see me now they wouldnt know me i aint got no fashionable friends and i dont want any growled missouri jack spitting on the floor what i want is to meet gentlemen that aint afraid to drink like gentlemen i say stranger youd better leave them methodist fellers and join our gang thank you mr jack youre very kind and ill think of it said peabody diplomatically though a little exhilarated he was not quite blind to the character of the man with whom he was fraternizing and had too much real refinement to enjoy his coarseness have another drink thank you peabody drank again this time with a friend of jacks a man of his own stripe who straggled into the saloon do you play euchre asked jack producing a dirty pack of cards i know little of it said peabody but ill try a game then you and me and bill here will have a game all right said peabody glad to while away the time whatll you put up on your game stranger asked bill you dont mean to play for money do you asked peabody a little startled sartain i do whats the good of playin for nothing so the young bostonian out of his modest pile was tempted to stake an ounce of golddust though his head was hardly in a condition to follow the game intelligently he won or at least bill and jack told him he had and for the first time lawrence felt the rapture of the successful gambler as he gathered in his winnings he plays a steep game bill said jack tiptop a no i believe i do play a pretty good game said the flattered peabody my friends in boston used to say so youre hard to beat and no mistake said bill try another game im ready gentlemen said peabody with alacrity its a great deal easier earning money this way he reflected regarding complacently the two ounces of dust which represented his winnings than washing dirt out of the river and the poor dupe congratulated himself that a new way of securing the favors of fortune had been opened to him the reader will easily guess that lawrence peabody did not win the next game nor will he be surprised to hear that when he left the saloon his pockets were empty better luck next time stranger said jack carelessly take a drink before you go peabody accepted the invitation and soon after staggered into the tent occupied by tom and his friend ferguson whats the matter mr peabody asked tom are you sick yes answered peabody sinking to the floor somethings the matter with my head i dont feel well have you been to the saloon mr peabody asked ferguson yes answered the bostonian and while there you drank some of their vile whiskey didnt you im a free man mr ferguson if i choose to drink what what business is it yours none except as a friend i advise you not to go there again further inquiries elicited the facts about the gambling and ferguson and tom seriously remonstrated with peabody who however insisted that mr jack as he called him was a hospitable gentleman the dust which peabody had lost should have been paid to capt fletcher as his share of the expenses that same evening of course this was now impossible fletcher warned him that any subsequent failure from the same cause would be followed by an exclusion from his table chapter iii how tom got on about this time tom took account of stock he had come out to california with the noble and praiseworthy purpose of earning money to help his father pay off the mortgage on his little farm he was the more anxious to succeed because two hundred dollars of the amount had been raised to defray his expenses across the continent the mortgage amounting now to twentytwo hundred dollars was held by squire hudson a wealthy resident of the same town who hoped eventually to find an excuse for foreclosing the mortgage and ejecting mr nelsons family he was actuated not alone by mercenary motives but also to gratify an ancient grudge in early life mrs nelson toms mother had rejected the suit of the wealthy squire and this insult as he chose to characterize it he had never forgotten or forgiven had tom been aware of the squires feelings towards his family he never would have been willing to have the mortgage increased for his sake much as he wished to go to california but neither tom nor his father dreamed of squire hudsons secret animosity and regarded his willingness to advance the extra two hundred dollars as an evidence of friendship but i have said that tom took account of stock in other words ascertained how much he was worth first then of the money borrowed for his trip the original two hundred dollars he had twentyfive dollars left over besides this sum after paying all expenses he had accumulated by hard work and strict economy fifty dollars worth of golddust i wish father had this money said tom to his tentmate ferguson i am afraid he stands in need of it there may be a way to send it to him tom i wish there were theres one of our party going to san francisco next week he can buy a draft there and send it to your father who is going asked tom eagerly john miles you can trust him with the money tom of course i can id trust john miles with any sum whos that taking liberties with my name asked a manly voice and john miles himself stepped into the tent bending his head as he entered i hear you are going to san francisco john yes i start next week will you come back again i intend to i am going to prospect a little and buy some things for myself and captain fletcher will you do me a favor of course i will if it isnt too large a one answered miles tom explained what he wished and john miles cordially assented youre a good boy tom he said to think of your father so soon i feel anxious about him said tom he raised money to send me out here and i dont want him to suffer for it thats the right way to feel tom i wish i had a father and mother to look out for said miles soberly but youre in better luck than i both died when i was a mere lad how much do you want to send seventyfive dollars have you saved up so much already asked miles in surprise part of it i had left over when i got here will you have any left no isnt it well to reserve a little then oh i shall have some more soon answered tom sanguine as most boys are suppose you are sick if he is sick he shall suffer for nothing said the scotchman while i have money tom shall not feel the want of it thank you mr ferguson said tom gratefully that old fellow has a heart after all thought miles who had been disposed to look upon ferguson ever since their first acquaintance as rather miserly the scotchman was certainly frugal and counted his pennies carefully but he was not mean and had conceived a strong affection for his young companion whom he regarded much as a son or a nephew suppose you take the money now john said tom shall i scribble a receipt tom i am afraid my writing materials have given out i dont want any receipt said tom ill trust you without one nevertheless lad said the cautious scotchman it may be well yes tom mr ferguson is right of course i know that you trust me but if anything should happen to me any accident i mean the paper may be useful to you just as you like mr miles but i dont ask it remember that yes i will remember it and i dont mean to meet with any accident if i can help it mr ferguson can you oblige me with a pipeful of tobacco ill join you in smoking smoking was the scotchmans solitary extravagance not a costly one however as he never smoked cigars but indulged only in a democratic clay pipe john miles threw himself on the ground between tom and his scotch friend and watched complacently the wreaths of smoke as they curled upwards tom you ought to smoke he said you dont know how much enjoyment you lose dont tempt the lad said ferguson its a bad habit you smoke yourself that is true but it isnt well for a growing boy it can do him no good i smoked before i was as old as tom so did i but i wish i had not well perhaps youre right but its a comfort when a mans tired or out of spirits i am not troubled in that way said tom i mean with being out of spirits youth is a hopeful age said the scotchman when we are young we are always hoping for something good to befall us and when one is older how is it mr ferguson we fear ill more than we hope for good he replied then i want to remain young as long as i can a good wish tom some men are always young in spirit but those that have seen the evil there is in the world find it harder to be hopeful you speak as if you had had experience of the evil mr ferguson so i have answered the scotchman slowly then after a pause i will tell you about it its no secret not if it is going to pain you oh the pain is past its only a matter of money and those wounds heal only a matter of money said john miles to himself i must have misjudged ferguson i thought money was all in all with him i did not think he would speak so lightly of it when i was a young man ferguson began my father died leaving me a thousand pounds and a small annuity to my mother with this money i felt rich but i knew it would not support me nor was i minded to be idle so i began to look about me to consider what business i had best go into when a young man about my own age a clerk in a mercantile house came to me and proposed a partnership he was to put in five hundred pounds and contribute his knowledge of business which was greater than mine he was a young man of good parts and had a brisk pleasant way with him that made him a favorite in business circles i thought it was a good chance and after taking a little time for thought agreed to his proposal so the firm of mcintire and ferguson was formed we went into business and for a time all seemed to go well as my partner chose to keep the books i was not so clear as i wished to be about matters but we seemed to be prospering one morning however on coming to business i found that my partner had disappeared after possessing himself of all the money he could collect on the credit of the firm of course we were bankrupts or rather i was for he left me to bear the brunt of failure have you ever seen him since mr ferguson from that day to this twenty years i have never set eyes on sandy mcintire it was a mean trick to serve you ferguson said miles yes said the scotchman soberly i minded the loss of money but the loss of confidence was a sore thought too after all the trust i had put in that man presently miles rose to go ill take care of your money tom he said and do my best to get it safely to your father thank you john as miles left the tent he did not observe a crouching figure on the other side of it it was the figure of bill crane a crony of missouri jack in fact the man who helped him to fleece poor peabody of his scanty hoard bill looked after miles enviously i wonder how much money hes got thought bill id like some of it for im bust i must tell jack i dont dare to tackle him alone chapter iv a foiled robber in the grand rush to the newly discovered goldfields all classes were represented there were men of education representatives of all the learned professions men versed in business and along with them adventurers and men of doubtful antecedents graduates of prisons and penitentiaries bill crane introduced in the last chapter belonged to the latter undesirable class he had served a term at singsing as a housebreaker and later another term in a western penitentiary he had come to california with a prejudice against honest labor and a determination to make a living by the use of the peculiar talents on which he had hitherto relied he had spent a week at river bend chiefly at the saloon of missouri jack whom he found a congenial spirit and had picked up a little money from flats like the young bostonian but on the whole he had found it an unprofitable field for the exercise of his special talents i must make a raise somehow he bethought himself and then ill make tracks for some other settlement precisely how to raise the fund of which he stood in need was difficult to decide moneyed men were not plenty at river bend captain fletcher and his party had been at work but a short time and were not likely to have collected much as we know bill crane overheard a part of the closing conversation between tom and john miles from this he learned that miles besides his own money would be in charge of seventyfive dollars belonging to our young hero it was not much but it was something if the whole doesnt come to over two hundred dollars i can make it do thought crane it will get me out of this beastly hole and carry me to san francisco john miles slept by himself under a small tent at the northern end of the small encampment he looked like a man who ate well and slept well and this would be favorable to bill crane who proposed to effect the robbery in the night he had half a mind to secure the aid of missouri jack but then jack would expect to go shares in the plunder and there was likely to be little enough for one so bill decided to make the attempt alone in a small camp like that at river bend the movements and plans of each individual were generally known so it was generally understood that john miles intended to start on thursday for the city the previous evening he spent with tom and ferguson with whom he was more intimate than any others of the party he would not have been drawn to the scotchman but for his being toms roommate through him he came to appreciate and respect the scots sterling virtues and to overlook his dry phlegmatic manner i hope youll have good luck mr miles said tom thank you my boy i would join with my young friend tom said ferguson if i were quite clear in my mind whether good luck is the right term to use dont you think some men are luckier than others mr ferguson asked tom some men are more successful doubtless but what we call good luck generally comes from greater industry good judgment and above all the prompt use of opportunities there is something in that said miles but when two men work side by side with equal industry and one finds a nugget worth thousands of dollars while the other plods along at a few dollars a day isnt there some luck there it may be so said the scotchman cautiously but such cases are exceptional so one boy is born to an inheritance of wealth and another to an inheritance of hard work isnt there any luck there the luck may be on the side of the poor boy was the reply he is further removed from temptation john miles laughed well at any rate it seems you believe in luck after all i am sure you both wish me to be prosperous whether you call it luck or by some other name tom if i meet with any good opening that i think will suit you i shall write you you dont want to stay here particularly no the place is not so pleasant since these new people have come here missouri jack isnt a neighbor that i like he is exerting a bad influence said ferguson i am afraid peabody visits him too often for his own good he ought to have stayed in boston said miles he is not the man for such a life as ours he is too delicate to work or thinks he is and i see no other reliable road to success i saw peabody reeling out of the saloon this afternoon said tom i asked him if he considered it was hightoned to drink in a saloon as that is the word he is always using but he said it didnt make much difference out here where he wasnt known peabody isnt overstocked with brains though he does come from boston said miles ten oclock came and miles rose to go i must have a good nights rest he said for tomorrow night must see me many miles on my road tom i will attend to that commission of yours just as soon as i have the opportunity thank you mr miles john miles walked slowly toward his tent arrived there he threw himself down on his rude couch and in less than fifteen minutes he was sound asleep he had done his usual days work and made some preparations for his journey besides and these made slumber sweet and refreshing before settling himself for the night however miles carefully deposited a bag of golddust under his head wrapped up in an extra pair of pantaloons had he known that bill crane had formed a plan to rob him that very night he would have taken extra precautions but he was not inclined to be suspicious or to anticipate danger perhaps an hour later tom who found himself unusually restless got up from his hard couch leaving ferguson fast asleep and went out into the air thinking that a walk would do him good and dispose him to sleep the night was dark but not wholly so there was no moon but a few stars were shining and as his eyes became accustomed to the faint light he could easily distinguish objects at the distance of a few rods toms thoughts reverted to his humble home more than three thousand miles away probably the fact that he had committed to john miles a sum of money to send to his father had turned his thoughts in that direction father will be glad to get the seventyfive dollars thought tom and i am sure he will need it i wish it could get there more quickly but it is a long way off tom was not homesick and was far from wishing himself back with his object in coming yet unaccomplished but it did occur to him that he would like to see his father and mother and brothers and sisters if only for a few minutes when he came out he had no particular direction in mind in which he wished to walk but chance directed his steps toward the tent of his friend john miles when he came near it his attention was arrested by the sight of a crouching figure which appeared to be entering the tent his first thought was that miles like himself had got up from his couch and was just returning he was on the point of calling out john when a sudden doubt and suspicion silenced him might not it be a robber tom was determined to find out he crept nearer so that he could have a clearer view of the figure its bill crane he said to himself with sudden recognition whats he up to tom could guess he didnt know the mans antecedents but he had read his character aright he was instantly on the alert crane evidently was on a thiefs errand and was likely to steal not only miless money but toms our hero was alive to the emergency and resolved to foil him he had his revolver with him for in the unsettled state of society with no one to enforce the laws and indeed no laws to enforce it was the custom for all men to go armed tom was not long left in doubt as to cranes intentions he saw him cautiously pulling at something in the tent and felt sure that it was the bag of treasure he decided that the time had come to act put that back he exclaimed in boyish but clear commanding tone bill crane turned suddenly panicstricken he saw tom standing a few feet from him with a revolver in his hand all was not lost he might he thought intimidate the boy mind your business you young cub he growled what are you about demanded tom i am going to sleep with miles he invited me does that satisfy you no it doesnt for i know that its a lie you are here to rob him youd better not insult me boy or ill have your life get up this instant and leave the tent or ill fire said tom resolutely a young cub like you cant frighten me that shootingiron of yours isnt loaded said bill crane rather uneasily itll be rather a bad thing for you to take the risk said tom with a coolness that surprised himself for the situation was a strange one for a boy brought up in a quiet new england farming town what do you want of me growled the desperado uncomfortably for he was satisfied that the weapon was loaded and tom looked as if he would shoot i want you to leave that tent at once said tom suppose i dont then i shall fire at you and be hung for attempted murder i think i could explain it said our hero you know very well what will happen to you if you are caught bill crane did know hanging was the penalty for theft in the early days of california and he had no desire to swing from the branch of a tree youre a young fool he said roughly as he rose from his stooping posture i wanted to ask miles to do a little commission for me in frisco i had no thought of robbing him you can see him in the morning about it said tom resolutely ill be even with you for this said the foiled thief as he sullenly obeyed the boy halfashamed to do so tom went back to his tent aroused ferguson and the two took turns in guarding the tent of miles during the night tom did not wish to awaken him for he needed rest on the eve of a long and fatiguing journey chapter v miles sets out on his journey when miles woke up in the morning he found tom beside him hallo tom he said in some surprise this is an early call i have been here half the night said tom quietly how is that i was afraid you would be robbed did you have any particular reason for fearing it asked miles quickly thereupon tom described his chance visit of the evening before and what he saw as might have been expected john miles was indignant the miserable sneak id like to wring his neck he exclaimed did you say he had his hand upon the bag of golddust tom yes i distinctly saw him attempting to draw it out from under your head if the boys knew of this cranes fate would be sealed a thief in a mining camp has a short shrift you mean he would be hung asked tom in surprise yes he would grace a limb of yonder tree and i am not sure but it would be the best way to dispose of him tom shuddered it would be a terrible fate he said i should like to see him punished but i dont want him hanged then you will have to keep your mouth shut once let the boys get hold of what happened and nothing will save him then i shall keep it to myself i will see crane and let him understand that i am aware of the attempt he made said miles after breakfast he came upon crane within a few rods of missouri jacks saloon look here bill crane said miles ive got something to say to you what is it returned crane sullenly looking ill at ease i understand you favored me with a visit last night who told you so tom nelson the young cub had better mind his own business growled crane in a menacing tone he did me a service in preventing your intended theft if he says i meant to rob you he lies nevertheless if he should make public what he saw the boys would be likely to believe him rather than you said miles significantly is he going to tell asked crane nervously he has told me but is not likely to speak of it to others being unwilling that you should suffer the punishment you deserve he is very kind sneered bill crane but he felt very much relieved you probably owe your life to his kindness said miles quietly he tells me you wish me to do something for you in frisco ive changed my mind said crane abruptly i may go there myself soon miles smiled i thought it might be something urgent he said since it led you to come to my tent at midnight i thought you would be starting away early this morning well thought of bill crane but it is only fair to tell you that i dont believe a word you say i have one thing to say to you before i go and you had better bear it in mind if you harm a hair of tom nelsons head and i believe you quite capable of it i will never rest till i have found you out and punished you for it i am not afraid of you john miles retorted crane but he looked uncomfortable you will have cause to be if you injure tom miles walked off leaving behind him a bitter enemy i hate him him and the boy too muttered bill crane if i dared i would put my mark on him before he leaves the camp but crane did not dare he knew that he was in a very critical position his safety depended on the silence of two persons one of whom would soon be gone he was not aware that ferguson also knew of his attempted crime or the danger would have seemed greater however much he thirsted for vengeance it would not do to gratify it now he must bide his time bill crane was cunning as well as malignant he decided to quiet toms suspicions if he could and ensure his continued silence by an affectation of friendliness he waited till he saw our hero washing dust beyond earshot of any listeners and strolled up to him how are you getting on tom he asked with an appearance of friendliness tom looked up quickly considering all that had happened he was somewhat struck by cranes effrontery fairly well he answered coldly shant i relieve you a few minutes proposed crane no thank you its pretty hard work and dont pay as well as it might i think californias a humbug for my part have you tried washing for gold asked tom i havent seen you at work not here ive tried it elsewhere but its slow then why do you stay here asked tom naturally crane shrugged his shoulders because i havent money to get away he said im waiting for something to turn up if i could only get to frisco i would go into some business i would like to have gone with miles was that what you were going to propose to him last night asked tom dryly yes i wanted to speak to him on that subject i had a great mind to ask him to lend me a little money and take me along with him i would have arranged to pay him soon after we reached frisco tom knew that the fellow was lying and remained silent you made a little mistake about my intentions continued bill crane smoothly but perhaps it was natural under the circumstances tom thought it was but still preserved silence much to cranes discomfiture bill crane eyed him sharply and saw his incredulity but for that he cared little if only he could secure his silence i think you will see that it isnt fair to me to speak of this matter he continued i had made up my mind not to speak of it said tom i dont want to get you into trouble goodmorning mr crane said lawrence peabody who had just come up goodmorning peabody i was watching our friend tom how are you getting on i havent done anything yet today its dirty work i dont think its fit for a gentleman tom there is used to work and he dont mind shall we go round to jacks all right and the two walked away together i am sorry peabody doesnt keep better company tom said to himself bill crane wont do him any good chapter vi robbed in his sleep tom was right in concluding that bill cranes influence over peabody was anything but good the young bostonian however was not long subjected to it during the night following john miless departure the little settlement at river bend was called upon to deplore the loss of an eminent member in brief somewhere between midnight and dawn mr william crane took his departure without the ceremony of leavetaking had he gone alone no one perhaps would have felt any violent sorrow but he took with him a horse belonging to adam dietrich an industrious young german who had only recently arrived no one had seen the two go together but it was only natural to suppose that crane had spirited away the horse dietrich borrowed a horse and accompanied by a friend set out in search of the thief but returned at night unsuccessful had it been wet weather it might have been possible to track the fugitive but it was very dry and the trail was soon lost it was almost impossible to tell what direction crane would choose and continued pursuit would not pay so adam sadly returned to his work little doubt was entertained among the miners that crane was responsible for the loss of the horse had he been caught there would have been small chance for him so generally was he pronounced guilty a few of his companions especially missouri jack defended him bill crane wouldnt steal a horse any more than i would said jack and there were those who agreed with him without acquitting bill bill aint no saint but he aint a thief whether jack believed what he said admits of a doubt crane needed a different advocate to clear him from suspicion it may as well be stated that crane did steal the horse he had a decided objection to walking as long as he could ride and having no animal of his own annexed the property of his neighbor he had two motives which influenced him to leave the settlement first he was in toms power and he was by no means certain that our hero would keep silence touching his nightattempt at robbery in the second place he still coveted the bag of golddust which john miles carried away with him he had been prevented from taking it but as miles was travelling alone he foresaw a better chance of success if he should follow on his track how or under what circumstances he should make the new attempt he left to be decided later the first thing obviously was to overtake him crane experienced the same difficulty in tracking miles that had led to the failure of his own pursuers it was only on the fifth day that as he halted his steed on the hillside and cast long glances about him he caught sight a mile away of the object of his pursuit he could not mistake the sturdy broadshouldered figure and large massive head thats miles sure enough he exclaimed joyfully i thought i had missed him but im in luck that bag must be mine the most direct course was to ride up in the fashion of a highwayman and demand the bag but crane did not mean to proceed in this fashion physically though not a weak man he was not a match for miles and he knew it cunning must supply the place of strength he knew that miles was a sound sleeper and could think of no better plan than repeating the visit he had made in camp it was already late in the afternoon when he caught sight of the sturdy miner it was his policy now to keep him in sight but not to approach near enough for recognition once seen miles would be on his guard and the game would be spoiled crane halted therefore and drew back within the shadow of the trees henceforth advancing cautiously john miles did not once turn back had he done so it is quite possible that he might have caught a glimpse of his pursuer he had travelled since morning and his faithful horse was beginning to show signs of fatigue you are tired my poor dick he said kindly stroking the horse you deserve supper and rest and you shall have it dick appeared to understand what his rider said for he gave a short neigh of satisfaction john miles looked around him just ahead was a large tree under whose broad branches it would be pleasant to recline not far away was a slender mountainstream trickling over the rocks nothing could have been better miles slid from his horse and made preparations to encamp for the night first leading his faithful steed to the stream where he quenched his thirst then he brought out his slender stock of provisions and partook of supper its pleasant to rest after a long days ride soliloquized miles i must have made forty miles today i could easily have gone farther had it been on the prairies at home but these mountainroads are hard upon man and beast after supper miles threw himself upon the ground and his mind became busy with his plans and prospects i shall reach frisco in three days according to my calculations he reflected and then first of all i must attend to toms commission thats a good boy tom i wish he were here with me tonight why didnt i urge him to come with me he is not doing very well where he is and there are plenty of chances for a smart boy in the city if i find any opening for him i will send for him i dont know what gives me such an interest in that boy but id sooner do him a good turn than any man i know i hope that thief crane wont play any trick upon him if he does i swear ill get even with him john miles little suspected that he himself stood in more peril from the man he denounced than our hero had he known that bill crane was lurking in the vicinity he would scarcely have courted slumber so fearlessly physical fatigue and the stillness of outward nature speedily brought on a feeling of drowsiness that was not long in bringing sleep twilight had hardly given place to night when our traveller had become to dumb forgetfulness a prey this was what bill crane had been waiting for he rightly calculated that miles would soon be asleep he inferred this from his own feelings he too had travelled many miles and felt drowsy but with the object he had in view near accomplishment he was able to resist the promptings of nature crane rode till he was but a few rods from miles then dismounted and tethered his horse with stealthy step he approached the sleeper with satisfaction he regarded the upturned face of the man whom if waking he would have feared and noted his deep regular breathing you wouldnt sleep so sound john miles he said to himself if you knew i was standing over you how easily i could put a bullet into you but then i wouldnt have the satisfaction of anticipating your disappointment when you wake up and find your treasure gone no you may live i have no use for your life that is if you dont wake up in that case i may have to kill you the bag of golddust lay under the head of miles he knew of no better place for it calculating that any attempt at removal would arouse him so it might under ordinary circumstances but unusual fatigue made him sleep like a log bill crane kneeled down and by delicate manipulation succeeded in drawing the bag from beneath the sleepers head lest the removal of the pillow might awaken miles he replaced it by a coat which he folded up so as to produce about the same elevation above the ground the transfer was made without in the least interfering with the slumbers of the tired traveller bill crane rose to his feet triumphant not only was he possessed of a sum of which he stood sorely in need but he had the satisfaction of outwitting his adversary moreover he had obtained toms money in addition and thus revenged himself upon the boy who had once thwarted him goodby john miles he said lifting his hat mockingly sorry to inconvenience you but cant help it a long sleep and pleasant dreams thus speaking he turned away unconscious that he had been observed by a third party chapter vii the heathen chinee this third party belonged to that peculiar race immortalized by bret harte he was a heathen chinee his face was smooth and bland and wore an expression of childlike innocence which was well calculated to deceive ah sin possessed the usual craft of his countrymen and understood very well how to advance his worldly fortunes he belonged to the advance guard of immigrants from the central flowery kingdom and with a companion ah jim was engaged in mining in the immediate neighborhood his gains had not been great thus far but then his expenses had amounted to little or nothing he and his friend had brought two bags of rice from san francisco and they were well satisfied with this solitary article of diet ah sin from a distance had seen john miles encamp for the night and impelled by curiosity or a more questionable motive had approached to take a view of the stranger before reaching him he caught sight of bill crane and his almond eyes straightway watched the movements of that gentleman while he himself kept sufficiently in the background to escape observation when he saw crane stealthily remove the bag from under the sleepers head he became very much interested and a bland smile overspread his face while his cue vibrated gently with approval melican man very smart he murmured to himself he steal his friends money while he sleep my readers are probably aware that our mongolian visitors find a difficulty in pronouncing the letter r and invariably replace it by l suppose other melican man wake up he make a low continued ah sin softly but the other melican man did not wake up and bill crane got away with his booty as we already know cautiously the chinaman followed him and ascertained where he intended to pass the night it was at a moderate distance from the cabin which the two chinamen had selected for their mining camp bill crane jumped from his horse stretched his limbs and gaped im powerful sleepy he soliloquized i cant go any farther tonight i dont like to rest so near miles but i can be on the road before he wakes up i guess it will be safe enough crane having made up his mind to rest rolled himself up in his blanket and stretched himself out first tying his horse to a sapling the place was retired and he felt moderately confident that even if he overslept himself he would not be discovered id like to see miles when he discovers his loss he said to himself smiling at the thought hell be ready to tear his hair and wont have the least idea how the golddust was spirited away you excel me in brute strength john miles but one thing i am pretty sure of you havent got my brains and he complacently tapped his forehead there must be at least two hundred dollars worth in that bag he reflected it isnt a great haul but it will do it will last me some time and perhaps start me in something in frisco bill crane youve done a good stroke of business today you are entitled to a good nights rest and you shall have it first however he concealed the bag he did not think it safe to place it under his head as miles had done he scooped a hole in the earth near by deposited the bag replaced the dirt and spread a few leaves over the top no one will think of searching there thought crane even if miles himself surprises me here he wont suspect anything bill crane felt that he was unusually sharp and crafty and felt great contempt for the stupidity of the man whom he had overreached the time was not far off when he had occasion to doubt whether he had not overrated his own artfulness a pair of almond eyes lighted up with mild wonder followed closely all the movements of william crane when the bag was concealed and crane lay down to sleep the chinaman nodded blandly and remarked softly all light me go find ah jim ah sin had to walk but half a mile to find the partner of his toils ah sin and ah jim though not related to each other were as like as two peas the same smooth face the same air of childlike confidence the same almond eyes a pigtail of the same length a blouse and loose pants of the same coarse cloth were characteristic of both when the two met they straightway plunged into a conversation in which ah sin had most to say ah jim listened attentively and was evidently well pleased with what his companion said i am afraid my young friends are not well up in the chinese tongue and would not understand the conversation however faithfully reported they must infer what it was from what followed the two chinamen bent their steps towards the restingplace of bill crane ah sin carried a bag of about the same size as the one crane had stolen which he carefully filled with sandy earth with stealthy steps these two innocent heathen drew near the spot and looked searchingly at the recumbent form of the eminent representative of american civilization ah sin turned to ah jim with a pleased smile all light he said melican man asleep a similar smile lighted up the face of ah jim melican man sleep sound he said no wake up quite unaware of the honor done him by the special chinese embassy which had taken this early opportunity to call upon him bill crane slept on there was a smile upon his upturned face as if he were dreaming of something pleasant he should have been a prey to remorse if his conscience had done its duty but bills conscience had grown callous and gave him very little trouble it was only when he was found out that he became sensible of a kind of mental discomfort which came as near to remorse as he was capable of feeling reassured by the deep regular breathing of the sleeper ah sin and his friend proceeded to their work the former drew a slender stilettolike knife from a fan which protruded above the collar of his blouse and stooping down began skilfully to remove the dirt which covered the bag of golddust from time to time he stole a glance at the sleeper to mark the first indications of returning consciousness it was well for crane that his sleep continued a chinaman does not set a high value upon human life and the long stiletto would have been plunged into the melican man before he was well aware of what was going on bill cranes good genius saved him from this sudden exit by continuing the profound slumber in which he was repairing the ravages of fatigue the chinamen therefore met with no interruption in their work they drew out from its place of concealment the buried bag and emptying the contents of their own poured into it the combined treasures of miles and poor tom then they filled the first bag with the worthless dust which they had brought with them and carefully reburied it in the ground they did their work so carefully and well that no one was likely to suspect that the bag had been tampered with having done their work ah sin and his friend smiled upon each other in bland satisfaction which was further expressed by a low guttural chuckle all light said ah sin with a nod all light chimed in ah jim nodding in return a consciousness of lofty virtue could not have produced a happier expression upon any face than appeared on the mild countenance of the chinamen melican man much supplised when he wake up remarked ah jim chinamen make much money returned his friend the two enterprising visitors returned to their quarters and concealed their booty in a safe place then they too lay down and slept the sleep of confiding innocence bret harte has not told us whether the heathen chinee has a conscience but if he has neither ah sin nor ah jim experienced any inconvenience from its possession neither they nor bill perhaps can fairly be taken as fair representatives of the different religious systems under which they were trained bill crane could hardly claim any superiority over the heathen chinee in point of honesty chapter viii bill cranes disagreeable discovery it was five oclock in the morning when bill crane opened his eyes he felt refreshed by his nights sleep yet under ordinary circumstances would have deferred getting up for at least an hour but the consciousness that he had a treasure to guard and the knowledge that he was at any moment liable to be called to account by the real owner whose camp was scarcely more than a mile distant aroused him to exertion i must get away while john miles is still asleep he bethought himself let me get to frisco first and i can at once dispose of it and he will never find me out crane did not wait to prepare breakfast that he could take on the road an hour or two later when he felt safe from interruption he rose and shook himself this was his scanty toilet next he must take the bag from its place of concealment and then he could commence his journey while uncovering the bag crane did not discover that it had been tampered with partly because it was still there it was natural to suppose that if discovered by a third party it would be carried away he did not even open the bag not thinking it necessary john miles hasnt waked up yet he said to himself with a smile when he does therell be some swearing ill be bound youre a good boy john miles but you aint so smart as you think you are i think i have got the start of you this time bill crane rode off smiling his course led him by the camp of the chinamen early as it was they were astir ah sin saw the rider and at once recognized him as the man he had robbed how could crane know that those pleasantfaced barbarians had served him such a trick hallo chinamen he said aloud have they got out here already ill speak to them hallo john he said halting his horse for even then every chinaman was john how do john replied ah sin smiling blandly my name isnt john but no matter what are you two doing looking for gold was the reply do you find any velly little bad place have you been in san francisco yes john why didnt you stay there too many chinamen too little washee washee what have you got in the way of provisions mine are stale id like to buy some of you we have got a little lice john got a little what oh i know you mean rice why dont you pronounce your english better because chinamen not melican men then i suppose i may as well be moving on as i cant get anything out of you oh have you got any tea john yes john got any made ah sin produced a cup for he and his friend had just prepared their breakfast and being warm bill crane gulped it down with a relish after all a man needs some warm drink in the morning he said to himself how much to pay john nothing john melican man welcome john youre a gentleman or rather both of you are gentlemen even if you are heathens ill remember you in my prayers the eminent christian bill crane rode off from the chinese camp calmly confident of his moral superiority to the two benighted heathen whom he left behind him whether he remembered his promise to intercede for them in prayer is a little doubtful or would have been if he had had occasion to pray himself it is to be feared that prayer and william crane had long been strangers as crane rode away the two chinamen exchanged glances a gentle smile lighted up their yellow faces and they were doubtless thinking of something pleasant they exchanged a few guttural remarks which i should like to be able to translate for they doubtless referred to bill crane whom they had kindly supplied with a cup of tea gratis yet perhaps considering all things it was the dearest cup of tea crane had ever drank since it was the only return he got for a bag of golddust worth over two hundred dollars but there is an old saying where ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise crane was just as happy as if the bag really contained golddust but this happy ignorance was not to last long after riding five or six miles our traveller thought he might venture to dismount for rest and refreshment he selected as his breakfasttable the green sward beside a sparkling mountain streamlet he dismounted permitting his horse to graze while he took out the stale provisions which must constitute his morning meal they were not very palatable and crane sighed for the breakfasts of old the memory of which at this moment was very tantalizing but he comforted himself with the thought that he had the means of making up for his enforced selfdenial when he reached san francisco this naturally led him to open the bag and feast his eyes over his easily obtained wealth he untied the string and with a smile of pleased anticipation peered at the contents his face changed suddenly was he dreaming in place of the shining dust his eyes rested on sand he hastily thrust in his finger and stirred the grains but nothing else was to be discovered the bag contained nothing but worthless sand crane stared at the deceptive bag in the most lugubrious astonishment surely the bag contained golddust when he concealed it there could be no doubt on that point for he had opened it and seen the contents for himself but in that case how could such a change have been effected in one night it had not been touched so at any rate he believed he had found it in the morning in the exact spot where he had placed it overnight and yet bill crane took another look at the contents of the bag hoping that he had been deceived by some ocular delusion but the second examination brought him no comfort he sank back feeling in a state of mental and bodily collapse never was poor thief so utterly bewildered as bill crane he could almost believe that some magical transformation had been practiced at his expense was it possible he thought that john miles discovering his loss had visited him and played this trick upon him he could not believe this it was not in accordance with johns direct straightforward nature instead of acting in this secret manner he would have sternly charged crane with the robbery and punished him on the spot leaving him out of the account then the mystery deepened it never occurred to crane to suspect the chinamen who had so hospitably furnished him with a cup of tea even if they had come into his mind he would have been puzzled to account for their knowledge of his having the bag in his possession bill crane was decidedly unhappy his glowing anticipations of prosperity based upon the capital contained in the bag were rudely broken in upon and the airy fabric of his hopes dashed to the ground he felt that fortune had been unkind that he was a deeply injured man had his claim to the stolen property been the best possible he could not have felt the injustice of fate more keenly its always the way he exclaimed in deep dejection i always was unlucky just as i thought i was on my feet again this cursed golddust turns to sand here am i out in the wilderness without an ounce to my name i dont know what to do id give a good deal if i had it to find out what became of the golddust as he spoke crane in a fit of illtemper kicked the unlucky bag to a distance and slowly and disconsolately mounting his horse plodded on his way all his cheerfulness was gone it was some comfort but still scant to think that john miles was as unlucky as himself both had become penniless tramps and were alike the sport of fortune there was a difference in respect to their desert however john miles may rightly claim the readers sympathy while bill crane must be considered to have met with a disaster which he richly deserved chapter ix cleaned out john miles slept long and awoke feeling refreshed and cheerful he had a healthy organization and never failed to eat and sleep well like crane he had no toilet to make but sprang to his feet already dressed his first thought was naturally of his treasure his heart gave a quick bound when he failed to discover it in the place where he remembered to have put it in dismay he instituted a search which of course proved unavailing who could have taken it thought miles large drops of perspiration gathering upon his forehead all about him was loneliness he could see no signs of life yet the bag could not have gone away of itself there was certainly human agency in the matter miles confessed to himself with sadness that he had been imprudent to leave the bag where it would naturally excite the cupidity of any passing adventurer that it must have been taken by such a one seemed evident in that case the chance of recovering it seemed slender enough nevertheless john miles decided to make an effort hopeless as it was to discover the whereabouts of his lost property if it had been mine i wouldnt have cared so much he said to himself with a sigh but poor toms money is gone too i will make it up to him if i live but i am afraid his father will be inconvenienced by the delay miles made preparations for his departure and strode away looking searchingly to the right and left in search of something that might throw light upon his loss presently he espied the two chinamen could they have taken it he would at any rate speak to them goodmorning john he said when he came within hearing distance ah sin bobbed his head and repeated goodmorning john do you live here yes we washeewashee for gold does anyone else live near by the two inclined their heads and answered in the negative have you seen anyone pass last night or this morning yes answered ah sin melican man stay all nightee over there chinaman give him a cup of tea this morning how long ago asked miles eagerly two hours answered ah jim in what direction did he go the two chinamen readily told him miles decided to tell them of the loss of his bag of golddust possibly they could throw some light upon his loss some one stole a small bag of dust from me last night he said i suspect it was the man you describe did he appear to have any such article with him yes answered ah sin who with natural cunning saw that this information would divert suspicion from them it was so large indicating the size with his hands of course his description was accurate for he had very good reason to know the size of the bag he must have been the thief said miles eagerly in what direction did you say he went ah sin pointed to the west i will follow him it is on my way if i catch the villain it will be the worse for him he velly bad man said ah sin sympathizingly thats where you are right my heathen friend well goodmorning john i am much obliged to you for your information velly welcome john as john miles rode away ah sin turned to his friend ah jim and remarked spose he catch him he kill him all lightee returned ah jim he velly bad man he thief the two chinamen exchanged glances if they had been white men there would have been a smile or a wink but these children of confucius looked so serenely virtuous so innocent of guile that the most experienced detective would have seen nothing in their faces indicating any guilty knowledge of the lost treasure but guileless as they seemed they had proved more than a match for bill crane and his victim john miles rode away with a faint hope that he might overtake the man whoever he might be who had stolen his precious bag in due time he reached the spot where crane had examined the bag and on discovering its worthless contents had thrown it away the thief had not taken the trouble to empty it when miles saw it he hurried to it hoping he might find some of the treasure inside of course he was disappointed and at the same time bewildered this is certainly my bag he said to himself here are my initials j m then there are other marks well known to me i could swear to it anywhere but how does it happen that it is full of sand and why has the thief thrown it away that beats me miles decided that for some reason unknown the thief had transferred its contents to some other bag perhaps his own and then had discarded the original one in wanton humor filling it instead with sand he may have been afraid it would be found on him thought miles the marks on the bag would have been evidence enough to condemn him by throwing away my bag he thinks himself safe his solution of the puzzle was ingenious but as we know he erred in two respects bill crane had not filled the bag with sand and thrown it away from prudential considerations nor had he profited by the theft he had committed he had been as badly outwitted as his victim and the profit had gone to the bland and obliging chinamen who had thus far escaped suspicion john miles slackened his rein and thought seriously and sadly of the position to which he was reduced what was he to do he was in the expressive language of the country cleaned out and brought to a pass where he must begin life over again with the disadvantage of being seventyfive dollars in debt for he was resolved that toms loss should be paid back to the uttermost penny presently philosophy came to his aid it might have been worse he reflected two hundred dollars is too large a sum to lose but it wont take long to make up if i have any sort of luck i wish i were in san francisco it may trouble me to get there without means when misfortune comes it is always best to look it manfully in the face and not to shrink from or over estimate it john miles had a strong healthy nature with a good deal of confidence in his own resources and in an hour or two he was again looking hopefully forward to the future not that he cherished a hope of recovering his lost money there seemed to be no way of identifying it even if he should track the thief one ounce of golddust looks like another and there is no way of distinguishing individual property in that form john miles pushed on slowly about noon he found himself threading a narrow caсon shaded by gigantic redwood tress with steep almost perpendicular sides with here and there a narrow streamlet descending in a cascade and lighting up the darkened scene with its silvery reflections this is a pretty spot but it would be lonely to live here thought miles yet shading his eyes there seems to be a cabin of some sort is it possible that anybody lives in this caсon ten minutes ride brought him to a rude cabin with a gigantic tree spreading at a great height protecting branches over it that it was inhabited was clear for in front of it stood a strongly built robust woman who seemed to be nearing forty she bent a searching look upon the intruder who bent his head courteously goodmorning maam said miles goodmorning stranger was the reply where might you be going i am on my way to the city am i on the right track i reckon so do you live here alone asked john miles in some curiosity it looks like it doesnt it returned the woman ive been alone since my man pegged out is that long a matter of three weeks i sympathize with you said miles you must be very lonely yes said the widow jim was good company and i feel kind of lonesome without him you better believe there isnt much sentiment there thought miles she doesnt appear to be heartbroken do you mean to stay here alone he inquired are you not afraid whats there to be afraid of some tramp or adventurer might attack and injure or at least rob you look here stranger do you see that and the woman produced a revolver do you see that shootingiron it looks as if it might be a good one said miles who began to think the woman better able to take care of herself than he had at first supposed you bet it is i know how to use it too if one of them tramps gets in front of it and sasses me hed better say his prayers mighty quick for hell need em he neednt reckon much on my being a woman i can shoot jest as true as my man could when he was alive chapter x a california widow john miles eyed the woman curiously there did not seem much that was feminine left in her life in the wilderness had made her as bold and selfreliant as a man she was not compelled to plead for womans rights she resolutely took a mans rights and was prepared to maintain them against all comers i rather think you can take care of yourself maam he said you can bet your bottom dollar on that stranger said the woman cheerfully brown thats my husband knew what i was we was ekal partners brown and me and he knew too much to tread on me im glad i wasnt brown thought john miles when i marry itll be a woman and not a man in petticoats if youre hungry stranger said the woman just jump off that horse of yours and come in i can give you a square meal and i reckon you havent had one lately you are right mrs brown said miles dismounting with alacrity my provisions are dry and stale and i shall enjoy a square meal amazingly but i ought to tell you that last night i was robbed of a bag of golddust and i have nothing to pay you who asks for pay returned the woman i dont keep a hotel but im tired of eating alone i want to see how it seems to have a man setting opposite me agin so come in and i wont keep you waiting long thank you mrs brown if you dont mind ill light my pipe and sit out here till ive had a smoke you can smoke inside if you want to i always let brown it makes me feel better now that hes pegged out that i didnt deny him any of his little comforts clearly mrs brown was a considerate wife thought miles but she doesnt look like a woman to fall in love with tying his horse he threw himself down on the grass and enjoyed the luxury of a smoke while mrs brown was heard bustling about inside preparing the square meal which she had promised to her unexpected guest presently she reappeared the victuals is ready if you are stranger she said i am ready mrs brown said miles rising at once and entering the cabin the cabin was rough and illadapted to a fastidious tenant but it looked comfortable what attracted miles most however was a table set in the middle of the floor covered with a substantial and appetizing meal mrs brown was a fair cook perhaps her only feminine accomplishment she placed miles at the head of the table and seated herself opposite him she watched his attacks upon the fare she had provided with evident satisfaction i hope you like it she said mrs brown i havent tasted anything so good for a long time she nodded with a pleased look brown allus liked my cookin she said he had a good appetite most generally and it was a pleasure to see him eat its kinder lonesome cookin for yourself then too it takes away my appetite sittin down alone to eat you must be very lonely mrs brown yes its lonesome like bein a widder im kinder used to seein a man about the house so i suppose be you a married man asked the lady pointedly no maam how old be you twentyeight answered miles rather amused then youre old enough to get married oh yes i am old enough be you in love with any girl the old womans getting curious thought miles however i dont mind gratifying her curiosity no im not in love he replied mrs brown eyed him thoughtfully she seemed to be revolving some plan in her mind take a good look at me stranger she said bracing herself up as if on exhibition certainly said john miles considerably astonished i want to ask you a few questions go ahead mrs brown am i humpbacked certainly not who said you were just attend to my questions if you please stranger am i squinteyed mrs brown must be crazy thought miles however he answered in the negative am i as homely as a hedgefence pursued the widow has anybody been calling you so if so tell me who it is never you mind stranger am i old and wrinkled certainly shes out of her mind thought miles i must humor her i think you are a very goodlooking woman he said soothingly no im not said the strongminded lady but at the same time i aint a scarecrow certainly not dont talk too much stranger i expect youre surprised at my questions but ill come to the pint at once im tired of livin here alone i didnt think id miss brown so much he wasnt any great shakes of a man but he was better than nothing he was company for me brown was in the long evenins and i miss him ive made up my mind to take on somebody in his place and i reckon id like to engage you stranger will you marry me mrs brown did not blush when she asked this extraordinary question she was entirely selfpossessed and could not have been cooler if she had been transacting an ordinary piece of business john miles had never before received a proposal of marriage he felt as awkward and confused as a young girl and began to hesitate and stammer really mrs brown he began you have taken me by surprise i expect i have said the widow but ill give you time to think it over brown left me i pretty comfortable though i did more to get the property together than he you wouldnt think it perhaps but ive got five thousand dollars in gold hid away somewheres near and theres a claim not far away that belongs to me and will pay for workin i am glad you are so well off mrs brown said miles if you marry me continued the widow you can work that claim youre a strong ablebodied man and a year from now if you want to well go to the city and settle down im older than you but a matter of a few years dont make much difference you were robbed you told me yes of all that i had how much was it about two hundred dollars that aint much its a good deal when its all you have answered miles if you marry me you wont miss it said mrs brown i wont give you my money right off for you might run off with it but at the end of the first year you shall have half of it theres a parson a few miles up the caсon at dirt hole that will marry us any time we ride over what do you say stranger it was an embarrassing moment for john miles he had no desire to succeed the deceased brown notwithstanding the little property he had left behind him mrs brown did not in the least resemble the wife of whom he had sometimes dreamed but how could he decline without exciting the resentment of that singular female he bore in mind that mrs brown carried a revolver and she might take a notion to shoot him down he must temporize your proposal is a very kind and flattering one mrs brown but i dont care to marry just at present i want to go to the city and try my fortune ive only lately arrived in california and i am not ready to settle down yet to his relief mrs brown accepted his objection in good part no offence stranger she said i didnt know how you might feel about it ive made you a fair offer indeed you have the time may come when i shall return and i wont promise to wait for you stranger somebody else may happen along thatll take the situation it would be too much to expect you to wait for me i admit all right stranger youve answered fair and now well let the matter drop when miles left the cabin he carried with him an addition to his stock of provisions for which he was indebted to mrs browns liberality it was evident that she bore no malice notwithstanding her suit had been rejected chapter xi bill cranes good luck about an hour after john miles rode away from the widows door mr william crane came in sight of the cabin he had strayed from the direct course and that had delayed him otherwise he would not have fallen behind miles bill crane was in rather a melancholy mood he had not got over his disappointment of the morning he was fagged out and hungry and felt that luck was against him when he saw the cabin and the widow brown sitting in the doorway it instantly occurred to him that here was a chance to get a dinner he had nothing to pay to be sure but he need say nothing about it till after the dinner was eaten as he rode up he removed his hat and said goodday maam mrs brown scrutinized the newcomer with critical eyes she decided that he was not as goodlooking as john miles indeed bill crane never could have been accounted handsome but on this point the widow was not exacting she was looking for somebody to fill the place of her lamented brown and relieve her loneliness and it was cranes eligibility in this respect that she was considering beauty was but skin deep as mrs brown was practical enough to admit and she was not overstocked with that attractive quality herself though crane did not know it the resolute middleaged female from whom he hoped to obtain a gratuitous dinner was making up her mind to offer him the position of husband goodday stranger she answered composedly are you travelin fur im thinkin of goin to frisco he said but its a long journey and im fagged out if you have no objection ill stop at your place and see if i can rest a few minutes you can stop if you want to she said i dont see much company and i like to see a new face now and then so do i said crane thinking a little flattery might help him especially when its the face of a goodlooking woman i aint goodlookin enough to hurt me returned mrs brown with a frankness which rather disconcerted and puzzled crane but i dont mind you callin me so if you are anyways hungry i havent cleared away the dinner and you are very kind broke in crane eagerly i dont mind saying i am a little bit hungry all right stranger if youll wait long enough for me to make some hot tea and warm the victuals you shall have a chance to judge of my cookin bill crane was quite elated he decided that the widow would not ask him for payment thus saving him from embarrassing excuses in due time he was called in and seated in the chair not long since occupied by john miles youre the second man thats dined with me today said the widow and who was the first lucky man inquired crane suspecting at once that it might have been miles i dont know his name but he was a goodlooking young man who said he had had a bag of golddust stolen from him thats miles thought crane and he at once decided not to betray any knowledge of him he was in bad luck said bill did he know who stole it he didnt tell me i dont think he knew thats well thought crane did he say where he was going to the city do you live here all the year round mrs my names brown stranger all i can say is that brown is a lucky man another cup of tea if you please mrs brown you might not like to exchange places with him for all his luck stranger remarked the widow indeed i would said bill with a languishing look hes six feet under ground explained mrs brown dryly dead ejaculated crane yes hes been dead these three weeks and you are a widow thats so stranger but you dont mean to stay a widow interrogated crane well it is kinder lonesome it seems natural like to have a man round i wonder if shes got any money thought crane ill find out if i can yes mrs brown i feel for you he said a woman cant struggle with the world as a man can i dont know about that stranger i can take care of myself if thats what you mean but a woman needs a man to protect and work for her insinuated crane i dont need any one to protect me said the widow and as for support ive got a matter of five thousand dollars laid by and a good claim thatll pay for the workin i dont think i shall need to go to the poorhouse yet awhile bill cranes eyes sparkled the widow brown seemed wonderfully attractive in his eyes he was willing to barter his young affections for five thousand dollars and a claim even if the widow had been thrice as homely as she was if he had known that mrs brown was bent on marriage his way would have been clearer his mind was made up he would woo and win his fair hostess if he could when did brown die he inquired three weeks ago stranger you must miss him yes he was a quiet man brown was he never gave me any trouble and it was natural to see him round you must not mourn for him too much mrs brown i shant make a fool of myself said the widow hes gone and he wont come back theres no use cryin shes rather a queer specimen thought crane she hasnt broken her heart it seems you ought to marry again he said i mean to said mrs brown well thats frank thought crane there aint any nonsense about her your second husband will be a lucky man mrs brown well hell have a good livin and if he treats me right hell get treated right too this is a cold world mrs brown ive been drifting about till im tired id like to settle down with a good wife if you want to take browns place say so remarked the widow in a businesslike tone bill crane was staggered by the promptness with which his hint was taken but did not hesitate to follow it up thats what i mean he said whats your name stranger william crane you havent got another wife anywhere have you of course not ive got to take your word for it i spose i guess ill take the risk ill marry you if you say so how soon asked crane eagerly well theres a parson a few miles from here we can ride right over and be back by sundown if that will suit you a capital idea mrs brown you wont be brown long he added sportively how will you like to be called mrs crane one name will do as well as another said the widow philosophically crane wanted to make inquiries about the five thousand dollars and the claim but he reflected that it might be inferred that his views were mercenary it would be more politic to wait till after marriage he did not understand the character of the woman he was going to marry she understood very well that crane was marrying her for her money but she felt lonesome and it suited her to have a husband and she was willing to overlook such a trifle the widow had a horse of her own directly after dinner it was harnessed and the two rode over to dirt hole a small mining settlement where the rev pelatiah pond a methodist minister united them in the bonds of matrimony when mr and mrs crane reached home bill ventured to inquire have you got the money in the house mrs crane the five thousand dollars i mean its put away in a safe place youd better let me take care of it for you my dear not at present mr crane a year from now i will let you have half of it if you behave yourself as your husband madam i insist stop right there stranger mr crane i mean said the bride decidedly do you see that and she whipped out a revolver good gracious mrs crane do you want to murder me no i didnt marry you for that but i want you to understand that the money is in my hands and i dont allow any man to insist i may let you have some of it when i get ready do you understand i believe i do murmured crane im regularly taken in and done for he reflected sadly but directly after their return mrs crane prepared a nice supper and crane as he ate it and smoked a pipe later began to be reconciled to his new situation chapter xii tom receives news from home meanwhile tom happily unconscious that the money entrusted to john miles had been lost continued to work diligently at his claim his success varied from day to day but on the whole he was gaining he spent nothing except for absolute necessities and in spite of all temptations he gave a wide berth to missouri jacks saloon in this way he gained the illwill of the saloonkeeper who felt a certain portion of every miners gains ought to find its way into his till one evening tom met the saloonkeeper when out walking the latter had not at that time given up securing toms patronage goodevening young feller said jack tom answered the greeting politely why dont you come round to the saloon evenings we always have a jolly crowd there after a hard days work itll do you good to take a social glass i would rather not drink thank you said tom you aint afraid of a little drink i hope are you yes i would rather let it alone oh youre too good to live said jack in deep disgust i hope not answered tom smiling for i hope to live a good many years that was the last attempt missouri jack made to secure tom as a patron our hero spoke in so decided a tone that he understood the uselessness of the attempt two months passed and tom heard nothing from john miles he was not surprised or disquieted for he knew that mails to the interior were very irregular and besides miles might not be fond of letterwriting he took it for granted that the seventyfive dollars had been forwarded home and were now in his fathers hands he had saved as much more and would like to have sent that too for its possession gave him anxiety but there seemed to be no opportunity about this time he received two letters the first was from john miles written from san francisco after acquainting tom with his loss of the bag of golddust he proceeded i should not have cared so much tom had the loss been mine only but it was hard to think that i had lost your money too and was unable to pay it back i know from what you said that your father needed the money and that the delay would put him to a good deal of inconvenience you shall have it all back tom every cent but you will have to wait awhile on reaching frisco i got work and soon saved up enough to pay the debt when as bad luck would have it i fell sick and before i got well all my money had been used up now i am well again and at work and if i have good luck will be able soon to send on the money to your father i know you will understand the circumstances and will excuse the delay the very day i discovered my loss i had a chance to marry a fortune you will stare at that and wonder how it happened at a lonely cabin i made the acquaintance of a widow who was looking out for a second husband she was left with a comfortable property which with her hand she was willing to bestow upon your friend but she didnt tempt me much i believe her fortune amounted to five thousand dollars and a claim it would be a good chance for you if you were old enough tom i dont know when this letter will reach you for the country mails at least to such outoftheway places as river bend go quite irregularly however i hope you will get it after a while and wont be too much troubled about the money if i live it shall be repaid tom showed this letter to ferguson its a pity my lad that the money was stolen said the scotchman but youll get it again john miles is an honest man i am sure of that mr ferguson i dont know that i ought to make him pay it back though it isnt his fault that it was lost thats true my lad and you might offer to share the loss with him but i doubt if he would accept your offer he will feel better to pay it all back at any rate i will write him and make him the offer thats fair tom but youll see what hell say it may be stated here that miles utterly declined to accept any abatement of the debt i ought to have taken better care of the money he said its my fault and i shall pay it in full the next letter was from home tom opened and read it eagerly it was mainly from his father but there was a note from each member of the family his father wrote my dear tom we are glad to hear that you have reached california after a wearisome journey and are now at work we have travelled so little that we can hardly realize that you are more than three thousand miles away from us with so many mountains plains and valleys between of course you cannot tell us much in your letters of your various experiences i wish we could have you with us this evening and hear some of them from your own lips i am anxious to hear that you are succeeding in the object of your journey and that you will not find the stories of the rich gold fields greatly exaggerated i do not myself believe all i hear yet i think there must be gold enough to pay those who search for it diligently you must remember my dear boy that hard work is better than luck and more to be relied upon dont expect to make your fortune all at once by finding a big nugget but work steadily and you will meet with more or less success if you succeed moderately i shall be glad you went away for here prospects are not very good our little farm seems to be less productive every year the soil is not very good as you know and i cannot afford fertilizers this year the crops were not as good as usual and we have felt the decrease sensibly if there were not a mortgage on the farm i could get along very well but the interest now amounts to one hundred and thirtytwo dollars annually and it is hard to get that amount together next month sixtysix dollars come due and i dont know how i am to find the money squire hudson could afford to wait but i am afraid he wont the older and richer he gets the more grasping he becomes i sometimes think however i dont want to borrow trouble if it is absolutely necessary i can sell off one of the cows to raise the money and before the year comes round i think you will be able to help me walter though only twelve years old his thirteenth birthday comes next month helps me about the farm and is very useful in doing chores he likes farmwork and will be ready to succeed me in time as for sarah she is a good sensible girl and helps her mother in a good many ways though i am a poor man and always expect to remain so i feel that i am blessed in having good industrious children who promise to grow up and do me credit i should not be willing to exchange one of my boys for squire hudsons son sinclair he is to my mind a very disagreeable boy who makes himself ridiculous by the airs he puts on i have seen him once or twice lately when he appeared to have been drinking but i hope i am mistaken in this he is an only son and it would be a pity that he should go astray tom looked thoughtful after reading this letter is it bad news tom lad asked ferguson times are hard at home mr ferguson answered tom father is very much in need of money it would have been a great help to him if he had received that seventyfive dollars you have as much as that on hand now tom if it isnt enough i will lend you some thank you mr ferguson you are a good friend and i wouldnt mind accepting your offer if i needed it but father wont need any more than i can send him only i dont know how to get it to him if you were in san francisco you would have no difficulty in sending the money no ive been thinking tom said ferguson after a while that it might be a good plan for us to take a little vacation and visit the city we have been working steadily here over three months and the change would do us good besides we might on the way come across some better place this isnt as good now as when we began to work it that is true said tom suppose then we stay a week longer sell out our claim if we can and start in the direction of the city you and i yes we shall be better off without company we had better not let peabody know we are going or he will want to accompany us i could almost be willing to take him poor creature to get him away from that missouri jack but as you say he would not be a help to us so it was decided that in a few days as soon as they were ready tom and ferguson should leave river bend chapter xiii a speculative investment it leaked out after a while that tom and ferguson were intending to leave river bend and considerable regret was expressed by the other members of the party tom was a general favorite his youth and his obliging disposition made him liked by all except missouri jack and his set it cannot be said that his scotch friend was popular but he was at all events highly respected as a man of high principle and rigid honesty this was not the way the miners expressed it they called him a square man and that word expressed high moral praise they all felt that tom was going off in good company before they went the two had a chance for a speculation two weeks before a man came to river bend across the country with a horse and wagon the latter an old express wagon which he had brought round the horn from some one of the eastern states what had induced him to take so much trouble to convey such bulky articles was not quite clear now that he was a miner he had no use for them and at river bend they were not saleable this man abner kent came to fergusons tent where he and tom were resting after the labors of the day he was a tall man with a shambling gait and an angular face goodevening he said if you aint busy ill sit down a few minutes we are glad to see you mr kent said ferguson tom and i were discussing our plans but weve plenty of time for that come in heres a place for you i hear that you are going to leave us you two yes tom has some business in san francisco and i want to see a little more of the country how are you going well take the cars if we can find any answered tom if we cant well foot it thats what i came to see you about you know ive got a horse and wagon yes why dont you buy it youll go easier and quicker we cant afford it said ferguson poor men must walk you dont see the point when you get through with the team you can easily sell them for more than you gave it will be a good speculation that will depend on how much we give said the scotchman shrewdly to be sure mr ferguson now about that ill be easy they aint any good to me here ill take let me see four hundred dollars cash youll maybe double your money inside of a month the team did seem cheap at this price as prices of all articles in a new country are very much enhanced tom and i will talk it over and let you know tomorrow morning said ferguson thats all right its a good chance for you when kent was gone tom asked what do you think of his offer mr ferguson i think it will be a good investment tom and that we shall be less likely to be robbed than if we carried golddust with us you know how john miles got robbed i have only a hundred dollars said tom doubtfully i have enough to add to it but i think we can get the team cheaper i dont want to beat the man down but a bargain is a bargain and we must look out for our own interest you know more about such things than i do mr ferguson i will agree to anything you say very well my lad i shall be sure to consult your interest as well as my own it will be very comfortable for us to have a team of our own it will seem strange to me said tom laughing what will they think at home when they hear that i have set up a carriage they might think it imprudent to invest all you had in that way but well make money out of it yet or i am sorely mistaken the next morning while tom and ferguson were at work kent came up to them what have you decided about the team he asked we are not willing to pay four hundred dollars said ferguson thats a fair price it may be but it will take all the money tom and i can raise you know it wouldnt be quite prudent for us to part with all our funds i will take a note for part of the money said kent thats very considerate of you but scarcely prudent then dont you want it at all asked kent disappointed yes we are prepared with an offer well give you three hundred dollars kent shook his head thats too little he said ferguson remained silent he wished to give kent time to reflect upon his offer have you sold these claims of yours asked kent after a pause no then add them to your offer and i accept it this proposal struck ferguson favorably they could not carry away their claims and very possibly no other purchaser might offer as except as regards location other places along the riverbank could be had without cost what do you say tom asked ferguson i agree if you do mr ferguson then its a bargain mr kent i hope itll prove satisfactory to both of us i dont think youll regret it its a good speculation when the two friends had settled for their purchase tom paying one hundred and ferguson two hundred dollars our hero found himself left with twenty dollars or its equivalent in golddust while his companion had about one hundred and fifty left over we shall go off in style said tom riding in our own carriage but theres one thing i have been thinking of i want to send a hundred dollars home as soon as i get the chance suppose we cant sell the team have no fears about that tom ill lend you the money if that is the case but mark my word we shant have it left on our hands of that you may be sure the night before they were to start lawrence peabody dropped in he was looking down in the mouth how does the world use you mr peabody inquired tom fortune is against me said peabody im tired of river bend tom glanced at his companion he could guess what was coming wont you take me with you tom entreated the young bostonian you must ask mr ferguson he is the head of our party peabody looked appealingly towards ferguson but the scotchman shook his head you mustnt be offended mr peabody he said when i tell you that you are responsible for your own bad luck you have had just as good a chance as tom or i your claim was better there was no difference that i can see except that we worked and you didnt you dont expect gold to come to you you and tom are more used to hard work than i murmured peabody if you did not feel able to work you should not have come to california a man must work harder here than at home and then he stands a chance of succeeding better then you wont take me asked peabody sadly are you in debt to captain fletcher for board peabody reluctantly admitted that he was but had no idea how much he owed fletcher tells me that he shall not trust you any longer lawrence peabody looked frightened what shall i do he faltered i shall starve you cant blame the captain he knows that you spend the little money you do earn at the saloon but he will give you a chance there is no one to wash clothes in the camp and we have all observed that you keep yours looking well if you will set up a laundry you can make more money than in any other way but then i should be a common washerwoman objected peabody what would my friends in boston say they wont hear of it besides a man can do here what he would not do at home it may be stated here that peabody finding work absolutely needful went into partnership with a chinaman who arrived at the camp a day or two later and succeeded in making a fair living which hitherto he had been unable to do after he was employed his visits to the saloon became less frequent at times he was disturbed by the fear that his friends at home might learn the character of his employment apart from this he found his new business with the income it yielded not distasteful chapter xiv a new acquaintance having made all necessary preparations ferguson and tom set out on their way they took a course differing somewhat from that chosen by john miles one object being to survey the country and find if possible a suitable place for continuing their search for gold after their three months steady work both of our travellers were prepared to enjoy the journey their road was difficult at times from its steepness and more than once they found it necessary out of consideration for the horse to get out and walk but this only added to the romantic charm of the trip its like a constant picnic said tom i should like to travel this way for a year if i did not feel the need of working we might tire of it after a while suggested ferguson in the rainy season for example that would not be so pleasant to be sure tom admitted do you have such fine scenery in scotland mr ferguson our mountains are not so high my lad nor our trees so gigantic but its the associations that make them interesting every hill has a legend connected with it and our great novelist walter scott has invested them with a charm that draws pilgrims from all parts of the world to see them now this is a new country beautiful i grant but without a history look around you and you will see nothing to remind you of man it is nature on a grand scale i admit but the soul is wanting i like mountains said tom thoughtfully there is something grand about them there are some famous mountains in your native state new hampshire are there not tom yes but i have only seen them from a distance they are not above thirty miles away from where i was born but poor people dont travel in search of scenery mr ferguson no my lad and theres another thing i have noticed we dont care much for the curiosities that are near us the people about here if there are any settled inhabitants care nothing about the mountains i doubt that is true in our village at home there is an old man nearly eighty years old who has never visited the mountains though he has lived near them all his life i can well believe it my lad but what is that the sound which elicited this exclamation was a loud hollo evidently proceeding from some one in their rear both tom and the scotchman turned and their eyes rested on a horseman evidently spurring forward to overtake them tom who was driving reined in the horse and brought him to a stop the horseman was soon even with them he was evidently a yankee all yankees do not carry about with them an unmistakable certificate of their origin but ebenezer onthank was a typical new englander his face was long and thin his expression shrewd and goodnatured his limbs were long and ungainly in later life with the addition of forty or fifty pounds of flesh he would be much improved in appearance goodmorning gentlemen said he it seems kinder good to see a human face again it aint very populous round here is it we havent seen any large towns said tom smiling where are you steerin inquired the yankee im expectin to fetch up at san francisco some time if i dont get lost in the woods that is our destination my friend returned ferguson would you mind my joining your party asked onthank its lonesome travelin by ones self without a soul to speak to we shall be glad of your company said the scotchman sincerely for though naturally cautious he could not suspect the newcomer of anything which would make him an undesirable companion perhaps youd like to know who i am said the new acquaintance my name is ebenezer onthank from green mountain mills in vermont my father is deacon of the baptist church at home i suppose you will take his place when you get older said tom gravely no i guess not i wonder what susan jones would say to my bein a deacon and ebenezer burst into a loud laugh is miss jones a particular friend of yours asked tom slyly i should say she was why i expect to marry her when i get home i congratulate you dont be too fast we aint hitched yet say boy where do you come from from vernon in new hampshire you dont say why that aint moren fifty miles from green mountain mills curus we should meet so fur away from hum aint it when did you start seven or eight months ago ive been in california six months does that gentleman come from your town my friend answered the scotchman not without a touch of pride i am not an american i am from the highlands of scotland you be sho well of course you cant help that help it sir i am proud of hailing from the land of scott and burns well i guess its a pretty nice sort of country said mr onthank patronizingly i guess youll like america best though i am by no means sure of that my friend said ferguson a little nettled americas all very well but why you could put scotland into its waistcoat pocket and thered be plenty of room left said ebenezer energetically i admit that as regards size scotland cannot compare with this country say have you got mountains as high as them or trees as high as that pointing to a gigantic redwood no but size is not everything thats so vermont is a little state but shes smart i tell you but you havent told me your names yet i am called donald ferguson mr onthank my young friend here answers to the name of thomas nelson commonly called tom added our hero smiling why ive got a brother tom said mr onthank curus isnt it considering that tom is by no means an uncommon name it could hardly be called very remarkable but tom politely assented is he older than i am he inquired yes my brother tom is twentyone years old i expect he voted at the last townmeeting im four years older than tom have you been fortunate so far in california mr onthank cant say i have i guess ive wandered round too much been a sort of rollin stone and my granny used to say that a rollin stone gathers no moss ive got about enough money to get me to san francisco and i own this animal but i havent made a fortune yet what luck have you two had pretty fair but it will take a good while to make our fortunes we own this team and thats about all we do own a sort of an express wagon isnt it yes aint goin into the express business be you probably not we bought it on speculation that reminds me of old sam bailey in our town he was always tradin horses sometimes he made money and then again he didnt how much did you give tom told him that was a pretty stiff price wasnt it it would be considered so at home but we hope to get a good deal more when we come to sell it their new friend kept on with them amusing them with his homely sayings and original views of things his conversation beguiled the tedium of the journey so that all were surprised when the shadows deepened and suppertime came selecting a favorable place they encamped for the night chapter xv a grizzly bear ebenezer onthank was an early riser he had been brought up on a farm where during a part of the year it was the custom for the menfolks to rise between four and five oclock in the morning to begin the labors of the day his old habit clung to him and at five oclock when tom and ferguson were yet asleep mr onthank sprang from his leafy couch refreshed and vigorous seeing his companions yet sleeping he concluded to take a walk itll give me an appetite for breakfast thought he and a chance to see something of the country as to the appetite ebenezer was generally well provided indeed latterly his appetite had exceeded his means of gratifying it and more than once he had longed to be back at his old home in the vermont farmhouse where the table was always generously if not elegantly furnished if ebenezer had a special weakness it was for doughnuts which he called nutcakes if i only had a few of marms nutcakes he had said the night before to his newfound friends id be a happy man what are nutcakes asked the scotchman puzzled dont you know what nutcakes are inquired ebenezer astonished at fergusons ignorance i never heard of them before said ferguson well i declare i thought everybody knew what nutcakes are ejaculated the yankee dont you ever make em in scotland not that i ever heard then you dont know what is good you know what they are tom oh yes said tom smiling we often have them at home perhaps mr ferguson would understand better if he heard them called doughnuts or crullers thus defined mr ferguson acknowledged that he had heard of them and he thought he had once tasted one scotland however fell considerably in the estimation of mr onthank when he learned that his favorite article of food was almost unknown in that distant country you scotchmen dont know what is good he said if you ever come to green mountain mills ill get marm to fry a batch of nutcakes and youll say theyre goloptious this last word was not familiar to ferguson but the smack of the lips with which it was accompanied made it sufficiently intelligible he assured ebenezer politely that he hoped some day to accept his kind invitation when ebenezer left the camp he had no definite plan of exploration everything was alike new to him and it mattered little in what direction his steps led him it was a charming morning the sun had risen and hill and valley were glorified by its slanting rays the air was bracing and ebenezer though neither a poet nor a sentimentalist felt his spirits rise as with vigorous steps he strode on letting his eyes wander at will over the landscape looks kinder hansome he said to himself i wish susan jones was with me now gals like to walk round and look at scenery and pick flowers and so on as for me a good field of corn suits me better than all the flowers in the world theyre only good to smell of out here though id like a good claim best it seems curus to think how much money you can get sometimes from a hole in the ground beats cornfields for profit by a great sight if you only get hold of the right place i just wish i could find a big nugget as big as my head i guess it would make me the richest man in green mountain mills id be a bigger man than the old deacon theyd be glad to make me selectman and perhaps send me to montpelier after a while to make laws well theres no knowin what may turn up why shouldnt i light on a nugget as well as the next man in this pleasant channel the thoughts of our yankee adventurer were running as he strode over the uneven ground with all the vigor gained by his hardy training but his walk was destined to be interrupted in a decidedly unpleasant manner all at once he became conscious of a huge object scarcely thirty yards distant whose attention he had already attracted mr onthank had been long enough in california to recognize in the huge unwieldy figure a grizzly bear ebenezer onthank was no coward but it must be admitted that when he saw the eyes of the grizzly fixed upon him he turned pale and his limbs trembled he had heard from fellowminers stories of the great strength and ferocity of this most formidable beast the grizzly bear shows no fear of man he is always ready to make an attack even when not stimulated by hunger even the lion is crafty and cunning and likes to attack his enemy unawares but the grizzly boldly advances to the attack without seeking to surprise his adversary if out of humor it makes no account of odds but will as readily attack a party as a single foe col albert s evans the author of an interesting volume containing sketches of life in california says i am satisfied that an average grizzly could at any time whip the strongest african lion in a fair standup fight while a fullgrown bull is no more to him than a rat is to the largest housecats twentyfive years ago the grizzly was to be found in various parts of california as the state has become settled his haunts have become contracted but even now as the writer just quoted assures us he is still found in great numbers in the coast range mountains from san diego to del norte in describing samson a famous specimen once on exhibition in san francisco we are told that his strength was that of an elephant and his claws eight inches in length curved like a rainbow and sharp as a knife would enable him to tear open anything made of flesh and blood as you or i would open a banana such was the new acquaintance who confronted mr onthank and barred his progress jerusalem ejaculated the surprised and dismayed yankee and he instinctively felt for his rifle but alas he had left it in the camp it was thoughtless and imprudent to venture out unarmed but the scene was so quiet and peaceful that no thought of danger had entered the mind of our unlucky friend the bear sat upon his haunches and stared at the intruder ebenezer brought to a standstill returned his gaze they were less than a hundred feet apart and the situation was decidedly critical i guess he wants to chaw me up for his breakfast thought ebenezer despairingly and i dont see what i can do to prevent it the bear however seemed in no hurry to commence the attack he surveyed our yankee with dignified gravity conscious that he had him at advantage when ebenezer felt for his rifle he uttered a low growl being possibly aware of his purpose possibly he laughed in his sleeve some of my young critics may suggest that bears have no sleeves at his failure ebenezer looked about him despairingly no man will surrender at discretion to a grizzly for he can hope for no mercy but what could be done once subjected to the terrible hug and the life would be crushed out of him in less than a minute if ferguson and tom were only here thought poor ebenezer but the camp was at least two miles away and his two companions unconscious of his terrible peril were calmly sleeping and not likely to awaken till he was a crushed and bleeding corpse in great crises the mind travels rapidly i shall not attempt to record the thoughts that chased one another through the mind of the luckless adventurer but they were by no means pleasant i shall never see green mountain mills again he thought with an inward groan i shall never marry susan jones or eat any of marms nutcakes if i only had my rifle here id make one effort for my life id spoil the beauty of that ugly devil anyhow still as if charmed he stood staring openeyed at the grizzly bruin deciding that this had lasted long enough began in a slow and dignified manner to approach the intruder upon his solitude this broke the charm with a wild shout ebenezer onthank took to his heels and flew over the ground at a rate of speed which weston the champion runner would scarcely be able to equal the grizzly accepted the challenge and increased his own speed developing an activity hardly to be expected of his huge and unwieldy form it was man against beast with the odds decidedly in the favor of the latter chapter xvi up a tree the race between the yankee and the bear was an exciting one to the former at least he was fleet of foot and in a hundred yards dash would have won without great difficulty but in wind and endurance the grizzly excelled him so as the race continued mr onthank looking back from time to time was painfully conscious that his enemy was gaining upon him the perspiration came out upon his face in large drops and he panted painfully he felt that the chances were against him and he could almost feel in advance the fatal hug which would slowly press the life out of him as he felt his strength failing he looked around him despairingly just before him was a moderatesized tree though he knew that bears can climb he gathered his remaining strength seized a low hanging branch and swung himself up just in time to avoid his persistent foe who was close upon his heels he did not tarry where he was but climbed higher up until from a height of twenty feet he could look down upon the bear bruin looked up placidly but did not begin to climb at once probably he was fatigued with his race moreover he knew that his intended victim could not get away the latter was emphatically and literally treed the bear sat upon his haunches and complacently regarded the yankee ebenezer onthank made himself as comfortable as he could under the circumstances he was by no means easy in mind however he was holding the fort it is true but the enemy was in force outside and evidently intended to remain worse still he would probably after a while climb the tree and this would bring matters to a crisis you pesky critter why dont you go along about your business exclaimed the unhappy adventurer shaking his fist at the foe bruin deigned no reply but continued to survey him with steady unwinking eyes if i only had a gun id pepper you continued ebenezer i should like to put a bullet into that impudent eye of yours though the bear had never received an english education his instinct probably enabled him to understand the feelings of his intended victim but he remained as placid as ever so an hour passed at the end of that time the situation remained unchanged the unfortunate yankee was getting hungry as well as tired of his somewhat constrained position bears probably have more patience than the human family for bruin had scarcely moved except occasionally to wag his great head he felt that in the game that was being played it was his adversarys turn to make the next move i wish tom and the scotchman would find me out thought onthank what on earth makes them sleep so late he continued irritably they must be naturally lazy he may be excused for feeling irritated though there was no particular reason to expect his two friends to curtail their hours of slumber because he had done so but he was not in a position where it is easy to be reasonable and in his situation every minute seemed to him as long as five meanwhile in the camp a mile away tom and ferguson had awakened how did you sleep tom asked the scotchman tiptop did you rest well i have a gift of sleep replied ferguson but where is our yankee friend i suppose he has taken an early walk said tom he will be back before long i guess wed better not wait breakfast for him im hungry for one the two friends proceeded to break their fast washing down the rather stale provisions with water from a spring near by i wish it were coffee said tom im tired of cold water doubtless the coffee would be more gratifying to the palate tom but its likely the water is better for the health i suppose you would refuse a cup of hot coffee mr ferguson if it were offered you said tom smiling i dont say that tom i would risk its effect upon my health for once but as we havent got it we may as well make the best of what we have soon after their simple meal which did not consume much time tom suggested to his companion that they set out in search of mr onthank he did not suspect that their missing companion was in trouble but he thought that it would be pleasant to take a walk you can go if you like tom said ferguson with characteristic caution i will remain behind to look after the camp all right mr ferguson ill soon be back dont go too far away my lad and mind your bearings so that you can find your way back never fear mr ferguson it wouldnt be very easy to be lost here ill keep my eyes open and bring mr onthank back with me if i see him anywhere ferguson sat down and indulged himself in reading probably for the hundredth time walter scotts marmion of which he had a small pocket edition while tom went on his way a fortunate chance directed our hero by an almost straight course to the very tree where ebenezer onthank was still perched with the grizzly standing guard beneath from time to time he looked about him anxiously in the hope of seeing the approach of one of his travelling companions it was with a feeling of joy not wholly unmingled with anxiety that he descried tom descending a hillock not many rods away as yet it was evident that our hero had not caught sight of the bear and his prisoner it was very necessary to put him on his guard tom shouted mr onthank at the top of his voice tom heard the call in spite of the distance and looked about him but did not immediately catch sight of the speaker it did not occur to him to look upwards tom shouted the yankee again here i am look up in the tree that time toms glance detected his companion and not yet having discovered the bear he was led to wonder why mr onthank had climbed the tree as he was advancing incautiously onthank shouted again theres a cursed grizzly under the tree dont come too near tom saw the bear and he paused suddenly he was startled in truth for he had been long enough in california to be aware that it was a dangerous beast isnt ferguson with you asked onthank anxiously for he knew that a boy of sixteen even if armed was no match for the king of the california sierras no hes behind in the camp shouted tom in reply by this time the bear became aware that there was a second intruder within his precincts he turned his head deliberately and surveyed our hero it is not within the range of the author to read the thoughts of a grizzly but from the indifference with which he turned away and resumed his watch it may be inferred that he considered tom too small game to merit his attention this was rather satisfactory to our young hero who was not ambitious to come in close quarters with so formidable an antagonist startled as he was tom maintained his ground he wanted to help onthank but he did not know how to do it what can i do to help you mr onthank shouted tom blamed if i know answered the yankee helplessly i wish ferguson were here it wont do for you to attack the beast singlehanded shall i go back for ferguson asked tom i dont know how far away is the camp it must be as much as a mile while you are away the brute may take it into his head to climb the tree and then i am gone up havent you any weapon no ill fire at the bear if you say so it would be of no use if you missed or only grazed him he would make for you i wish you had my rifle said tom so do i id let him have it straight in the eye have you had breakfast yes im as hungry as a bear as this bear who probably wants me for his breakfast o tom if i was only back at green mountain mills once more id be content to live and die there and all the gold in california wouldnt bring me out here again tom stood silent and perplexed while he was considering whether he could do anything to help his friend the bear slowly rose approached the tree and grasping it between his paws prepared to climb he was evidently tired of waiting hes coming tom shouted onthank o lord what shall i do chapter xvii an exciting pursuit mr onthanks reflections when the grizzly was slowly but steadily climbing the tree were by no means pleasant if he once grips me i am gone he said despairingly shall i shoot asked tom looking on in excitement you might hit me said ebenezer who knew nothing of toms skill as a marksman no i wont i think ill swing off said the yankee and join you whether this was or was not a wise thing to do tom did not feel qualified to decide it was evident that onthank must do something speedily or he would be in the power of the bear he waited nervously till bruin was uncomfortably near and then seizing the branch with his hands swung to the ground the height was considerable and the fall jarred him but quickly recovering himself he ran towards tom now we must run for our lives tom he said suiting the action to the word tom fully understood the necessity and followed suit first hazarding a glance at the discomfited bear when the grizzly witnessed the escape of his victim he showed no excitement nor did he accelerate his motions he began deliberately to back down the tree this required some little time which tom and his friend made the most of give me your rifle said onthank id rather keep it said tom i can make better use of it said the yankee i dont know about that said tom at any rate i will keep it he felt that it was hardly reasonable to expect him in the presence of such a danger to give up his only instrument of defence you are only a boy said his companion discontented i can shoot answered tom briefly onthank was not in general an unreasonable man but danger makes men selfish give it to me he said in a tone of authority and he tried to wrest it from toms hands you shall not have it exclaimed tom indignantly take away your hand or ill shoot you of course tom was excited and would not have carried out his threat but he was fully resolved to stand up for his rights whether ebenezer would have yielded the point being stronger than tom is uncertain but our hero shouted look out for the bear and the yankee in alarm released his hold and the two entered upon a race in which the yankees superior length of limb enabled him to keep the first place bruin was now on terra firma and was on his way wagging his great head developing an alarming rate of speed tom was somewhat hampered by the weapon which he carried and he was getting out of breath onthank was three or four rods ahead of him the situation had changed and it was now tom that was in the greater peril dont give out tom called out ebenezer encouragingly i wont gasped tom if i can help it is he gaining on us yes returned our hero then ill try another tree said onthank and he caught a branch and clambered up into a tree quite similar to the other in which he had been besieged tom would gladly have followed his example but the branch was too high for him to reach readily and the grizzly was too near to give him adequate time poor boy he began to despair and was at an utter loss what to do to face round and fire at the foe seemed about all that was left him but he wanted to reserve his fire to the last he caught sight of another tree of a larger trunk than the one which onthank had ascended and ran towards it pursued by the grizzly then commenced a dodging game which seemed to afford but a brief respite from destruction this cant last long thought poor tom i suppose i must die in that brief time of peril many thoughts passed through his mind to die at his age would be sad enough but the thought that his expedition would be a failure only involving his father deeper in difficulty and debt chiefly troubled him the mortgage would be foreclosed and his father and whole family deprived of their humble home onthank watched the boys peril unable to give him assistance to do him justice he almost forgot his own danger in the more apparent and immediate peril of his young companion be careful he shouted quite needlessly dont let him grip you give it to him right in the eye tom was so absorbed and his mind so painfully occupied by his efforts to keep out of his enemys clutches that he was not conscious of the warning active and alert as he was the result was hardly a matter of doubt he would tire sooner than the bear and if he ran again he was sure to be overtaken this however was what he did of course the grizzly instantly pursued him poor tom breathed a prayer for help though there seemed no chance of his prayer being answered but sometimes god sends assistance when there seems no chance of escape the galloping of a horse was heard there was a whirling sound and bruin already within two yards of tom was jerked back and brought to a standstill by a lasso which wound about his neck a shout caused tom suddenly to turn his head and to his joy he saw a mounted mexican vaquero who had brought him timely relief bruin growled angrily on finding himself balked of his prey he was not disposed to yield to his new antagonist rising and sitting on his haunches he began coolly to draw in the lasso against the combined strength of man and horse the muscular force of a big grizzly is simply enormous usually he is attacked from two sides two lassos being thrown around him for a single antagonist he is sometimes more than a match as seemed likely in the present case the rieta being attached to the pommel of the saddle of course the bear in pulling as he did hand over hand steadily brought the vaquero and his steed nearer the horse terrified trembled in every limb and tried to rear but his strength was as nothing when opposed to the steady power of his massive antagonist relieved from the immediate attentions of the grizzly tom did not continue to run but stood still and forgetting his own peril remained an excited spectator of the struggle between the bear and the vaquero the mexican in an excited manner shouted to him to shoot this brought tom to a sense of his duty a third person had been brought into danger by an effort to give him assistance and he was too manly to leave him to his fate he raised his rifle and taking quick aim fired our young hero was of course inexperienced and it was only by a piece of good fortune that his bullet inflicted a serious wound striking the bear in the throat the blood began to flow and the grizzly growling fiercely slackened his hold on the lasso the vaquero followed up toms shot by another equally effective and the powerful animal dropped to the ground dangerous still if approached but unfitted for pursuit the vaquero reined his horse back and his dark face became illumined with a smile of satisfaction he will do no more harm he said in good english but with a foreign accent the danger is over is the critter used up shouted onthank cautiously from his elevated perch is he defunct he soon will be answered tom i guess it will be safe to come down ebenezer onthank needed no second invitation he shinned down the tree in a manner not unlike the grizzly and approached the spot where the huge foe was lying the lifeblood flowing from his throat id like to kick you you big brute said mr onthank the bear slowly turned upon him his glazing eyes and they expressed so much ferocity that almost involuntarily the yankee drew back the bear partly raised himself and tried to drag himself towards his adversaries but the effort was vain he is one of the largest i have seen said the vaquero see how strong he is it was lucky for me that you came up said tom he was almost upon me i had about given you up tom said onthank and i thought my turn was coming next we are much indebted to you sir said tom gratefully to the mexican you have saved my life the vaquero courteously expressed his satisfaction and remounting his horse resumed his journey i never want to see another grizzly said onthank this one is enough for me darn his ugly pictur i quite agree with you mr onthank said tom chapter xviii toms old home leaving tom for a time we will cross the continent and a little earlier in point of time look in upon mark nelson and his family at their humble home in new hampshire for years mr nelson had been struggling to provide a comfortable living for his wife and children the struggle was not an easy one his small farm was sterile and yielded grudgingly its annual crops then the mortgage held by squire hudson imposed a burden of interest very hard to meet each half year sixtysix dollars must be raised somehow to satisfy the squires demand though a rich man with ready money in plenty he never failed to call for his money on the very day it was due once or twice he had granted a delay of a day or two but his manner was so unpleasant that the farmer except from dire necessity was hardly likely to ask a renewal of the favor the six months immediately following toms departure from home were not favorable to his father there was a drought of considerable duration which made the crops smaller than usual and thus materially decreased the farmers income when the semiannual interest became due with the most energetic effort mark nelson had got together but thirtysix dollars towards it leaving a deficit of thirty dollars i feel anxious about tomorrow mary he said as the little family sat together the night before in the plain sittingroom i have never been so much behindhand before with the interest how much do you lack mark asked mrs nelson thirty dollars that is a good deal of money said his wife gravely yes i dont know where to raise it if squire hudson were only a little considerate but he isnt and even if he were i am afraid there is no prospect of my raising the money at present you may get some money from tom soon suggested sarah i cant rely upon that tom will doubtless send when he is able for he understands my circumstances and is a thoughtful boy but it is going to take time for him to earn a surplus enough to send on he may find a big nugget said walter the second boy who eagerly read the letters from california which from time to time appeared in the weekly paper he may but the chances are against it i was reading in last weeks paper about a man finding a nugget worth over two thousand dollars such nuggets are as rare as large prizes in a lottery i suspect said mark nelson who had a large share of plain commonsense walter looked rather disappointed having made up his mind that tom would certainly find a big lump of gold and come home rich dont you think tom will find some gold he asked yes i have no doubt he will gather some golddust i have no doubt too that he will earn more than he or i can do at home but i havent much faith in these extraordinary pieces of good luck still tom may find a nugget persisted walter yes he may and i shall be very glad if he does but we must not build too many aircastles on that chance i wish i could see the dear boy again sighed his mother looking up from the stocking she was laboriously darning so do i said walter he would have a lot to tell us california seems so far away resumed mrs nelson and he has no one there to look after him and mend his clothes and darn his stockings said walter smiling if he walked all the way across the continent said sarah i dont believe he would have larger holes in his stockings than you have walter oh well i exercise a good deal said walter ask father if i dont walter will be more successful as a farmer than as a scholar said mr nelson he helps me a good deal tom was a good scholar said sarah and he was always ready to work too walter will never astonish or electrify the world by his learning i dont want to said her brother it isnt in my line thats true enough dont tease walter said mrs nelson he helps your father a good deal and he is not a dunce thank you mother for taking my part sarah is going to be a strongminded woman i should not wonder if she came out as a lecturer on womans rights some time i think i see her with a pair of ironbowed spectacles on her nose and her back hair tied up in a big knot flinging her arms about and thatll do walter said sarah it is an unusually powerful effort for you i have no desire to lecture on womans rights though i think they ought to have them all the same i guess youll get yours youll make your husband stand round if you ever get one sarah laughed goodnaturedly and retorted i shall pity your wife if she has to darn your stockings the next day about dinnertime squire hudson walked up to the front door and knocked his approach was witnessed not without trepidation for he was not an easy creditor the squire looked about him searchingly as he entered he suspected that the interest was not ready and the farmers grave face confirmed his suspicions that he was glad of this of course mark nelson did not dream for he was not aware of his creditors deeplaid plans a fine day said the squire with suavity i hope you are well mrs nelson pretty well thank you sir have you heard from tom lately yes he had just reached california then of course he could not say anything of his prospects it was too soon you must miss him a good deal all of you i am thinking of him all the time said mrs nelson to be sure that is natural in a mother but if the boy does well that will repay you hereafter if i only felt sure he would do well oh he is young and industrious he will be sure to make his way hell like it too why my sinclair envies him the chance of leaving home he wanted to go with him sinclair would not like to go in the same way as tom with the prospect of having to work hard after he got there said mark nelson to be sure not neighbor nelson my boy has never been brought up to work my circumstances ahem have not made it necessary sinclair is fortunate in having a rich father said the farmer so i tell him said the squire complacently his fortune is already made what are you going to do with him squire oh i shall make a professional man of him a lawyer most likely said the rich man complacently i can give him a suitable income till he gets into a paying practice that will be a good many years thought sarah unless sinclair works harder than he has lately at school but the shrewd young lady kept this thought to herself one by one wife and children left the room for it was well understood that the squire came on business and would be likely to desire a private interview with the farmer they went into the kitchen closing the door behind them and awaited anxiously the result of the interview i do hope squire hudson will be considerate said mrs nelson anxiously i am afraid he wont be mother said sarah he is a hard man sinclair puts on no end of airs said walter by the way he struts round you would think he owned the whole town you had better set your cap for him sarah for he will be rich some day i would rather be an old maid than marry him said sarah decidedly very likely your wish will be gratified said her brother mrs nelson did not smile at this sally for her mind was too full of anxiety chapter xix a modern shylock i believe your interest falls due today mr nelson said the squire when he found himself alone with his debtor yes answered the farmer slowly it was not very likely to slip his mind i suppose you have the money ready continued the squire who supposed no such thing i have a part of it ready said mark nelson with an effort a part repeated his creditor with a frown yes i can give you thirtysix dollars today only thirtysix dollars the amount due is sixtysix i know it squire hudson but this has been a bad year for the farmers as you probably know owing to the drought my crops fell off at least one quarter i cant help that said the squire coldly if you will be a little patient said mr nelson uneasily neighbor nelson said his creditor interrupting him i wish to ask you one question when i lent you money on mortgage was there a stipulation that if there was a drought i was to wait for my just interest no squire hudson to be sure not i would not of course lend you money on any such terms it was understood that my interest was to be paid semiannually was it not so yes but wait a moment you must certainly agree that i am entitled to prompt payment a bargain is a bargain i dont dispute it squire hudson and i have tried to be ready for you but in spite of all my efforts i am thirty dollars short do you expect me to be content with this explanation i think you are rather hard on me squire it isnt as if i had the money and objected to pay i am a poor man but no one ever lost a dollar by me and i dont mean that any one shall while i have my life and strength thats all very well but it wont make up the thirty dollars in which you are delinquent what would you have me do i cannot make money i wouldnt give much for an investment when the interest is delayed it is no longer worth its face if any of my railroad bonds defer their usual interest they at once drop in value i know very little of railroad bonds never having any money to invest in them but i think my farm will be full security for all the money i owe you suppose i should foreclose you would consider it an unkind thing and a great hardship wouldnt you it would take away my means of supporting my family i dont think you would go to extremes for the sake of thirty dollars it isnt the amount of money neighbor nelson that is to be considered it is the principle that is involved this is a very common pretext with men who have made up their minds to do a mean thing generally speaking it is false and the money is the first consideration will you give me two months to pay the balance of interest asked mark nelson what better prospect have you of being able to pay me then as soon as tom has any money to send he will remit to me i think it probable that i shall hear from him in the course of two months if that is your reliance said the squire shrugging his shoulders i am afraid you are leaning upon a broken reed i know boys pretty well and i fancy tom will find a use for all the money he earns you dont know him squire hudson he is a very conscientious boy and understands very well the sacrifice i made in raising money to send him to california he is not very likely to forget that it seems to me that the sacrifice was mine said the squire with a half sneer if i remember rightly i advanced the money which he took away with him mark nelson flushed and he answered warmly you did advance the money squire hudson but i gave you security for it and the very first interest that has come due you are not prepared to meet you cant blame me for feeling a little doubt as to the wisdom of my advance are you very much in need of the thirty dollars asked mr nelson nettled at the squires tone what do you mean sir is it subjecting you to any great inconvenience to wait a couple of months for it that is what i mean my circumstances are not such returned the squire haughtily as to make me feel even the loss of thirty dollars i wish i could say the same but i cannot since then it will occasion you no inconvenience i ask you as a favor that you will let the balance rest for two months squire hudson saw that he was cornered but none the less was he disposed to yield the point he even felt provoked with the farmer for having forced from him an acknowledgment that he did not need the money he so persistently demanded i told you before he said that it was not the amount of money but the principle that i care for you cannot have forgotten this i dont see how any principle is involved squire hudson you look at the matter solely from a debtors point of view if you held the mortgage instead of myself you would change your view very quickly i dont think i should said the farmer slowly i would be considerate to a poor neighbor even if it did inconvenience me a little the poor neighbor should not have borrowed money on which he was unable to pay interest said squire hudson severely how could i anticipate the drought that has diminished my crops said mark nelson with spirit that is neither here nor there you knew that the interest must be paid drought or no drought crop or no crop i cannot argue with you further since you refuse to consider circumstances over which i have had no control you refuse to grant me any delay i do since i have not the money to pay you will you tell me what you require how many cows do you keep three you can give me one of these and i will consider it an equivalent for the thirty dollars do you require this asked the farmer uneasily yes unless you have some other satisfactory arrangement to propose i am afraid i have nothing else which you would regard as satisfactory the loss of a cow will diminish my income instead of three i ought to have four or five i shouldnt like to be reduced to two very likely not but an honest man is willing to make a sacrifice in order to meet his just liabilities besides you expect to have the money you say in a couple of months when it has come you may have your cow back on paying two months interest on the deferred payment that is only fair say no more squire hudson said the farmer i must of course consent to this arrangement since you insist upon it how soon do you wish for the cow you had better let your son walter drive it over this afternoon he is losing no time thought mark nelson bitterly he does not even appear to be willing that i should have the benefit of this nights milking you may send me whiteface continued squire hudson who knew that this was the most valuable of the three cows that is my best cow protested the farmer that makes little difference as you expect to redeem it in two months mark nelson was silent he felt indignant with squire hudson for his cruel exaction but he felt that he was in his power and that he must submit to his exactions you will attend to this matter asked the squire as he rose and prepared to go yes answered the farmer coldly when his creditor was gone he went into the kitchen and acquainted the family with what had passed great were the grief and indignation of the children and walter expressed a desire that squire hudson might lose all his property as a fitting reward for his meanness heaven help me if i cant meet the next interest said mark nelson later in the day to his wife dont be too much troubled about the future mark said his wife who was of a more hopeful temperament than her husband i am sure that you will get some help from tom before six months are over i hope so answered her husband but for the rest of the day he was very grave walter drove over whiteface at his fathers request but he came near crying stout boy as he was at the loss of the faithful animal which his father had reared from a calf chapter xx at sacramento after his escape from the grizzly tom had no further adventures of an exciting character one afternoon he and his companions arrived at sacramento it was but a small settlement but was more townlike than any place they had yet seen in california they drove to a twostory frame building which was the chief hotel in the town taking the precaution to inquire the price of board and lodging they were dismayed by the extravagance of the charges tom saw that his reserve fund of twenty dollars would scarcely last him fortyeight hours i cant stay here mr ferguson he said i will take my chances and camp out if necessary i agree with you lad im not inclined to waste my substance on luxurious living there wont be much luxurious living i guess said ebenezer onthank who with yankee curiosity had already visited the kitchen and obtained some idea of the fare to be expected i kin get better board at green mountain mills for three dollars a week and folks are darned glad to accommodate you for that price these chaps seem to think and act as if we were made of money i wish some of your green mountain mills boardinghouses were here said tom i could save plenty of money then well gentlemen do you want to stay here inquired the landlord wed like to squire but not bein millionaires i guess well have to put it off till times are better just as you say said the landlord indifferently theres others waiting for the only room i have empty then noticing for the first time the express wagon which tom had left outside he asked in a tone of interest who owns that team it belongs to this boy and myself answered ferguson where did it come from the states you dont want to sell do you tom was about to reply in the affirmative but the scot more shrewd answered indifferently we may sell it when we get to san francisco i need just such a team as that said the landlord eagerly ill give you a good price for it you can go down the river to frisco i suppose we might said ferguson slowly if it was worth our while whatll you take cash down inquired the landlord earnestly nay my friend i prefer to hear your views as to the price i will give you eight hundred dollars for the wagon this was certainly an excellent profit for but three hundred had been paid for horse and wagon toms heart beat fast with excitement for he remembered that onethird of the money would come to him if it had depended upon him he would have clinched the bargain at once but he wisely left the matter in the hands of his companion and partner that seems a fair offer said ferguson but i think we may as well wait till we reach san francisco besides we want to sell the horse too i will give you a thousand dollars for the two said the landlord a man with his pantaloons tucked in his boots a coarse woolen shirt and a widebrimmed sombrero which overshadowed a face bearing a beard of a weeks growth was leaning against the doorpost landlord said he i see your price and ill go two hundred better tom stared at the speaker in surprise he looked like a man who would have found it hard to raise twelve dollars yet he had made an offer of twelve hundred our hero did not learn till afterwards that the man had struck it rich at the mines sold out his claim for ten thousand dollars and for the time being was the lucky possessor of a large bank account now tom scott expostulated the landlord this aint fair i want the wagon moren you do and youre araisin the price on me how do you know that drawled scott ive got a pile and i mean to take it easy while it lasts im going back to the mines like a gentleman with my own team you bet if ive got money enough to buy one the landlord was satisfied that if he wanted the team he must outbid his competitor and advanced his offer to thirteen hundred dollars but tom scott was not terrified his money had come easily and he would not let two or three hundred dollars stand in the way of his wishes ill go fifteen he drawled the landlord shrugged his shoulders and said in a disappointed tone youll have to take it scott youve gone ahead of my pile well stranger is it a bargain asked scott the scotchman though inwardly elated as well as astonished at the extraordinary offer he had received answered quietly if my partner agrees i guess wed better sell said tom trying not to betray his inward satisfaction all right said scott appearing to be well pleased you can have your money when you want it if you are going to frisco ill give you an order on my banker there tom scotts a square man and his order will fetch the money said the landlord observing fergusons prudent hesitation that is satisfactory replied ferguson in five minutes more the business was concluded and ferguson and tom longing to congratulate each other on their good fortune walked off together were in luck mr ferguson said tom i dont know whether i stand on my head or my heels i never expected such a price twelve hundred dollars is a great profit said ferguson i almost doubt whether we are justified in asking such an extortionate price of the poor man he is pleased with his bargain and i dont think we need to trouble ourselves about that answered tom besides you know we cant compare prices with those at home no doubt there is reason in what you say my lad but its not easy at first to make allowance for the difference thats so mr ferguson when shall we go to san francisco we will go tomorrow if we can i suppose you will wish to send some money to your father yes i am in a hurry to send to him for i am sure he needs it already i can hardly realize that i am worth five hundred dollars five hundred yes i had a third share in the team that isnt my way of looking at it tom is it possible mr ferguson would cheat me out of my fair share thought tom but he only harbored the suspicion for an instant he had seen too much of his friend to believe such a thing and he quietly waited for an explanation ill tell you how i propose that we divide it tom first well take out the money each of us put in one hundred for you and two hundred for me and then well divide the profit equally but protested tom you are entitled to twothirds then i wont take it said ferguson decidedly i only want half of the profit that will give me eight hundred dollars and that ought to satisfy me and i shall have seven hundred said tom his eyes sparkling precisely how kind you are mr ferguson exclaimed tom eagerly seizing the scotchmans hand no my lad i am only just i am glad to help a boy who is working for his father and family i shouldnt deserve to succeed if i didnt said tom earnestly always bear that in mind my lad and god will smile on your efforts and raise you up friends in spite of the high price tom and his partner felt justified now in stopping over night at the hotel where they had met with such a piece of good luck and the next day started down the river for san francisco chapter xxi tom buys a business it was an interesting moment for our two friends when they landed in san francisco the future western metropolis was only a town of scattered wooden and adobe houses with irregular streets and a general lack of uniformity in its buildings but everybody seemed on the alert the number of drones was wonderfully small even the constitutionally lazy could not resist the golden incentives to labor money was looked upon with very different eyes there and at the east no one took the trouble to dispute prices and a man who landed with an article rare or desirable could often obtain twenty times its value within ten minutes of his arrival tom witnessed a case of this kind just as he was entering montgomery street he noticed a man evidently a newcomer with a fine bunch of pineapples in his hand he had just arrived in the steamer columbus then anchored out in the stream i shouldnt mind having one of those pineapples said tom to ferguson doubtless they are highpriced being a rarity said the scotchman just then a passerby attracted like tom and feeling a similar longing stepped up to the newcomer are those pineapples for sale he asked yes if youll pay enough was the halfjocular reply name your price ten dollars here is your money and he put a gold piece into the hand of the astounded passenger which represented ten times the sum he had paid for the fruit at san blas thats a pretty steep price said tom for six pineapples it is very wasteful to spend such a sight of money to pamper the appetite said the canny scot truly a fool and his money are soon parted he was destined to be still more surprised the purchaser within five minutes transferred half his purchase to another for fifteen dollars gold seems to be plenty here said tom i hope all provisions are not as high said ferguson or we shall soon have a chance to spend all we have where shall we go first asked tom we had better go to a public house and secure a lodging said ferguson i wish i knew some one here to direct me scarcely had tom uttered these words than he cried out in surprise why theres john miles they were passing a little unpainted wooden building of one and a half stories used as a grocery a german name was on the sign but behind the rough counter stood the familiar form of john miles tom dashed into the store followed by his more dignified companion how are you john he exclaimed why if it isnt tom returned miles his face showing the joy he felt and heres mr ferguson too then there ensued a hearty shaking of hands followed by the question when did you get here about twenty minutes ago and you came straight to me thats good so it is but its an accident we had no idea where you were so you are a grocer john is the place yours if it is then ive changed my name said miles pointing to the sign bearing the name john schinkelwitz the first names right at any rate said tom laughing i suppose you are the clerk then yes how long have you been here four weeks is it a good business very good my dutch friend pays me five dollars a day and i sleep here among the groceries yes it saves me the expense of a bed outside and that is a good deal i havent saved quite enough to pay you yet tom but i can soon no hurry john i have been lucky since i saw you i am glad to hear it tom did the claim prove more productive no but i have been speculating guess how much money i have with me a hundred and fifty dollars more two hundred more yet not three hundred tom i wont make you guess any more i have seven hundred dollars no wonder you look surprised ill tell you how i made it and tom repeated the story of his purchase and its profitable sale i am not so much surprised now said miles for in this country a man will have what he takes a fancy to no matter what it costs i am glad the good luck came to you and mr ferguson i shouldnt mind having that amount of money myself what would you do with it i would buy out my employer and then i could make money fast does he want to sell yes he wants to go to the mines would he sell for such a small sum yes there isnt much of a stock but we are constantly replenishing i tell you what tom you buy him out and ill manage the business are you in earnest john certainly i am but i want to send some money home objected tom how much a hundred dollars at least ill lend you the hundred my lad said ferguson and fifty more and you can take your own money and buy the business i dont favor acting hastily in general but i have faith in our friend here and i am led to believe that the enterprise will be a profitable one youll be my partner tom and ill give you a third of the profits without your doing a thing if you work with me you shall have as much more as will be satisfactory i would rather go back to the mines john and leave you to manage this business by yourself a quarter of the profits will satisfy me no it shall be a third as you furnish the capital that is only fair we may be counting our chickens too soon perhaps your dutch friend whose name i cant pronounce wont sell here he is to speak for himself a short german with a ponderous frame and a broad goodhumored face here entered the grocery panting with the exertion of walking and looked inquiringly at tom and the scotchman herr schinkelwitz this is my friend tom nelson said miles glad to see you mine vriend said the german addressing ferguson no that is mr ferguson said miles smiling i should have introduced him first wie gehts herr ferguson said the grocer you have one strange name your name seems strange to me said the scotchman oh no schinkelwitz is a very common name most peoples admire my name tom was considerably amused but herr schinkelwitz did not observe the smile which he could not repress i have told my friends you would like to sell out the business said miles oh ja it is a good business but my health is not good i think it will be much better at the mines you will do well to buy it yourself i would if i had money enough ja i must have the money for i shall need it my friend here has money and may buy of you said miles indicating tom what the boy yes where did he get so much money at the mines oh ja that is a good place to get gold well my young vriend i will sell cheap it will not be necessary to enter into a detailed account of the negotiation it is enough to say that for the sum of seven hundred dollars herr schinkelwitz made over the business to herr tom as he called him and our hero found himself penniless but the owner of a grocery in half an hour it was all completed now tom you are my boss said miles shall i put your name outside no john put your own i am only a silent partner you know i congratulate you tom said ferguson here are two hundred dollars for which you can give me your note two hundred yes you will need some yourself besides what you send to your father suppose i cant pay you back then i will levy on the grocery my lad said ferguson chapter xxii a gamblinghouse having completed this important business arrangement the two friends went out to explore the town the limits were narrow compared with those of the flourishing city of the present day where the palace and grand hotels now stand was a sandhill and the bay encroached upon the business part of the city far more than now scarcely a stones throw from the grocery on montgomery street between california and sacramento was the office of adams express which advertised to forward golddust and packages by every steamer i will go in here mr ferguson said tom i shall not feel comfortable till i have started this money homeward i am sure it will be wanted right my lad we will attend to it by all means they entered the building a very humble one it would now be considered but they found other customers before them and had to wait for their turn what can i do for you asked the clerk in a quick businesslike tone i want to send home a hundred dollars said tom give me the address this was done the money paid over and a receipt returned in two minutes how long before my father will receive the money asked tom the steamer starts in three days about a month will be needed then tom moved aside and the next man took his place i am glad that is attended to said tom relieved now mr ferguson i will go wherever you wish we had better secure a lodging said the scotchman when we are sure of a bed we can walk about at our leisure lodgings were to be had but they were generally very dear the first room looked at was five dollars per day without board a price our friends were unwilling to pay finally they found a decent though small room with rather a narrow bed which could be had for three fifths of that sum and they engaged it we will have to go back to the mines soon said tom san francisco is too expensive for us to live in you can afford it better than i tom said his friend why because you have a business that brings you in an income oh i forgot that said our hero smiling things happen so fast here that i havent got used to my new position do you think i invested my money wisely mr ferguson yes my lad since your agent is a trustworthy honest man i am sure i can trust john miles if i were not confident of it also i would not have encouraged you to take so important a step i think i wont write to father about it said tom after a pause he might think i had acted foolishly and become anxious if i succeed then i shall be glad to surprise him i think i shall make money but i dont want to count on it too much i shall be ready to go back with you to the mines whenever you say the word as they sauntered about gazing curiously at the motley sights around them they heard strains of music it appeared to proceed from a large wooden building with a jutting roof under which on benches lounged a number of persons some of them mexicans in their native costumes smoking cigarettes a large american flag was displayed over the door and a crowd was constantly passing in and out let us go in said tom his companion making no objection they entered the first sight of the interior made clear the character of the place there were numerous tables spread with games faro monte and roulette each surrounded by an absorbed and interested group easy come easy go was the rule with the early california pioneers and the gamingtable enlisted in its service many men who would not have dreamed at home that they could ever be brought to tolerate such an instrument of evil tom was a country boy and unsophisticated but he could not help understanding the nature of the business which brought so many to the place i suppose they are gambling he said yes poor deluded creatures said the scotchman who had been brought up to an abhorrence of games of chance they are wasting their time and their substance and foolishly laying up for themselves future misery had this remark been heard it would have excited indignation and perhaps subjected the speaker to insult but the players were too intent upon their varying chances to pay any attention to the remarks of bystanders i hope tom you will never yield to the seductive lures of the gamingtable continued ferguson i dont think there is much danger said tom i have always been taught that gambling is wicked may you long feel so my lad tom did however watch the players with interest he saw money lost and won without understanding exactly how it was decided from the game his attention was drawn to the gamesters he was led to notice particularly a young man of prepossessing countenance who was evidently profoundly excited from time to time he drew out a roll of gold pieces which he placed on a card and invariably lost he must have had a considerable sum but small or large he was in illluck and constantly lost as he neared the end of his resources the feverish blush upon his handsome features was succeeded by a deep pallor and there was no mistaking the expression of deep anguish and despair which announced that he had reached the end tom became painfully interested in the young man and silently drew the attention of his companion to him when the end came and the victim thoroughly cleaned out turned to go out tom said in a low voice let us follow him ferguson acquiesced he too had become interested and the young mans expression as he passed our two friends was so despairing that ferguson felt some alarm as to the effect of his disappointment upon his mind once in the street ferguson and tom followed the unfortunate young man into an obscure street keeping up with difficulty for his pace was rapid and excited it proved to be a fortunate thing for when he supposed himself free from observation the young man drew a pistol and with an incoherent exclamation placed it in contact with his temple tom sprang forward and so did the scotchman but the boy was the quicker and more agile and dashed the pistol aside just in time to prevent a suicide why did you do that asked the baffled wouldbesuicide gloomily turning his gaze upon tom i was afraid you were going to kill yourself so i was what could induce you to take such a rash step asked ferguson i have been a reckless fool i have lost all my money at the accursed gamblingtable and my life is not worth retaining it appears to me said the scotchman quietly that you set too high a value upon money you have certainly been very foolish to risk it at the gamingtable and the loss will no doubt inconvenience you but was your money all you had to live for the young man regarded ferguson with some surprise but his excitement was evidently abated the quiet tone of the speaker had a favorable effect upon him i didnt think of it in that light he admitted have you no relatives to whom your life is of value yes answered the young man i have a mother and sister would not your death affect them more than the loss of money yes it seems to me that to take your life would be to treat them cruelly the young man was evidently agitated by contending thoughts i suppose you are right he said slowly but let me tell you all and you can judge me better i arrived in california six months since my home is in ohio not far from cincinnati i was fortunate enough to commence mining at a point on the western slope of the sierra nevada mountains where i was almost alone i struck it rich and two days since arrived in san francisco with over two thousand dollars in golddust you were certainly in luck said ferguson surprised i turned it into money and in strolling about the city was lured into that accursed den i looked on and was fascinated i thought i would try my luck i began with a small stake and kept on till i had lost every dollar in one hour the fruits of six months labor are gone do you wonder that i am reduced to despair chapter xxiii a new scheme i see no cause for despair replied ferguson in the same calm tone i have not a penny left out of the two thousand dollars i had only an hour since i understand all that i am a ruined man said the young man despondently i dont admit that how old are you twentyone you are well and strong are you not oh yes i have nothing to complain of on that score then it appears to me that your loss is not serious your capital still remains my capital repeated the young man yes your strong arms your education your capacity to labor but i shall have to begin over again beginning over again at your age when possibly fifty years of life lie before you is not such a serious matter were i in your situation and i am twice as old as you i should not thing of despairing dont you think it would be rather foolish for two thousand dollars which you have been only six months in accumulating to throw away fifty years and all that you can make in that time thereby bringing a lifelong grief to your mother and sister the calm logical tone of the scotchman had its effect i see that i was about to add to one piece of folly another far greater said the young man i dont know who you are sir but i heartily thank you and your son for saving my life this is not my son but my young friend thomas nelson said ferguson i am not so fortunate as to have a son well god bless you both and goodnight excuse my persistency but may i ask where you are going i am not going to repeat my folly of just now if that is what you mean i did not suspect you of that but are you sure of a bed anywhere no i have no money to pay for one i shall walk the streets or possibly lie down in some quiet place i was accustomed to roughing it at the mines and can do it again if necessary tom and i have a room in which you are welcome to find a shelter i am sorry that our bed is too narrow to hold another thank you that will be better than to sleep in the streets but are you not afraid to make me this offer why should i be i might rob you during the night you might but you dont look like one who would so reward confidence you are right if you had fifty thousand dollars i would not touch a dollar of it i will accept your offer how can i repay you for your kindness there may be a way we will talk of that this evening nine oclock found the three collected in the small room which had been hired by ferguson for himself and tom my friend said ferguson you told us that you found a favorable place for mining up in the sierras yes i struck it rich i take it for granted that you did not exhaust the wealth of the place far from it i only dipped into it there is abundance left is this place known to many to only one so far as i know he and i worked independently but were company for each other but what induced you to leave so rich a claim i was tired of working and wanted to come to the city for a change you know what a change i have experienced here why dont you go back and start anew in the place where you met with your former good fortune asked ferguson because i am penniless i must find something to do here for a while when i have got together a little fund sufficient for the purpose i will go back would you go back now if you had the chance would i certainly i would for i could make money faster there than here would you have any objection to let tom and myself accompany you not the least i should be glad of your company there is gold enough for us all then we will start tomorrow that is if you and tom are willing i am ready said tom promptly but i have nothing i dont like to be an expense to you objected the young man we will pay your expenses we shall be more than recompensed by the richness of the mines we might find something to do here but both tom and myself prefer the freedom of the mining camp and if the spot is as rich as you have led us to suspect we shall make more money there agreed said the young man promptly name the hour of starting and rely upon me to be ready ferguson was evidently well pleased with this response he felt that his new acquaintance would be so far away from the city and would sooner retrieve his fortunes at the mines he hoped too to find opportunity to strengthen his principles and guard him against the temptations of the city when he should again visit it again he had reason to think that the arrangement would benefit tom and himself in a pecuniary way and the scotchman was by no means indifferent to that consideration though as we have seen he did not unduly exalt the power or value of money tom too was pleased with the prospect he was grateful and attached to ferguson whom he felt to be a true friend but he was glad to have another companion nearer his own age the young man was of a prepossessing exterior and when he had shaken off his present disquietude looked as if he might be a cheerful and agreeable companion since we are to live together for a time at least and become fellowworkers said ferguson we ought to know each other better i will introduce myself first hereupon ferguson gave a brief account of himself which need not be repeated and then called upon tom who followed his example now it is my turn said their new acquaintance you dont even know my name yet though you have done me such an important service i have already told you that i am from ohio my name is richard russell though my friends generally call me dick my father whom i had the misfortune to lose several years since was at one time a member of congress he left a small property the income of which is barely sufficient to provide my mother and sister with the comforts of life i had a fair education including enough latin and greek to fit me for entering college my mother desired me to enter but i knew that she could not keep me there without practicing pinching economy and i secured a place with a small salary in a business house in cincinnati a year since when the papers were full of the gold discoveries on this coast i was seized like so many others with the golden fever and arranged to start overland it would have proved a wise step had i not been so rash a fool as to squander my earnings for two thousand dollars in six months compare very favorably with twelve dollars a week which i was earning at home i might have gone home by the next steamer and had money enough to carry me through a course of legal study had i desired i am out of patience with myself when i think of how i have thrown away my good fortune dont think too much of the past which cannot be recalled resolve not to repeat your folly and all may yet be well i have fully resolved upon that said russell earnestly do you think you shall study law if you are again fortunate mr russell asked tom if you please dont call me mr russell unless you want me to call you mr nelson call me dick i will said tom smiling for i am not ready to be called mr nelson yet now to answer your question if i can get two thousand dollars together again i shall probably study law of course i dont mean to be a miner all my life any more than you now tom what are your plans i think i should like to be a lawyer too but i must earn more than two thousand dollars first two thousand ought to be sufficient to educate you if you are economical it would be but i want to pay off a mortgage on my fathers farm before i begin to lay up money for myself you are a good fellow tom and i wish you success thank you dick i will succeed if hard work can bring success goodnight to you both said ferguson i want to sleep well to prepare myself for starting tomorrow in half an hour all three were sleeping soundly chapter xxiv preparing for a new start when tom opened his eyes he did not at first remember where he was but a glance at dick russell his new acquaintance stretched out on the floor and still sleeping quickly recalled the important events of the day previous mr ferguson was already dressed well tom are you rested he asked yes mr ferguson i slept like a top what time is it it is seven oclock our new friend is still asleep i suppose he was on his feet all day yesterday i dont know whether i ought to hurry you away from san francisco so soon tom said his scotch friend we only arrived yesterday and you have not had time to see the place and enjoy yourself after your hard work at the mines i dont care for that mr ferguson i am anxious to be at work again i didnt come out here to enjoy myself but to make money for my father you have succeeded pretty well thus far tom yes but i have made more by the sale of the team than by work at the mines true but that is a legitimate transaction if our friend here has reported correctly we shall find mining more profitable in the place he mentions than at river bend i have no objection to that though i was satisfied with river bend wouldnt it be splendid mr ferguson if we could do as well in the next six months as he did making two thousand dollars each yes we may accomplish it but it is best not to calculate upon it if i could only free the farm from that troublesome mortgage i should be proud and happy it has worn upon father as i could see and he has been compelled to toil early and late to pay the interest besides supporting us all how much is the mortgage tom twentytwo hundred dollars you have made a good beginning towards it already tom you have seven hundred dollars invested in business but out of that i owe you a hundred and fifty mr ferguson dont trouble yourself about that tom unless i should stand in great need of it i will wait till you have paid off the mortgage before asking to have it repaid you are very kind mr ferguson said tom gratefully a part of my seven hundred dollars rightfully belongs to you for you owned twothirds of the horse and wagon i couldnt have bought them without your help tom so you see that you enabled me to make money i am quite satisfied with an equal partnership and i am very well satisfied with my partner said tom smiling shall we wake up russell yes for we have much to do today john miles will be surprised at my leaving the city so quick by the way tom as he is to remain here while you are out of the reach of postoffices it may be well to ask your father to direct future letters to his care and he can forward them as he has opportunity that is a good idea i will write today so as to catch the next steamer and i will also speak to john tom had to shake dick russell energetically before that young man opened his eyes whats the matter he ejaculated drowsily dont you want some breakfast asked tom oh its you tom yes you have touched the right chord i have a firstclass appetite and no money he added his face clouding mr ferguson is treasurer said tom lightly wishing to divert russell from the thoughts of his heavy loss and the folly to which he owed it but we know very little of the city can you guide us to a good restaurant to a good one but not a cheap one everything is high here then it is fortunate we are going to leave so soon in a small restaurant on montgomery street our three friends partook of a hearty breakfast it might not have attracted an epicure but neither of the three was fastidious and though the charge was five dollars ferguson economical as he was paid the bill cheerfully it was the first civilized breakfast he had eaten for months and it might be months before he would be able to partake of another as good i wish we could breakfast like this at the mines said tom so say i chimed in dick russell but you know that the goldhunter must sacrifice home comforts i shant complain of that if i can do as well as you did said tom i see no reason why you cant there is plenty of gold there and all that is needed is work and perseverance i am willing to contribute them said tom i mean to do my best to succeed none of us can do more my lad said ferguson let us hope that god will prosper our undertakings i say i am glad i have met with you two said dick russell youll keep me on the right track and in spite of my past folly i hope in time to win success i am glad to hear you speak so sensibly my young friend said the scotchman kindly its a great deal better to put your back to the wheel once more than to take the life god gave you dont speak of that again mr ferguson said russell shuddering i dont like to think of it hell do thought ferguson with satisfaction his mind is now in a healthy condition and i have great hopes of him the rest of the day was devoted to the purchase of supplies ferguson also bought a mule in behalf of the party which was of service in carrying a part of their burdens it was not until afternoon that tom found an opportunity to call on john miles and acquaint him with his almost immediate departure i am sorry you are going away so soon tom said miles i thought you would stay at least a week so i would if i were not so anxious to be at work once more you know how my father is situated john for i have told you more than once yes tom but i see no reason why you should feel uneasy with the help you are to send him there will be no trouble about his paying his interest regularly i know that john but i shall feel uneasy until the mortgage is paid off and he is out of squire hudsons power for how long a time has the farm your father owns been encumbered with this mortgage for ten years at least is the mortgage for any specified term of years i dont think so it merely runs from year to year then i suppose so in that case this squire hudson could foreclose at any time could he not yes answered tom soberly dont make yourself uneasy about it however said miles observing that tom seemed apprehensive as your fathers farm is not particularly valuable there can be no danger of foreclosure by the way wouldnt you like to have me remit your father something next month out of the profits of the business i can charge it to your account i am glad you mentioned it john you may send him fifty or seventyfive dollars if my share should amount to so much i will and i am going to have my home letters directed to your care you can forward them to me whenever you have an opportunity i wont fail tom if there is anything you need sent out to you you have only to write me and i will attend to your commissions it is very convenient to have an agent in the city said john smiling i shall feel much more comfortable out at the mines i wish you good luck tom but remember even if you dont succeed in your search for gold i shall be making money for you here you make me feel quite like a capitalist john i hope you may be one some day goodby they shook hands and parted before nightfall tom had started on his new journey in quest of gold chapter xxv whiteface mark nelson missed sorely the cow which he had been compelled to yield to the squire on account of default of interest whiteface was his best cow and a great favorite with all the children she gave nearly as much milk as the other two and had been one of the main dependences of the family it was worth considerably more than the thirty dollars for which the squire took it but he insisted upon that and no other and whiteface had to go six months had passed and there seemed to be very little chance of redeeming the lost cow squire hudson had agreed to give her back on payment of the balance due with accrued interest but neither he nor mark nelson expected that such an offer would be made i was passing squire hudsons today and saw poor whiteface said walter one evening i think she knew me for when i called her she lowed back i wish we had her back said sarah it was heartless in the squire to take her he had a dozen cows of his own he hasnt any heart said walter or if he has it must be pretty small we must not forget that he was entitled to some security for the balance of interest i owe him said the farmer the cow was worth a good deal more than thirty dollars said sarah yes she was but i am not sure whether i could have got any more money for her at a forced sale then you know the squire is pledged to give her back whenever i can pay him the thirty dollars with interest i wish you could pay it now father said walter so do i my boy but i cannot unless your brother sends me some money it is three weeks since we have heard from tom said mrs nelson anxiously i am afraid he is sick dont worry yourself with imaginary fears mary said her husband tom may be sick of course but he is strong and healthy and we wont fear such a thing without some ground probably a letter is on the way from him now i hope he is making money said walter i wish i were with him i would never consent to have you go too said mrs nelson hastily i dont think walter seriously thinks of asking leave said mr nelson smiling as he is only thirteen years old i should be inclined to object myself i must have him at home to help me with the farm i should be perfectly contented to stay at home if we had whiteface back said walter ive a great mind to steal her out of the squires yard i bet shed be glad to come dont speak in that way walter said his father i dislike to have you speak of stealing even in fun at this moment there was a knock at the front door farmer nelsons house was an oldfashioned one and not provided with a bell go to the door sarah said her father sarah obeyed goodevening nahum she said to the village expressman ive got a small package for your folks said nahum its marked all over guess it came from californy it must be from tom exclaimed sarah in delight thats what i thought said the expressman who knew everybody in the village and could probably give a fairly correct list of their sisters cousins and aunts with a fair guess at their worldly circumstances is there anything to pay nahum only fifty cents the expressage from boston never mind about it now for im in a hurry your father can hand it to me next time he sees me o father heres a package from tom said sarah hurrying into the room where they were all sitting open it quick said walter see if theres any money in it the cord was cut and a small box was disclosed containing a hundred dollars in gold pieces and a line from tom stating that he was doing well and that he hoped soon to send some more money a hundred dollars what a lot of money exclaimed walter gazing on the little pile of coins as if fascinated i am so glad the dear boy is doing well said mrs nelson now we can have whiteface back cant we father asked walter joyfully yes walter said mark nelson almost as excited as his son i will go over the first thing in the morning cant we go over this evening asked walter impatiently no it is dark and whiteface is stalled for the night youll have seventy dollars left over father wont you yes and that will provide for my next interest i feel grateful and happy at toms success and his thoughtfulness could tom have seen the effect of his remittance it would have made his heart glad and he would have felt abundantly repaid for his labor and selfdenial chapter xxvi squire hudsons disappointment if whiteface was missed at her old home she was scarcely less appreciated by her new possessor on the very morning succeeding the day when toms remittance was received the squire remarked to his head workman whiteface is an excellent cow abner yes squire i calculate shes the best youve got i dont know but she is abner said the squire complacently i consider her worth at least fifty dollars so she is every cent of it and she cost me only thirty thought squire hudson with a smile of content he was a rich man and abundantly able to pay his poor neighbor the full value of the cow but somehow it never occurred to him to do it he was not above taking an unfair advantage of a man who was unluckily in his power of course the squire knew that farmer nelson had a right to redeem the cow at the price agreed upon with interest but he felt pretty safe on this point the farmer was not very likely to have thirty dollars to spare and as for a remittance from tom the squire was pretty sure none would be received itll be all the boy can do to take care of himself out there he reflected let alone sending money home he may send ten dollars or so some time but its very doubtful very doubtful squire hudson turned to go back to the house when he saw the man of whom he had been thinking coming up the road he stopped short thinking the farmer might wish to speak to him goodmorning mr nelson he said pleasantly for he was in goodhumor goodmorning squire your whiteface has got to feel quite at home in my barnyard she is a good cow squire hudson yes tolerable tolerable she is worth more than the thirty dollars for which you took her well i dont know about that cows are pretty cheap nowadays i see how it is thought the squire nelson wants me to allow him more for the cow but a bargain is a bargain and i shant do it i always valued her at a considerably higher price no doubt no doubt you raised her yourself didnt you yes that makes a difference of course you attach a sentimental value to her but that doesnt affect her real value i really cant allow you any more for her i dont want you to squire hudson the squire looked astonished what is the man driving at he thought she may not be worth any more to you and so you wont mind my taking her back taking her back ejaculated the squire certainly it was agreed that i could redeem her at any time by paying you the thirty dollars and interest not after two months said the squire hastily it is not two months it was only six weeks yesterday the fact is squire ive come for whiteface and ive got the money for you have you heard from tom asked the squire with a blank look of disappointment yes i heard from him yesterday and he sent you some money yes he reports that he is doing well did he send you thirty dollars rather more than that said mark nelson not caring to gratify the curiosity of his creditor i think you had better keep your money and leave whiteface with me said squire hudson after a pause i would rather not squire the fact is whiteface is a sort of pet at home and we all want her back squire hudson was disconcerted he had not expected that mr nelson would be able to redeem the cow and he was reluctant to give her up but there was no excuse for retaining her his agreement stood in the way neighbor nelson he said after a pause i dont mind giving you five dollars over and above what you owe me for whiteface come thats a good offer mark nelson shook his head shes worth more than that he said but thats neither here nor there i raised the animal and it was sorely against my will that i parted with her six weeks ago now that i have the money to pay you i want her back i think you are standing in your own light mr nelson said the squire i have taken a fancy to the cow and am willing to pay more for her than she is worth i will say ten dollars mark nelson shook his head id rather have whiteface than the money he said if she comes into my possession again said squire hudson i shall not be willing to grant you the privilege of redeeming her it wont be many months before another payment becomes due i hope to be ready to meet it squire said the farmer not appearing at all anxious he seems very independent thought the squire watching moodily the cow driven away by her former owner he may sing another tune on interest day i wonder how much the boy sent home had he known that mr nelson had in his pocket enough money to pay the whole of the next accruing interest he would have felt more doubtful about recovering the cow which he now coveted more than ever well abner ive lost her said the squire hurrying to his assistant but shell be back here some day mark my words i thought you bought her squire said abner in surprise well not exactly i took her for a debt but nelson had the right of redeeming her and he has done it his boy sent him the money that tom nelson is a smart boy said abner who though in the squires employ was friendly to our hero well soso remarked the squire indifferently i helped him to go to california but i am not sure whether it was a wise step i let my feelings get the better of my judgment then it is the first time was abners unspoken comment it may turn out for the best he said aloud i doubt if i shall ever see my money again said the squire but he did not seem to take it to heart judging from his manner and tone didnt you have security for the loan asked abner well yees answered the squire slowly but not very good the farm was already mortgaged for its full value the squire is getting benevolent thought abner or he wants me to think so but im inclined to think he has some object under it all what is it a few weeks later farmer nelsons heart was gladdened by the receipt of another remittance this time sent by john miles out of the profit of the business in which tom was his partner the amount this time was seventyfive dollars it made him feel quite rich mary he said we all need some new clothes and i propose to use this money for that purpose now i want you to consider how we can spend it to the best advantage to begin with you must buy a new dress you have long needed one mrs nelson demurred a little but was forced to admit that the dress was needed so the purchases were made at once it is wonderful how far seventyfive dollars will go in an economical family of plain tastes it was soon apparent to the neighbors that the nelsons were exhibiting signs of prosperity it must be tom they decided efforts were made to ascertain just how much our hero had sent home but on this point the nelsons would not speak definitely they reported in general terms that tom was doing well of course squire hudson was not ignorant of the apparent improvement in the fortunes of his debtor strange to say he seemed rather annoyed he was pleased however by the outlay for dress theyre getting extravagant abner he said cheerfully i thought mark nelson was a man of more sense because his son has sent home a little money he must rig out the whole family in new clothes a fool and his money are soon parted mark nelson is no fool said abner stoutly he is in this instance said the squire sharply however i dont object to it if he likes to violate the rules of prudence it strikes me however that it would be well for him to pay up the money i advanced for toms expenses before buying new clothes wholesale abner repeated this to mr nelson the farmer answered quietly the squire is not wholly wrong it is good doctrine to pay your debts before you spend money for what you dont need in this case however we did need the clothes we bought now that we are provided i hope before very long if tom is prospered to pay back the two hundred dollars the squire advanced for him i hope you will im sure said abner thats a smart boy of yours and i always said so he is a good boy and i am sure he will do what is right hes a blamed sight better than the squires boy sinclair is a stuckup jackanapes and it would do me good to kick him it might not do him any good i am not sure about that i think he needs it chapter xxvii the new diggings meanwhile tom and his party pursuing their journey by easy stages for they sensibly determined not to overtask their strength reached at last the spot of which russell had spoken ferguson and tom soon found that he had not exaggerated the new diggings were certainly far richer than those at river bend it was in fact the bed of a dead river upon which russell had stumbled without knowing it my readers are probably aware that in the beds of rivers or creeks the early miners found their first harvest of gold and that where practicable these were mined by turning the stream in the dry season when the water was low as it may not be so well understood what is meant by a dead river i quote a passage from an article in the overland monthly as found in the pages of the pacific coast mining review for the year a dead river is one which formerly existed but exists no longer in volcanic regions it sometimes happens that the liquid lava seeking the lowest ground fills up the beds of the rivers which die and are replaced by watercourses running in other channels and in different directions these dead streams are so few and of so little importance elsewhere that as yet i believe no class name has been given to them but in california they are among the chief source of its mineral wealth and among the most remarkable features of its geological formation they take us back to a remote era before the time of rome of greece or of egypt far back beyond the origin of history or tradition before our coast had taken its present shapes before shasta and lassen and castle peaks had poured out their lava floods before the sacramento river had its birth and while if not before the mastodon the elephant the rhinoceros the horse the mammoth bull the tapir and the bison lived in the land they are indeed among the most remarkable discoveries of the age and among the greatest wonders of geology they deserve some common name and we have to choose between extinct and dead we speak of extinct volcanoes and of dead languages and as the latter is saxon and short we prefer it they have been called old channels but this name does not convey the proper idea since a channel is not necessarily a river and an old channel is not necessarily a dead one a dead river is a channel formerly occupied by a running stream but now filled up with earthy or rocky matter and is not to be confounded with a channel that is open and remains dry during the greater part of the year because of a lack of water or that has been abandoned by the stream for a deeper channel elsewhere a dry riverbed is not a dead river the dead rivers of california so far as are known are on the western slope of the sierra nevada from five hundred to seven thousand feet above the level of the sea they are all goldyielding and therefore they have been sought and examined they have yielded probably three hundred millions in all they now produce perhaps eight million dollars annually they are not less interesting to the miner than to the geologist not less important to the statesman than to the antiquarian at the risk of being considered tedious by some of my boyreaders i will transcribe the writers explanation of the existence of these dead rivers for the reason we must go back to a remote geological epoch the main cause must have been the subsequent rise of the sierra nevada suppose that a range of mountains seven thousand feet high were upheaved thirty miles east of the mississippi that the bed of that stream were on the mountain side three thousand feet above the sea and that thirty miles west the country maintained its present level the result would be that the present mississippi would soon be a dead river it would be cut across by streams running down the mountain side and flowing into a new mississippi thirty miles or more west of the present one we know that the sierra nevada has been upheaved that a large stream ran on what is now the mountain side and that it has been succeeded by a new river farther west and we must infer that the death of the old and the birth of the new river were caused by the upheaval reference is here made to the big blue lead the largest dead river known in california which has been traced for a distance of sixtyfive miles from little grizzly in sierra county to forest hill in placer county the original river however is thought to have run for many hundreds of miles eventually traces of its existence may be found elsewhere it is not to be supposed that tom and his friends knew anything about dead rivers or troubled themselves as to how the rich deposits had been made or how long they had been waiting discovery they were chiefly engaged with more practical considerations they found a rich harvest in the ravines and they went to work energetically the work was monotonous and a detailed account of their progress would be tiresome what we chiefly care about is results and these may be gathered from a conversation which took place some five months later under a tent at nightfall reclined the three friends they looked contented and on good terms with the world but though prosperous they certainly did not look it in fact they were all three exceedingly almost disreputably shabby they looked more like tramps than respectable goldminers tom you are looking very ragged said dick russell surveying our hero critically i know it dick i feel as though i had just come out of a ragbag i cant say that you look much better nor ferguson either this rough work is hard on clothing said russell i wish there were a readymade clothing store near by so do i i would pay a high price for a good suit if our friends at home could see us what would they think eh tom that we were candidates for the poorhouse thats so ive been into several poorhouses in the course of my life but i never saw any of the inmates quite so poorly clad as we are you are right said ferguson but there are generally compensations i was taking account of stock and i estimate that i have from sixteen to eighteen hundred dollars worth of golddust i have nearly as much said tom my pile wont vary far from toms said russell that is a pretty good showing for five months my friend said the scotchman it will make up for the old clothes said tom i have been thinking said ferguson that we need a vacation what do you say to starting next week for san francisco i agree said russell promptly and i said tom i should like to see john miles very well we will continue our work about a week longer and then start chapter xxviii a rich deposit about the middle of the next forenoon tom suddenly stopped work whats the matter tom are you tired no but i feel like exploring a little who goes with me not i answered ferguson let well enough alone ill go with you said russell i should like a holiday besides we may discover something a rolling stone gathers no moss said ferguson true but theres another proverb all work and no play makes jack a dull boy tom and i will try a little play the two friends sauntered away in an idle mood yet combining business with pleasure they watched carefully the surface indications ready to avail themselves of any that were favorable its a strange life we are leading tom said russell it is free and independent and healthful but i shouldnt like to live so all my life nor i answered tom no amount of gold would repay me because gold is only valuable for what it will bring here it brings nothing except the hope of future ease and comfort suggested tom of course that is what we are working for we have made a good beginning yes dick i have almost accomplished what i have had in view ever since i left home i know you mean paying off your fathers mortgage thats it it amounts to twentytwo hundred dollars and i have but a few hundred dollars more to earn i would stay here a month or two longer if my clothes would hold together but i cant risk it you need rest at any rate tom leaving clothes out of the question as he spoke tom without special thought drove his pick into the ground it was a lucky inspiration some shining particles attracted the attention of russell tom he exclaimed in excitement do you see that and that i believe youve struck a bonanza upon that both set to work in earnest a further investigation showed that russell was right tom by good luck had chanced upon a deposit of far greater richness than any they had yet encountered if it holds out our fortunes are made tom said russell go and call ferguson and i will remain on guard till you come back tom stood not on the order of his going but went at once whats the matter tom asked the scotchman as panting and breathless tom stood before him has anything happened to russell no its good news splendid news mr ferguson weve found a place ten times as rich as this come at once and see ferguson made preparations to accompany tom with what seemed to our hero to be provoking deliberation in truth the scotchman with his national caution was rather skeptical as to toms news and did not suffer himself to become enthusiastic or excited tom had hard work to accommodate his impatient steps to the measured pace of his more sedate companion when at length they reached the spot they found russell no less impatient i thought you would never come he said tom wanted to fly said ferguson but i am too old for that now what is it you have found when he was shown what had been discovered he admitted that it was very promising if it holds out we shall be lucky he said it will hold out said russell enthusiastically it isnt well to be too confident said ferguson cautiously you are very coldblooded mr ferguson said russell impatiently wont anything excite you what good would it do to become excited returned the scotchman i am as ready to test the matter as you are and i shall rejoice if your sanguine expectations are realized do not expect too much however and you will guard against possible disappointment but there was no disappointment awaiting them they worked steadily for two weeks with marvelous results in this time they unearthed six thousand dollars worth of gold which by arrangement they divided equally between them and still the gold deposit was far from being exhausted at the end of the fortnight they were visited by a party of capitalists from san francisco who were out on an exploring expedition they recognized the richness of the new discoveries and after some negotiation offered the three friends ten thousand dollars for their claims one consideration decided them to accept it was absolutely necessary for them to go to the city for clothing and other articles of which they stood in imperative need they closed the bargain and started on their return chapter xxix bad news from home arriving in the city late in the afternoon tom went at once to see john miles when the latter caught sight of tom in his ragged attire he came to the natural conclusion that our hero had met with hard luck why tom where did you spring from he exclaimed grasping the hand of his young partner i am just in from the mines i suppose you are in want of money said miles his voice betraying sympathy tom laughed how do you like my appearance john he asked never mind that tom i see you have had a rough time but i have been earning money for you did you send money regularly to father yes i have sent him three hundred dollars in all thats good said tom in a tone of satisfaction that has made him easy i suppose that took up about all i was entitled to no i have as much more to your credit i am ready to pay it to you at once i see john you think i have not been doing well you dont look very prosperous tom i must acknowledge well john appearances are deceitful i have been wonderfully lucky i am delighted to hear it tom said miles cordially how much is it now what do you say to a thousand dollars excellent two thousand you dont mean it i wont keep you in suspense john i dont know exactly how much ive got but its over six thousand dollars john miles stared at our hero in undisguised astonishment are you sure youre quite right here he said touching his forehead you havent been sunstruck have you no john its all as i tell you let me explain how my luck came in a few sentences tom made it clear to his partner that his luck was real as to the three hundred dollars due me from you john concluded tom i make you a present of it but tom protested miles let it be so and for the future you shall pay me my share have you any letters for me i have three give them to me quick i am hungry for news from home tom sat down on a keg and fairly devoured the letters two of which were from his father one of these gave him much to think of i will transcribe the passages which gave tom most concern yesterday i paid squire hudson his regular semiannual interest amounting to sixtysix dollars thanks to your liberal remittances i had no difficulty in making the payment indeed i had two hundred dollars left over imagine my dismay when the squire told me he had made up his mind to call in the mortgage having another use for the money but i cant pay it up said i you ought to be able to obtain the money somewhere he returned you are the only capitalist with whom i am acquainted said i since i have paid you the interest promptly what more can you desire he insisted that he needed the money i offered to pay him the two hundred dollars which he had advanced for your journey he seemed surprised but repeated that he must have the whole the upshot of it was that he gave me a formal notice of three months as stipulated in the mortgage at the end of that time unless i am ready to pay the twentytwo hundred dollars he will foreclose and the old farm must be sold of course it will be sold much below its real value probably the squire will get it for the amount of the mortgage and we shall be thrown upon the world without a home it seems hard tom and very selfish but might makes right and squire hudson has the power on his side in a postscript mark nelson added i understand that squire hudson has a connection his wifes brother for whom he wants the farm that explains his resolute refusal to give me time to redeem it of course it is too early to decide upon any plans i must hire some tenement to move into when i have to leave here it will be hard upon us all to give up the old farm walter who has a taste for farming and whom i look to be my successor feels very sad dont let this news depress you too much tom we shall not suffer thanks to you i have some money ahead and we shall not lack for comfort tom looked up when he had finished reading the letter john he said quickly when does the next steamer start for new york day after tomorrow where can i engage passage are you going home yes john it is absolutely necessary squire hudson is about to foreclose the mortgage on my fathers farm i must be there to stop it have you money enough three times over he shall be defeated in his wicked purpose or my name isnt tom nelson tom spoke in a quick indignant tone and his voice had a manly ring wait john let me read you the letter the mans a mean rascal said miles a rich man who will take advantage of a poor mans necessity to deprive him of his home deserves to be horsewhipped i shant attempt that said tom smiling but i will disappoint him he little thinks i have it in my power to defeat his plans that very evening tom engaged passage to new york and two days later he sailed out of the golden gate i dont know how long i shall be gone john he said you need send me no remittances for i have money enough with me you will hear from me as soon as i have reached home and transacted my business with squire hudson you will come out here again tom wont you yes and before long i have been so busily occupied making money that i have seen almost nothing of san francisco tom did not journey alone ferguson having thriven beyond his expectations decided to sail to new york and thence to scotland on a visit to his relatives though he thought it probable he should come back within a year dick russell also was now in a position to study law at home and gave up the business of goldmining forever i owe all my present prosperity to you two he said but for you i should have blown my brains out five months since we owe our prosperity to you also said tom you guided us to the mines from which we gathered a golden harvest we have worked together and been mutual helpers said ferguson god has favored us all and to him be the thanks chapter xxx the night before the auction it was a sad household that of mark nelson on the day preceding the departure from the farm there was to be an auction the next day at which the farmstock and farmimplements were to be sold it was well understood that squire hudson was to be the buyer of the farm and as he was not likely to have any competitor there was little hope that it would fetch more than the amount of the mortgage during the afternoon mr nelson called on squire hudson to make the best terms he could at private sale the farm is worth at least a thousand dollars more than the mortgage squire hudson said the farmer it is worth what it will fetch mr nelson said the squire do you mean that an article always commands its full value at auction squire hudson ahem it brings its market value mr nelson which may be far below its intrinsic value suppose a diamond worth ten thousand dollars were put up at auction in our village do you consider that it would bring a fair price ahem you are wandering from the subject we are talking of farms not diamonds as to the farm then you are likely to be the only bidder unless you allow the mortgage to remain if i were inclined to do that i would not disturb you as long as you paid the interest promptly then you decline to buy the farm at private sale i do i dont think you will be any better off in the end squire hudson for oppressing a poor man and robbing him of his little all said mark nelson bitterly you dont look at the matter from a business point of view said the squire coldly i am acting as any business man would under the circumstances i cannot believe you sir all business men are not so hardhearted i really dont think there is any use in prolonging this interview said squire hudson stiffly i have resolved upon my course in which i am perfectly justified however you may choose to regard it this removed the farmers last hope and he had only to look about for another home for his family there was small choice of houses in the little farming town in fact there was but one house a shabby dilapidated building a mile from the church and store this mr nelson having no choice engaged for a period of three months it makes me homesick to think of going to live in that barn said sarah as they were sitting together after supper it may not be so bad as you think for sarah said her mother but she secretly sympathized with her daughter i wish squire hudson had to live there himself said walter in an angry outburst usually walter was checked by his father when uttering such speeches but tonight mark nelson took no notice of his sons angry remark he felt that it would only be a righteous retribution upon the squire for his cold selfishness while they were sitting in the plain room endeared to them by the association of years a sound of wheels was heard and the village stage stopped before the door who can it be said sarah wonderingly the whole family hurried to the window what youthful yet manly figure was that actively descending from his perch beside the driver its tom exclaimed mrs nelson heaven be praised it is my dear boy tom was almost suffocated by the embraces which he received on entering the house how you have grown tom said sarah and how well you look thank you for the compliment said tom laughing but i dont feel well what is the matter asked his mother with maternal solicitude i am as hungry as a bear have you got anything to eat in the house this hint was enough fresh tea was made and the wanderer was soon sitting before a bountiful supply of food cooked in his mothers best style it seems good to be at home said tom looking around him his face beaming with happiness did you get my letter tom announcing the squires intention to foreclose the mortgage asked his father gravely yes father is it really true yes he will listen to no persuasions when does the sale take place tomorrow i shall be present have you thought of any other house father the old belcher house is the only one i can hire that is a poor place it must do for lack of a better i didnt think the squire would act so meanly at any rate father i will see that you dont any of you suffer for lack of money have you been doing well tom asked walter ask me tomorrow walter tonight i want to hear all the news and everything that has happened since i went away chapter xxxi bidding for the farm i apprehend said the squire to his brotherinlaw the next morning that we shall get the farm at our own price i hope we shall squire said the poor relative deferentially i suppose this man nelson is sorry to part with it of course he charges me with meanness oppressing the poor and so on but of course i dont mind that its a matter of business as i told him to be sure i am not to be moved by sentimental considerations business is business but he wont see it in that light you consider the farm worth considerable more than the amount of the mortgage of course it is worth four thousand dollars in my opinion said the squire complacently if you get it for twentytwo hundred it will be an excellent bargain father exclaimed sinclair entering the breakfastroom rather hurriedly tom nelson has got home where did you hear this my son asked squire hudson in surprise at the store he got home by coach last evening got discontented i suppose said the squire in a tone of triumph i thought that was how it would turn out he cant expect me to advance money to take him out there again i wish you would let me go said sinclair some day i may take a trip out there with you my son have you seen thomas no he keeps mighty close he hasnt even been round at the store he is ashamed to show himself i suppose he will have to work on the farm on a farm again i suppose that will be a hard pill for him to swallow said sinclair no doubt he is poor and proud like his father before him i am glad of one thing that i am sure of getting back the two hundred dollars i advanced for his journey i wonder where he raised money to get back though there were not likely to be any competitors for the farm a considerable number gathered at the sale there was a general feeling of sympathy for the nelsons but no one was able to express that sympathy in a tangible form squire hudson cared little for the opinion of his neighbors some of them were in debt to him and he looked down upon them with the arrogance of wealth tom received many friendly greetings he was plainly dressed quiet in his manner and seemed to take matters very coolly at length the farm was put up the auctioneer naturally turning towards the squire who responded pompously i bid twentytwo hundred dollars the amount of the mortgage i hold upon the property is there any other bid asked the auctioneer i bid twentyfive hundred dollars said a clear boyish voice all were startled and all eyes were turned upon tom nelson who came slightly forward twentyfive hundred repeated the auctioneer hesitating whether he should receive the bid i protest against this outrage exclaimed squire hudson angrily the bid is ridiculous why is my bid ridiculous squire hudson asked tom calmly because you havent got the money it is a transparent attempt to run up the price of the farm you know nothing of my circumstances squire hudson said tom independently i stand ready to pay the sum i bid and should you outbid me i am ready to prove to any committee you may appoint that i possess the money or all my bids shall go for nothing and you can have the farm at your first offer that is fair cried all this is all nonsense said the squire those of you who choose may believe this boy i dont going at twentyfive hundred said the auctioneer twentyfive hundred and fifty said the squire adding i make the bid on the terms proposed by the boy twentyeight hundred said tom and fifty bid the squire three thousand instantly came from tom no one was more surprised than toms own family at this unexpected scene he had not dropped a hint as to his intentions choosing to take all by surprise mark nelson was perplexed though he had great confidence in tom he feared that he could not make good his bold bids at length the farm was knocked down to our hero at three thousand five hundred dollars now said the squire angrily i demand that this farce come to an end i believe the bidding of this boy to be a premeditated swindle if so i will do my best to have him punished and i said tom boldly have an equal right to demand that squire hudson submit proof that he is responsible for the amount of his offers curse your impudence exclaimed the squire foaming with rage but i waive that right continued tom and will ask squire hudson to name two gentlemen present to examine the proofs which i have to offer of my ability to back my bids i name mr jones and mr howe said the squire quickly and request them to act at once that is my desire said tom in five minutes the committee reported that tom had shown them bankbooks of two boston banks certifying that he held two thousand dollars on deposit in one and four thousand in the other is that satisfactory asked tom coolly no shouted the squire i believe that the books are bogus but the rest of those present entertained no doubts and our hero was at once surrounded by admiring friends who shook his hand till it fairly ached squire hudson your mortgage shall be paid whenever you desire said tom three cheers for tom nelson proposed some one and the cheers were given with a will during the confusion the squire and his brotherinlaw slipped out of the house thoroughly discomfited chapter xxxii manhood if squire hudson was surprised at toms suddenly revealed wealth mr nelson was no less so when tom first commenced bidding his father feared that he was only trying to annoy the squire or perhaps seeking to force him to pay a higher price for the farm but when investigation revealed the fact of toms riches and he saw the mountain of debt lifted from his little property he was overjoyed and grateful i cant understand it tom he said how could you possibly get possession of so much money i have worked hard father but that wont explain it i have been very lucky and my good luck has enabled me to save the farm i think you will be easier with me than the squire tom said his father smiling i will make out a mortgage to you since your money has been used to redeem the farm i shall have no claim on the farm said tom or if i have i give it to you i have money enough for myself and hope to earn a good deal more besides if that is the case tom i will gladly accept your gift it will be a great relief to think that i have no interest to pay now i shall be able to get along easily i have over two hundred dollars on hand i want to make your life easier hereafter father i think you need a larger income than the farm will yield you and i will therefore send you a hundred dollars every quarter you are very generous tom but i fear you will soon get rid of all your money at this rate i will explain my circumstances father and then you will think differently i have a business in san francisco which will yield me at least a thousand dollars a year without my personal attention and after paying the squire what is due him i shall have about four thousand dollars left this i mean to invest securely in boston i can hardly realize that you are so rich tom i can scarcely realize it myself father when i think of the change that fifteen months have made in my circumstances i consider myself the luckiest boy in the world and have great cause for gratitude it will be understood that though tom had bid thirtyfive hundred dollars for the farm all he was required to pay was the amount of the mortgage the bid having been made in his fathers interest in a few days the business was completed and mr nelson found himself the owner of an unencumbered property tom remained a week longer in the village and then started once more for california his mother urged him to remain at home now that he had so much money but tom reminded her that he was partner in a business in san francisco and that he needed to look after his interests there john miles might be sick or die and in that case he might meet with serious losses returning to san francisco tom became an active instead of a silent partner the business was considerably enlarged and became much more profitable at the end of two years tom sold out to his partner for several thousand dollars and entering an office studied law devoting a portion of his time to general study at a comparatively early age he was admitted to the bar of his adopted city and by degrees got into lucrative practice he had become so much attached to california that he decided to make it his permanent home up among the new hampshire hills his father still tills his little farm but he no longer depends upon it for his entire living tom regularly sends the allowance he promised and in addition his brothers are often the recipients of handsome gifts harry developing a taste for study was sent to exeter academy from which in due course he was transferred to harvard he too was destined for the law and when he had taken his legal degree joined tom in california and is now his partner other changes there are in the little village squire hudson is dead and sinclair making haste to sell the homestead removed to new york engaged in speculation and lost everything one day shabbily dressed he entered toms office in san francisco and asked for the loan of fifty dollars to enable him to reach the mines tom gave it for old acquaintance sake it was not the last request for money made by sinclair nothing has been heard of him for some years and it is probable that a life which was of no service to any one is finished he had the best start in life but misused his advantages tom has worthily employed the talents committed to his charge and is happy honored and prosperous the young explorer or among the sierras will be the next volume
