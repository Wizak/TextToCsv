the land of promise chapter i nora opened her eyes to an unaccustomed consciousness of wellbeing she was dimly aware that it had its origin in something deeper than mere physical comfort but for the moment in that state between sleeping and wakening which still held her it was enough to find that body and mind seemed rested youth was reasserting itself and it was only a short time ago that she had felt that never never could she by any possible chance feel young again when one is young one resents the reaction after any strain not purely physical as if it were a premature symptom of old age a ray of brilliant sunshine which found its way through a gap in the drawn curtains showed that it was long past the usual hour for rising she smiled whimsically and closed her eyes once more she remembered now that she was not in her own little room in the other wing of the house the curtains proved that how often in the ten years she had been with miss wickham had she begged that the staring white window blind which decorated her one window be replaced by curtains or even a blind of a dark tone that she might not be awakened by the first ray of light she had even ventured to propose that the cost of such alterations be stopped out of her salary miss wickham had refused to countenance any such innovation three years before when the offending blind had refused to hold together any longer nora had had a renewal of hope but no the new blind had been more glaringly white than its predecessor which by contrast had taken on a grateful ivory tone in its old age they had had one of their rare scenes at its advent nora had as a rule an admirable control of her naturally quick temper but this had been too much i might begin to understand your refusal if you ever entered my room but since it would no more occur to you to do so than to visit the stables i cannot see what possible difference it can make nora had stormed miss wickhams smile which at the beginning of her companions outburst had been faintly ironic had broadened into the frankly humorous stated with your characteristic regard for exactitude my dear miss marsh it would never enter my head to do either i prefer the white blind however as you know i have no taste for explanations we will let the matter rest there if you please then she had added some day i strongly suspect some man will amuse himself breaking that fiery temper of yours i wish i were not so old i think that i should enjoy knowing that he had succeeded and the incident had ended as always with a few angry tears on noras part as a preliminary to the inevitable game of bezique which finished off each happy day and this had been her life for ten years a wave of pity not for herself but for that young girl of eighteen who had once been herself that proudly confident young creature who when suddenly deprived of the protection of her only parent noras father had died when she was too young to remember him had so bravely faced the world serene in the consciousness that the happiness which was her right was sure to be hers after a little waiting dimmed her eyes for a moment the dreams she had dreamed after she had received miss wickhams letter offering her the post of companion she recalled how she had smiled to herself when the agent with whom she had filed her application congratulated her warmly on her good fortune in placing herself so promptly and by way of benediction had wished that she might hold the position for many years many years indeed that had been no part of her plan those nebulous plans had always been consistently rosecolored it was impossible to remember them all now sometimes the unknown miss wickham turned out to be a softhearted and sentimental old lady who was completely won by her young companions charm and unmistakable air of good breeding after a short time she either adopted her or on dying left her her entire fortune again she proved to be a perfect ogre in this variation it was always the prince charming that looms large in every young girls dreams who finally after a brief period of unhappiness came to the rescue and everything ended happily if somewhat conventionally the reality had been sadly different miss wickham had disclosed herself as being a hard selfcentered worldly woman who considered that in furnishing her young companion with board lodging and a salary of thirty pounds a year she had to use a commercial phrase obtained the option on her every waking hour and indeed during the last year of her life she had extended this option to cover many of the hours which should have been dedicated to rest and sleep all the fine plans that the young nora had made while journeying down from london to tunbridge wells for going on with her music improving herself in french and perhaps taking up another modern language in her leisure hours had been nipped in the bud before she had been an inmate of miss wickhams house many days she had no leisure hours miss wickham saw to that she had apparently an abhorrence for her own unrelieved society that amounted to a positive mania she must never be left alone let nora but escape to her own little room in the vain hope of obtaining a few moments to herself and kate the parlor maid was certain to be sent after her miss wickhams compliments and she was waiting to be read to miss wickhams compliments but did miss marsh know that the horses were at the door miss wickhams compliments and should she have kate set out the backgammon board and upon the rare occasions when there was company in the house miss wickhams ingenuity in providing occupation for dear miss marsh while she was herself occupied with her friends was inexhaustible in an evil hour nora had confessed to a modest talent for washing lace miss wickham it developed had a really fine collection of beautiful pieces which naturally required the most delicate handling their need for being washed was oddly coincident with the moment when the expected guest arrived at the door or it appeared that the slugs had attacked the rose trees in unusual numbers the gardener was in despair as he was already behind with setting out the annuals would miss marsh mind while miss wickham had her little afterluncheon nap miss marsh did mind she loved flowers to arrange them was a delight at least it had been once but she hated slugs but she was too young and too inexperienced to know how to combat the subtle encroachments upon her own time made by this selfish old woman and so gradually she had found that she was not only companion but a sort of superior ladys maid and assistant gardener as well and all for thirty pounds a year and her keep and alas prince charming had never appeared unless nora laughed aloud at the thought he had disguised himself with a cleverness defying detection with reginald hornby a callow youth the son of miss wickhams dearest friend who occasionally made the briefest of duty visits mr wynne the family solicitor an elderly bachelor and the doctors assistant a young person by the name of gard noras list of eligible men was complete there had been a time when nora had flirted with the idea of escaping from bondage by becoming the wife of young gard he was a rather common young man but he had been sincerely in love with her he was not sufficiently subtle to recognize that it was the idea of escaping from miss wickham and the deadly monotony of her days that tempted her he had laid his case before miss wickham there had been some terrible scenes nora had felt the lash of her employers bitter tongue partly because she was still smarting from the attack and partly because she was indignant with her suitor for having gone to miss wickham at all and particularly without consulting her she too had turned on the unfortunate young man there had been mutual recriminations and reproaches and young gard after his brief and bitter experience with the gentry had left the vicinity of tunbridge wells and later on married a girl of his own class but miss wickham had been more shaken at the prospect of losing her young companion who was so thoroughly broken in than she would have liked to have confessed she detested new faces about her and as a matter of fact she came as nearly caring for nora as it was possible for her to care for any human being she had told the girl then that it was her intention to make some provision for her at her death so that she might have a decent competence and not be obliged to look for another position there was of course the implied understanding that she would remain with miss wickham until that lady was summoned to a better and brighter world a step which miss wickham herself was in no immediate hurry to take in the meantime she knew perfectly well just how often a prospective legacy could be dangled before expectant eyes with perfect delicacy it furnished her with an additional weapon too against her nephew james wickham and his wife both of whom she cordially detested although she fully intended leaving them the bulk of her fortune the consideration and tenderness she showed toward nora when mr and mrs wickham ran down from london to see their dear aunt showed a latent talent for comedy on the part of the chief actress of no mean order these occasions left nora in a state of mind in which exasperation and amusement were about equally blended it was amusing to note the signs of apprehension on the part of miss wickhams disagreeable relatives as they noted their aunts doting fondness for her hired companion and while she felt that they richly deserved this little punishment it was humiliating to be so cynically made use of and now it was all over after a year of illness and gradual decline the end had come two days before nothing could induce miss wickham to have a professional nurse the long strain and weeks of broken rest had told even on noras strength kindly dr evans had insisted that she be put immediately to bed and kate the parlor maid who had always been devoted to her had undressed her as if she had been a baby for the last two days she had done little but sleep the dreamless sleep of utter exhaustion and today was the day of the funeral she was just about to ring to find the time when kates gentle knock came at the door come in good morning kate do tell me the time oh how good it is to be lazy once in a while good morning to you miss i hope youre feeling a bit rested its just gone eleven dr evans has called miss he told me to see if you had waked how good of him ask him to wait a few moments and ill come right down coming right down was not so easy a matter as she had thought nora found herself strangely weak and languid she was still sitting on the edge of her bed trying to gather energy for the task of dressing when kate returned i beg your pardon miss but dr evans says youre not to get up until he sees you im to bring you a bit of toast and your tea and to help you freshen up a bit and then he will come up in twenty minutes he says to tell you that he has plenty of time nora made a show of protest secretly she was rather glad to give in she had not reckoned with the weakness following two unaccustomed days in bed dr evans was a kindly elderly man whose one affectation was the gruffness which the country doctor of the old school so often assumes as if he wished to emphasize his disapproval of the modern suave manner of his city confrre he had a sardonic humor and a sharp tongue which had at first quite terrified nora until she discovered that they were meant to hide the most generous heart in the world many were the kindly acts he performed in secret for the very people he was most accustomed to abuse having felt noras pulse and looked at her sharply with his keen gray eyes he settled the question of her attendance at miss wickhams funeral with his accustomed finality youll do nothing of the sort he growled you may get up after a while and go and sit in the garden a bit the air is fairly springlike but this afternoon you must lie down again for an hour or two i suppose youll have to get up to do the civil for james wickham and his wife before they go back to town oh no theyll not stay the night theyll rush back as fast as the train will take them once theyve heard the will read couldnt bear the associations with the place now that their dear aunt has departed he gave one of his sardonic chuckles it may be nonsense this in reply to noras remonstrance but im not going to have you on my hands next youll go to that funeral and get hysterical like all women and begin to think that you wish her back i should think this last year would have been about all anyone would want but youre a poor sentimental creature after all he jeered im nothing of the sort but i did feel sorry for her badly as she often treated me she was a desperately lonely old soul nobody cared a bit about her really and she knew it in spite of all her little amiable tricks to make people love her said the doctor now remember the garden for an hour this morning the drawingroom later in the day after youve rested for an hour or so and dont dare disobey me with that he left it was pleasant in the garden the air though chilly held the promise of spring warmly wrapped in an old cape which the thoughtful kate had discovered somewhere with a book on paris and some italian sketches to fall back upon when her own thoughts ceased to divert her nora sat in a sheltered corner and looked out on the border which would soon be gay with the tulips whose green stocks were just beginning to push themselves up through the brown earth poor miss wickham she had been so proud of her garden always but for her it had bloomed for the last time would the james wickhams take as much pride in it somehow she fancied not and she where would she be a year from now a year where would she be in another month the whole world in a modest sense would he hers to choose from while she had no definite notion as to the amount of her legacy she had understood that it would bring in sufficient income to keep her from the necessity of seeking further employment probably something between two and three hundred pounds a year she had always longed to travel italy france germany spain she would see them all one could live very reasonably in really good pensions abroad she had been told and then some day after a few years of happy wandering she might adventure to that faroff canada where her only brother was living the life of a frontiersman on an incredibly huge farm she had not seen him for many years but her heart warmed at the thought of seeing her only relative again he was much older yes eddie must now be about forty oh all of that she herself was almost twentyeight but she wouldnt go to him for several years he had done one thing which seemed to her quite dreadful he had made an unfortunate marriage with a woman far beneath him socially men were so weak because they fancied themselves lonely or even captivated by a pretty face they were willing to make impossible marriages women were different still she had the grace to blush when she recalled the episode of the doctors assistant yes she would go out to eddie after his wife had had the chance to form herself a little more living with a husband so much superior was bound to have its influence and she must have some really good qualities at bottom or she could never have attracted him there was nothing vicious about her brother she must write him of miss wickhams death they were neither of them fond of writing it must be nearly a year since she had heard from him last and then it was so difficult to keep up a correspondence when people had no mutual friends and so little in common a glance at her watch told her that it must be nearly time for the london wickhams to arrive it would be better not to see them unless they sent for her until after they had returned from the cemetery they were just the sort of people to think that she was forgetting her position if she had the manner of playing hostess by receiving them thank goodness she would probably never see them again after today with a word to kate that she would presently have her luncheon in her room and then rest for a few hours until the people returned after the funeral she made her way to her own bare little room how cold and bare it was with the exception of the framed pictures of her father and mother and a small photograph of eddie taken before he had gone out there was nothing but the absolutely necessary furniture miss wickhams ideas of what a companions room should be like had partaken of the austere and all the rest of the house was so crowded and overloaded with things the drawingroom had always been an eyesore to nora crammed as it was with little tables and cabinets containing china and in every available space there were porcelain ornaments and photographs in huge silver frames it was all like a badly arranged museum or a huddled little curio shop well she would soon be done with that too armed with her portfolio and writing materials nora returned to the guest chamber which was her temporary abode the motherly kate was waiting with an appetizing lunch on a neat tray what a good friend she had been she would be genuinely sorry to part with kate she must ask her to give her some address that would always reach her who knew years hence when she returned to england but what she might afford to set up a modest flat with kate to manage things for her she would speak to her on the morrow after the will was read ah kate you knew just what would tempt me thank you so much by the way has miss pringle sent any message yes miss miss pringle stopped on her way to the village a moment ago she was with mrs hubbard and had only a moment i was to tell you that she would call this afternoon and hoped you could see her i told her miss that the doctor had said you were not to go to the burial she will come while they are away let me know the moment she comes i want to see her very much miss pringle was the only woman friend nora had made in the years of her sojourn at tunbridge wells they had little in common beyond the fellowfeeling that binds those in bondage miss pringle was also a companion her task mistress mrs hubbard was in noras opinion about as stolidly brainless as a woman could well be miss pringle was always lauding her kindness but then miss pringle had been a companion to various rich women for thirty years nora had her own ideas as to the value of the opinions of any woman who had been in slavery for thirty years having eaten her luncheon and written her letter to her brother she felt glad to rest once more how wise the doctor had been to forbid her to go to the funeral and how grateful she was that he had forbidden it was her last waking thought chapter ii it was well on to three oclock when miss pringle made her careful way up the path that led to the late miss wickhams door how strange it will be not to find her in her own drawingroom she reflected i dont recall that nora marsh and i have ever been alone together for two consecutive minutes in our lives i simply couldnt have stood it ill tell miss marsh youre here miss pringle said kate at the door how is she today kate still tired out poor thing the doctor made her promise to lie down directly after she had had a bite of luncheon but she said i was to let her know the moment you came miss im very glad she didnt go to the funeral dr evans simply wouldnt hear of it miss i wonder how she stood it all these months waiting on miss wickham hand and foot she should have been made to have a professional nurse it wasnt very easy to make miss wickham have anything she had made up her mind not to you know that miss said kate as she led the way to the drawingroom miss marsh slept in miss wickhams room towards the last and the moment she fell asleep miss wickham would have her up because her pillow wanted shaking or she was thirsty or something i suppose she was very inconsiderate miss pringle did not in general approve of discussing things with servants but nora had told her frequently how faithfully kate looked after her and as far as it was possible made things bearable so she felt she could make an exception of her inconsiderate isnt the word miss i wouldnt be a ladys companion kate paused her hand on the doorknob to make a sweeping gesture not for anything what they have to put up with everyone isnt like miss wickham said miss pringle a trifle sharply the lady im companion to mrs hubbard is kindness itself that sounds like miss marsh coming down the stairs now said kate opening the door miss pringle is here miss as kate closed the door behind her nora advanced to meet her friend from the doorway with her pretty smile and outstretched hand miss pringle kissed her warmly and then drew her down on a large sofa by her side her glance had a certain note of disapproval as it took in her friends black dress which did not escape that observant young person i was so glad to hear you were coming to me this afternoon it is good of you how did you escape the dragon she had long ago nicknamed the excellent mrs hubbard the dragon simply to tease miss pringle mrs hubbard has gone for a drive with somebody or other and didnt want me said miss pringle primly you havent been crying nora yes i couldnt help it my dear its not unnatural miss pringle dropped the hand she had been stroking to clasp both her own over the handle of her umbrella well i dont like to say anything against her now shes dead poor thing but miss wickham was the most detestable old woman i ever met still said nora slowly looking toward the french window which opened on the garden at the sun streaming through the drawn blinds i dont suppose one can live so long with anyone and not be a little sorry to part with them forever i was miss wickhams companion for ten years how you stood it exacting domineering disagreeable yes i suppose she was because she paid me a salary she thought i wasnt a human being i certainly never knew anyone with such a bitter tongue at first i used to cry every night when i went to bed because of the things she said to me but i got used to them i wonder you didnt leave her i would have miss pringle attempting to delude herself with the idea that she was a mettlesome highspirited person who would stand no nonsense was immensely diverting to nora to hide an irrepressible smile she went over to a bowl of roses which stood on one of the little tables and pretended to busy herself with their rearrangement posts as ladys companions are not so easy to find i fancy at least i remember that when i got this one i was thought to be extremely lucky not to have to wait twice as long i dont imagine things have bettered much in our line do you that they have not rejoined miss pringle gloomily they tell me the agents books are full of people wanting situations before i went to mrs hubbard i was out of one for nearly two years her voice shook a little at the recollection her poor tired weatherbeaten face quivered as if she were about to cry its not so had for you said nora soothingly you can always go and stay with your brother youve a brother too ah yes but hes farming in canada he has all he could do to keep himself he couldnt keep me too how is he doing now asked miss pringle to whom any new topic of conversation was of interest she had so little opportunity for conversation at the irreproachable mrs hubbards that lady having apparently inherited a limited set of ideas from her late husband as mr hubbard used to say being her favorite introduction to any topic miss pringle saw herself making quite a little success at dinner that night there was to be a guest she believed by saying a friend of mine has just been telling me of the success her brother is having way out in canada he is getting on she asked encouragingly oh hes doing very well hes got a farm of his own he wrote over a few years ago and told me he could always give me a home if i wanted one canadas so far off observed miss pringle deprecatingly her tone seemed to imply that there were other disadvantages which she would refrain from mentioning now while nora had always had the same vague feeling that canada in addition to being an immense distance off was not quite well it wasnt england that was indisputable she found herself unreasonably irritated by her friends tone not when yon get there she replied sharply miss pringle evidently deemed it best to change the subject why dont you draw the blinds she asked after a moment it is horrid isnt it but somehow i thought i ought to wait till they came back from the funeral but just see the sunlight it must be beautiful out of doors why dont we walk about in the garden do you care for a wrap ill send kate to fetch you something if you do miss pringle having decided that her coat was sufficiently warm if they did not sit anywhere too long and just walked in the paths where it was sure not to be damp they went out of the gloomy drawingroom into the bright afternoon sunshine dont you love a garden when things are just beginning to show their heads i sometimes think that spring is the most beautiful of all the seasons its like watching the birth of a new world i think the most human thing about poor miss wickham was her fondness for flowers she always said she hoped shed never die in winter to miss pringle the note of regret which crept now and again into noras voice when she spoke of her late employer was a continual source of bewilderment here was a woman who she knew had a quick temper and a passionate nature speaking as if she actually sorrowed for the tyrant who had so frequently made her life unbearable she was sure that she couldnt have felt more grieved if providence had seen fit to remove the excellent mrs hubbard from the scene of her earthly activities poor miss pringle she did not realize that after thirty years of a life passed as a hired companion that she no longer possessed either sensibility or the power of affection to her one employer would be very like another so long as they were fairly considerate and not too unreasonable it would be tiresome to be sure to have to learn the little likes and dislikes of mrs hubbards successor but what would you life was filled with tiresome moments poor miss pringle her next remark was partly to make conversation and partly because she might obtain further light upon this perplexing subject she made a mental note that she must not forget to speak to mrs hubbard of noras grief over miss wickhams death naturally she would be gratified well it must be a great relief to you now its all over she said sometimes i cant realize it said nora simply these last few weeks i hardly got to bed at all and when the end came i was utterly exhausted for two days i have done nothing but sleep poor miss wickham she did hate dying miss pringle had a sort of triumph she had proved her point even mrs hubbard could not doubt it now thats the extraordinary part of it i believe you were really fond of her do you know that for nearly a year she would eat nothing but what i gave her with my own hands and she liked me as much as she was capable of liking anybody that wasnt much miss pringle permitted herself and then i was so dreadfully sorry for her good heavens shed been a hard and selfish woman all her life and there was no one who cared for her nora went on passionately it seemed so dreadful to die like that and leave not a soul to regret one her nephew and his wife were just waiting for her death it was dreadful each time they came down from london i could see them looking at her to see if she was any worse than when last theyd seen her well said miss pringle with a sort of splendid defiance i thought her a horrid old woman and im glad shes dead and i only hope shes left you well provided for oh i think shes done that nora smiled happily into her friends face yes i can be quite sure of that i fancy two years ago when i when i nearly went away she said shed left me enough to live on they walked on for a moment or two in silence until they had reached the end of the path where there was a little arbor in which miss wickham had been in the habit of having her tea afternoons when the weather permitted do you think we would run any risk if we sat down here a few moments suppose we try it we can walk again if you feel in the least chilled i think the view so lovely from here besides i can see the carriage the moment it enters the gate miss pringle sat down with the air of a person who was hardly conscious of what she was doing you say she told you she had left you something when you nearly went away she went on in the hesitating manner of one who has been interrupted while reading aloud and is not quite sure that she has resumed at the right place you mean when that assistant of dr evans wanted to marry you im glad you wouldnt have him he was very kind and and nice said nora gently but of course he wasnt a gentleman i shouldnt like to live with a man at all retorted miss pringle with unshakable conviction i think theyre horrid but of course it would be utterly impossible if he werent a gentleman noras eyes twinkled with amusement she gave a little gurgle of laughter he came to see miss wickham but she wouldnt have anything to do with him first she said she couldnt spare me and then she said that i had a very bad temper i like her saying that retorted her listener its quite true said nora with a deprecating wave of her hand every now and then i felt i couldnt put up with her any more i forgot that i was dependent on her and that if she dismissed me i probably shouldnt be able to find another situation and i just flew at her i must say she was very nice about it she used to look at me and grin and when it was all over say my dear when you marry if your husbands a wise man hell use a big stick now and then old cat i should like to see any man try it said nora with emphasis miss pringle dismissed the supposition with a wave of her hand how much do you think shes left you she asked eagerly well of course i dont know the will is going to be read this afternoon when they come back from the funeral but from what she said i believe about two hundred and fifty pounds a year its the least she could do shes had the ten best years of your life nora gave a long happy sigh just think of it never to be at anybodys beck and call again i shall be able to get up when i like and go to bed when i like go out when i choose and come in when i choose think of what that means unless you marry you probably will said miss pringle in a discouraging tone never what do you purpose doing i shall go to italy florence rome oh everywhere ive so longed to go do you think its horrible of me im so happy my dear child said miss pringle with real feeling at that moment the sound of carriage wheels came to them turning quickly nora saw the carriage containing mr and mrs wickham coming up the drive there they are now how the time has gone id better go hadnt i said miss pringle with manifest reluctance im afraid you must im sorry couldnt i go up to your room and wait there i do so want to know about the will nora hesitated a moment she didnt want to take miss pringle up to her bare little room a sort of loyalty to the woman who was after all to be her benefactress for was she not after all with her legacy going to make the happy future pay rich interest for the unhappy past made her reluctant to let anyone know how poorly she had been lodged no she said ill tell you what stay here in the garden they want to catch the foursomething back to london and later we can have a cozy little tea all by ourselves very well oh my dear said miss pringle with emotion im so sincerely happy in your good luck nora was genuinely moved she leaned over and kissed miss pringle her eyes filling with quick tears then she went into the house the wickhams were already in the drawingroom mrs james wickham was a pretty young woman a good ten years younger than her unattractive husband of the two nora preferred mr wickham there was a certain cynicism about her insincerity which his somehow lacked even now they wore their rue with a difference mrs wickhams mourning was as correct and elegant as a fashionable dressmaker could make it the very latest thing in grief mr wickham was far less sumptuous beyond the customary band on his hat and a pair of black gloves conspicuously new he had apparently made little expenditure on his costume as nora entered mrs wickham was pulling off her gloves how do yon do she said carelessly ouf do put the blinds up miss marsh really we neednt be depressed any more jim if you love me take those gloves off theyre perfectly revolting why whats wrong with them the fellow in the shop told me they were the right thing no doubt i never saw anyone look quite so funereal as you do well retorted her husband you didnt want me to get myself up as if i were going to a wedding did you were there many people said nora hastily the insolence of mrs wickhams glance was scarcely veiled oh quite a lot she drawled the sort of people who indulge in other peoples funerals as a mild form of dissipation i hope wynne will look sharp said her husband hastily looking at his watch i dont want to miss that train who were all those stodgy old things who wrung your hand afterwards jim asked his wife she was moving slowly about the room picking up the various little objects scattered about and examining the contents of one of the cabinets with the air of an appraiser i cant think they did make me feel such a fool oh was that it laughed his wife i saw you looking a perfect owl and i thought you were giving a very bad imitation of restrained emotion dorothy in a tone of remonstrance would you care for some tea mrs wickham nora broke in to her the whole scene was positively indecent she longed to make her escape but felt that it would be considered part of her duty to remain as long as the wickhams stayed as she was about to ring the bell mrs wickham stopped her with a gesture well you might send some in so that itll be ready when mr wynne comes well ring for you shall we she added i dare say youve got one or two things you want to do now very good mrs wickham nora could feel her cheeks burn as she left the room but she was thankful to escape outside the door she hesitated for a moment there was no good in rejoining miss pringle as yet she had no news for her she hoped mr wynne would not be delayed much longer the wickhams could not possibly be more anxious to get back to london than she was to have them go how gratuitously insolent that woman was thank heaven she need never see her again after today of course she was furious because she suspected that the despised companion was to be a beneficiary under the will how could anyone be so mean as to begrudge her her wellearned share in so large a fortune well the coming hour would tell the tale on the table in her room was the letter to her brother which she had forgotten to send to the post slipping down the stairs again she went in search of kate to see if it were too late to send it to the village now that it was written she had almost a superstitions feeling that it was important that it should catch the first foreign mail as she passed the door of the drawingroom she could hear james wickhams voice raised above its normal pitch were they already quarreling over the spoils chapter iii noras surmise had been very nearly correct the wickhams were quarreling but not as yet over the spoils james wickham had waited until the door had closed behind his aunts companion to rebuke his wifes untimely frivolity i say dorothy you oughtnt to be facetious before miss marsh she was extremely attached to aunt louisa oh what nonsense jeered mrs wickham throwing herself pettishly into a chair i find its always a very good rule to judge people by oneself and im positive she was just longing for the old lady to die she was awfully upset at the end you know that yourself nerves men are so idiotic they never understand that there are tears and tears i cried myself and heaven knows i didnt regret her death my dear dorothy you oughtnt to say that why not retorted his wife its perfectly true aunt louisa was a detestable person and no one would have stood her for a minute if she hadnt had money i cant see the use of being a hypocrite now that it cant make any difference either way oh why doesnt that man hurry up she resumed once more her impatient walk about the room i wish wynne would come said her husband glad to change the subject particularly as he felt that he had failed to be very impressive itll be beastly inconvenient if we miss that train he finished glancing again at his watch and another thing said mrs wickham turning sharply as she reached the end of the room i dont trust that miss marsh she looks as if she knew what was in the will i dont for a moment suppose she does aunt louisa wasnt the sort of person to talk nevertheless im sure she knows shes been left something oh well i think she has the right to expect that aunt louisa led her a dogs life mrs wickham made an angry gesture she had her wages and a comfortable home if she didnt like the place she could have left it she said pettishly after all she went on in a quieter tone its family money in my opinion aunt louisa had no right to leave it to strangers i dont think we ought to complain if miss marsh gets a small annuity said her husband soothingly i understand aunt louisa promised her something of the sort when she had a chance of marrying a couple of years ago miss marsh is still quite young it isnt as if she had been here for thirty years protested mrs wickham well anyway ive got an idea that aunt louisa meant to leave her about two hundred and fifty a year two hundred and fif but whats the estate amount to have you any idea about nineteen thousand pounds i believe mrs wickham who had seated herself once more struck her hands violently together oh its absurd its a most unfair proposition it will make all the difference to us on that extra two hundred and fifty a year we could keep a car my dear be thankful if we get anything at all said her husband solemnly for a moment she stared at him aghast jim jim you dont think oh that would be too horrible hush take care he crossed to the window as the door opened and kate came in softly with the tea things how lucky it is that we had a fine day he said endeavoring to give the impression that they had been talking with becoming sobriety of light topics he hoped his wifes raised voice had not been heard in the passageway but mrs wickham was beyond caring her toneless yes in response to his original observation betrayed her utter lack of interest in the subject but as kate was still busy setting out the things on a small table he continued his efforts really dorothy should play up more it looks as if we were going to have a spell of fine weather yes its funny how often it rains for weddings very funny the tea is ready sir as kate left the room mrs wickham crossed slowly over to where her husband was standing in front of the window leading to the garden her voice shook with emotion it was evident that she was very near tears he put his arm around her awkwardly but with a certain suggestion of protective tenderness ive been counting on that money for years she said hardly above a whisper i used to dream at night that i was reading a telegram with the news of aunt louisas death and ive thought of all we should be able to do when we get it itll make such a difference you know what she was she didnt care twopence for us we ought to be prepared for the worst he said soberly do you think she could have left everything to miss marsh i shouldnt be greatly surprised well dispute the will she said once more raising her voice its undue influence i suspected miss marsh from the beginning i hate her oh how i hate her oh why doesnt wynne come a ring at the bell answered her here he is i expect the suspense is too awful pull yourself together old girl said wickham patting his wife encouragingly on the shoulder and i say look a bit dismal after all weve just come from a funeral mrs wickham gave a sort of suppressed wail oh im downhearted enough heaven knows mr wynne sir said kate from the doorway mr wynne the late miss wickhams solicitor was a jovial hearty man tallish bald and ruddylooking in his spare time he played at being a country gentleman he had a fine straightforward eye and a direct manner that inspired one with confidence he was dressed in complimentary mourning but for the moment his natural hearty manner threatened to get the better of him helloa he said holding out his hand to wickham but the sight of mrs wickham seated on the sofa dejectedly enough recalled to him that he should be more subdued in the presence of such genuine grief he crossed the room to take dorothys hand solemnly i didnt have an opportunity of shaking hands with you at the cemetery how do you do she said rather absently pray accept my sincerest sympathy on your great bereavement mrs wickham made an effort to bring her mind back from the allabsorbing fear that possessed her of course the end was not entirely unexpected no i know but it must have been a great shock all the same he was going on to say what a wonderful old lady his late client had been in that her faculties seemed perfectly unimpaired until the very last when wickham interrupted him not only was he most anxious to hear the will read himself and have it over but he saw signs in his wifes face and in the nervous manner in which she rolled and unrolled her handkerchief that she was nearing the end of her selfcontrol never very great my wife was very much upset but of course my poor aunt had suffered great pain and we couldnt help looking upon it as a happy release naturally responded the solicitor sympathetically and how is miss marsh he was looking at james wickham as he spoke so that he missed the sudden i told you so glance which mrs wickham flashed at her husband oh shes very well she managed to say with a careless air im glad to learn that she is not completely prostrated said mr wynne warmly her devotion to miss wickham was perfectly wonderful dr evans hes my brotherinlaw you know told me no trained nurse could have been more competent she was like a daughter to miss wickham i suppose wed better send for her said mrs wickham coldly have you brought the wickham stopped in embarrassment yes i have it in my pocket said the solicitor quickly he had noted before now how awkward people always were about speaking of wills there was nothing indelicate about doing so heavens all rightminded persons made their wills and they meant to have them read after they were dead everybody knew that and yet they always acted as if it were indecent to approach the subject he had no patience with such nonsense with an eloquent look at her husband mrs wickham slowly crossed the room to the bell ill ring for miss marsh she said in a hard voice i expect mr wynne would like a cup of tea dorothy she frowned at her husband behind the solicitors broad back more delays could she bear it oh im so sorry i quite forgot about it no thank you very much i never take tea protested that gentleman he took from his pocket a long blue envelope and slowly drew from it the will which he smoothed out with a deliberation which was maddening to mrs wickham she could hardly tear her fascinated eyes away from it long enough to tell the waiting kate to ask miss marsh to be good enough to come to them whats the time jim she asked nervously oh theres no hurry he said looking at his watch without seeing it then turning to wynne he added weve got an important engagement this evening in london and were very anxious not to miss the fast train the train service down here is rotten said mrs wickham harshly thats all right the will is very short it wont take me two minutes to read it mr wynne reassured them what on earth is miss marsh doing said mrs wickham half to herself an endless minute passed how pretty the garden is looking now said the solicitor cheerfully gazing out through the window very wickham managed to say miss wickham was always so interested in her garden yes my own tulips arent so advanced as those arent they wickhams tone suggested irritation mr wynne addressed his next observation to mrs wickham are you interested in gardening no i hate it at last the exclamation was called forth by the appearance of nora in the doorway the two men both rose wynne to go forward and shake noras hand with unaffected cordiality wickham to whisper in his wifes ear beseeching her to exercise more selfcontrol how do you do miss marsh im rejoiced to see you looking so fit oh im very well thank you how do you do will you have a cup of tea asked wickham in response to what he thought was a signal from his wife but mrs wickham had reached the point where further waiting was simply impossible jim she remonstrated miss marsh would much prefer to have tea quietly after were gone nora understood and for the moment found it in her heart to be sorry for the woman much as she disliked her i wont have any tea thank you she said simply mr wynne has brought the will with him explained mrs wickham her tone was almost appealing as if she begged nora if she knew of its contents to say so without further delay oh yes nothing should induce her to show such agitation as this woman did she managed to assume an air of polite interest and find a chair for herself quite calmly and yet she was conscious that her heart was beating wildly beneath her bodice but she would not betray herself she would not and yet her stake was as great as any her whole future hung on the contents of that paper mr wynne was caressing with his long fingers miss marsh questioned mr wynne as soon as she was seated so far as you know there is no other will how do you mean miss wickham didnt make a later one without my assistance i mean you know of nothing in the house for instance oh no said nora positively miss wickham always said you had her will she was extremely methodical i feel i ought to ask you the solicitor went on with unwonted gentleness because miss wickham consulted me a couple of years ago about making a new will she told me what she wanted to do but gave me no actual instructions to draw it i thought perhaps she might have done it herself i heard nothing about it i am sure that her only will is in your hands then i think that we may take it that this mrs wickhams set face relaxed the light of triumph was in her eyes she understood when was that will made she asked eagerly eight or nine years ago the exact date was march th the date settled it nora too realized that she was left penniless what a refinement of cruelty to deceive but she must not think of that now she would have all the rest of her life in which to think of it but here before that woman whose searching glance was even now fastened on her face to see how she was taking the blow she would give no sign when did you first come to miss wickham mrs wickhams voice was almost a caress at the end of nineteen hundred and three there was no trace of emotion in that clear voice after a moment mr wynne spoke again shall i read it or would you just like to know the particulars it is very short oh let us know just roughly mrs wickham was still eager well miss wickham left one hundred pounds to the society for the propagation of the gospel and one hundred pounds to the general hospital at tunbridge wells and the entire residue of her fortune to her nephew mr james wickham mrs wickham drew her breath sharply once more she looked at her late aunts companion but nothing was to be read in that calm face she was a designing minx none the less but she did yield her a grudging admiration for her selfcontrol in the shipwreck of all her hopes now they could have their car oh what couldnt they have she felt she had earned every penny of it in that last dreadful half hour and miss marsh she heard her husband ask miss marsh is not mentioned somehow nora managed a smile i could hardly expect to be at the time that will was drawn i had been miss wickhams companion for only a few months that is why i asked whether you knew of any later will said mr wynne almost sadly when i talked to miss wickham on the subject she said her wish was to make adequate provision for you after her death i think she had spoken to you about it yes she had she mentioned three hundred a year that was very kind of her noras voice broke a little im glad she wished to do something for me oddly enough continued the solicitor she spoke about it to dr evans only a few days before she died perhaps there is a later will somewhere said wickham i honestly dont think so oh im sure there isnt affirmed nora dr evans was talking to miss wickham about miss marsh she was completely tired out and he wanted miss wickham to have a professional nurse she told him then that i had the will and that she had left miss marsh amply provided for that isnt legal of course said mrs wickham decidedly what isnt i mean no one could force us i mean the will stands as it is doesnt it certainly it does im afraid its a great disappointment to you miss marsh wickham said not unkindly i never count my chickens before theyre hatched this time nora smiled easily and naturally the worst was over now it would be very natural if miss marsh were disappointed in the circumstances i think shed been led to expect mr wynnes voice was almost pleading mrs wickham detected a certain disapproval in the tone she hastened to justify herself he might still be useful when the estate was once settled they would of course put everything in the hands of their london solicitor but it would be better not to antagonize him for the moment our aunt left a very small fortune i understand and i suppose she felt it wouldnt be fair to leave a large part of it away from her own family of course said her husband following her lead it is family money she inherited it from my grandfather and but i want you to know miss marsh that my wife and i thoroughly appreciate all you did for my aunt money couldnt repay your care and devotion youve been perfectly wonderful its extremely good of you to say so i think everyone who saw miss marsh with miss wickham must be aware that during the ten years she was with her she never spared herself mr wynnes eyes were on mrs wickham of course my aunt was a very trying woman began james wickham feebly his wife headed him off earning ones living is always unpleasant if it werent thered be no incentive to work this astonishing aphorism was almost too much for noras composure she gave mrs wickham an amused glance to which that lady responded by beaming upon her in her most agreeable manner my wife and i would be very glad to make some kind of acknowledgment of your services i was just going to mention it echoed mrs wickham heartily mr wynnes kindly face brightened visibly he was glad they were going to do the right thing after all he had been a little fearful a few moments before i felt sure that in the circumstances but mrs wickham interrupted him quickly what were your wages may i ask miss marsh thirty pounds a year really in a tone of excessive surprise many ladies are glad to go as companion without any salary just for the sake of a home and congenial society i daresay youve been able to save a good deal in all these years i had to dress myself decently mrs wickham said nora frigidly mrs wickham was graciousness itself well im sure my husband will be very glad to give you a years salary wont you jim its very kind of you replied nora coldly but im not inclined to accept anything but what is legally due to me you must remember went on mrs wickham that therell be very heavy death duties to pay theyll swallow up the income from miss wickhams estate for at least two years wont they mr wynne i quite understand said nora perhaps youll change your mind i dont think so there was an awkward pause mr wynne rose from his seat at the table his manner showed unmistakably that he was not impressed by mrs wickhams great generosity well i think i must leave you he said looking at nora goodby miss marsh if i can be of any help to you i hope youll let me know thats very kind of you bowing slightly to mrs wickham and nodding to her husband he went out we must go too dorothy said james uneasily mrs wickham began drawing on her gloves jim will be writing to you in a day or two you know how grateful we both are for all you did for our poor aunt we shall be glad to give you the very highest references youre such a wonderful nurse im sure youll have no difficulty in getting another situation i expect i can find you something myself ill ask among all my friends nora made no reply to this affable speech come on dorothy we really havent any time to lose said wickham hurriedly goodby miss marsh goodby said nora dully she stood her hands resting on the table her eyes fastened on the long blue envelope which mr wynne had forgotten from a long way off she heard the wheels of the cab on the driveway chapter iv i thought they were never going well it was miss pringle who had come in from her retreat in the garden eager to hear the news the moment she had seen the wickhams driving away nora turned and looked at her without a word miss pringle was genuinely startled at the drawn look on her face nora whats the matter isnt it as much as you thought miss wickham has left me nothing said nora in a dead voice miss pringle gave a positive wail of anguish ohhhh not a penny oh its cruel the girl said almost wildly after all she went on bitterly there was no need for her to leave me anything she gave me board and lodging and thirty pounds a year if i stayed it was because i chose but she neednt have promised me anything she neednt have prevented me from marrying my dear you could never have married that little assistant he wasnt a gentleman miss pringle reminded her ten years the ten best years of a womans life when other girls are enjoying themselves and what did i get for it board and lodging and thirty pounds a year a cook does better than that we cant expect to make as much money as a good cook said miss pringle with touching and unconscious pathos one has to pay something for living like a lady among people of ones own class oh its cruel nora could only repeat my dear said miss pringle with an effort at consolation dont give way im sure youll have no difficulty in finding another situation you wash lace beautifully and no one can arrange flowers like you nora sank wearily into a chair and i was dreaming of france and italy i shall spend ten years more with an old lady and then shell die and i shall look out for another situation it wont be so easy then because i shant be so young and so itll go on until i cant find a situation because im too old and then some charitable people will get me into a home you like the life dont you my dear there are so few things a gentlewoman can do when i think of those ten years said nora pacing up and down the length of the room having to put up with every unreasonableness never being allowed to feel ill or tired no servant would have stood what i have the humiliation ive endured youre tired and out of sorts said miss pringle soothingly everyone isnt so trying as miss wickham im sure mrs hubbard has been kindness itself to me considering i dont know what you mean by considering considering that shes rich and youre poor she gives you her old clothes she frequently doesnt ask you to have dinner by yourself when shes giving a party she doesnt remind you that youre a dependent unless shes very much put out but you youve had thirty years of it youve eaten the bitter bread of slavery till till it tastes like plum cake miss pringle was distinctly hurt i dont know why you say such things to me nora oh you mustnt mind what i say i mr hornby would like to see you for a minute miss said kate from the doorway now i told him i didnt think it would be very convenient miss but he says its very important and he wont detain you more than five minutes what a nuisance ask him to come in very good miss i wonder what on earth he can want who is he nora oh hes the son of colonel hornby dont you know he lives at the top of molyneux park his mother was a great friend of miss wickhams he comes down here now and then for weekends hes got something to do with motor cars mr hornby said kate from the door reginald hornby was evidently one of those candid souls who are above simulating an emotion they do not feel he had regarded the late miss wickham as an unusually tiresome old woman his mother had liked her of course but he could hardly have been expected to do so moreover he had a shrewd notion that she must have been a perfect tartar to live with miss marsh might be busy or tired out with the ordeal of the day but as she also might be leaving almost immediately and he wanted to see her he had not hesitated to come once he was sure that the wickham relatives had departed that he would find the late miss wickhams companion indulging in any show of grief for her late employer had never entered his head he was a goodlooking if rather vacuous young man with a long elegant body his dark sleek hair was always carefully brushed and his small mustache trimmed and curled his beautiful clothes suggested the fashionable tailors of savile row everything about him his tie his handkerchief protruding from his breast pocket his boots bore the stamp of the very latest thing i say im awfully sorry to blow in like this he said airily he beamed on nora whom he had always regarded as much too pretty a girl to be what he secretly called a frozy companion and sent a quick inquiring glance at miss pringle whom he vaguely remembered to have seen somewhere in tunbridge wells but then tunbridge wells was filled with frumps oh yes he remembered now she was usually to be seen leading a pair of poms on a leash you see i didnt know if youd be staying on here he went on retaining noras hand and i wanted to catch you im off in a day or two myself wont you sit down mr hornby miss pringle how dyou do mr hornbys glance skimmed lightly over miss pringles surface and returned at once to noras more pleasing face everything go off o k he inquired genially i beg your pardon funeral i mean mother went regular outing for her miss pringle stiffened visibly in her chair and began to study the pattern in the rug at her feet with an absorbed interest nora was conscious of a wild desire to laugh but with a heroic effort succeeded in keeping her face straight out of deference to her elderly friend really she said in a faint voice oh yes went on young hornby with unabated cheerfulness you see mothers getting on im the child of her old age benjamin dont you know benjamin and sarah you know he explained apparently for the benefit of miss pringle as he pointedly turned to address this final remark to her i understand perfectly said miss pringle icily but it wasnt sarah wasnt it when one of her old friends dies he went on to nora mother always goes to the funeral and says to herself well ive seen her out anyhow then she comes back and eats muffins for tea she always eats muffins after shes been to a funeral the maid said you wanted to see me about something in particular nora gently reminded him thats right i was forgetting he wheeled suddenly once more on miss pringle who had arrived at that stage in her study of the rug when she was carefully tracing out the pattern with the point of her umbrella if sarah wasnt benjamins mother whose mother was she if you want to know i recommend you to read your bible retorted that lady with something approaching heat mr hornby slapped his knee i thought it was a stumper he remarked with evident satisfaction the fact is im going to canada and mother told me you had a brother or something out there a brother not a something said nora with a smile and she said perhaps you wouldnt mind giving me a letter to him i will with pleasure but im afraid he wont be much use to you hes a farmer and he lives miles away from anywhere but im going in for farming you are what on earth for ive jolly well got to do something said hornby with momentary gloom and i think farmings about the best thing i can do one gets a lot of shooting and riding yon know and then there are tennis parties and dances and you make a pot of money theres no doubt about that but i thought you were in some motor business in london well i was in a way but i thought youd have heard about it mothers been telling everybody governor wont speak to me altogether things are rotten i want to get out of this beastly country as quick as i can would you like me to give you the letter at once said nora going over to an escritoire that stood near the window i wish you would fact is he went on addressing no one in particular as nora was already deep in her letter and miss pringle having exhausted the possibilities of the rug was gazing stonily into space im broke i was all right as long as i stuck to bridge i used to make money on that over a thousand a year what horror was stronger than miss pringles resolution to take no further part in the conversation with this extraordinary and apparently unprincipled young man playing regularly you know if i hadnt been a fool id have stuck to that but i got bitten with chemi with what asked nora over her shoulder chemin de fer never heard of it i got in the habit of going to thorntons i suppose you never heard of him either he keeps a gambling hell gives you a slapup supper for nothing as much pop as you can drink and cashes your checks like a bird the result is ive lost every bob i had and then thornton sued me on a check id given him the governor forked out but he says ive got to go to canada im never going to gamble again i can tell you that oh well thats something murmured nora cheerfully you cant make money at chemi went on hornby relapsing once more into gloom the cagnottes bound to clear you out in the end when i come back im going to stick to bridge there are always plenty of mugs about and if you have a good head for cards you cant help making an income out of it but i thought you said you were never going began miss pringle but thinking better of it abandoned her sentence in midair here is your letter said nora holding it out to him thanks awfully i daresay i shant want it you know i expect i shall get offered a job the moment i land but theres no harm having it ill be getting along goodby then and good luck goodby he said shaking hands with nora and miss pringle nora why dont you go out to canada said miss pringle thoughtfully as soon as the door had closed after young hornby now your brother has a farm of his own i should think my brothers married interrupted nora quickly he married four years ago you never told me i couldnt why isnt his wife isnt his wife nice she was a waitress at a scrubby little hotel in winnipeg what are you going to do then i im going to look out for another situation miss pringle shook her head sadly well i must be going mrs hubbard will be back from her drive by this time shes sure to have you in for tea or something before you go shes always been quite fond of you at any rate ill see you again of course oh yes indeed nora was thankful to be alone once more she wanted to think it all out what a day it had been starting with such high hopes to end only in utter disaster she felt completely exhausted by the emotions she had undergone time enough to plan tomorrow tonight she needed rest two days later in the late afternoon she found herself in the train for london the second journey she had taken in ten years once three years before miss wickham had been persuaded to go up and pay the james wickhams a short visit and had taken nora with her it could hardly have been described as a pleasure trip miss wickham detested visiting and had only yielded to her nephews importunities because she had never been in his london house to stay any time and had an avid curiosity to see how they lived she had of course disapproved of everything she saw about the establishment but as it was no part of her purpose to let the fact be known to her relatives she had in a large measure vented her consequent illhumor upon her unfortunate companion the last few days had seemed full indeed no matter how little one may really care for a place the process of uprooting after ten years is not an easy one mr wynne had been to see her to renew his offer of assistance and counsel in any plan she might have for the future and she had spent an hour with the good doctor and his wife the dreaded invitation from mrs hubbard had duly arrived and had turned out to be for dinner an extraordinary honor nora had accepted it entirely on miss pringles account mrs hubbard had been condescension itself and had even gone the length of excusing miss pringle from the evenings game of bezique in order that she might have a farewell chat with her friend she had mildly deprecated miss wickhams carelessness in not altering her will but had reminded miss marsh that she should be grateful to her late employer for having had such kindly intentions toward her vaguely ending her remarks with the statement that as her dear husband had always said in this imperfect world one had often to consider intentions it was from her more humble friends that nora found it hardest to part she had had tea with the gardeners wife and children of whom she was genuinely fond but it was the parting from kate that had brought the tears to her eyes she had confided to that motherly soul how large she had loomed in the rosy plans she had made while she still had expectations from miss wickham and been assured in turn that kate couldnt have fancied herself happier than she would have been in looking after her and the faithful kate refused to regard the plan as anything more than postponed it developed that she was an adept in telling fortunes with tea leaves she hoped her dear miss marsh wouldnt consider it a liberty for her to say so but in every forecast that kate had made for herself in the last twelfth month miss marsh had always been mixed up which showed beyond the peradventure of a doubt that they were to meet again it was already dusk when london was reached but nora had an address of an inexpensive little private hotel which the doctors wife had given her she had written ahead to engage a room so that her mind was at ease on that subject not knowing exactly where the street might be further than that it led off the strand she indulged herself in the novel luxury of a taxi and drove to her new lodgings in state if it isnt too much out of the way would you take me by way of trafalgar square please the chauffeur touched his cap his yes miss was noncommittal she was conscious of an unusual feeling of exaltation as she went along london while it can be one of the most depressing cities in the world when one is alone and friendless quickens the imagination as they went through trafalgar square and caught a fleeting glimpse of the national gallery nora resolved that she would give herself a real treat and renew old acquaintance with that institution as well as see the wallace collection and the tate gallery both of which would be new to her she realized more poignantly than ever how starved her love of beauty had been for the last ten years it awoke in her afresh with the thought that for a few days at least she could permit herself the luxury of gratifying it she was shown to her room by a neat maid who said she would see what might be done in the way of a light tea as a rule breakfast was the only repast that was supposed to be furnished but she was quite sure miss horn the proprietor would in view of the fact that the young lady was a stranger in london and would hardly know where to go alone for a bite of dinner make an exception nora thanked her and set about making the bare little room which was quite at the top of the house look a little more homelike by unpacking some of her own things after all she reflected it wasnt much less cheerful than the room she had had for ten years perhaps her late participation in the splendors of miss wickhams guest chamber which had been part of dr evans prescription had spoiled her for simpler joys she laughed aloud at the thought by the time she had had her supper which was sufficiently good and written a few notes one to the doctors wife to say that she thought she would be quite comfortable in her new quarters and one to the head of the agency through which she had obtained her post with miss wickham nora found herself ready for bed the next day dawned bright and fine one of those delightful spring days to which the great city occasionally treats you as if to protest against the injustice of her reputation for being dark and gloomy there were a number of pleasant looking people in the coffee room when nora went down to breakfast which turned out to be abundant and well cooked having inquired her direction a sense of location was not one of her gifts she set out gaily enough for a whole day of sightseeing she might never get another position and have eventually to go out as a charwoman the detail that she would be illy equipped for any such undertaking she humorously dismissed but a day or two of unalloyed enjoyment she was going to have come what might the day was a complete success having done several of the picture galleries lunched and dined frugally at one of the a b c restaurants nora returned at nightfall tired but happy oh the blessed freedom of it the next morning on coming down stairs she found at her plate a letter from the agency the management of affairs it seemed had passed into other hands doubtless miss marshs name would be found on the books of several years back but it was not familiar to the new director however they would of course be pleased to put themselves at miss marshs service if she would be good enough to give them an early call bringing any and all references she might have etc etc miss marsh tore the note into tiny fragments the agency could wait everything could wait for the moment she must have her fling the first taste of freedom in all these years after that chapter v october had come nora was no longer in the comfortable little hotel to which the doctors wife had sent her early in july she had thought it wiser to seek cheaper quarters where breakfast was not included every penny must be counted now and by combining breakfast and lunch late in the morning she found she could do quite well until night besides saving an appreciable sum for the end of the week when her room must be paid for the summer had been one long nightmare of heat it had been years according to all accounts since the unhappy londoners had so sweltered beneath the scorching rays of an almost tropic sun often when tossing on her little bed or when seated by her small window which gave on a sort of court with the forlorn hope of finding some air stirring had she thought with longing of the pleasant garden at tunbridge wells and is perfumed breezes so far her search for any position had been fruitless she had gone to other agencies to some whose greatly reduced fees were a sure indication that she could hope for nothing so high class to use their hateful phrase as she had been accustomed to but one must do what one could at one establishment she shuddered to remember she found that she would be expected to sit in the office as at the servants agencies to be inspected by prospective employers this nora had flatly refused to do and had been coolly informed by the manager an insufferable young man with a loud voice and a vulgar manner that in that case he could do nothing for her he had at the same time refused to return her fee which he had providently collected before explaining these conditions on the ground that they never returned fees nora had been glad enough to make her escape from his hateful presence without arguing the matter with him although she considered that to all intents and purposes her pocket had been picked apparently everyone in the world was already supplied with a companion she had thought of filing an application for the position of nursery governess only to find that for a really good post two modern languages would be required that coupled with the fact that she was obliged to confess to absolutely no previous experience in teaching closed the door to even secondclass appointments and the desolating loneliness of it all only once in all this time had she seen anyone she knew and that was shortly after her arrival while still in the first flush of her newly regained freedom she had gone with a young woman who was staying at the hotel for a few days to the gallery of a theater from her lofty perch she had seen reggie hornby with a gay party of young men in the stalls below evidently he was making the most of his last hours at home before going into exile since leaving the hotel she had exchanged but few words with anyone beyond her landlady the little slavey and the people at the various agencies once it chanced that for several days in succession she had lunched at the same table in a dingy little restaurant with a fresh pleasantlooking young girl who had said good morning in such a friendly manner on their second encounter that nora felt encouraged to begin conversation her new acquaintance had the gift of a sympathetic manner and before nora realized it she found herself relating the story of her failures and disappointments miss hodson so nora discovered she was called from the very businesslike card she had handed her at the beginning of the repast with an air which for the moment relapsed from the sympathetic to the professional had suggested when they had finished their lunch that as she still had a quarter of an hour to spare they might go and finish their chat in one of the little green oases abutting on the embankment seated on one of the benches she proceeded to advise her companion to take up stenography and typewriting while she was still in funds there are plenty of chances for a girl who knows her business and youre your own mistress and not at the beck and call of any old cat who thinks she has bought you outright just because shes paying you starvation wages she said with a finely independent air then in a thoroughly businesslike way she went on to give the address of the school at which she had studied herself and had offered to take nora there any evening the coming week in the end to noras great pleasure she had suggested joining forces for an outing on the coming sunday with a gesture that seemed to refer one to her card she had explained that after typing all week in a stuffy office she always tried to have a sunday out of doors to get her mind off her work it was arranged that they should go somewhere together leaving their destination to be decided when they met they were to meet in front of the national gallery at a quarter before ten but although poor nora waited for over an hour her friend did not turn up and she had returned sadly to her dreary room neither of the girls had thought to exchange addresses beyond her name and occupation miss hodsons card vouchsafed nothing nor had nora ever seen her again although she had returned several times to the restaurant where they had met she had spent many of the long sleepless hours of the night in speculation as to what had become of her she was sure that some accident had befallen her or she would have met her again no one could be so cruel intentionally once again in a tea room she had timidly ventured prompted by sheer loneliness to speak to an elderly woman with gray hair it was a harmless little remark about some flowers in a vase on the counter the woman had stared at her coldly for a moment before she said i do not seem to recall where i have had the pleasure of seeing you before a flash of the old temper had crimsoned noras cheek but she made no reply since then aching as she was for a little human companionship she had spoken to no one she had had two long letters from miss pringle whose star seemed momentarily to be in the ascendant mrs hubbard had been ordered to the seaside they were later to take a continental trip there was even talk of consulting a famous and expensive specialist before returning to the calm of tunbridge wells but prosperity had not made miss pringle selfish in the face of the gift of a costume which mrs hubbard had actually never worn having conceived a strong distaste for it on its arrival from the dressmaker she had time to think of her less fortunate friend while waiting for the situation which was sure to come eventually why didnt nora run down to brighton for a week after the terrible london heat one could get really very comfortable lodgings remarkably cheap at this season it would do her no end of good and on the theory that a watched pot never boils she would be certain to find that there was something for her on her return miss pringles brother it seemed had had a turn of luck just what she discreetly forbore to mention certainly it could not have been at cards nora smiled at the recollection of the horror that mr hornbys remarks as to his earnings from that source had provoked however he had most generously sent his sister a tenpound note as a present miss pringle had of course no possible use for it at the time also it appeared that the thought of carrying it about with her particularly as she was going among foreigners filled her with positive terror therefore she was enclosing it to nora to take care of she hoped she would use any part of it or all of it she could return it after they returned to tunbridge wells provided that miss pringle survived the natural perils that beset one who ventured out of england they would have started on their journey before the receipt of the letter as to their destination miss pringle said never a word a small envelope had fallen into her lap when she opened the letter with dimmed eyes nora opened it it contained the tenpound note it was a week later that it occurred to nora to answer two advertisements that appeared in one of the morning papers in each case it was a companion that was wanted one of the ladies lived at whitby and pending the answer to her letter she decided to call personally on the other who lived at hampstead the morning being fine she decided to make an early start and walk about on hampstead heath until a suitable hour for making her call when she finally arrived before the house a rather pretentious looking structure in south hampstead she was met at the gate by a middleaged woman of unprepossessing appearance who inquired rather sharply as to her errand mrs blakes card distinctly said that all applications were to be made in writing she said disagreeably in reply to noras explanation the one i read did not at least i dont think it did said nora well if it didnt it should have said the woman tartly may i ask if you are mrs blake write and you may find out although i might as well tell you you wont answer mrs blake will be wanting someone of a very different appearance said the woman rudely i am indeed unfortunate said nora with a bow the woman closed the gate with a bang and turned toward the house as nora walked rapidly away she decided to answer no more advertisements one morning at the end of the week the post brought her three letters one from its postmark was clearly from her brother in canada she put that aside for the moment to be read at her leisure illustration nora overhears frank say wives are made for work only the yorkshire lady it appeared was blind and required a companion to read to her and to assist in preparing some memoirs which her dead brother had left uncompleted she offered nora a refined home with every comfort that a lady could desire but there was no salary attached to the position the third was from one of the agencies a client was prepared to offer a lady companion the magnificent sum of ten shillings a week and her lunch out of her salary nora would be expected therefore to find herself a room clothes breakfast and supper her brothers letter was as always kind and affectionate he rather vaguely apologized for his delay in replying to hers written at the time of miss wickhams death he had been frightfully busy up at dawn and so tired at night that he was glad to tumble into bed right after supper his wife too had had a sharp spell of sickness however she was all right again he was glad to say why did not nora come out to them they would be glad to offer her a comfortable home although she must make up her mind to dispense with the luxuries she was accustomed to but there was always plenty to eat and a good bed at any rate he knew she would grow to love the life as he had done there was a fine freedom about it for his part nothing would ever tempt him back to england except for a visit when he had put by a little more she would find his wife a good sort she too would welcome her sisterinlaw they would be no end of company for each other during the long days while the men were away and she would be glad to have someone to lend a hand about the house he hoped she had been able to save enough money to pay her passage out if she hadnt he would somehow manage to send whatever was necessary but while he was fairly prosperous ready money was a little more scarce than usual for the moment his wifes illness had been pretty expensive what with hiring a woman to do all the work etc etc the letter settled it on the one hand was this heartbreaking waiting while watching ones little hoard diminish from day to day and always the terrifying and unanswerable question what is to be done when it is exhausted on the other a home and the prospect that she might be able in a measure to pay her way by helping her brothers wife noras housewifely accomplishments were but few yet she could learn and while learning she could at least take away the sting of those lonely hours as her brother had said on one thing she was resolved she would let bygones be bygones she would do everything in her power to win her sisterinlaw forgetting everything but that she was the wife of her only brother the next few days were the happiest she had known for a long time there was a pleasurable excitement in getting ready for so momentous a step after having paid her passage she found that she had eight pounds in the world the result of ten years work as ladys companion she wrote to let mr wynne know of her decision and enclosed miss pringles banknote to the doctors wife with an explanatory note asking her to see that it reached her hands safely miss pringle herself should have a long letter from the new world waiting her on her return her last day at home having satisfied herself that nothing was forgotten she spent a long hour in the turner room in the tate gallery drinking it all in for the last time when she left the building it was with a feeling that the last farewell to the old life was said to her great pleasure and a little to her surprise nora discovered herself to be a thoroughly good sailor as a consequence the voyage to montreal was quite the most delightful thing she had ever experienced the boat was a slow one but the time never once seemed long indeed as they approached their destination she found herself wishing that the western continent might by some convulsion of nature be removed quite safely an indefinite number of leagues farther or that they might make a dtour by way of the antipodes anything rather than bring the voyage to an end there were but few passengers at this season so that beyond the daily exchange of ordinary courtesies she was able to pass much of the time by herself the weather was unusually fine for the time of year it was possible to spend almost all the daylight hours on deck and with night came long hours of dreamless sleep such as she never remembered to have enjoyed since childhood as a consequence it was a thoroughly rejuvenated nora that landed in montreal the stress and strain of the past summer was forgotten or only to be looked back upon as a sort of horrid nightmare from which she had happily awakened it was too late in the day after they had landed to think of continuing her journey besides as is often the case with people who have stood a sea voyage without experiencing any disagreeable sensations nora found that she still felt the motion of the boat after landing it seemed a pity too not to see something of this newworld city while she was on the ground her brothers farm was still an incredible distance farther west people thought nothing of distance in this amazing new world still it might easily be long before she would be here again the future was a blank page there was a delightful irresponsibility about the thought she had come over the sea at her brothers bidding the future was his care not hers the journey west had the same charm of novelty that the sea voyage had had the nearest station to eddies farm was a place called dyer in the province of manitoba not far from winnipeg once inured to the new and strange mode of traveling in canada so different from what she had been accustomed to nora prepared to enjoy it never before had she realized the possibilities of beauty in a winter landscape the flying prospect without the window fascinated her the magazines and papers with which she had provided herself lay unopened in her lap she realized that these vast snowcovered stretches might easily drive one mad with their loneliness and desolation if one had to live among them but to rush through them as they were doing was exhilarating it was all so strange so contrary to any previous experience that nora had an uncanny feeling that they might easily have left the earth she knew and be flying through space she whimsically thought that if at the next stop she were to be told that she was on the planet mars she would not be greatly astonished it was like traveling with alice in wonderland one thing however recalled her to earth and prosaic mundane affairs her supply of money was rapidly getting dangerously low barring accident she would have enough to get her to dyer where eddie was to meet her but suppose they should be snowed up for a day or two only an hour before she had been thrilled with an account of just such an experience which a man in the seat in front of her was recounting to his companion well if that happened she would either have to go hungry or beg food from the more affluent of her fellowpassengers fortunately she was not obliged to put their generosity to the test the train arrived at dyer without accident only a few minutes behind the scheduled time there were a number of people at the station as nora alighted for a moment she had a horrid fear that either she had been put off at the wrong place or that her brother had failed to meet her certainly none of the furcoated figures were in the least familiar but almost at once one of the men detached himself from the waiting group on the platform and after one hesitating second came toward her nora my child i hardly knew you i was forgetting that you would be a grown woman and nora was half smothered in a furry embrace and kissed on both cheeks before she was quite sure that the advancing stranger was her brother oh eddie dear i didnt know you at all but how can one be expected to with that great cap covering the upper part of your face and a coat collar hiding nearly all the rest but you really havent changed now that i get a look at you i daresay i have altered more than you but i was little more than a child when you went away well we have quite a little drive ahead of us said eddie as having himself helped to carry noras trunks to a nondescriptlooking vehicle to which were attached two horses he motioned to nora to get in i expect you wont be sorry to have a little air after being so long in a stuffy car nora noticed that he gave the man who had helped him with the trunks no tip and that they called each other joe and ed this was democracy with a vengeance she made a little face of disapproval nora never forgot that drive in the light of afterevents it seemed to have cut her off more sharply from all the old life than either the crossing of the pathless sea or the long overland journey it was taken for the most part in silence eddies attention being largely taken up with his team also nora noted that he seemed to feel the cold more than she did as he kept his coat collar turned up all the way she herself was so occupied with her thoughts that she had no sense of either time or distance at last they came in sight of a house such as she had never seen it was built entirely of logs at the sound of their approach the one visible door opened on the crack as if to avoid letting in the cold and nora saw a thin dark little woman with rather a hard look and a curiously driedup skin whom she rightly guessed to be her sisterinlaw standing in the doorway while lounging nonchalantly against the doorpost was a tall strong wellsetup young man whose age might have been anything between thirty and thirtyfive he had remarkably cleancut features and was cleanshaven his frankly humorous gaze rested unabashed on the strangers face forgetting all her good resolutions to adapt herself to the habits and customs of this new country nora felt that she could have struck him in his impudent face the fact that she reddened under his scrutiny naturally only made her the more furious come on out here some of you called eddie jovially heavens the way you all hug the stove would make anyone believe youd never seen a canadian winter before in your lives here frank lend a hand with these trunks and call ben to take the horses gertie this is nora now you need never be lonely again pleased to make your acquaintance said gertie primly the man called frank the one who had been honoring nora with his regard came forward with a hand outstretched to help her alight while another man the ordinary type of english laborer placed himself at the horses heads come hop out nora there was nothing else to do nora put the very tips of her fingers into the outstretched hand to her unspeakable indignation she felt herself lifted bodily out and actually carried inside the door at her smothered exclamation gertie gave a shrill laugh chapter vi three weeks had passed with inconceivable rapidity leaving nora with the dazed feeling that one has sometimes when waking from a fantastic dream there were moments when she was overwhelmed with the utter hopelessness of ever being able to adapt herself to a mode of life so foreign to all her traditions she had she told herself been prepared to find everything different from life at home and while she had smiled on that day such ages ago when young hornby had called on her at tunbridge wells to announce his impending departure from the land of his birth at his airy theory that the life of the canadian farmer was largely occupied with riding hunting dancing and tennis she found to her dismay that her own mental picture of her brothers existence had been nearly as far from the reality on the drive over from the station eddie had vaguely remarked that he had a great surprise for her when she reached the house nora had paid but little attention at the moment thinking that he probably meant the house itself what had been her astonishment when once her rage at being lifted bodily from the sled by the man called frank had permitted of her feeling any other emotion to find reginald hornby himself an inmate of her brothers household there was but little trace of the ultra smart young londoner beyond his still carefully kept hair and mustache the only difference between his costume and that of the others was that his overalls were newer and that his flannel shirt was plainly a piccadilly product nora had known gentlemen farmers in england who worked hard riding about their estates every day supervising and directing everything and who seemed from their conversation to take it all seriously enough she had made all allowance for the rougher life in a new and unsettled country there was something picturesque and romantic about the frontiersman which had always appealed to her imagination she had read a little of him and had seen a play in london the night she recognized reggie from afar where the scene was laid in the far west on returning to the hotel she had looked with new interest at eddies photograph and tried to picture him in the costume worn by the leading man but to find that her own brother a man of education and refinement actually worked with his own hands like a common laborer and what to noras mind was infinitely more incomprehensible on a footing of perfect equality with his hired men calling them familiarly by their given names and being called ed in turn was a distinctly disagreeable revelation that they should be familiar with gertie was quite another matter probably they were acquaintances of long standing dating back to her old hotel days her sisterinlaw too was absolutely different from the type she had imagined always she had seen her as one of those vapid pretty little creatures who had become old long before her time peevish spoiled inclined to be flirtatious refusing to give up her youth still living in the recollection of her little day of triumph gertie fulfilled only one of these conditions she was a small woman not nearly so tall as nora herself in all else she was as different as possible from what she had imagined there could never have been anything of the clinging vine about gertie as a girl she might have been handsome in an almost masculine way pretty in the generally accepted sense she could never have been her one coquetry seemed to be in the matter of shoes her feet were unbelievably small nora divined that she was inordinately proud of them while always scrupulously neat she was apparently indifferent to clothes so long as they were clean and not absolutely shabby but her highheeled shoes were the smartest that could be had from winnipeg and as for her being soft and spoiled never was there a more tireless and hardworking creature from early morning till late at night she was never idle she was a perfect human dynamo of force and energy the cooking and washing for the family which now that nora was here consisted of six persons four of whom were men with the appetites which naturally come with a long days work in the open air in itself was no light task but by way of recreation after the supper dishes had been washed up gertie darned socks mended shirts patched trousers for the men folk or sewed on some garment for herself nora longed to see her sit with folded hands just once that she was as devoted to her husband as he to her there could be no doubt all other men were a matter of complete indifference to her were they good workers or shirkers that was the only thing about them of any interest but she was not the sort of woman to show tenderness or affection eddie had apparently the greatest respect for her judgment in all matters pertaining to the running of the farm frequently in the evenings they sat together in the far corner of the living room eddie talking in a low voice while gertie always at her eternal sewing listened with close attention often nodding her head in approval but occasionally shaking it vehemently when any project failed to meet with her approbation occasionally her sharp birdlike glance flashed over the other occupants of the room at the three men yarning lazily by the big stove or playing cards at the dining table and at nora making a pretense of reading a sixmonthsold magazine or writing her portfolio on her knee always when nora encountered that glance she understood its exultant message look you it said as plainly as if it had been couched in actual words look at me ruling over my little court advising as a queen might with her prime minister you think yourself my superior you with your fineladys airs and graces a pretty pass your education and accomplishments have brought you to of what use are you to anyone there was no blinking the fact the antagonism between the two women was too instinctive too deep ever to be more than superficially covered over they each recognized it and yet neither was wholly to blame it had its roots in conditions that were far more significant than mere personal feeling nora for her part had come to her brothers house with the sincere intention of doing everything in her power to win her sisterinlaws good will if not affection she had believed that their common fondness for eddie would be a sure foundation on which to build but from the first without being at all conscious of it her manner breathed patronage and disapproval of a mode of life so foreign to all her experience she had made the resolution to remember nothing of gerties humble origin to treat her in every way with the deference due her brothers wife gertie too had made good resolutions she was at heart the more generous nature of the two she was prepared to find her husbands sister unskilled to the point of incompetency in all the housewifely lore of which she was past mistress for she too had her traditions she would have laughed at the idea that it was possible for her to be jealous of anybody but secretly she knew that there was one thing which aroused in her a frenzy of jealous rage that was those years of her husbands life in which she had neither part nor lot any reference to his old life at home fairly maddened her and deep down in her heart each woman nursed a grievance with gertie it was the remembrance of the angry letter of protest which nora had written her brother when she learned of his approaching marriage and which he had been indiscreet enough to show her with nora it was the recollection of gerties laugh the night of her arrival when her brothers hired servant had dared to take her for a moment in his arms still any open rupture might have been avoided or at least delayed for several months longer if either could have been persuaded to exercise a little more patience and selfcontrol each of them in her different way had known adversity both of them had had to learn to control tempers naturally high while they were still dependent but it never occurred to either of them that the obligation to do so still existed from gerties point of view nora was just as much a dependent as in the days when she was a hired companion to a rich woman it was her house in law and in fact for her husband had made it over to her it was her bread that she ate her bed she slept in it behooved her therefore to be a little less lofty and condescending she had always known how it would be and it was only because the project seemed so near her husbands heart that she had consented to such an experiment in simple justice it must be said that such a thought had never entered noras head she had accepted gladly her brothers invitation to make her home with him what more natural that he should offer it now that he was able to do so in return she was perfectly willing to do everything she could to help in all the womans work about the house as far as her ignorance would permit it could hardly be expected that she would be as proficient in household work as a person who had done it all her life she was more than willing to concede her sisterinlaws superiority in all such matters and she was perfectly ready to learn all that gertie would teach her she had in everything been prepared to meet her halfway further she would not go for the rest it was her brothers place to protect her sadly nora confessed to herself that eddie had deteriorated in a degree that she could not have believed possible the first shock had come when they sat down to supper the night of her arrival to her amazed disgust they had all eaten at the same table hired men and all and then to see her brother a gentleman by birth breeding and training sitting down at his own table in his shirtsleeves her own seat was on the right of her sisterinlaw next reginald hornby all the men except eddie wore overalls he had replaced his with an old black waistcoat and a pair of grubby dark trousers nora wondered sarcastically if his more formal costume was in honor of her arrival but quickly remembered that he had had to drive to dyer it was cold outside probably these festive garments were warmer she found herself speculating as to whether any of the men owned anything but outer coats there hadnt been much general conversation at that first meal naturally eddie had had many questions to ask about old acquaintances in england nora had given her first impressions of travel in the new world addressing many of her remarks to gertie who had been noticeably silent through all her bright talk the thought would obtrude itself what can reggie hornby think of my brother she had an angry consciousness too that she was unwittingly furnishing much amusement to that objectionable person opposite whose name she learned was frank taylor she meant to speak to eddie about him later he was an entirely new type to her his fellow servant whose name was trotter on the contrary could be seen about london any day an ordinary ignorant cockney he at least had the merit of seeming to know his place and how to conduct himself in the presence of his betters and except when asking for more syrup of which he seemed inordinately fond kept discreetly silent but the idea that there was any difference in their stations was not betrayed in taylors look or manner he commented humorously from time to time on noras various experiences coming overland quite oblivious to all appearances that she pointedly ignored him nora had arrived at that point in her gay recital when she had had qualms that her brother had failed to meet her you can fancy how i felt getting down at a perfectly strange station she was interrupted by gerties irritating little laugh but what have i said what is it it was taylor who replied well you see out here in the wilderness we dont call it a station we call it a depot do you really asked nora with exaggerated surprise looking at her brother custom of the country he said smilingly but a depot is a place where stores are kept of course i dont know what you call it in england said gertie aggressively but while youre in this country i guess youd better call it what other folks do it would be rather absurd for me to call it that when its wrong said nora flushing with annoyance gerties thin lips tightened of course i dont pretend to have had very much schooling but it seems to me ive read something somewhere about doing as the romans do when youre livin with them at any rate im sure of one thing its considered the polite thing to do in any country the feeling that she had been put in the wrong even if not very tactfully did not tend to lessen noras annoyance she looked appealingly at her brother but he leaning back in his chair and seeing that his wifes eyes were bent on her plate shook his head at her smiling slightly if everyone has finished said gertie after an awkward pause if youll all move your chairs away ill clear away the things may i help you said nora with an effort at conciliation no thanks no no youre company tonight said her brother with a mans relief at finding an unpleasant situation at an end but i daresay tomorrow gertiell find plenty for you to do well all be out till dinner time you girls will have a lot to talk over while youre getting acquainted hornby groaned dismally it doesnt make any difference what the weather is in this blessed country he said dismally to nora you have to go out whether theres really anything to do or not thats so laughed taylor still i think youll admit the boss always manages to find something to fill up the time that he does said hornby with another hollow groan the last time i saw you said nora you were calling poor old england all sorts of dreadful names isnt farming in canada all your fancy painted it gertie paused in the act of pouring water from the kettle into the dishpan not a bit like it she said dryly hes like most of the english ive run up against they think all youve got to do is just to sit down and have afternoon tea and watch the crops grow by themselves oh come now gertie youve never had to accuse me of loafing and im an englishman said her husband goodnaturedly i said most and as for afternoon tea broke in hornby i dont believe they have that sacred institution in the whole blessed country you have tea with all your meals men out here have something else to do but sit indoors afternoons and eat between meals do you know said nora after a pause it isnt nearly so cold as i expected to find it dont you usually have it much colder than this its rarely colder until later in the season but frank here whos our champion weather prophet says its going to be an exceptional season with hardly any snow at all nora had been conscious all through the evening that taylor had hardly once taken his eyes from her face she looked directly at him for the first time to find him watching her with a look of quiet amusement that would indeed be an exceptional season if all one hears of the rigors of the climate be true she said coldly every season in this country is exceptional he said humorously if it isnt exceptional one way its sure to be exceptional the other fetch me those pants of yours said gertie to trotter he left the room to return shortly with the desired articles exhibiting a yawning tear in one of the knees gertie at once set about mending them in the same workmanlike manner that she did everything doesnt she ever rest asked nora in an undertone of hornby never he whispered her one recreation is abusing me i fancy youll come in for a little of the same medicine shes planning an amusing winter i can see that already i think if i may ill ask you to excuse me said nora rising abruptly im a little tired after my long journey oh how good itll be to find oneself in a real bed again im sure you must be said her brother nora knows where her room is he said turning to his wife she was up before supper she cant very well have forgotten the way the house is small after what shes been accustomed to i dare say thank you i can find it again easily said nora hastily ill see you at breakfast eddie she crossed over to where gertie was sewing busily good night gertie i hope you will not find me too stupid about learning things youll find me willing anyway she said almost humbly gertie looked up at her with real kindness wlllings half the battle she said in softened tone as nora was leaving the room satisfied at having done her part as far as gertie was concerned she was recalled by taylors drawling tone oh miss nora youre forgetting something am i what youre forgetting to say good night to me why so i am she could hear them laugh as she left the room and so ended the first day in her brothers house breakfast the next morning was of the most hurried description gertie herself did not sit down until the men had gone being chiefly occupied with baking some sort of hot cakes which were new to nora who confined herself to an egg and some tea she secretly longed for some toast but as no one else seemed to have any she refrained from making her wants known perhaps later when she was more familiar with the ways of this strange household she would be permitted to make some for herself when she wanted it while her sisterinlaw was eating her breakfast nora stood looking out of the window at the vast expanse of snowcovered country with never a house in sight already there were signs that taylors prophecy would be fulfilled the sun which had been up only a few hours shone brightly and already the air had lost much of its sharpness it was distinctly warmer than it had been the day before at the first sign that gertie had finished her breakfast nora began to gather the things together for washing wisely not waiting to ask permission if possible gertie seemed to be less inclined for conversation in the early morning than at night they finished the task in unbroken silence when the last dish had been put away gertie spoke can you bake i have baked cakes how about bread and biscuits ive never tried them umph i should be glad to learn if you would be good enough to teach me i have little time for teaching said gertie ungraciously but you can watch how i do it and maybe youll learn something can you wash and iron said gertie while she was kneading her dough of course i can iron and i can wash lace people round here wear more flannel shirts than lace i suppose you never washed any flannels no never have you ever done any scrubbing of course not nora was beginning to find this catechism a little trying not work for a lady i suppose just what does a companion do it depends she does whatever her employer requires reads aloud acts as secretary goes riding and shopping with the lady she lives with arranges the flowers everything of that sort oh but nothing really useful nora gave an angry laugh its clear that some people consider a companions work useful since they employ them you take pay for it after all its much the same as being a servant its not at all the same ed tells me that sometimes when miss wickers wickham whatever her name was miss wickham that when miss wickham had company for dinner you had to have your dinner alone that is true then she considered you sort of a servant said gertie triumphantly nora was silent gertie having cut her dough into small round pieces with a tin cutter and put them into her pans went toward the oven and yet you object to eating at the same table with the hired men having satisfied herself that the oven was at the proper heat she shut the door with a bang ive said nothing about it you didnt need to but i most certainly do object to it and i cant for the life of me see the necessity of it i was what you call a servant for years i suppose you object to eating at the table with me what perfect nonsense its not at all the same thing youre my brothers wife and the mistress of his house yes im the mistress of the house all right said gertie grimly frank taylors an uncommonly handsome man isnt he i really havent noticed what perfect nonsense mimicked gertie of course youve noticed any woman would notice him then i must be different from other women oh no youre not you only think you are at bottom women are all alike take it from me and ive known a few if i can be of no help to you here i think ill go and unpack my box said nora she felt as if she had borne all she possibly could as you like once in her own room nora found it hard to keep back her angry tears only the thought that her reddened eyes would betray her to gertie at dinner kept her from having a good cry chapter vii that one morning was a fair sample of all the other days each suspected the other neither would make allowances or concessions as a consequence day by day the breach widened even eddie who was more unobserving than most men felt vaguely uncomfortable in the surcharged atmosphere from the first nora realized that it was an unequal contest gertie was too strongly intrenched in her position but it was not in her nature to refrain from administering those little thrusts which women know so well how to deal one another from any motive of policy the question of what she should do once her brothers house became intolerable she never permitted herself to ask in the needlepricking mode of warfare she was of course far more expert than her rival but if gerties hand was clumsy it was also heavy and always in the back of her mind was the consciousness that she so to speak had at least one piece of heavy artillery which she could bring up once the enemys fire became unendurable during the day the men being out of the house except at meal time there was to a certain degree a cessation of hostilities nora gradually acquired some knowledge of housework she learned to cook fairly well and always helped with the washing rarely complaining of her aching arms and back the only indication she had that she was making progress was that gertie complained less praise of course was not to be expected at dinner the men were usually too anxious to get back to work always with the exception of hornby who according to his own highly colored account had been assigned the herculean task of splitting all the wood required by the province of manitoba for the ensuing winter to linger longer than the time required for smoking a hurried pipe so that it was only during the long evenings that hostilities were resumed and then more or less under cover there was one person upon whom nora could openly vent her nervous irritation after a long day in gerties society and that was frank taylor they quarreled constantly to the great amusement of the others but with him too she felt hopelessly at a disadvantage he was maddeningly sure of himself and while he sometimes gave back thrust for thrust he never lost his temper seemingly nothing could penetrate his armor of good nature nor make him comprehend that she really meant her bitter words slow of movement and speech his mind was alert enough and nora had to admit to herself although she always openly denied it that he had humor to lose ones own temper in a wordy passage at arms and find ones opponent still smiling and serene is not a soothing experience often in the darkness of the night after she had gone to bed she could feel her cheek burn at the recollection that this ignorant clod as she contemptuously called him to herself had the power to make her feel a weak undisciplined child by merely never losing his selfcontrol there would have been consolation in the thought that in his stupidity he did not understand how she despised him how infinitely beneath her she considered him had it not been darkened by the suspicion that he understood perfectly well and didnt care how dared he how dared he she had complained of his familiar manner to her brother a day or two after her arrival but he had given her neither support nor consolation my dear nora he said we are not back in england the sooner you forget all the old notions of class and class distinctions the happier youll be they wont go here as long as a mans straight honest and a worker and franks all three it doesnt make any odds whether hes working for himself or for someone else were all on the same footing it is only due to the fact that ive had two good years in succession that im not somebodys hired man myself dont eddie dont you dont realize how you hurt me my dear girl im sorry but im in dead earnest you a hired man oh i cant believe it its true nevertheless plenty of better fellows than i have had to do it when youre starting in unless you have a good deal bigger capital than i had you only need to be hailed out frosted out or weeded out a couple of years in succession to use up your little stake and then where are you what do you mean by weeded out he was just about to explain when a halloo from the stables cut him short theres frank now i ought to be out helping him this minute weve got a good stiff drive ahead of us you ask gertie about it shell explain it to you but gertie had been deeply preoccupied with some domestic problem and nora had forborne to question her she had intended returning to the subject that evening but eddie and gertie were deep in one of their conferences until nearly bedtime it would never have suggested itself to her to seek any information from the objectionable frank so under cover of a heated discussion between him and trotter she appealed to reggie what does it mean to be weeded out oh lord i dont know kicked out i suppose isnt there something in the bible about tares and wheat nonsense it doesnt mean that id forgotten by the way how strong you were on biblical references do you remember your discussion about sarah and benjamin with agnes pringle of course i do and i completely stumped her dont you recollect goose she only wanted to make you look it up for yourself but being weeded out is something disastrous that happens to the farmers here like having the crops frozen well it hasnt happened since ive been here anyway but ill bet you a bob it means kicked out i tell you ill ask gertie if she doesnt think that i ought to be weeded out youd better not laughed nora the first open quarrel had taken place one day at dinner the night before nora had proposed making her first attempt at baking bread gertie had given a grudging consent everything had gone well until the bread once in the oven nora had gone to her room to add some pages to a long letter which she had begun some evenings before to agnes pringle gertie had been out in one of the barns most of the morning engaged in some mysterious task which she had been reserving until the weather became milder there had been a decided thaw setting in the day before and nora intended to be gone only a short time filled with a warm feeling of gratitude to miss pringle for her generous loan of the tenpound note she was writing her a long letter in the form of a diary describing her voyage across the atlantic and the trip across the continent both of which she was sure would greatly interest her friend and furnish her with topics for her ttette dinners with the excellent mrs hubbard for some days to come of the difficulties and disappointments in her new life she was resolved to say nothing nora hated to confess that she had failed in anything and so far she could hardly say that she had made a success later on she might have to acknowledge that her move had been a mistake but for the moment she would confine herself to describing all that struck her as novel and strange while the impression was still fresh while she still had the seeing eye when i came to the end of my last page and i remember that i was getting extremely sleepy at that point she wrote i had just finished describing the exterior of my brothers house to you i am sure i can never do justice to the interior you can never have seen much less imagined anything in the least like it i have decided upon reflection that it is the most unenglish thing i have seen yet and i have not forgotten those strange railway carriages either try to imagine a large room longer than it is deep at once livingroom diningroom and kitchen with nothing but rough brown boards for walls on which some framed some unframed are the colored supplements of the christmas illustrated papers both english and american over one of the doors is a magnificent trophy at least that is what we would call it at home i think it is a moose i am not at all sure although i have been told more than once over another door is a large clock such a one as one finds in a brokers office with us the floor is covered with what is called oilcloth i wonder why it certainly is not the least like cloth very new and excessively shiny it has a conventional pattern in black and white and when the sun shines on it it quite dazzles ones eyes there are two windows one to the south the other looking west the western view is magnificent i feel as if i could see straight away to the setting sun in the summer when the prairie is one great waving green sea it must be superb two days ago it was covered with snow as i write i can see great patches of brown every here and there for we have had a sudden thaw the window sills are filled with geraniums planted my dear in tins which once contained syrup of which everyone here including my brother seems extravagantly fond the syrup jug appears regularly at every meal and is almost the first thing put on the table i have yet to acquire a taste for it which they all think extremely queer the furniture consists of two american rockers and a number of kitchen chairs an unvarnished deal dresser covered with earthenware i dont think there are any two pieces that match two tables one a dining table a bookcase containing a few paperbacked novels and some magazines none so recent however as those i saw before i left england and last and most important an enormous american cooking stove our principal meal called dinner is great heavens her bread nora dashed from her room gertie was standing at one of the windows in the unwonted indulgence of a moments leisure nora threw open the oven door it was empty oh did you look after my loaf gertie im so sorry i quite forgot it yes i took it out a few moments ago she still had her face turned toward the window so nora did not see the smile that curled her lip she turned after a moment and the two women began to set the table for dinner presently the men were heard laughing outside as they cleaned their muddy boots on the scraper reggie had apparently achieved something new his ignorance of everything pertaining to farming furnished the material for most of the amusement that was going fortunately he was always goodnatured gertie with unusual good spirits entered into the joke of the thing at once and even bantered reggie playfully upon his latest discovery nora did not even hear what it was all about she was searching for the bread plate which always stood on the dresser why gertie i its all right said gertie without looking up from pouring the tea i took it ill get it in a minute come sit down nora obeyed hornby was just about to begin his explanation for whatever it was he had done when eddie interrupted him hold on a minute reg i want some bread i declare you two girls are getting to be as bad as reggie here setting a table without bread i was keeping it for a surprise said gertie getting up slowly i want you to appreciate the fact that nora helped me by doing the baking this morning noras face flushed with pleasure as her brother patted her on the shoulder with evident approval she looked at gertie with eyes shining with gratitude at that moment she came nearer liking her sisterinlaw than she ever was to again gertie went slowly across the room she usually moved with nervous quickness and picking up the missing bread plate from where it was leaning against the wall behind the stove went into the little pantry that gave off the kitchen slowly she returned and stood beside her husbands chair on the plate burned almost to a cinder was the loaf of bread that nora had forgotten here it is said gertie her smile was cruel oh i say gertie thats too bad of you it was frank who spoke too bad nora sprung to her feet with flashing eyes too bad its mean and despicable there are no words to do it justice but what could i expect from nora said her brother sharply nora rushed from the table to her room and although eddie knocked repeatedly at her door and begged her to let him speak with her if only for a moment that evening at suppertime she made no sign nor did anyone see her again that night she made a point of not coming down to breakfast the next morning until after the time when the men would be gone she thought it best to meet gertie alone it was time that they came to some sort of understanding to her surprise and annoyance taylor was still at the table gertie was nowhere to be seen come down to keep me company thats real nice of you im sure i supposed naturally that you had gone you usually have at this hour you dont know how it flatters a fellow to have women folks study his habits like that he said with a grin i knew that my brother had left the house since i saw him go i took it for granted that all his employees left when he did let me assure you once and for all that your habits are of no possible interest to me taylor put on his hat and went to the door just as he was about to open it he changed his mind and came back to the table where nora had seated herself and stood leaning on the back of his chair looking down at her its all right for us to row he said but if i were you id go a little easy with gertie shes all right and a good sort at bottom you can take it from me yesterday i admit she was downright nasty i guess you rile her up more than shes used to but i want to see you two get on its my turn to feel flattered said nora sarcastically well so long he said with undiminished good humor as he went out gertie appeared almost at once from the pantry i heard what he said i couldnt help it he was right about us both we dont hit it off but im willing to give it another try i have little choice but to agree with you said nora bitterly well thats hardly the way to begin retorted gertie angrily there was a certain air of restraint about them ail when they came in to dinner eddie looked both worried and anxious but as he saw that the two women were going about their duties much the same as usual he argued that the storm had blown over and brightened visibly the men had pushed back their chairs and were preparing to light their afterdinner pipes well be able to start on the ironing this afternoon said gertie addressing nora for the first time since breakfast very well i say said trotter who rarely ventured on a remark while at the table it was a rare big wash you done this morning by the look of it on the line when shes been out in this country a bit longer norall learn not to wear more things than she can help said gertie as a matter of fact she had no intention of criticising nora at the moment she meant merely that she would be more economical with experience but nora was in the mood to take fire at once was there more than my fair share she asked sharply you use double the number of stockings than what i do and everything else is the same i see clean but incompetent theres many a true word spoken in jest said gertie with angry emphasis say reg taylor broke in hastily is it true that when you first came out you asked ed where the bathroom was thats right laughed trotter ed told im there was a river a mile and a alf from ere an that was the only bathroom e knowed one gets used to that sort of thing eh reg said marsh goodnaturedly rather if i saw a proper bathroom now it would only make me feel nervous i knew a couple of englishmen out in british columbia broke in taylor who were bathing and the only other people around were indians the first two years they were there they wouldnt have anything to do with the indians because they were so dirty after that the indians wouldnt have anything to do with them he pointed this delectable anecdote by holding his nose what a disgusting story said nora dyou think so i rather like it you would now dont start quarreling you two and on franks last day nora gave her brother a quick glance it was on the tip of her tongue to ask what he meant by franks last day but seeing that taylor was watching her with an amused smile she held her tongue getting up she began clearing away the table hornby ramming the tobacco into his pipe went over to the corner by the stove where gertie was scalding out her large dishpan and tried to interest her in the number of logs he had split since breakfast without conspicuous success trotter stood looking out of the window while marsh stretched himself lazily in one of the rocking chairs with a sigh of content things were beginning to shake down a little better there had been a time yesterday when he feared that everything was off he knew noras temper of old and he knew his wifes jealous fear of her criticism it would take some rubbing to wear off the sharp corners but things were coming out all right after all theyd soon be working together like a wellbroken team gertie had been nasty about the bread but apparently everything was patched up and with frank once gone and the new chap a man of the trotter type who would never obtrude himself he foresaw that everything would run on wheels an idea dear to his peaceloving soul not that he was not sorry to lose frank in the first place he liked him and then he was a good steady hardworking fellow one of the kind you didnt have to stand over but naturally he wanted to get back to his own place now that he had saved up a bit every man liked being his own master taylor alone had remained at his place at the table nora had cleared away everything except the dishes at his place she never went near him if she could avoid it i guess im in your way he said rising not more than usual thank you taylor gave a little laugh i guess youll not be sorry to see the last of me nora paused in her work and leaning on the table with both hands looked him steadily in the face i cant honestly say that it makes the least difference to me whether you go or stay she said coldly when does your train go frank asked hornby from his corner halfpast three ill be starting from here in about an hour reg can go over with you and drive the rig back again said marsh all right ill go and dress myself in a bit i guess youll be glad to get back to your own place said gertie warmly she had always liked frank taylor a man who worked hard and earned his money she did not begrudge him a cent of it nor the pleasure he had in the thought of getting back to his own place he was the kind of man who should set up for himself well i guess ill not be sorry he sat looking out of the window with a sort of dreamy air as if seeing far to the westward his own land so that was the reason for his going he had a place of his own he was only a hired man for the moment eddie had told her that a man frequently had to hire out after a succession of bad seasons what of it his keeping it to himself was the crowning impertinence chapter viii ill do the washing nora and you can dry said gertie in that peculiar tone which nora had learned to recognize as the preface to something disagreeable all right ive noticed the things arent half clean when i leave them to you to do im sorry why didnt you tell me i suppose yon never did the washingup in england too grand but nora was not to be ruffled just now her resentment against taylor who was sitting watching her as if he read her thoughts she often wondered how much of them he did read made anything gertie said seem momentarily unimportant i dont suppose anyone would wash up if they could help it its not very amusing you always want to be amused no but i want to be happy well said gertie sharply youve got a roof over your head and a comfortable bed to sleep in three good meals a day and plenty to do thats all anybody wants to make them happy i guess oh lord exclaimed reggie from his corner well said gertie turning sharply on him if you dont like canada why did you come out you dont suppose said hornby rising slowly to his feet id have let them send me if id have known what i was in for do you not much up at five in the morning and working about the place like a navvy till your back feels as if it ud break and then back again in the afternoon and the same thing day after day what was the good of sending me to harrow and oxford if thats what ive got to do all my life there was a tragic dignity in his tone which for the moment held even gertie silent it was her husband who answered him and gerties jealous ear detected a certain wistfulness in his voice youll get used to it soon enough reg it is a bit hard at first ill admit but when you get your foot in you wouldnt change it for any other life this isnt a country for a man to go to sleep in and wait for something to turn up said gertie aggressively i wouldnt go back to england now not for nothing said trotter stung to an unusual burst of eloquence england eighteen bob a week thats what i earned and no prospects out of work five months in the year what did you do in england asked nora curiously bricklayer miss you neednt call her miss said gertie heatedly you call me gertie dont you well her names nora what with strikes and bad times went on trotter unheeding you never knew where you was and the foreman always bullying you i dont know what all i ad about enough of it i can tell you ive never been out of work since the day i landed ive ad as much to eat as i wanted and im saving money in this country everybodys as good as everybody else if not better said nora dryly in two years i shall be able to set up for myself why theres old man thompson up at pratt he started as a bricklayer same as i come from yorkshire he did hes got seven thousand dollars in the bank now believe me you fellows who come out now have a much softer thing of it than i did when i first came in those days they wouldnt have an englishman theyd have a galician rather in winnipeg when they advertised in the paper for labor youd see often as not no english need apply well it was their own fault stormed gertie they wouldnt work or anything they just soaked it was their own fault right enough this was the dumping ground for all the idlers drunkards and scallywags in england they had the delusion over there that if a man was too big a rotter to do anything at all at home hed only got to be sent out here and hed make a fortune i guess things aint as bad as that now spoke up taylor they send us a different class it takes an englishman two years longer than anybody else to get the hang of things but when once he tumbles to it hes better than any of them ah well said marsh knocking the ashes out of his pipe i guess nowadays everyones glad to see the englishman make good when i nearly smashed up three years ago i had no end of offers of help how did you nearly smash up asked hornby interestedly oh i had a run of bad luck one year the crop was frosted and the next year i was hailed out it wants a good deal of capital to stand up against that thats what happened to me said taylor i was hailed out and i hadnt got any capital so i just had to hire out he turned suddenly to nora if it hadnt been for that hail storm you wouldnt have had the pleasure of makin my acquaintance how hollow and empty life would have been without that she said ironically i wonder you didnt just quit and start out calgary way put in gertie well said taylor slowly it was this way id put in two years on my homestead and done a lot of clearing it seemed kind of silly to lose my rights after all that then too when youve been hailed out once the chances are it wont happen again for some years that is and by that time i ought to have a bit put by what sort of house have you got asked nora well it aint what you might call a palace but its large enough for two thinking of marrying frank asked marsh well i guess its kind of lonesome on a farm without a woman but its not so easy to find a wife when youre just starting on your own canadian girls think twice before taking a farmer they know something i guess said gertie grimly you took me gertie laughed her husband not because i wanted to you can be sure of that i dont know how you got round me i wonder i guess it was because you was kind of helpless and i didnt know what youd do without me i guess it was love and you couldnt help yourself gertie stopped her work long enough to make a little grimacing protest im thinking of going to one of them employment agencies when i get to winnipeg said taylor moving his chair so that he could watch noras face and looking the girls over like sheep said nora scornfully i dont know anything about sheep ive never had to do with sheep and may i ask do you think that you know anything about women i guess i can tell if theyre strong and willing and so long as they aint cockeyed i dont mind taking the rest on trust and what inducement is there for a girl to have you thats why he wants to catch em young when theyre just landed and dont know much laughed trotter uproariously ive got my quartersection went on the imperturbable frank quite undisturbed by the laughter caused by trotters sally a good hundred and sixty acres with seventy of it cleared and ive got a shack that i built myself thats something aint it youve got a home to offer and enough to eat and drink a girl can get that anywhere why im told theyre simply begging for service yees but you see some girls like getting married theres something in the word that appeals to them you seem to think that a girl would jump at the chance of marrying you said nora with rising temper she might do worse i must say i think you flatter yourself oh i dont know i know my job and there aint too many as can say that ive got brains what makes you think so well i can see youre no fool gertie chuckled with amusement he certainly put one over on you then nora because youve got no use for me theres no saying but what others may have i forgot that theres no accounting for tastes i can try cant i wishing to escape any further conversation with the object of her detestation and seeing her opportunity now that the dishes were washed nora started to empty the dishpan in the sink in the pantry but gertie who divined her motive and wished the sport to continue forestalled her ill do it she said you finish wiping the dishes its very wise of you to go to an agency said nora in answer to his last question a girls more likely to marry you when shes only seen you once than when shes seen you often it seems to make you quite mad the thought of me marrying with a wink at the others you wouldnt talk about it like that unless you looked down upon women oh how i pity the poor wretched creature who becomes your wife oh i guess she wont have such a bad time when ive broken her in to my ways and are you under the impression that you can do that yep youre not expecting that therell be much love lost between you and the girl whom you you honor with your choice whats love got to do with it asked taylor in affected surprise its a business undertaking what noras eyes were dark with indignation and anger none at all i give her board and lodging and the charm of my society and in return shes got to cook and bake and wash and keep the shack clean and tidy and if she can do that ill not be particular what she looks like so long as shes not cockeyed reggie reminded him no i draw the line at that i beg your pardon said nora with bitter irony i didnt know it was a general servant you wanted you spend a dollar and a half on a marriage license and then you dont have to pay any wages its a good investment for the first time she seemed to have pierced the enemys armor youve got a sharp tongue in your head for a girl nora please dont call me nora dont be so silly nora said her brother with a trace of irritation its the custom of the country why they all call me ed i dont care what the custom of the country is im not going to be called nora by the hired man dont you bother ed said frank apparently once more restored to his normal placidity ill call her miss marsh if she likes it better but nora was not to be pacified he wouldnt have dared take such a liberty with her had he not been on the eve of going away for good she told herself it was a last shot from a retreating enemy well and good he should hear if for the last time what she thought of him i should like to see you married to someone whod give you what you deserved id like to see your pride humbled you think yourself very high and mighty dont you id like to see a woman take you by the heartstrings and wring them till you screamed with pain oh nora how violent you are said ed youre overbearing supercilious and egotistic went on nora bitingly im not sure as i know what them long words means but i guess they aint exactly complimentary i guess they aint she mimicked im sorry for that taylor straightened himself a little in his chair his blue eyes seemed to have caught a little of the light from noras i was thinking of offering you the position before i went to the employment agency how dare you speak to me like that dont fly into a temper nora said ed while he didnt blame frank he wished he had not made that last speech why didnt he go and get ready for town here was nora all upset again just as things had calmed down a bit hes got no right to say impudent things to me dont you see hes only having a joke with you he said soothingly he shouldnt joke hes got no sense of humor she made a furious gesture and the cup she was in the act of wiping flew out of her hand crashing in a thousand pieces on the floor just as gertie returned butter fingers im so sorry said nora in a colorless tone she was raging inwardly at having allowed that beast of a man to put her in such a temper why couldnt she control herself how undignified to bandy words with a person she so despised it was hardly the moment for gertie to take her to task for carelessness but gertie was not the person to consider other moods than her own you clumsy thing youre always doing something wrong oh dont worry ill pay for it who wants you to pay for it do you think i cant afford to pay for a miserable cup you might say youre sorry thats all i want you to do i said i was sorry no you didnt i heard her gertie broke in ed she said she was sorry as if she was doing me a favor said gertie turning furiously on the wouldbe peacemaker you dont expect me to go down on my knees to you do you the cups worth twopence it isnt the value im thinking about its the carelessness its only the third thing ive broken since ive been here if nora had been in a calmer mood herself she would not have been so stupid as to attempt to palliate her offense her offer of replacing the miserable cup only added fuel to the flame of gerties resentment you cant do anything she stormed youre more helpless than a child of six youre all the same all of you youre not going to abuse the whole british nation because ive broken a cup worth twopence are you and the airs you put on condescending isnt the word its enough to try the patience of a saint oh shut up said marsh he went over to his wife and laid a hand on her shoulder she shook him off impatiently youve never done a stroke of work in your life and you come here and think you can teach me everything i dont know about that said nora in a voice which by comparison with gerties seemed low but which was nevertheless perfectly audible to every person in the room i dont know about that but i think i can teach you manners if she had lashed the other woman across the face with a whip she couldnt have cut more deeply she knew that and was glad gerties face turned gray how dare you say that how dare you you come here and i give you a home you sleep in my blankets and you eat my food and then you insult me she burst into a passion of angry tears now then gertie dont cry dont be so silly said her husband as he might have spoken to an angry child oh leave me alone she flashed back at him of course you take her part you would its nothing to you that i have made a slave of myself for you for three whole years as soon as she comes along and plays the lady she rushed from the room after a moment ed followed after her there was an awkward pause nora stood leaning against the table swinging the dishcloth in her hand a smile of malicious triumph on her face gertie had tried it on once too often but she had shown her that one could go too far she would think twice before she attempted to bully her again especially before other people she stooped down and began to gather up the broken pieces of earthenware scattered about her feet her movement broke the spell which had held the three men paralyzed as men always are in the presence of quarreling women i reckon i might be cleaning myself said taylor rising from his chair times getting on youre coming ben yes im coming i suppose youll take the mare yep thats what ed said this morning they went out toward the stables without a word to nora well are you enjoying the land of promise as much as you said that i should hornby asked with a smile weve both made our beds i suppose we must lie in them said nora shaking the broken pieces out of her apron into a basket that stood in the corner do you remember that afternoon at miss wickhams when i came for the letter to your brother i hadnt much intention of coming to canada then myself well i dont mind telling you that i mean to get back to england the very first opportunity that comes he said pacing up and down the floor im willing to give away my share of the white mans burden with a package of chewing gum you prefer the effete east smiled nora putting a couple of irons on the stove rather give me the degrading influence of a decadent civilization every time your father will be pleased to see you wont he i dont think of course i was a damned fool ever to leave winnipeg i understand you didnt until you had to say said hornby pausing in his walk i want to tell you your brother behaved like a perfect brick i sent him your letter and told him i was up against it dyou know i hadnt a bob i was jolly glad to earn half a dollar digging a pit in a mans garden bit thick you know i can see you laughed nora your brother sent me the fare to come on here and told me i could do the chores i didnt know what they were i soon found it was doing all the jobs it wasnt anybody elses job to do and they call it gods own country i think youre falling into the ways of the country very well however retorted nora as she struggled across to the table with the heavy ironingboard do you what makes you think that you can stand there and smoke your pipe and watch me carry the ironingboard about i beg your pardon did you want me to help you never mind it would remind me of home i suppose i shall have to stick it out at least a year unless i can humbug the mater into sending me enough money to get back home with she wont send you a penny if shes wise oh come now wouldnt you chuck it if you could and acknowledge myself beaten said nora with a flash of spirit you dont know she went on after ironing busily a moment what i went through before i came here i tried to get another position as ladys companion i hung about the agents offices i answered advertisements two people offered to take me one without any salary the other at ten shillings a week and my lunch i if you please was to find myself in board lodging and clothes on that magnificent sum that settled me i wrote eddie and said i was coming when id paid my fare i had eight pounds in the world after ten years with miss wickham when he met me at the station at dyer depot you forget my whole fortune consisted of seven dollars and thirtyfive cents i think it was thirtyfive what about that wood youre splitting reg said a voice from the doorway eddie came in fumbling nervously in his pockets he detested scenes and had some reason to think that he was having more than his share of them in the last few days has anyone seen my tobacco oh here it is he said taking his pouch from his pocket come reg youd better be getting on with it oh lord is there no rest for the wicked exclaimed hornby as he lounged lazily to the door dont hurry yourself will you brilliant sarcasm is just flying about this house today was his parting shot as he banged the door behind him chapter ix nora understood perfectly that her brother had been forced to take a stand as a result of this last quarrel with gertie well she was glad of it things certainly could not go on in this way forever of course he would have to make a show at least of taking his wifes part but equally of course he would understand her position perfectly however much his new life and his long absence from england might have changed him at bottom their points of view were still the same he and she so to speak spoke a common language she and gertie did not gertie had probably been pouring out her accumulation of grievances to him for the last half hour now it was her turn she would show that she was as always more than ready to meet gertie halfway it would be his affair to see that her advances were received in better part in future than they had been she went on busily with her ironing waiting for him to begin but eddie seemed to experience a certain embarrassment in coming to the subject while she took article after article from the clothesbasket at her side he wandered about the room aimlessly puffing at a pipe which seemed never to stay lighted illustration married though secretly enemies thats the toughest nut ive ever been set to crack he said at length pointing his pipestem after the vanished hornby why on earth did you give him a letter to me he asked me to i couldnt very well say no i cant make out what people are up to in the old country they think that if a man is too big a rotter to do anything at all in england theyve only got to send him out here and hell make a fortune he may improve i hope so look here nora youve thoroughly upset gertie shes very easily upset isnt she its only since you came that things havent gone right we never used to have scenes so you blame me i came prepared to like her and help her she met all my advances with suspicion she thinks yon look down on her you ought to remember that she never had your opportunities shes earned her own living from the time she was thirteen you cant expect in her the refinements of a woman whos led the protected life you have now eddie i havent said a word that could be turned into the least suggestion of disapproval of anything she did my dear your whole manner has expressed disapproval you wont do things in the way we do them after all the way you lived in tunbridge wells isnt the only way people can live our ways suit us and when you live amongst us you must adopt them shes never given me a chance to learn them said nora obstinately she treated me with suspicion and enmity the very first day i came here when she sneered at me because i talked of a station instead of a depot of course i went on talking of a station what do you think im made of because i prefer to drink water with my meals instead of your strong tea she says im putting on airs marsh made a pleading gesture why cant you humor her you see youve got to take the blame for all the english people who came here in the past and were lazy worthless and supercilious they called us colonials and turned up their noses at us what do you expect us to do say thank you very much sir we know were not worthy to black your boots dont bother to work itll be a pleasure for us to give you money its no good blinking the fact there was a great prejudice against the english but its giving way now and every sensible man and woman who comes out can do something to destroy it all i can say said nora going over to the stove to change her iron is if youre tired of having me here i can go back to winnipeg i shant have any difficulty in finding something to do good lord i dont want you to go i like having you here its its company for gertie and jobs arent so easy to find as you think especially now the winters coming on everyone wants a job in the city what do you want me to do i want you to make the best of things and meet her halfway you must make allowances for her even if you think her unreasonable its gertie youve got to spend most of your time with he was so manifestly distressed and as he hadnt been so hard on her as she had expected and in her own heart felt that she deserved nora softened at once ill have a try thats a good girl and i think you ought to apologize to her for what you said just now i said nora aflame at once ive got nothing to apologize for she drove me to distraction there was a moments pause while eddie softly damned the pipe he had forgotten to fill for not keeping lighted she says she wont speak to you again unless you beg her pardon really does she look upon that as a great hardship my dear were twelve miles from the nearest store were thrown upon each other for the entire winter last year there was a bad blizzard and we didnt see a soul outside the farm for six weeks unless we learn to put up with one anothers whims life becomes a perfect hell nora stopped her work and set down her iron you can go on talking all night eddie ill never apologize time after time when she sneered at me till my blood boiled ive kept my temper she deserved ten times more than i said do you think im going to knuckle under to a woman like that remember shes my wife nora why didnt you marry a lady what the dickens do you think is the use of being a lady out here youve degenerated since you left england now look here my dear ill just tell you what gertie did for me she was a waitress in winnipeg at the minnedosa hotel and she was making money she knew what the life was on a farm much harder than anything shed been used to in the city but she accepted all the hardship of it and the monotony of it because because she loved me she thought it a good match you were a gentleman fiddledidee she had the chance of much better men than me and when such men as frank taylor no doubt and when i lost my harvest two years running do you know what she did she went back to the hotel in winnipeg for the winter so as to carry things on till the next harvest and at the end of the winter she gave me every cent shed earned to pay the interest of my mortgage and the installments on the machinery nora had been more moved by this recital than she would have cared to confess she turned away her head to hide that her eyes had filled with tears after all a woman who could show such devotion as that and to her brother yes she would try again very well ill apologize but leave me alone with her i i dont think i could do it even before you eddie fine thats a good girl ill go and tell her nora felt repaid in advance for any sacrifice to her pride as he beamed on her all the look of worriment gone she was once more busy at her ironingboard bending low over her work to hide her confusion when he returned with gertie a glance at her sisterinlaw told her that there was to be no unbending in that quarter until she had made proper atonement there was little conciliatory about that sullen face however she made an effort to speak lightly until once eddie had taken his departure she could make her apology ive been getting on famously with the ironing have you this is one of the few things i can do all right any child can iron well ill be going down to the shed said her brother uneasily what for said gertie quickly i want to see about mending that door it hasnt been closing right i thought nora had something to say to me so she has thats what im going to leaves you alone for i like that she insults me before everybody and then when shes going to apologize its got to be private no thank you what do you mean gertie asked nora you sent ed in to tell me you was goin to apologize for what youd said didnt you and im ready to for peace and quietness well what you said was before the men and its before the men you must say youre sorry how can you ask me to do such a thing cried nora indignantly dont be rough on her gertie pleaded her husband no one likes apologizing people who dont like apologizing should keep a better lookout on their tongue it cant do you any good to make her eat humble pie before the men perhaps it wont do me any good but itll do her good gertie dont be cruel im sorry if i lost my temper just now and said anything that hurt you but please dont make me humiliate myself before the others ive made up my mind said gertie folding her arms across her breast so its no good talking dont you see that its bad enough to have to beg your pardon before eddie good lord said gertie irritably why cant you call him ed like the rest of us eddie sounds so sappy ive called him eddie all my life its what our mother called him said nora sadly oh its all of a piece you do everything you can to make yourself different from all of us she stalked over to the window and stood with folded arms looking out toward the woodpile on which reggie was seated it is to be presumed having a moments respite after his arduous labors no i dont pleaded nora at least i dont mean to why wont you give me any credit for trying to do my best to please you thats neither here nor there she suddenly wheeled about facing them both go and fetch the men ed and then ill hear what shes got to say no i wont i wont i wont cried nora furiously you drive me too far you wont beg my pardon demanded gertie threateningly if she wished to drive nora beside herself she accomplished her purpose i said i could teach you manners she gave a hysterical laugh i made a mistake i couldnt teach you manners for one cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear shut up nora said her brother sharply now you must make her ed said gertie grimly he replied with a despairing gesture im sick to death of the pair of you im your wife and im going to be mistress of this house my house its horrible to make her eat humble pie before three strange men youve no right to ask her to do a thing like that are you taking her part demanded gertie her voice rising in fury whats come over you since she came here youre not the same to me as you used to be why did she come here and get between us i havent changed havent i been a good wife to you have you ever had any complaint to make of me you know perfectly well i havent as soon as your precious sister comes along you let me be insulted you dont say a word to defend me darling said her husband with grim humor youve said a good many to defend yourself but gertie was not to be reached by humor grim or otherwise im sick and tired of being put upon you must choose between us she said with an air of finality what on earth do you mean if you dont make her apologize right now before the hired men im quit of you i cant make her apologize if she wont then let her quit oh i wish i could i wish to god i could said nora wildly you know she cant do that said marsh roughly theres nowhere she can go ive offered her a home you were quite willing when i suggested having her here i was willing because i thought shed make herself useful we cant afford to feed folks who dont earn their keep we have to work for our money we do i didnt know you grudged me the little i eat said nora bitterly i wonder if i should begrudge it to you if i were in your place look here its no good talking im not going to turn her out as long as she wants a home the farms open to her and shes welcome to everything ive got then you choose her demanded gertie choose her i dont know what youre talking about easygoing as he was he was beginning to show signs of irritation i said youd got to choose between us very well let her stay i earned my own living before and i can earn it again im going dont talk such nonsense said marsh violently you think i dont mean it dyou think im going to stay here and be put upon why should i dont you love me any more havent i shown that i love you have you forgotten ed weve gone through so much together darling he said huskily yes we have that she said in a softened tone wont you forgive her for for my sake gerties face hardened once more no i cant youre a man you dont understand if she wont apologize either she must go or i shall i cant lose you gertie what should i do without you i guess you know me well enough by now when i say a thing i do it eddie nora had buried her face in her hands he looked at her a moment without speaking shes my wife after all if it werent for her i should be hiring out now at forty dollars a month nora lifted her face for a long moment brother and sister exchange a sad regard very well she said huskily ill do what you want he made one last appeal you do insist on it gertie of course i do ill go and call the men he looked vacantly about the room searching for his hat frank taylor neednt come need he asked nora timidly why not hes going away almost immediately it cant matter about him surely then why are you so particular about it the others are english she knew she had made an unfortunate speech the moment the words had left her lips and hastened to modify it hell like to see me humiliated he looks upon women as dirt hes oh i dont know but not before him itll do you a world of good to be taken down a peg or two my lady oh how heartless how cruel go on ed i want to get on with my work why do you humiliate me like this asked nora after the door had closed on her brother gertie had seated herself very erect and judicial in one of the rocking chairs you came here and thought you knew everything i guess but you didnt know who youd got to deal with i was a stranger and homeless if youd had any kindness you wouldnt have treated me so i wanted to be fond of you you scoffed gertie you despised me before you ever saw me nora made a despairing gesture even now the men might be on the way but she had a more unselfish motive for wishing to placate gertie anything rather than bring that look of pain she had seen for the first time that day into her brothers eyes she staked everything on one last appeal oh gertie cant we be friends cant we let bygones be bygones and start afresh we both love eddie ed i mean hes your husband and hes the only relation i have in the world wont you let me be a real sister to you its rather late to say all that now but its not too late is it nora went on eagerly i dont know what i do that irritates you so i can see how competent you are and i admire you so much i know how splendid youve been with eddie how youve stuck to him through thick and thin youve done everything for him gertie struck her hands violently together and sprang from her chair oh dont go on patronizing me i shall go crazy patronizing you you talk to me as if i were a naughty child you might be a school teacher nora wrung her hands it seems perfectly hopeless even when youre begging my pardon gertie went on you put on airs you ask me to forgive you as if you was doing me a favor i must have a most unfortunate manner nora laughed hysterically dont you dare laugh at me said gertie furiously dont make yourself ridiculous then did you think i would ever forget what you wrote to ed before i married him what i wrote i dont know what you mean oh dont you you told him it would be a disgrace if he married me he was a gentleman and i oh you spread yourself out and he showed you that letter said nora slowly now i understand she added to herself still she went on looking gertie directly in the face i had a perfect right to try and prevent the marriage before it took place but after it happened i only wanted to make the best of it if you had this grudge against me why did you let me come here oh said gertie moodily ed wanted it and it was lonely enough sometimes with the men away all day and no one to say a word to but i cant bear it she almost screamed when ed talks to you about the old country and all the people i dont know anything about then you are jealous its my house and im mistress here i wont be put upon what did you want to come here for upsetting everybody till you came i never had a word with ed oh i hate you i hate you she finished in a sort of ecstasy gertie youve given me my chance said gertie with set teeth im going to take it im going to take you down a peg or two young woman youre doing all you can to drive me away from here you dont think its any very wonderful thing to have you do you you talk of getting a job she went on scornfully you you couldnt get one i know something about that my girl you what can you do nothing suddenly from outside they heard frank taylors laugh nora winced as if she had been struck gerties face was distorted with an evil smile she seated herself once more in the rocking chair and folded her arms across her heaving breast here they come now take your punishment she said harshly chapter x nora could never after think of what followed with any feeling of reality so far as her personal participation in the scene was concerned it was like watching a play in which one is interested without being in any degree emotionally stirred she saw gertie erect and stern in her big chair she saw herself standing behind the ironingboard as if at a bar of justice her hands resting loosely upon it and she saw the door open to admit her brother followed by taylor and trotter noted that the former had discarded the familiar overalls and was wearing a sort of peajacket with a fur collar and that her brothers face was once more sad and a little stern she had been obliged to press her handkerchief to her mouth to hide the crooked smile that the thought he is the executioner had brought to her lips then the figures which were gertie and her brother had exchanged some words wheres hornby hes just coming do they know what theyre here for no i didnt tell them then the figure which was reggie had come in with some laughing remark about being torn away from his work but stopping so suddenly in the midst of his laughter at the sight of gerties face that it was comical once more she had had to press her handkerchief to her lips and all the time she knew that this nora whom she seemed to be watching had flushed a cruel red clear to her temples and that a funny little pulse was beating oh so fast so fast way up by her cheekbone it couldnt have been her heart her heart had never gone as fast as that then she had heard gertie say nora insulted me a while ago before all of you and i guess she wants to apologize and then frank had said if you told me it was that ed you wanted me to come here for i reckon id have told you to go to hell why it must have been she who had asked the question although she was not conscious that her lips had moved and the voice did not seem like her own her own voice was rather deep this voice was curiously thin and high ive got other things to do besides bothering my head about womens quarrels oh i beg your pardon still in the same high tone i thought it might be some kindly feeling in you go on nora were waiting came the voice from the big chair sourdough thats what those coats such as frank had on were called she had been wondering all the time what the name was it was only the other day that gertie had used the word in saying that she wished eddie no ed could afford a new one what a ridiculous name for a garment im sorry i was rude to you gertie i apologize to you for what i said if theres nothing more to be said wed better go back to our work while her brother was speaking to his wife frank had taken a step forward somehow the smile on his face had lost all of its ordinary mockery you didnt find that very easy to say i reckon im quite satisfied and then gertie had dared to add let this be a lesson to you my girl that was the last straw the men had turned to go in a flash she had made up her mind her brothers house was no longer possible gertie had in a moment of passion confessed that she hated her had always hated her in her secret heart ever since she had read that protesting letter what daily humiliations would she not have to endure now that she had matched her strength against gertie and lost it meant one long crucifixion of all pride and selfrespect no it was not to be borne there was one avenue of escape open and only one he had said that he was willing to offer a home to a woman who was willing to assume her share of the burden of making one it was even possible that he would be both kind and considerate no matter how many mistakes she made at first to a woman who tried to learn of one thing she was certain he would know how to see that his wife was treated with respect by all the world for the moment her bleeding pride cried to her that that was the only thing in life that was absolutely necessary nothing else mattered frank will you wait a minute sure what can i do for you ive understood that im not wanted here im in the way you said just now you wanted a woman to cook and bake for you wash and mend your clothes and keep your shack clean and tidy will i do sure nora her brother was shaking her by the shoulder im afraid youll have to marry me i guess it would be more respectable nora you cant mean it youre in a temper see here frank you mustnt pay any attention to her shameless thats what i call it that was gertie he wants a woman to look after him he practically proposed to me half an hour ago didnt you practically nora youve been like cat and dog with frank ever since you came my dear you dont know what youre in for if hes willing to risk it i am it aint an easy life youre coming to this farm is a palace compared with my shack im not wanted here and you say you want me if youll take me ill come for what seemed an interminable moment he had looked at her with more gravity than she had ever seen in his face ill take you all right when will you be ready will an hour do for you an hour youre in a great hurry she had had a funny sensation that her knees were giving way she had never fainted in her life was she going to faint now before them all before gertie never somehow she must get out of the room and be alone a minute why yes then we can catch the threethirty into winnipeg you can go to the y w c a for the night and well be buckled up in the morning you meant it didnt you you werent just saying it as a bluff i shall be ready in an hour she had pushed eddie gently aside and without a glance at anyone had walked steadily from the room once seated on the side of the bed in the room that had been hers she had been seized with a chill so violent that her teeth had chattered in her head to prevent anyone who might follow her from hearing them and it was probable that her brother might come for a final remonstrance it was even conceivable that gertie herself might be sorry for what she had done but no it was she who had said she was shameless she got up and locked her door and then threw herself full length on the little bed and crammed the corner of the pillow into her mouth perhaps she was going to die she had never really been ill in her life and the violence of the chill frightened her in her present overwrought state the thought of death was not disquieting but supposing she was only going to be very ill with some long and tedious illness that would make her a care and a burden for weeks she recalled the unremitting care which she had had to give miss wickham and pictured gerties grudging ministrations at her sickbed anything rather than that she must manage to get to winnipeg once away from the house nothing mattered but after a few moments the violence of the chill which was of course purely nervous in its origin subsided perceptibly nora rose and began to busy herself with her packing fortunately her wardrobe was small she had no idea how long she had been lying on the bed she had just folded the last garment and was about to close the lid of her trunk when there came a knock at the door who is it its me said franks voice the team is at the door are you ready for reply nora threw open the door and pointed to her box i have only to put on my hat will you be good enough to fasten that for me here is the key while he knelt on the floor locking and strapping it she gave a careful look at herself in the mirror while putting on her hat she congratulated herself that she had not been crying aside from the fact that she looked pale and tired there was nothing in her face to suggest that she had had a crisis of the nerves certainly no look of defeat for gertie to gloat over would they all be there to witness her retreat well let them no one could say that she had not gone out with flying colors she turned with a smile to meet franks gaze thats right he said approvingly you look fine say he added im afraid ill have to have reggie up to give me a lift with this trunk of yours i dont know what you can have in it unless its a stove and weve got one at home already itll be all right once i get it on my back he had taken just the right tone his easy reference to home and to their common possession of even so humble a piece of furniture as a stove as if they were an old married couple returning home after paying a visit had a restorative effect on nerves still a little jangly that was the only way to look at it in a thoroughly commonplace manner as he had said himself it was a business undertaking she gave a perfectly natural little laugh no i havent a stove only a few books i didnt realize how heavy they were im sorry im not he said heartily you can read to me evenings i guess a little more booklearningll polish me up a bit and ill be right glad of the chance youre not afraid to stand at the horses heads are you while reg runs up here no of course not she could hear gertie in the pantry as she crossed the livingroom she was grateful to her for not coming out to make any show of leavetaking having sent reggie on his errand she stood stroking the horses soft noses while waiting for the men to return just as they reached the door eddie came slowly over to her from the barn his face was haggard he looked older than she had ever seen him nora he said in a low tone i beg you before it is too late please dear she whispered her hand on his you only make it harder ill write eddie oh in a few days and tell you all about my new home she called gayly as frank having disposed of her trunk in the back of the wagon lifted her in her brother turned without a word to the others and went into the house as she felt herself for the second time in those arms the reaction came eddie eddie but strangled by sobs her voice hardly carried to the man on the seat in front of her as he sprang in frank gave the horses a flick with the whip the afternoon air was keen and the highspirited team needed no further urging they swung out of the farm gate at a pace that made reggie cling to the seat when he had them once more in hand taylor turned his head slightly all right back there he called without looking at her she managed a yes she had only just recovered her selfcontrol as they drove into winnipeg as they drew up in front of the principal hotel taylor turned the reins once more over to reggie and vaulting lightly from his seat held out his hand and helped her to alight youd better go into the ladies parlor for a minute or two im feeling generous and am going to blow reg to a parting drink ill come after you in a minute and take you to the y w c a very well here he called as she turned toward the door marked ladies entrance arent you going to say goodby to reg for a moment she almost lost her hardly regained selfcontrol to say goodby to reg was the final wrench she had known him in those immeasurably faroff days at home it was saying goodby to england she held out her hand without speaking goodby miss marsh he said warmly and good luck a quarter of an hour later taylor came to her in the stuffy little parlor of which she was the solitary tenant in silence they made their way to the building occupied by the y w c a you have money he asked as they reached the door plenty thanks do you want me to come in with you it isnt necessary what time shall i come for you tomorrow at whatever time you choose shall we say ten then or eleven might be better ive got to get the license you know and look up the parson very good at eleven good night nora good night frank noras first impulse on being shown to a room was to go at once to bed mind and body both cried out for rest but she remembered that she had eaten nothing since noon she would need all her strength for the morrow she supposed they would start at once for taylors farm after they were married good god since the world began had any woman ever trapped herself so completely as she had done but she must not think of that she had not the most remote idea where the farm was all she remembered to have heard was that it was west of winnipeg miles farther than her brothers one couldnt drive to it it was necessary to take the train but whether it was a days journey or a weeks journey she had never been interested enough to ask after all what could it possibly matter where it was the farther away from everybody and everything she had ever known the better the sound of a gong in the hall below recalled her thoughts to the matter of supper she went down to a bare little diningroom only partly filled and accepted silently the various dishes set before her all at one time she had never seen a dinner or supper they probably called it served in such a haphazard fashion even at gerties she smiled wanly at the thought that since the morning she no longer thought of it as her brothers but as gerties while such a thing as a dinner served in courses had probably never been heard of by anyone but reggie her brother and herself the few simple wellcooked dishes bore some relation to each other and the supply was always ample gertie was justly proud of her reputation as a good provider but here there was a sort of mockery of abundance dabs of vegetables sauces preserves meats both hot and cold in cheap little china dishes fairly elbowed each other for room it would have dulled a keener appetite than poor noras having managed to swallow a cup of weak tea and a piece of heavy bread she went once more to her room and sat down by the window which looked out on what she took to be one of the principal streets of the town tired as she still was she felt not the slightest inclination for sleep the thought of lying there wakeful in the dark filled her with terror for the first time in her life nora was frightened she pressed her face against the window to watch the infrequent passersby surely none of them could be as unhappy as she like a hideous refrain over and over in her head rang the words trapped trapped trapped by your own mad temper trapped at length unable to bear it any longer the now empty street offering no distraction she undressed and went to bed hoping for relief in sleep but sleep would not be wooed she tossed from side to side always hearing those maddening words trapped trapped trapped by your own mad temper trapped all sorts of impractical schemes tormented her feverish brain she would appeal to the manager of the place she was a woman she would understand she would do any work anything for her bare keep take care of the rooms wait on table anything then the thought came to her of how gertie would gloat to hear and she would be sure to do so things always got out that she was now doing her old work no she could not bear that perhaps if she started out very early she could get a position in some shop there must be plenty of shops in a place the size of winnipeg but what would she say when asked what experience she had had no that too seemed hopeless as a last resort she thought of throwing herself on taylors mercy she would explain to him that she had been mad with anger that she hadnt in the least realized what she was doing that her only thought had been to defy gertie in the hour of her triumph surely no man since the days of the cavemen would prize an unwilling wife she would humbly confess that she had used him and beg his pardon if necessary on her knees but what if he refused to release her from her promise and what if he did release her what then there still remained the unsolvable problem of what she was to do her brother had told her that positions in winnipeg during the winter months were impossible to get gertie had taunted her with the same fact she had less than six dollars in the world after she had paid her bill she would have little more than four it was hopeless trapped trapped trapped by your own mad temper trapped and then more plans each one kindling fresh hope in her heart only to have it extinguished like a torch thrown into a pool when they proved on analysis each to be more impracticable than its predecessor and then the refrain and then more plans it was a haggard and wearylooking bride that presented herself to the expectant bridegroom the next morning the great circles under her eyes told the story of a sleepless night but nothing in taylors manner betrayed that he noticed that she was looking otherwise than as usual while she was dressing nora had come to a final decision quite calmly and unemotionally she would explain the situation to him she would point out the impossibility the absurdity even of keeping an agreement entered into by one of the parties at least in hot blood and thoroughly repented of on later and saner reflection in the remote event of this unanswerable argument failing to move him she would appeal to his honor as a man not to hold her a woman to so unfair a bargain she had even prepared the wellbalanced sentences with which she would begin but as she stood with her cold hand in his warm one he forestalled her by exhibiting not without a certain boyish pride the marriage license and the plain gold band which was to bind her if these familiar and rather commonplace objects had been endowed with some evil magic they could not have deprived her of the power of speech more effectively without a protest she permitted herself to be led to the waiting carriage provided in honor of the occasion it seemed but a moment later that she found herself being warmly embraced by a motherly looking woman who it transpired was the wife of the clergyman who had just performed the ceremony from the parsonage they drove directly to the station chapter xi the journey had seemed endless it was already nightfall when they arrived at the town of prentice where they were to get off and drive some twelve miles farther to her new home and yet endless and unspeakably wearying as it was her heart contracted to find that it was at an end she realized now how comfortable even luxurious her trip across the continent had been by comparison then she had traveled in a pullman this she learned was called a daycoach her husband did everything in his power to mitigate the rigors of the trip he made a pillow for her with his coat bought her fruits candies and magazines from the trainboy until she protested best of all he divined and respected her disinclination for conversation at intervals during the day he left her to go into the smokingcar to enjoy his pipe the view from the window was on the whole rather monotonous but it would have had to be varied indeed to match the mental pictures that noras flying thoughts conjured up for her the dead level of her life at tunbridge wells had been a curious preparation for the violent changes of the last few months how often when walking in the oldworld garden with miss wickham she had had the sensation of stifling oppressed by those vinecovered walls and inwardly had likened herself to a prisoner there were no walls now to confine her clear away to the sunset it was open and yet she was more of a prisoner than she had ever been and now she wore a fetter albeit of gold on her hand it had been her habit to think of herself with pity as friendless in those days forgetful of the good doctor and his wife agnes pringle and even mr wynne not to speak of her humbler friends the gardeners wife and children and the good kate well she was being punished for it now it would be hard indeed to imagine a more friendless condition than hers rushing onward farther and farther into the wilderness to make for herself a home miles from any human habitation no woman in all probability to turn to in case of need and crowning loneliness having ever at her side a man with whom she had been on terms of open enmity up to a few short hours before from time to time she stole furtive glances at him as he sat at her side and once when he had put his head back against the seat and pulled his broadbrimmed hat over his eyes and was seemingly asleep she turned her head and gave him a long appraising look how big and strong and selfreliant he was he was just the type of man who would go out into the wilderness and conquer it and although she had scoffed at his statement when he made it she knew that he had brains yes although his lack of education and refinement must often touch her on the raw he was a man whom any woman could respect in her heart and when they clashed as clash they must until she had tamed him a little she would need every weapon in her womans arsenal to save her from utter route she realized that but then these big rough men were always the first to respond to any appeal to their natural chivalry if she found herself being worsted there was always that to fall back upon if from some other world miss wickham could see her how she must be smiling nora herself smiled at the thought and at the thought of agnes pringles outraged astonishment if she were to meet her husband now before she had toned him down as she meant to do she recalled the chill finality of her friends tone when in animadverting on the doctors unfortunate assistant she had said but my dear of course it would be impossible to marry anyone who wasnt a gentleman if by some arabian nights trick she could suddenly transport herself and the sleeping frank to miss pringles side she felt that that excellent ladys astonishment at seeing her descend from the magic carpet would be as nothing in comparison to her astonishment in being presented to noras husband her mind had grown accustomed already to thinking of him as her husband not as yet to thinking of herself as his wife at supper time they went into a car ahead where frank ate with his accustomed appetite and nora pecked daintily at the cold chicken and now they were at prentice for some minutes before arriving frank who had asked her a few moments before to change places with him had been looking anxiously out of the window his nose flattened against the glass as they drew up to the station platform he gave a shout good theres old man sharp luckily i remembered it was the day he generally drove over and wired him what for so that he could drive us home hes a near neighbor lives only about a mile beyond us hes married too so you wont be entirely without a woman to complain to about me i should hardly be likely to do that said nora stiffly bless your heart i know you wouldnt youre not that sort i hope shes not much like gertie gosh no a different breed of cats altogether well thats something to be thankful for this is mr sharp sid shake hands with mrs frank taylor it was the first time that she had heard herself called by her new name it came as a distinct and not altogether pleasant shock once again her husband lifted her in his strong arms to the back seat of the roughlooking wagon and saw to it that she was warmly wrapped up for although there was little or no snow to be seen at prentice the night air was sharply chill she moved over a little to make room for him at her side but without appearing to notice her action he jumped lightly onto the front seat beside his friend let em go sid everything all comfortable he asked turning to nora quite thanks throughout the long cold drive they exchanged no further word frank and sid seemed to have much to say to each other about their respective farms nora gathered from what she could hear that sharp had played the part of a good neighbor during her husbands enforced absence in having a general oversight of his house youll find the fences down in quite a few places i allowed to fix it myself when i had the spare time but when i heard that you was comin back so soon i just naturally let her go sure that was right itll give me something to do right at home i dont want to leave mrs taylor too much alone until she gets a little used to it shes always been used to a lot of company nora heard him say she smiled to herself in the darkness and felt a little warm feeling of gratitude she was right in her estimate this man would be tractable enough after all his attitude toward women which had formerly so enraged her was only on the surface an affectation assumed to annoy her when they were always quarreling how foolish she had been not to read him more accurately for the first time she felt a little return of selfconfidence she would bring this hazardous experiment to a successful conclusion after all it was really failure that she had most feared but her heart sank within her once more when at last they drew up in front of a long low cabin built of logs mr sharp had not overstated the dilapidated state of the fence it sagged in half a dozen places and one hinge of the gate was broken altogether it was as dreary a picture as one could well imagine the little cabin had the utterly forlorn look of a house that has long been unoccupied woa there stand still cant you said sharp tugging at the reins a tidy pull that last bit said frank trails very bad stand still you brute wait a minute mrs taylor i guess she wants to get home taylor vaulted lightly from his seat and without waiting to help nora ran up the path to the house as she stood up trying to disentangle herself from the heavy laprobe she could hear a key turn noisily in a lock with a jerk he threw the door wide open wait a bit and ill light the lamp if i can find where the hell its got to he called this shacks about two foot by three and im blamed if i can ever find a darned thing nora smiled to herself in the darkness she got down unassisted this time under the bright and starry sky she could see a long stretch of prairie fading away without a break into the darkness a long way off she thought she could distinguish a light but she could not be certain ill give you a hand with the trunk called sharp laboriously climbing out of the wagon woa there as the mare pawed restlessly on the ground ill come and help you if youll wait a bit come on in nora nora hunted round among the numerous parcels underneath the seat until she found a meshed bag containing some bread butter and other necessaries they had bought on the way to the station then she walked slowly up the path to her home she had the feeling that she was still a free agent as long as she remained outside once her foot had crossed the threshold it was like getting into an icecold bath she dreaded the plunge however it must be taken he was standing stockstill in the middle of the room as she reached the door his heavy brows drawn together im quite stiff after that long drive the moment the words were out of her mouth she wished to recall them this was no way to begin it was actually as if she had been trying to excuse herself for not coming more quickly when she was called his whole attitude of frowning impatience showed that he had expected her to come at the sound of his voice his face cleared at once are you cold he asked with a certain anxiety no not a bit i was so well wrapped up well its freezing pretty hard but you see its your first winter and you wont feel the cold like we do how odd said nora ill just bring some of the things in she had an odd feeling that she didnt want to be alone with him just now and said the first thing that entered her head dont touch the trunk its too heavy for you oh im as strong as a horse dont touch it i wont she laughed he brushed by her and went on out to the rig returning almost instantly with an arm full of parcels we could all do with a cup of tea just have a look at the stove it wont take two shakes to light a fire it seems hardly worth while its so late oh light the fire my girl and dont talk about it he said goodhumoredly on her knees before the stove with her face as flushed as if it were already glowing nora raked away at the ashes through the open doorway she could see her husband and mr sharp unfasten the trunk from the back of the wagon and start with it toward the house this trunk of yours aint what you might call light mrs taylor said sharp goodnaturedly as he stepped over the threshold you see it holds everything i own in the world said nora lightly i guess it dont do that laughed her husband since this morning you own a half share in a hundred and sixty acres of as good land as there is in the province of manitoba and a mighty good shack if i did build it all myself to say nothing of a husband retorted nora where do you want it put asked sharp it ud better go in the next room right away we dont want to be falling over it as they were carrying it in nora with a rather helpless air carried a couple of logs and a handful of newspapers over from the pile in the corner here youll never be able to light a fire with logs like that wheres that darned ax ill chop em for you i guess youll have plenty to do getting the shack tidy after a little searching he found the ax back of the woodpile and set himself to splitting the logs in the meantime sharp who had made another pilgrimage to the rig returned carrying his friends grip and gun now thats real good of you sid get any shooting down at dyer frank there was a rare lot of prairie chickens round but i didnt get out more than a couple of days well said sharp taking off his fur cap and scratching his head i guess ill be gettin back home now oh stay and have a cup of tea wont you do said nora seconding the invitation she had taken quite a fancy to this rough goodnatured man in spite of his straggly beard and unkempt appearance there was a vague suggestion of the soldier about him besides she had a vague feeling that she would like to postpone his departure as long as she could i hope you wont be offended if i say that i would take you for english she said smiling brightly on him youre right maam i am english and a soldier i was a noncommissioned officer in a regiment back home maam he said greatly pleased but why should i be offended nora and her husband exchanged glances its this way frank laughed gertie thats noras brothers wife down where ive been working aint very partial to the english i guess my wifes been rather fed up with her talk oh i see but thank you all the same and you too mrs taylor i dont think ill stay its getting late and the marell get cold put her in the shed no i think ill be toddling my missus says i was to give you her compliments mrs taylor and shell be round tomorrow to see if theres anything you want thats very kind of her thank you very much sid lives where you can see that light just about a mile from here nora explained frank mrs sharpll be able to help you a lot at first oh well weve been here for thirteen years and we know the ways of the country by now deprecated mr sharp noras about as green as a new dollar bill i guess i fear thats too true nora admitted smilingly theres a lot you cant be expected to know at first protested their neighbor ill say good night then and good luck well good night then sid if you wont stay and say it was real good of you to come and fetch us in the rig oh thats all right good night to you mrs taylor goodnight pulling his cap well down over his ears mr sharp took his departure in the silence they could hear him drive away nora went over to the stove again and made a pretense of examining the fire conscious all the time that her husband was looking at her intently i guess it must seem funny to you to hear him call you mrs taylor eh no he isnt the first person to do so the clergymans wife did you remember thats so how are you getting on with that fire all right i guess ill get some water ill only be a few minutes he took a pail and went out nora could hear him pumping down in the yard getting up hurriedly from her knees before the stove she took up the lamp and held it high above her head this untidy comfortless bedraggled room was now hers her home she would not have believed that any human habitation could be so hopelessly dreary the walls were not even sealed as at the brothers tacked here and there against the logs were pictures cut from illustrated papers unframed just as they were the furniture with the exception of the inevitable rockingchair worn and shabby from hard use had apparently been made by frank himself out of old packing boxes the table had been fashioned by the same hand out of similar materials on a shelf over the rusty stove stood a few battered pots and pans evidently the entire kitchen equipment there were two doors one by which she had entered the other leading supposedly into another room the one window was small and low even in this light she could see that a spider had spun a huge web across it in the dark corners of the room all sorts of objects seemed to be piled without any pretense of order she lowered the lamp and listened yes she could still hear the pump with a furtive guilty air she hurried to complete her examination before he should surprise her one of the corners contained a battered suitcase and a nondescript pile of old clothes the other was piled high with yellowing copies of what she saw was the winnipeg free press and a few old magazines the library she said bitterly and was surprised to find that she had spoken aloud insane people did that she had heard was she she ran over to a shelf that had escaped her notice and the illfitting lamp chimney rattled as she moved it was stacked high with the same empty syrup cans that at gerties did the duty of flowerpots but these held flour now quite mouldy and various other staple supplies all spoiled and useless she started to say the larder but remembering in time put her hand over her lips that she might only think it and now she had come to that other door she must see what was there having a look at the shack she gave a stifled scream and for a moment turned so pale that he hastily set down his pail and went over to her i guess youre all tuckered out he said kindly no wonder youve had quite a little excitement the last day or two with a tremendous effort nora recovered her selfcontrol she walked steadily over to one of the packingbox stools and sat down it was silly of me but you dont know how you startled me dont think i usually have nerves but but the place was strange last night and i didnt sleep very well do you mind if i open the door a moment she asked after a short pause it isnt really cold and it looks so beautiful outside one cant see anything out of the window you know its so cobwebby i must clean it tomorrow try as she would her voice faltered on the last word she threw open the door and stood a moment looking out into the bright canadian night brilliant with stars it was all so big so open so free and so lonely you could fairly hear the stillness but she must not think of that ah there was the light that she had been told was the sharps farm somehow it brought her comfort but even as she watched the light went out she came in and closed the door chapter xii he was sitting on one of the stools pipe in mouth reading a newspaper he had already read in the train well what do you think of the shack i dont know i built it with my own hands every one of them logs was a tree i cut down myself you wait till morning and ill show you how theyre joined together at the corners theres some neat work there my girl i guess yes oh i was forgetting heres the kettle she brought it over to him from the shelf he filled the kettle carefully from the pail while she stood and watched him she took it from his hand and set it on the stove to boil youll find some tea in one of them cans on the shelf leastways there was some there when i come away i reckon youre hungry i dont think i am very i ate a very good supper on the train you know im glad you call that a good supper i guess i could wrap up the amount you ate in a postage stamp well she said with a smile you may be glad to learn that i havent a very large appetite i have then wheres the loaf we got in winnipeg this afternoon ill get it and the butter youll bake tomorrow i reckon youre a brave man unless youve forgotten my first attempt at eddies she said with a laugh as she took the loaf and butter from the bag for some reason her mood had completely changed all her confidence in being perfectly able to take care of herself had returned she had been frightened badly frightened a moment ago at nothing nerves nothing more nerves were queer things it was because she hadnt slept last night she was such a good sleeper naturally that a wakeful night affected her more than it did most people the cool night air had completely restored her she hunted about until she found a knife and with the loaf in one hand and the knife poised in the air asked shall i cut you some yep please please what yep please she said with a gay smile oh he growled still smiling she cut several slices of bread and buttered them going to the shelf she found the teapot and shook some tea into it from one of the cans measuring it carefully with her eye his momentary ill humor caused by her correcting him vanished as he watched her i guess its about time you took your hat and coat off he said with a chuckle as a matter of fact she was not conscious that they were still on without a word she took them off and having given her coat a little shake and a pat looked about her for a place to put them she ended finally by putting them both on the kitchen chair you aint terribly talkative for a woman are you my girl i havent anything to say for the moment said nora well i guess its better to have a wife as talks too little than a wife as talks too much i suppose absolute perfection is rare in women poor wretches she said in the old ironic tone she had always used toward him while he was her brothers hired man whats that he said sharply i was only amusing myself with a reflection he checked an angry retort and striding over to a nail in the wall took off his coat and hung it up somehow he looked larger than ever in his gray sweater a sense of comfort and unaccustomed wellbeing restored him to good humor throwing himself into the rocker he stretched out his long legs luxuriantly i guess theres no place like home you get a bit fed up with hiring out ed was o k i reckon but it aint like being your own boss i should think it wouldnt be said nora quietly where does that door go she asked presently that oh into the bedroom like to have a look no no what he said quickly nora turned from the shelf where she had been contriving a place to put the things they had brought from the town and looked at him inquiringly his face was grave but a twinkle in his eye betrayed him she blushed charmingly to the roots of her hair but her laugh was perfectly frank and goodhumored i beg your pardon i was so occupied with arranging my pantry that i forgot my manners no thank you one cant be too careful about these important things he said with rather heavy humor when i built this shack he went on proudly but the pride was the pride of possession not of achievement i fixed it up so as it would do when i got married sid sharp asked me what in hell i wanted to divide it up in half for but i guess women like little luxuries like that like what like having a room to sleep in and a room to live in heres the bread and butter said nora abruptly will you have some syrup sure he got up out of the rocking chair and pulling one of the stools up to the table sat down the water ought to be boiling by now what about milk thats one of the things youll have to learn to do without till i can afford to buy a cow i cant drink tea without milk you try say can you milk a cow i no then its just as well i aint got one nora laughed you are a philosopher having filled the teapot with boiling water and set it on the table she returned to the shelf and began moving the things about in search of something what you looking for is there a candle ill just get one or two things out of my box and bring in here aint you going to sit down and have a cup of tea i dont want any thanks sit down my girl why because i tell you to the command was smilingly given i dont think youd better tell me to do things nora could smile too then i ask you you aint going to refuse the first favor ive asked you certainly not she said in her most charming manner pulling another of the stools up to the table she sat facing him there now pour out my tea for me will you i tell you he said watching her slim hands moving among the tea things its rum seeing my wife sitting down at my table and pouring out tea for me is it pleasant sure now have some tea yourself my girl youll soon get used to drinking it without milk and i guess youll be able to get some tomorrow from mrs sharp nora noticed that he did not taste his tea until she had poured herself a cup just take a bit of the bread and butter he passed her the plate and she still smiling brightly broke off a small half of one of the slices i had a sort of feeling i wanted you and me to have the first meal together in your new home he said gently then with a sudden change of manner he laughed aloud we aint lost much time i guess why its only yesterday you told me not to call you nora you did flare out at me that was very silly of me but i was in a temper and now were man and wife yes married in haste with a vengeance aint you a bit scared i what of you her voice was steady but the hands in her lap were clenched with ed miles away tother side of winnipeg he might just as well be in the old country for all the good he can be to you you might naturally be a bit scared to find yourself alone with a man you dont know im not the nervous sort good for you you did give me a fright though said nora with a laugh when i asked you if youd take me i suppose it was only about fifteen seconds before you answered but it seemed like ten minutes i thought you were going to refuse how gertie would have gloated i was thinking i see counting up my good points and balancing them against my bad ones nooo i was thinking you wouldnt have asked me like that if you hadnt of despised me nora caught her breath sharply but her manner lost none of its lightness i dont know what made you think that well i dont know how you could have put it more plainly that my name was mud why didnt you refuse then i guess im not the nervous sort either he remarked dryly over his teacup and nora reminded him women are scarce in manitoba ive always fancied an english woman he went on ignoring her little thrust they make the best wives going when theyve been licked into shape nora showed her amusement frankly are you purposing to attempt that operation on me well youre clever i guess a hint or two is about all youll want you embarrass me when you pay me compliments ill take you round and show you the land tomorrow he said tilting back on his stool to the imminent peril of his equilibrium i aint done all the clearing yet so therell be plenty of work for the winter i want to have a hundred acres to sow next year and then if i get a good crop ive a mind to take another quarter you cant make it pay really without youve got half a section and its a tough proposition when you aint got capital i had no idea i was marrying a millionaire never you mind my girl you shant live in a shack long i promise you its the greatest country in the world we only want three good crops and you shall have a brick house same as you lived in back home i wonder what theyre doing in england now well i guess theyre asleep when i think of england i always think of it at tea time began nora and then stopped short a wave of regret caught her throat in spite of herself the tears filled her eyes she looked miserably at the cheap ugly tea things on the makeshift table before her her husband watched her gravely presently she went on more to herself than to him miss wickham had a beautiful old silver teapot a george second she was awfully proud of it and she was proud of her teaset it was old worcester and she wouldnt let anyone wash the tea things but again her voice failed her and two or three times a week an old indian judge came in to tea and he used to talk to me about the east the wonderful beautiful east he made me long to see it all i who had never been anywhere ive always loved history and books of travel more than anything else there are a lot of them there in my box thats what makes it so heavy all about the beautiful places i was going to see later on with the money miss wickham promised me her glance took in the mean little room in all its unrelieved ugliness oh why did you make me think of it all she bowed her head on the table for a moment taylor laid his hand gently on her arm the past is dead and gone my girl weve got the future its ours she gently disengaged herself from his detaining hand and went over to the little window looking out with eyes that saw other pictures than the window had to show one never knows when ones well off does one its madness to think of whats gone forever for several minutes there was silence during which nora recovered her selfcontrol having wiped away her tears she turned hack to him smiling bravely i beg your pardon youll think me more foolish than i really am im not the crying sort i assure you but i dont know it all thats all right i know youre not he said roughly i wish wed got a good drop of liquor here he went on with the evident intention of changing the current of her thoughts so as we could drink one anothers health but as we aint youd better give me a kiss instead im not at all fond of kissing said nora coolly frank grinned at her his pipe stuck between his white teeth it aint generally speaking an acquired taste i guess you must be peculiar it looks like it she said lightly come my girl he said getting slowly up from his stool you didnt even kiss me after we was married isnt a hint enough for you her tone was perfectly friendly why do you insist on my saying everything in so many words why make me dot my is and cross my ts so to speak it seems to me it wants a few words to make it plain when a woman refuses to give her husband a kiss do sit down theres a good fellow and ill tell you one or two things thats terribly kind of you he said sinking into the rocker have you any choice of seats not now since youve taken the only one thats tolerably comfortable i think theres nothing to choose between the others nothing i should say i think wed better fix things up before we go any further she said resuming her stool sure you gave me to understand very plainly that you wanted a wife in order to get a general servant without having to pay her wages wages are high here in canada that was the way you put it batching isnt very comfortable youll confess that ill confess that all right you wanted someone to cook and bake for you wash sweep and mend i offered to come and do all that for you it never entered my head for an instant that there was any possibility of your expecting anything else of me then youre a damned fool my girl he was perfectly goodnatured she would have preferred him to be a little angry she would know how to cope with that she thought but she flared up a little herself dyou mind not saying things like that to me his smile widened i guess ill have to say a good many things like that or worse before weve done i asked you to marry me only because i couldnt stay in the shack otherwise you asked me to marry you because you was in the hell of a temper he retorted you were mad clean through you wanted to get away from eds farm right then and there and you didnt care what you did so long as you quit but you was darned sorry for what youd done by the time youd got your trunk packed i dont know that you have any reason for thinking that she said stiffly ive got sense besides when you opened the door when i went up and knocked you was as white as a sheet youd have given anything you had to say youd changed your mind but your damned pride wouldnt let you i wouldnt have stayed longer in that house for anything in the world said nora with passion there you are thats just what i have been telling you he said nodding his head and this morning when i came for you at the y w c a you wanted bad to say you wouldnt marry me when you shook hands with me your hand was like ice you tried to speak the words but they wouldnt come after all one isnt married every day of ones life is one i admit i was nervous for the moment if i hadnt shown you the license and the ring i guess you wouldnt have done it you hadnt the nerve to back out of it then i hadnt slept a wink all night i kept on turning it over in my mind i was frightened at what id done i didnt know a soul in winnipeg i hadnt anywhere to go i had four dollars in my pocket i had to go on with it well you took pretty good stock of me in the train on the way here i guess he laughed pacing up and down the room what makes you think so asked nora who had recovered her coolness well i felt you was looking at me a good deal while i was asleep he jeered it wasnt hard to see that you was turning me over in your mind what conclusion did you come to nora evaded the question for the moment you see i lived all these years with an old lady i know very little about men i guessed that i came to the conclusion that you were a decent fellow and i thought you would be kind to me bouquets are just flying round have you got anything more to say to me he asked seating himself once more in his chair no i think not then just get me my tobacco pouch will you i guess youll find it in the pocket of my coat with narrowed eyes he watched her first hesitate and then bring it to him here you are her tone was crisp i thought you was going to tell me i could darned well get it myself he laughed i dont very much like to be ordered about she said smoothly i didnt realize it was one of your bad habits you never paid much attention to me or my habits till today i reckon i was always polite to you oh very but i was the hired man and youd never let me forget it you thought yourself a darned sight better than me because you could play the piano and speak french but we aint got a piano and there aint anyone as speaks french nearer than winnipeg i dont just see what youre driving at parlor tricks aint much good on the prairie theyre like dollar bills up in hudson bay country tobaccos the only thing you can trade with an esquimaux you cant cook very well you dont know how to milk a cow why you cant even harness a horse are you regretting your bargain already no he said going over to the shelf in search of the matches i guess i can teach you but if i was you he paused the lighted match in his fingers to look at her i wouldnt put on any airs well get on o k i guess when weve shaken down youll find i am perfectly capable of taking care of myself she said with emphasis speaking each word slowly she returned his steady gaze and felt a thrill of victory when he looked away when two people live in a shack he went on as if she had not spoken theres got to be a deal of give and take on both sides as long as you do what i tell you youll be all right a sort of an angry smile crossed noras face its unfortunate that when anyone tells me to do a thing i have an irresistible desire not to do it i guess i tumbled to that you must get over it youve spoken to me once or twice in a way i dont like i think we shall get on better if you ask me to do things dont forget that i can make you do them he said brutally how really he was amusing well im stronger than you are a man can hardly use force in his dealings with a woman she reminded him ooooh you seem surprised whats going to prevent him dont be so silly she retorted as she turned to look once more out of the window but her hands were clammy and somehow even though her back was turned toward him she knew that he was smiling chapter xiii how much time elapsed before he spoke she had no means of knowing probably at most two or three minutes but to the woman gazing out blindly through the cobwebcovered window into the night it might well have been hours for some illogical reason which she could not have explained to herself she had the feeling that the victory in the coming struggle would lie with the one who kept silent the longer to break the nervewrecking spell would be a betrayal of weakness none the less she had arrived at the point when the tension on her own nerves becoming too great she felt she must scream drive her clenched hand through the glass of the window or perform some other act of hysterical violence then he spoke and in the ordinary tone of daily life well im going to unpack my grip the tone together with the commonplace words had the effect of a cold douche she drew a sharp breath of relief her hands unclenched she was herself once more shed won she turned slowly as if reluctant to abandon the starry prospect without to find him bending over a clutter of things scattered about his halfemptied case she had been about to say that she must see to unpacking some of her own things wash up them things he jerked his bowed head toward the littered table for the first time his tone was curt but she was too much mistress of herself and the situation now to be more than faintly annoyed by it ill wash them up in the morning she said casually she started toward the door behind which her box had been carried wash em up now my girl youll find the only way to keep things clean is to wash em the moment youve done with em she smiled at him over her shoulder her hand on the knob of the door but she did not move did you hear what i said i did then why dont you do as i tell you because i dont choose to you aint taking long to try it out are you his face wore an ugly sneer they say theres no time like the present are you going to wash up them things no there was a moments silence while he held her eyes with his then very slowly and deliberately he got up poured some boiling water into a pan and placed it together with a ragged dishcloth on the table are you going to wash up them things no she was still cool and smiling only her grip on the knob of the door had tightened until the nails of her fingers were white do you want me to make you how can you do that ill soon show you she waited the fraction of a moment ill just get out those rugs shall i i think the holdall was put in here i expect it gets very cold toward morning she had opened the door now and stepped across the threshold her face was still turned toward his but her smile was a little fixed nora yes come here why because i tell you to still she did not move in two strides he was over at her side he stretched out his hand to seize her by the wrist you darent touch me she pulled the door to sharply and stood with her back against it facing him her face was as white as a linen mask and about as expressionless only her eyes lived anger and fear had enlarged the pupils until they seemed black in the dead white of her face you darent she repeated i darent who told you that have you forgotten that im a woman no i havent thats why im going to make you do as i tell you if you were a man i mightnt be able to come now he made a movement to take her by the arm but she was too quick for him with the quickness of a cat she slipped aside the next moment to his astonishment he felt a stinging blow on the ear he stared at her dumbfounded it is safe to hazard that never in his life had he been so utterly taken aback she met his stare without lowering her glance but she was panting now as if she had been running one clenched hand pressed against her heaving breast he gave a short laugh half of amused admiration at her daring and half of anger that was a darned silly thing to do what did you expect i expected that you were cleverer than to hit me you ought to know that when it comes to to muscle i guess ive got the bulge on you im not frightened of you it was a stupid thing to say nora realized it too late if she had only been able to hold her tongue he might have relented she thought but at her words his face hardened once more and the same steely glitter came into his eyes now come and wash up these things i wont i tell you come on quickly grasping her by the wrists he began to drag her slowly but steadily to the table earlier in the evening she had boasted that she was as strong as a horse as a matter of fact she had unusual strength for a woman but she was quickly made to realize that her strength even intensified as it was by her anger was of course nothing compared with his strain and resist as she might she could neither release herself from his grasp nor prevent him from forcing her nearer and nearer to the table which was his goal in the struggle one of the large shell hair pins which she wore fell to the floor in another second she heard it ground to pieces under his heel a long strand of hair came billowing down below her waist another moment and by making a long arm he could reach the table with a quick movement for which she was unprepared he brought her two hands sharply together so that he could hold both of her wrists with one hand leaving the other free let me go let me go she kicked him first on one shin and then on the other but their bodies were too close together for the blows to have any force come on now my girl whats the good of making a darned fuss about it his laugh was boyish in its exultant goodnature you brute how dare you touch me youll never force me to do anything let go let go let go and now his free hand held fast the edge of the table with a quick movement she bent down and fastened her teeth in the skin of the back of his hand with an exclamation of pain he released her carrying his wounded hand instinctively to his mouth gee what sharp teeth youve got you cad you cad she panted i never thought youd bite he said looking at his bleeding hand ruefully that aint much like a lady according to my idea you filthy cad to hit a woman gee i didnt hit you you smacked my face and kicked my shins and you bit my hand and now you say i hit you he picked up his pipe from the table and mechanically rammed the tobacco down with his thumb and looked about for a match you beast i hate you in the height of her passion she unconsciously began twisting up the loosened strand of her hair i dont care about that so long as you wash them cups with a furious gesture she swept the table clean look she screamed as cups saucers plates and teapot broke into a thousand pieces at his feet there came another little sound of something breaking like a faint echo far away it was his pipe which had fallen among the wreckage in his astonishment at her sudden action he had bitten through the mouthpiece thats a pity were terribly short of crockery we shall have to drink our tea out of cans now was all he said i said i wouldnt wash them and i havent washed them nora exulted they dont need it now i guess he said humorously i think ive won sure he said without the slightest trace of rancor now take the broom and sweep up all the darned mess youve made i wont look here my girl he said threateningly i guess ive had about enough of your nonsense you do as youre told and look sharp about it you can kill me if you like what would be the good of that women as you reminded me a little while back are scarce in manitoba he gave a searching look around the room and spying the broom in the corner went over and fetched it heres the broom if you want that mess swept up you can sweep it up yourself look here you make me tired his tone suggested that he was becoming more irritated but nora was beyond caring as he put the broom in her hand she flung it from her as far as she could look here he said again and this time there was no mistaking the menace in his voice if you dont clean up that mess at once ill give you the biggest hiding you ever had in your life i promise you that you she jeered yours truly he said nodding his head ive done with larking now he began rolling up the sleeves of his sweater for some obscure reason possibly because his deliberation seemed to connote implacability this simple action filled her with a terror that she had not known before even in the midst of their physical struggle help help help she screamed she rushed across the room and threw open the door sending her agonized appeal out into the night help help help she strained her ears for any sign of response whats the good of that theres no one within a mile of us listen it is doubtful if she heard his words if she had it would have mattered but little the answering silence which engulfed her like a wave told her that she was lost she bowed her head in her hands her whole slender body was wrecked with hard dry sobs when she lifted her head he read in her eyes the anguish of the conquered nevertheless she made one last stand if you so much as touch me ill have you up for cruelty there are laws to protect me i dont care a curse for the laws he laughed i know im going to be master here and if i tell you to do a thing youve darned well got to do it because i can make you now stop this fooling pick up that crockery and get the broom i wont he made one stride toward her no dont dont hurt me she shrieked i guess theres only one law here he said and thats the law of the strongest i dont know nothing about cities perhaps men and women are equal there but on the prairie a mans the master because hes bigger and stronger than a woman frank damn you dont talk she did not move her eyes were on the ground pride and fear were having their last struggle and fear conquered without looking at her husband she could feel that his patience was nearing an end very slowly she stooped down and picked up the teapot and the broken cups and saucers and laid them on the table blindly she tottered over to the rockingchair and burst into a passion of tears and i thought i knew what it was to be unhappy he watched her with a slight but not unkindly smile on his face come on my girl he said without any trace of anger dont shirk the rest of it through her laced fingers she looked at the mess of spilled tea on the floor keeping her tearmarred face turned away from him she slowly got up and slowly found the broom and swept it all into a little heap on the newspaper that lay where he had left it suddenly she threw back her head her eyes shone with a new resolution he watched her wondering with a quick firm step she carried the rolledup paper to the stove and shoved it far into the glowing embers gathering up the crockery after a glance around the room in search of some receptacle which her eye did not find she carried it over to the woodpile laying it upon the logs the broom was restored to its corner she took up her hat and coat and began to put them on what are you doing ive done what you made me do now im going where if i might ask what do i care as long as i get away you aint under the impression that theres a firstclass hotel round the corner are you there aint i can go to the sharps i guess theyre in bed and asleep by now ill wake them youd never find your way its pitch dark look he threw open the door it was true the sky had clouded over the feeling of the air had changed it smelt of storm ill sleep out of doors then on the prairie why youd freeze to death before morning what does it matter to you whether i live or die it matters a great deal once more let me remind you that women are scarce in manitoba are you going to keep me from going sure he closed the door and placed his back against it you cant keep me here against my will if i dont go tonight i can go tomorrow tomorrows a long long way off her hand flew to her throat frank what do you mean i dont know what silly fancies youve had in your head but when i married you i intended that you should be a proper wife to me but but but you understood it was all she could do to force the words from her dry throat with a desperate effort she pulled herself together and tried to talk calmly and reasonably im sorry for the way ive behaved frank it was silly and childish of me to struggle with you you irritated me you see by the way you spoke and the tone you took oh i dont mind i dont know much about women and i guess theyre queer we had to fix things up sometime and i guess theres no harm in getting it over right now youve beaten me all along the line and im in your power have mercy on me i guess you wont have much cause to complain i married you in a fit of temper it was very stupid of me im very sorry that i that ive been all this trouble to you wont you let me go no i cant do that im no good to you youve told me that im useless i cant do any of the things that you want a wife to do oh she ended passionately you cant be so hardhearted as to make me pay with all my whole life for one moments madness what good

think youd better give it a try once more hope wakened in noras heart his tone was so reasonable if she kept her selfcontrol she might yet win she sat down on one of the stools and spoke in a tone that was almost conversational all this life is so strange to me back in england they think its so different from what it really is i thought i should have a horse to ride that there would be dances and parties and when i came out i was so out of it all i felt in the way and yesterday gertie drove me frantic so that i felt i couldnt stay a moment longer in that house i acted on impulse i didnt know what i was doing i made a mistake you cant have the heart to take advantage of it i knew you was making a mistake but that was your lookout when i sell a man a horse he can look it over for himself i aint obliged to tell him its faults do you mean to say that after ive begged you almost on my knees to let me go youll force me to stay illustration frank glimpses the approaching storm that means his ruin thats what i mean oh why did i ever trap myself so come my girl lets let bygones be bygones he said goodhumoredly come give me a kiss she tried a new tack im not in love with you she said in a matteroffact voice i guessed that and youre not in love with me youre a woman and im a man do you want me to tell you in so many words that youre physically repellent to me that the thought of letting you kiss me horrifies and disgusts me in spite of her resolution her voice was rising thank you he was still goodhumored look at your hands it gives me gooseflesh when you touch me cuttin down trees diggin lookin after horses dont leave them very white and smooth let me go let me go he took a step away from the door his whole manner changed see here my girl you was educated like a lady and spent your life doin nothing oh i forgot you was a ladys companion wasnt you and you look on yourself as a darned sight better than me i never had no schooling its a hell of a job for me to write a letter but since i was so high his hand measured a distance of about three feet from the floor ive earned my living i guess ive been all over this country ive been a trapper ive worked on the railroad and for two years ive been a freighter i guess ive done pretty nearly everything but clerk in a store now you just get busy and forget all the nonsense youve got in your head youre nothing but an ignorant woman and im your master im goin to do what i like with you and if you dont submit willingly by god ill take you as the trappers in the old days used to take the squaws for the last moment nora could hardly have been said to have listened in a delirium of terror her eyes swept the little cabin searching desperately for some means of escape as he made a step toward her her roving eye suddenly fell on her husbands gun standing where sharp had left it when he brought it in with a bound she was across the room the gun at her shoulder with an oath frank started forward if you move ill kill you you darent unless you open that door and let me go ill shoot you ill shoot you shoot then he held his arms wide exposing his broad chest with a sobbing cry she pulled the trigger the click of the falling hammer was heard nothing more gee whiz shouted taylor in admiration why you meant it the gun fell clattering to the floor it wasnt loaded of course it wasnt loaded dyou think id have stood there and told you to shoot if it had been i guess i aint thinking of committin suicide and i almost admired you you hadnt got no reason to theres nothing to admire about a man who stands five feet off a loaded gun thats being aimed at him hed be a darned fool thats all you were laughing at me all the time youd have had me dead as mutton if that gun ud been loaded youre a sport all right all right i never thought you had it in you youre the girl for me i guess as she stood there dazed perfectly unprepared he threw his arms around her and attempted to kiss her let me alone ill kill myself if you touch me i guess you wont he kissed her full on the mouth then let her go sinking into a chair she sobbed in helpless angry despair oh how shameful how shameful he let her alone for a little then when the violence of her sobbing had died away came over and laid his hand gently on her shoulder hadnt you better cave in my girl youve tried your strength against mine and it hasnt amounted to much you even tried to shoot me and i only made you look like a darned fool i guess youre beat my girl theres only one law here thats the law of the strongest youve got to do what i want because i can make you havent you any generosity not the kind you want i guess she gave a little moan of anguish hark he held up his hand as if to call her attention to something for a moment hope flamed from its embers but stealing a glance at his face from beneath her drooping lashes she saw that she was mistaken the last spark died to be rekindled no more listen listen to the silence cant you hear it the silence of the prairie why we might be the only two people in the world you and me here in this little shack right out in the prairie are you listening there aint a sound it might be the garden of eden whats that about male and female created he them i guess youre my wife my girl and i want you nora gave him a sidelong look of terror and remained dumb what would have been the use of words even if she could have found voice to utter them taking up the lamp he went to the door of the bedroom and threw it wide she saw without looking that he remained standing like a statue of fate on the threshold to gain time she picked up the dishcloth and began to scrub at an imaginary spot on the table i guess its getting late youll be able to have a good cleanout tomorrow tomorrow a violent shudder similar to the convulsion of the day before shook her from head to foot but she kept on with her scrubbing come the word smote her ear with all the impact of a cannon shot the walls caught it and gave it back there was no other sound in heaven or earth than the echo of that word shame anguish and fear in turn passed over her face then with her hands before her eyes she passed beyond him through the door which he still held open chapter xiv the storm which the night had foreshadowed broke with violence before dawn at times during the night the wind had howled about the little building in a way which recalled to nora one of the bestremembered holidays of her childhood she and her mother had gone to eastborne for a fortnight with some money eddie had sent them shortly after his arrival in canada the autumnal equinox had caught them during the last days of their stay and the strong impression which the wind had made upon her childish mind had remained with her ever since lying wakeful through the long hours staring wideeyed out of the little curtainless window into the thick darkness thick enough to seem palpable the memory of how on that faroff day she had passed long hours with her nose flattened against the window of the dingy little lodginghouse drawingroom watching the wonder of the windlashed sea came back to her with extraordinary vividness the spectacle had filled her with a sort of terrified exultation she had longed to go out and stand on the windbuffeted pier and take her part in this saturnalia of the elements she had something of the same feeling now a longing to leave her bed and go out onto the windswept prairie strangely enough she had no sensation of fatigue or weariness either bodily or mentally her mind indeed seemed extraordinarily active little petty details of her childhood and of her life with miss wickham long forgotten such as the day the gardener had cut his thumb trooped through her mind in an endless procession she had a strange feeling that she would never sleep again but just as the blackness without seemed turning into heavy grayness lulled possibly by the wind which had moderated its violence and had now sunk to a moan not unpleasant and by the rythmic breathing of the sleeping man at her side she fell asleep for several hours she must have slept heavily indeed for when she awoke it was to find the place at her side empty hurriedly dressing herself she went out into the livingroom that was empty too but the lamp was lighted the kettle was singing merrily on the stove and the fire was burning brightly and outside was a whirling veil of snow which made it impossible to see beyond the length of ones arm had she been marooned on an island in the ultimate ocean of the antartic she could not have felt more cut off from the world she knew well it was better so she wondered what had become of frank surely on a day like this there could be nothing to do outside and even if there were nothing so imperative as to take him away before he had had his breakfast she felt a little hurt at his leaving without a word evidently he expected to return soon however the table was laid for two she felt her face crimson as she saw that there was but one cup left one of them must drink from one of those horrible tin cans she did not ask herself which one it would be partly to occupy herself and to take her thoughts away from the recollection of the events of the evening before and partly prompted by a desire to have everything in readiness against her husbands return she busied herself with the preparations for breakfast there were some eggs and a filch of bacon which they had brought from winnipeg she would make some toast too very likely he didnt care for it they certainly never had it at gerties but in her house she smiled to think how quickly in her mind she had taken possession she was just beginning to think that she had been foolish to start her cooking without knowing at all when he was going to return when she heard a great stamping and scraping of feet outside and in another moment franks snowcovered figure darkened the doorway getting on with the breakfast thats fine he called its quite ready wherever have you been i wouldnt have imagined that anyone could find a thing to do outside on a day like this oh theres always something to do but i just ran up to the sharps for a minute i knew old mother sharp wouldnt keep her promise about coming down today shes all right but she does hate to walk well im sure i wouldnt blame anyone for choosing to stay indoors a day like this but what did you want to see her in such a hurry for oh nothin particular i sort of thought maybe you wouldnt mind having a little milk with your tea on a gloomy morning like this he said shamefacedly that was awfully good of you thank you very much she said with real gratitude as she thought of him tramping those two miles in the blinding storm do you think we are in for a blizzard she asked when they were at the table to her unspeakable relief she found that the one cup was intended for her he had waved her toward the one chair apparently the place of honor contenting himself with one of the stools noo he said i dont think so its beginning to lighten up a little already and besides dont you remember that i foretold a mildish winter i was forgetting that i had married a prophet she smiled but all through the day the snow continued to fall steadily although the wind had died away and at intervals the sun shone palely at nightfall it was still snowing the day passed quickly as nora found plenty to occupy herself with by supper time she felt healthfully tired with the added comfortable feeling that for a novice she had really accomplished a good deal the whole room certainly looked cleaner and the pots and pans although not shining were as near to it as hot water and scrubbing could make them fortunately she had a quantity of fresh white paper in her trunk which greatly improved the appearance of the shelves during the day frank left the house for longer or shorter intervals on various pretexts which she felt must be largely imaginary trumped up for the occasion she was agreeably surprised to find that he was sufficiently tactful to divine that she wanted to be alone while he was in the house he smoked his pipe incessantly and read some magazines which she had unpacked with some of her books but she never glanced suddenly in his direction without finding that he was watching her i tell you this is fine he said heartily as he was lighting his aftersupper pipe mrs sharp wont hardly know the place when she comes over shes never seen it except when i was housekeeper she doesnt think im much good at it leastways shes always tellin sid that if she dies he must marry again right away as soon as he can find anyone to have him for fear the house gets to looking like this that doesnt look like a very strong indorsement nora admitted the next day nora woke to a world of such dazzling whiteness that she was blinded every time she attempted to look out on it you want to be careful her husband cautioned her getting snowblinded isnt as much fun as youd think even i get bad sometimes and im used to it looks like one of them christmas cards dont it somebody sent gertie one once and she showed it to us that afternoon mr sharp drove his wife down for the promised visit as in his judgment the two women would want to be alone he proposed to frank to drive back home with him to give him the benefit of his opinion on some improvements he was contemplating youre only wasting your time mrs sharp had remarked grimly there aint going to be anything done to any of them barns before i get a leanto on the house youd think even a man would know that a house thats all right for two gets a little small for seven she added scornfully to nora are there seven of you me and sid and five little ones if that dont make seven ive forgotten all the rithmetic i ever learned said mrs sharp briefly and let me tell you you whore just starting in that having children out here on the prairie half the time with no proper care and particularly in winter when maybe youre snowed up and the doctor cant get to you aint my idea of a bank holiday i shouldnt think it would be said nora sincerely shocked although she found it difficult to hide a smile at her visitors comparison bank holidays being among her most horrid recollections mrs sharp despite a rather emphatic manner which softened noticeably as her visit progressed turned out to be a stout redfaced woman of middle age who seemed to be troubled with a chronic form of asthma she was as unmistakably english as her husband but like him she had lost much of her native accent although occasionally one caught a faint trace of the cockney she had two rather keen brown eyes which as she talked took in the room to its smallest detail well i declare i think youve done wonders considering youve only had a day and not used to work like this she said heartily when sid told me that frank was bringing home a wife i said to myself well i dont envy her her job comin to a shack that aint been lived in for nigh unto six months and when it was with only a man runnin it you dont seem to have a very high opinion of mens ability in the domestic line said nora with a smile i can tell you just how high it is said mrs sharp with decision i would just as soon think of consultin little sid an hes goin on three about the housekeepin as i would his father it aint a mans work why should he know anything about it still demurred nora lots of men look after themselves somehow somehows just the word they never get beyond that of course i knew frank would be sure to marry some day and with his good looks its a wonder he didnt do so long ago most girls is so crazy about a goodlookin fellow that they never stop to think if he has anything else to him not that he hasnt lots of good traits i dont mean that but she added shrewdly you dont look like the silly sort that would be taken in by good looks alone no said nora dryly i dont think i am after that until the two men returned they talked of household matters and nora found that her new neighbor had a store of useful and practical suggestions to make and what was even better seemed glad to place all her experience at her disposal in the kindliest and most friendly manner possible entirely free from any trace of that patronage which had so maddened her in her sisterinlaw now mind you called mrs sharp as she laboriously climbed up to the seat beside her husband as they were driving away if frank here gets at all upish and hes pretty certain to all newly married men do you come to me ill settle him never fear frank laughed a little overloudly at this parting shot and nora noticed that for some time after their guests had gone he seemed unusually silent as for the sharps they also maintained an unwonted silence which for mrs sharp at least was something unusual until they had arrived at their own door well queried sharp as they were about to turn in it beats me replied his wife why shes a lady but shell come out all right she finished enigmatically shes got the right stuff in her poor dear in after years when nora was able to look back on this portion of her life and see things in just perspective she always felt that she could never be too thankful that her days had been crowded with occupation without that she must either have gone actually insane or in a frenzy of helplessness done some rash thing which would have marred her whole life beyond repair after she found herself growing more accustomed to her new life and after all the growing accustomed to it was the hardest part she realized that she was only following the universal law of life in paying for her own rash act the thought that she was paying with interest being overcharged as it were was but faint consolation it only meant that she had been a fool that conviction is rarely soothing then too she gradually began to look at the situation from franks point of view he had certainly acted within his rights if with little generosity but she had to acknowledge to herself that the obligation to be generous on his part was small she could hardly be said to have treated him with much liberality in the past she had used him without scruple as a means to an end she had made him the instrument for escaping from a predicament which she found unbearably irksome that she had done so in the heat of passion was small palliation for the present at least she wisely resolved to make the best of things it could not last forever the day must come when she could free herself from the bonds that now held her it was characteristic of her unyielding pride of her reluctance to confess to defeat that the thought of appealing to her brother never once entered her head for this reason it was long before she could bring herself to write the promised letter to eddie what was there to say the things that would have relieved her in a sense to tell must remain forever locked in her own heart in the end she compromised by sending a letter confined entirely to describing her new home as she read it over she thanked the fates that eddies was not a subtile or analytical mind he would read nothing between the lines but gertie well it couldnt be helped it was some two months after her marriage that she received a letter from miss pringle in answer to the one she had written while she was still an inmate of her brothers house miss pringle confined herself largely to an account of her continental wanderings and her bloodless encounters with various foreigners and their ridiculous unenglish customs from which she had emerged triumphant and victorious mrs hubbards precarious state of health had led her into being unusually captious it seemed miss pringle was more than ever content to be back in tunbridge wells where all the world was by comparison sane and reasonable in behavior when it came to touching upon her friends amazing environment and unconventional experiences miss pringle was discretion itself but if her paragraphs had bristled with exclamation points they could not to one who understood her mental processes have more clearly betrayed her utter disapproval and amazement that english people and descendants of english people could so far forget themselves as to live in any such manner replying to this letter was only a degree less hard than writing to eddie noras ready pen faltered more than once and many pages were destroyed before an answer was sent she confined herself entirely to describing the new experience of a canadian winter of her departure from her brothers roof and of her marriage she said nothing whatever in accordance with her resolution to make the best of things she set about making the shack more comfortable and homelike there were many of those things which small in themselves count for much that her busy brain planned to do during the time taken up in the necessary overhauling this cleaningup process had taken several days interrupted as it was by the ordinary daily routine to her unaccustomed hand the task of preparing three hearty meals a day was a matter that consumed a large amount of time but gradually day by day she found herself systematizing her task and becoming less inexpert to be sure she made many mistakes once indeed in a fit of preoccupation while occupied in rearranging the bedroom burning up the entire dinner upon his return her husband had found her redeyed and apologetic oh well he said it aint worth crying over what is the saying hell wasnt built in a day nora screamed with laughter i think youre mixing two old saws rome wasnt built in a day and hell is paved with good intentions well he laughed goodnaturedly they both seem to hit the case he certainly was unfailingly goodtempered not that there were not times when nora did not have to remind herself of her new resolution and he for his part exercise all his forbearance but in the main things went more smoothly than either had dared to hope from their inauspicious beginning the thing that nora found hardest to bear was that he never lost a certain masterful manner it was a continual reminder that she had been defeated then too he had a maddening way of rewarding her for good conduct which was equally hard to bear until she realized that it was perfectly unconscious on his part for example after she had struggled for a week with her makeshift kitchen outfit small in the beginning but greatly reduced by her destructive outburst on the night of their arrival he had without saying a word to her of his intentions driven over to prentice and laid in an entire new stock of crockery and several badly needed pots and pans nora had found it hard to thank him if they had been labeled for a good child she could not have felt more humiliated and what was equally trying he seemed to have divined her thoughts for his smile upon receiving her halting thanks had not been without a touch of malicious amusement on the other hand all her little efforts to beautify the little house and make it more livable met with his enthusiastic approval and support he was as delighted as a child with everything she did and often when baffled for the moment by some lack of material for carrying out some proposed scheme he came to the rescue with an ingenious suggestion which solved the vexed problem at once and so gradually to the no small wonder of her neighbor mrs sharp the shack began to take on an air of homely brightness and comfort which that ladys more pretentious place lacked even after a residence of thirteen years curtains tied back with gay ribands taken from an old hat and refurbished appeared at the windows the old tin syrup cans pasted over with dark green paper were made to disgorge their mouldy stores and transform themselves into flowerpots holding scarlet geraniums even the disreputable rakish old rocking chair assumed a belated air of youth and respectability wearing as it did a cushion of discreetly patterned chintz and the packingbox table hid its deficiencies under a simple cloth all these magic transformations nora had achieved with various odds and ends which she found in her trunk not to be outdone frank had contributed a wellmade shelf to hold noras precious books and a sort of cupboard for her sewing basket and for the crowning touch had with much labor contrived some rough chairs to take the place of the packingbox affairs of unpleasant memory as has been said mrs sharp came saw and wondered but she had her own theory all the same which she confided to her husband all these little but significant changes the result of their cooperative effort had not been the work of days but of weeks by the time they had all been accomplished the winter was practically over and spring was at hand looking back on it it seemed impossibly short although there had been times in spite of her manifold occupations when it had seemed to nora that it was longer than any winter she had ever known she looked forward to the coming spring with both pleasure and dread through many a dark winter day she had pictured to herself how beautiful the prairie must be clad in all the verdant livery of the most wonderful of the seasons and yet it would mean a new solitude and loneliness to her her husband of necessity being away through all the long daylight hours she began to understand gerties dread of having no one to speak to she avoided asking herself the question as to whether it was loneliness in general or the particular loneliness of missing her husband that she dreaded but she was obliged to admit to herself that the winter had wrought more transformations than were to be seen in the little shack chapter xv it had all come about so subtilely and gradually that she was almost unaware of it herself this inward change in herself nora had by nature a quick and active mind but she had also many inherited prejudices it is a truism that it is much harder to unlearn than to learn and for her it was harder in the circumstances than for the average person not that she was more set in her ways than other people but that she had accepted from her childhood a definite set of ideas as to the proper conduct of life a code in other words from which she had never conceived it possible to depart people did certain things or they did not you played the game according to certain prescribed rules or you didnt play it with decent people that was all there was to it one might as well argue that there was no difference between right and wrong as to say that this was not so of course there were plenty of people on the face of the earth who thought otherwise such as chinese aborigines turks and all sorts of unpleasant natives of uncivilized countries nora lumped them together without discrimination or remorse but no one planned to pass their lives among them and as for the sentiment that trotter had enunciated one day at her brothers that canada was a country where everybody was as good as everybody else that was of course utter nonsense it was because the country was raw and new that such silly notions prevailed no society could exist an hour founded upon any such theory and yet here she was living with a man on terms of equality whom when measured up with the standards she was accustomed to failed impossibly and yet did he that is did he in the larger sense that he was woefully deficient in all the little niceties of life that he was illiterate and ignorant could not be denied but he was no mans fool and as far as his light shone he certainly lived up to it that was just it he had a standard of his own she compared him with her brother and with other men she had known and respected was he less honest less brave less independent less scrupulous in his dealings with his fellowmen to all these questions she was obliged to answer no and he was proud too and ambitious ambitious to carve out a fortune with his own hands beholden to neither man nor circumstances for the achievement certainly there was much that was fine about him and as far as his treatment of herself was concerned after that first terrible struggle for mastery she had had nothing to complain of he had been patient with her ignorance and her lack of capabilities in all the things that the women in this new life were so proficient in did she not perhaps fall as far below his standard as he did before hers there was certainly something to be said on both sides there was one quality which he possessed to which she paid ungrudging tribute never had she met a man so free from all petty pretense he regretted his lack of opportunities for educating himself but it apparently never entered his head to pretend a knowledge of even the simplest subject which he did not possess the questions that he asked her from time to time about matters which almost any schoolboy in england could have answered both touched and embarrassed her at first she had found the evenings the most trying part of the day when not taken up with her household cares she found herself becoming absurdly selfconscious in his society they were neither of them naturally silent people and it was difficult not to have the air of talking down to him of palpably making conversation beyond the people at her brothers and the sharps they had not a single acquaintance in common her horizon hitherto had been bounded by england his by canada finally acting on the suggestion he had made but never again referred to the unforgettable day when they were leaving for winnipeg she began reading aloud evenings while he worked on his new chairs the experiment was a great success her little library was limited in range a few standard works and a number of books on travel and some of history she soon found that history was what he most enjoyed things that were a commonplace to her were revealed to him for the first time and his comments were keen and intelligent although his point of view was strikingly novel and at the opposite pole from hers to be sure she had been accustomed to accepting history merely as a more or less accurate record of bygone events without philosophizing upon it but to him it was one long chronicle of wrong and oppression he pronounced the dead and gone sovereigns of england a bad lot and cowardly almost without exception not apparently objecting to them on the ground that they were kings as she had at first thought but because they attained their ends mostly selfish through cruelty and oppression without any regard for humane rights it was the same way with books of travel the chateaus and castles with all their atmosphere of story and romance which she had always longed to visit interested him not a jot in his opinion they were one and all bloody monuments of greed and selfishness the sooner they were razed to the ground and forgotten the better for the world it was useless to make an appeal for them on artistic grounds art to him was a doubly sealed book and yet he frequently disclosed an innate love of beauty in his appreciation of the changing panorama of the winter landscape which stretched on every side before their eyes it was a picture which had an inexhaustible fascination for nora herself although there were times when the isolation and above all the unbroken stillness got badly on her nerves but she could not rid herself of an almost superstitious feeling that the prairie had a lesson to teach her twice they went in to prentice with these exceptions she saw no one but her husband and mr and mrs sharp but it was strangely enough from mrs sharp that she drew the most illumination as to the real meaning of this strange new life not that mrs sharp was in the least subtle quite the contrary she was as hardheaded practical a person as one could well imagine but her natural powers of adaptability must have been unusually great from a small shop in one of the outlying suburbs of london with its circumscribed outlook moral as well as physical to the limitless horizon of the prairie was indeed a far cry how much inward readjustment such a violent transplanting must require nora had sufficient imagination to fully appreciate but if mrs sharp herself were conscious of having not only survived her uprooting but of having triumphantly grown and thrived in this alien soil she gave no sign of it everything to employ her own favorite phrase with which she breached over inexplicable chasms was all in a lifetime as she had a deeply rooted distaste for any form of exercise beyond that which was required in the days work most of the visiting between them devolved upon nora to her the distance that separated the two houses was nothing and as she had from the first taken a genuine liking to her neighbor she found herself going over to the sharps several times a week when as was natural at first she felt discouraged over her little domestic failures she found these neighborly visits a great tonic mrs sharp was always ready to give advice when appealed to and unlike gertie she never expressed astonishment at her visitors ignorance or impatience with her shortcomings these became more and more infrequent nora made up for her total lack of experience by an intelligent willingness to be taught there was a certain stimulation in the thought that she was learning to manage her own house that would have been lacking while at her brothers even if gertie had displayed a more agreeable willingness to impart her own knowledge nora had always been fond of children and she found the sharp children unusually interesting it was curious to see how widely the ideas of this the first generation born in the new country differed not only from those of their parents but from what they must have inevitably been if they had remained in the environment that would have been theirs had they been born and brought up back in england all of their dreams as to what they were going to do when they grew to manhood were colored and shaped by the outdoor life they had been accustomed to they were to be farmers and cattle raisers on a large scale mrs sharp used to shake her head sometimes as she heard these grandiloquent plans but nora could see that she was secretly both proud and pleased after all why should not these dreams be realized everything was possible to the children of this new and wonderful country if they were only industrious and ambitious i dont know im sure what their poor dear grandfather would have said if he had lived to hear them she used to say sometimes to nora he used to think that there was nothing so genteel as having a good shop he quite looked down on farming folk still everything is different out here ideas as well as everything else and im not at all sure they wont be better off in the end in which notion nora secretly agreed with her to picture these healthy sturdy outdoor youngsters confined to a little dingy shop such as their mother had been used to in her own childhood was impossible as she recalled to her mind the pale anemiclooking little souls she had occasionally seen during her stay in london was not any personal sacrifice worth seeing ones children grow up so strong and healthy so manly and independent this then was the true inwardness of it all the thing that dignified and ennobled this life of toil and hardship deprived of almost all the things which she had always regarded as necessary that the welfare prosperity and happiness of generations yet to come might be reared on this foundation laid by selfdenial and deprivation she felt almost humbled in the presence of this simple unpretentious kindly woman who had borne so much without complaint that her children might have wider opportunities for usefulness and happiness than she had ever known not that mrs sharp herself seemed to think that she was doing anything remarkable she took it all as a matter of course it was only when something brought up the subject of the difficulties of learning to do without this or that that she alluded to the days when she also was inexperienced and had had to learn for herself without anyone to advise or help her miles away from any help other than her husband could give her she had borne six children and buried one and although the days of their worst poverty seemed safely behind them they had been able to save but little so that they still felt themselves at the mercies of the changing seasons given one or two good years to harvest their crops they might indeed consider themselves almost beyond the danger point but with seven mouths to feed one could not afford to lose a single crop with her head teeming with all the new ideas that mrs sharps experiences furnished nora felt that the time was by no means as wasted as she had once thought it would be there was no reason after all that she should sink to the level of a mere domestic drudge and if this part of her life was not to endure forever it would not have been entirely barren since it furnished her with much new material to ponder over after all was it really more narrow than her life at tunbridge wells in her heart she acknowledged that it was not to frank also the winter brought a broader outlook he had looked upon noras little refinements of speech and delicate point of view when he had first known her at her brothers as finicky to say the least all women had fool notions about most things this one seemed to have more than the average share that was all he secretly shared gerties opinion that women the world over were all alike in the essentials he had always been of the opinion that nora had good stuff in her which would come out once she had been licked into shape yet he found himself not only learning to admire her for those same niceties but found himself unconsciously imitating her mannerisms of speech then too after they began the habit of reading in the evenings he found that she had no intention of ridiculing his ignorance and lack of knowledge in matters on which she seemed to him to be wonderfully informed that they did not by any means always agree in the conclusions they arrived at in place of irritating him as he would have thought he found only stimulating to his imagination to attack and try to undermine her position as long as their arguments were conducted with perfect good nature on either side as they always were diverted him greatly and he was secretly pleased when she defended herself with a skill and address that defeated his purpose all the little improvements in the shack were a source of neverending pride and pleasure to him often when at work he found himself proudly comparing his place with its newly added prettiness with the more gaudy ornaments of mrs sharps or even with gerties more pretentious abode and it was not altogether the pride of ownership that made them suffer in the comparison looking back on the days before noras advent seemed like a horrible nightmare from which he was thankful to have awakened once in a while he indulged himself in speculating as to how it would feel to go back to the old shiftless untidy days of his bachelorhood but he rarely allowed himself to entertain the idea of her leaving seriously he was like a child snuggly tucked in his warm bed who listening to the howling of the wind outside pictures himself exposed to its harshness in order to luxuriate the more in its warmth and comfort but when as sometimes happened he could not close the door of his mind to the thought of how he should ever learn to live without her again it brought an anguish that was physical as well as mental once looking up from her book nora had surprised him sitting with closed eye his face white and drawn with pain her fright and above all her pretty solicitude even after he had assuaged her fears by explaining that he occasionally suffered from an old strain which he had sustained a few years before while working in the lumber camps tried his composure to the utmost for days the memory of the look in her eyes as she bent over him remained in his mind but he was careful not to betray himself again it was to prevent any repetition that he first resorted to working over something while she was reading while doubly occupied with listening and working with his hands he found that his mind was less apt to go off on a tangent and indulge in painful and profitless speculations for after all as she had said how could he prevent her going if her heart was set on it that she had given no outward sign of being unhappy or discontented argued nothing she was far too shrewd to spend her strength in unavailing effort pride and ordinary prudence would counsel waiting for a more favorable opportunity than had yet been afforded her she would not soon forget the lesson of the night he had beaten down her opposition and dragged her pride in the dust and would she ever forgive it that was a question that he asked himself almost daily without finding any answer there was nothing in her manner to show that she harbored resentment or that she was brooding over plans for escaping from the bondage of her life but women in his experience were deep even cunning once given a strong purpose women like nora pursued it to the end women of this type were not easily diverted by side issues as men so often were for weeks he lived in daily apprehension of eds arrival there was no one else she could turn to and evoking his aid did not necessarily argue that she must submit again to gerties grudging hospitality ed might easily unknown to his masterful betterhalf furnish the funds to return to england she had not written him that he knew of as a matter of fact she had not but she might have given the letter to sid sharp to post on one of his not infrequent trips into prentice it would only have been by chance that sid would speak of so trifling a matter he was much too proud to question him but as time went on and no ed appeared he began if not exactly to hope that after all she was finding the life not unbearable at least her leaving was a thing of the more or less remote future he summoned all his philosophy to his aid perhaps by the time she did make up her mind to quit him he would have acquired some little degree of resignation or at least would not be caught as unprepared as he frankly confessed himself to be at the moment the spring which brought many new occupations mostly out of doors had passed and summer was past its zenith frank had worked untiringly from dawn to dark so wearied that he frequently found it difficult to keep his eyes open until supper was over but his enthusiasm never flagged if everything went as well as he hoped the additional quartersection was assured for some reason or other possibly because he was beginning to feel a reaction after the hard work of the summer nora fancied that his spirits were less high than usual he talked less of the coveted land than was his custom she herself had never in all her healthy life felt so glowing with health and strength she too had worked hard finding almost every day some new task to perform but aside from the natural fatigue at night which long hours of dreamless sleep entirely dissipated she felt all the better for her new experiences for one thing her steady improvement in all the arts of the good housewife made her daily routine much easier as well as giving her much secret satisfaction never in her life had she looked so well the summer sun had given her a color which was most becoming chapter xvi one afternoon shortly after dinner she had gone out to gather a nosegay of wild flowers to brighten her little livingroom she was busily engaged in arranging them in a pudding bowl smiling to think that her hand had lost none of the cunning to which miss wickham had always paid grudging tribute even if her improvised vase was of homely ware when she heard her husbands step at the door it was so unusual for him to return at this hour that for a moment she was almost startled i didnt know you were about oh he said easily i aint got much to do today ive been out with sid sharp and a man come over from prentice from prentice having arranged her flowers to her satisfaction she stepped back to view the effect at that moment her husbands eye fell on them say what you got there arent they pretty i picked them just now theyre so gay and cheerful very but his tone had none of the enthusiasm with which he usually greeted her efforts to beautify the house a few flowers make the shack look more bright and cozy he took in the room with a glance that approved of everything youve made it a real home nora mrs sharp never stops talking of how youve done it she was saying only the other day it was because you was a lady it does make a difference i guess although i didnt use to think so nora gave him a smile full of indulgence im glad you havent found me quite a hopeless failure i guess ive never been so comfortable in all my life its what i always said once english girls do take to the life they make a better job of it than anybody whats the man come over from prentice for asked nora they were approaching a subject she always avoided i guess you aint been terribly happy here my girl he said gravely unmindful of her question what on earth makes you say that youve got too good a memory i guess and you aint ever forgiven me for that first night it was the first time he had alluded to the subject for months would he never understand that she wanted to forget it he might know that it always irritated her i made up my mind very soon that i must accept the consequences of what id done ive tried to fall in with your ways she said coldly you was clever enough to see that i meant to be the master in my own house and that i had the strength to make myself so how unlike his latter self this boastful speech was but then he had been utterly unlike himself for several days what did he mean she knew him well enough by now to know that he never acted without meaning but directness was one of his most admirable characteristics it was unlike him to be devious as he was being now but if the winter had taught her anything it had taught her patience ive cooked for you mended your clothes and ive kept the shack clean ive tried to be obliging and and obedient the last word was not yet an easy one to pronounce i guess you hated me though sometimes he gave a little chuckle no one likes being humiliated and you humiliated me eds coming here presently my girl ed who your brother ed eddie when why right away i guess he was in prentice this morning how do you know he phoned over to sharp to say he was riding out oh how splendid why didnt you tell me before i didnt know about it is that why you asked me if i was happy i couldnt make out what was the matter with you well i guess i thought if you still wanted to quit eds coming would be kind of useful nora sat down in one of the chairs and gave him a long level look what makes you think that i want to she said quietly you aint been so very talkative these last months but i guess it wasnt so hard to see sometimes that youd have given pretty near anything in the world to quit ive no intention of going back to eddies farm if thats what you mean to this he made no reply still with the same grave air he went over to the door and started out again pausing a moment after he had crossed the threshold if ed comes before i get back tell him i wont be long i guess you wont be sorry to do a bit of yarning with him all by yourself you are not going away with the idea that im going to say beastly things to him about you are you no i guess not that aint your sort perhaps we dont know the best of one another yet but i reckon we know the worst by this time frank she said sharply theres something the matter what is it why no theres nothing why youve not been yourself the last few days i guess thats only your imagination well id better be getting along sid and the other fellowll be waiting for me without another look in her direction he was gone closing the door after him nora remained quite still for several minutes biting her lips and frowning in deep thought it was all very well to say that there was nothing the matter but there was did he think she could live with him day after day all these months and not notice his change of mood even if she could not translate it he had still a great deal to learn about women on the way over to the shelf to get her work she paused a moment beside her flowers to cheer herself once more with their brightness sitting down by the table she began to darn one of her husbands thick woolen socks an instant later she was startled by a loud knock on the door with a little cry of pleasure she flung it open to find eddie standing outside she gave a cry of delight somehow the interval since she had seen him last significant as it was in bringing to her the greatest change her life had known seemed for the second longer than all the years she had spent in england without seeing him eddie oh my dear im so glad to see you she cried flinging her arms around his neck hulloa there he said awkwardly but how did you come i didnt hear any wheels look he pointed over to the shed she looked over his shoulder to see reggie hornby grinning at her from the seat of a wagon why its reggie hornby reggie she called reggie took off his broad hat with a flourish tell him he can put the horse in the leanto all right reg called marsh give the old lady a feed and put her in the leanto righto didnt you meet frank hes only just this moment gone out no hell be back presently now come in oh my dear it is splendid to see you youre looking fine nora have you had your dinner sure we got something to eat before we left prentice well youll have a cup of tea no i wont have any thanks ah laughed nora happily youre not a real canadian yet if you refuse a cup of tea when its offered you but do sit down and make yourself comfortable she said fairly pushing him into a chair how are you getting along nora his manner was still a little constrained they were both thinking of their last parting but she being a woman could carry it off better oh never mind about me she said gayly tell me all about yourself hows gertie and what has brought you to this part of the world and whats reggie hornby doing here and is thingamajig still with you you know the hired man the word other almost slipped out what was his name trotter wasnt it oh my dear dont sit there like a stuffed pig but answer my questions or ill shake you my dear child i cant answer fifteen questions all at once oh eddie im so glad to see you you are a perfect duck to come and see me now let me get a word in edgeways i wont utter another syllable but for goodness sake hurry up i want to know all sorts of things well the most important thing is that im expecting to be a happy father in three or four months oh eddie im so glad how happy gertie must be she doesnt know what to make of it but i guess shes pleased right enough she sends you her love and says she hopes youll follow her example very soon i said nora sharply but she added with a return to her gay tone youve not told me what youre doing in this part of the world anyway anyway nora blushed ive practically spoken to no one but frank for months its natural that i should fall into his way of speaking well when i got franks letter about the clearingmachine frank has written to you why yes didnt you know he said there was a clearingmachine going cheap at prentice ive always thought i could make money down our way if i had one they say you can clear from three to four acres a day with one frank thought it was worth my while to come and have a look at it and he said he guessed youd be glad to see me how funny of him not to say anything to me about it said nora frowning once more i suppose he wanted to surprise you and now for yourself how do you like being a married woman oh all right but you havent answered half my questions yet why has reggie hornby come with you do you realize ive not seen you since before you were married thats so you havent have you ive been a bit anxious about you thats why when frank wrote about the clearingmachine i didnt stop to think about it but just came it was awfully nice of you but why has reggie hornby come oh hes going back to england is he yes he got them to send his passage money at last his ship doesnt sail till next week and he said he might just as well stop over here and say goodby to you how has he been getting on how do you expect he looks upon work as something that only damned fools do wheres frank oh hes out with sid sharp sids our neighbor he has the farm you passed on your way here getting on all right with him nora why of course said nora with just a suggestion of irritation in her voice whats that boy doing all this time she asked going over to the window and looking out he is slow isnt he but marsh was not a man whom it was easy to sidetrack its a great change for you this after the sort of life youve been used to i was rather hoping youd have some letters for me said nora from the window i havent had a letter for a long time as a matter of fact she had no reason to expect any not having answered miss pringles last and having practically no other correspondent but the speech was a happy one in that it created the desired diversion there now said her brother with an air of comical consternation ive got a head like a sieve two came by the last mail i didnt forward them because i was coming myself you dont mean to tell me youve forgotten them no here they are nora took them with a show of eagerness they dont look very exciting she said glancing at them ones from agnes pringle the ladys companion that i used to know at tunbridge wells you remember and the others from mr wynne whos he oh he was miss wickhams solicitor he wrote to me once before to say he hoped i was getting on all right i dont think i want to hear from people in england any more she said in a low voice more to herself than to him tossing the letters on the table my dear why do you say that its no good thinking of the past is it arent you going to read your letters not now ill read them when im alone dont mind me its silly of me but letters from england always make me cry nora then you arent happy here why shouldnt i be then why havent you written to me but once since you were married i hadnt anything to say and then carrying the war into the enemys quarter id been practically turned out of your house i dont know what to make of you frank taylors kind to you and all that sort of thing isnt he very but dont crossexamine me theres a dear when i asked you to come and make your home with me i thought it mightnt be long before you married but i didnt expect you to marry one of the hired men oh my dear please dont worry about me nora was about at the end of her endurance its all very fine to say that but youve got no one in the world belonging to you except me dont i tell you nora now listen weve never quarreled once since the first day i came here now are you satisfied she said it bravely but it was with a feeling of unspeakable relief that she saw reggie hornby at the door she certainly had never before been so genuinely glad to see him as she smilingly held out her hand her eye took in his changed appearance gone were the overalls and the flannel shirt the heavy boots and broad belt before her stood the reggie of former days in a wellcut suit of blue serge and spotless linen she was surprised to find herself thinking after all men looked better in flannels i was wondering what on earth you were doing with yourself she said gayly i say he said his eye taking in the bright little room this is a swell shack youve got ive tried to make it look pretty and homelike helloa whats this said marsh whose eye had fallen for the first time on the bowl of flowers arent they pretty ive only just picked them theyre mustard flowers we call them weeds have you much of it oh yes lots why oh nothing eddie tells me youre going home yes said reggie seating himself and carefully pulling up his trousers im fed up for my part with gods own country nature never intended me to be an agricultural laborer no and what are you going to do now loaf mr hornbys tone expressed profound conviction wont you get bored smiled nora im never bored it amuses me to watch other people do things i should hate my fellowcreatures to be idle i should think one could do more with life than lounge around clubs and play cards with people who dont play as well as oneself hornby gave her a quick ironic look i quite agree with you he said with his most serious air ive been thinking things over very seriously this winter im going to look out for a middleaged widow with money wholl adopt me i recall that you have decided views about the white mans burden all i want is to get through life comfortably i dont mean to do a stroke more work than im obliged to and im going to have the very best time i can im sure you will said nora smiling but her smile was a little mechanical somehow she could no longer be genuinely amused at such sentiments which in spite of his airy manner she knew to be real and yet it was not so very long ago that she would have thought them perfectly natural in a man of his position somehow her old standards were not as fixed as she had thought them the moment i get back to london continued hornby imperturbably im going to stand myself a bangup dinner at the ritz then i shall go and see some musical comedy at the gaiety and after that ill have a slapup supper at romanos england with all thy faults i love thee still he finished piously i suppose its being alone with the prairie all these months said nora more to herself than him but things that used to seem clever and funny well i see them altogether differently now im afraid you dont altogether approve of me he said quite unabashed i dont think you have much pluck said nora not unkindly oh i dont know about that ive as much as anyone else i expect only i dont make a fuss about it oh pluck to stand up and let yourself be shot at she flushed slightly at the remembrance of frank standing in this very room in front of the gun in her hand would she ever forget his laugh but pluck to do the same monotonous thing day after day plain honest hard work you havent got that sort of pluck youre a failure and the worst of it is youre not ashamed of it it seems to fill you with selfsatisfaction oh youre incorrigible she ended with a laugh i am lets let it go at that i suppose theres nothing you want me to take home i shall be going down to tunbridge wells to see mother got any messages i dont know that i have eddie has just brought me a couple of letters ill have a look at them first she went over to the table and picked up miss pringles letter and opened it after reading a few lines she gave a little cry oh whats the matter asked marsh what can she mean listen ive just heard from mr wynne about your good luck and im glad to say i have another piece of good news for you dropping the letter she tore open the other it contained a check she gave it a quick glance a check for five hundred pounds oh eddie listen she read from mr wynnes letter dear miss marsh i have had several interviews with mr wickham in relation to the late miss wickhams estate and i ventured to represent to him that you had been very badly treated now that everything is settled he wishes me to send you the enclosed check as some recognition of your devoted services to his late aunt five hundred pounds thats a very respectable sum said marsh nodding his head sagely i could do with that myself remarked hornby ive never had so much money in all my life but whats the other piece of good news that miss stickinthemud has for you oh i quite forgot where is it her brother stooped and picked the fallen letter from the floor thank you umumumumum oh yes piece of good news for you i write at once so that you may make your plans accordingly i told you in my last letter did i not of my sisterinlaws sudden death now my brother is very anxious that i should make my home with him so i am leaving mrs hubbard she wishes me to say that if you care to have my place as her companion she will be very pleased to have you i have been with her for thirteen years and she has always treated me like an equal she is very considerate and there is practically nothing to do but to exercise the dear little dogs the salary is thirtyfive pounds a year but said marsh looking at the envelope in his hand the letter is addressed to miss marsh id intended to ask you about that dont they know youre married no i havent told them what a lark said reggie slapping his knee you could go back to tunbridge wells and none of the old frumps would ever know youd been married at all why so i could said nora in a breathless tone she gave hornby a strange look and turned toward the window to hide the fact that she had flushed to the roots of her hair her brother gave her a long look just clear out for a minute reg i want to talk with nora righto he disappeared in the direction of the shed nora do you want to clear out what on earth makes you think that i do you gave reg such a look when he mentioned it im only bewildered tell me did frank know anything about this my dear how could he its most extraordinary he was talking about my going away only a moment before you came about your going away but why she realized that she had betrayed herself and kept silent nora for goodness sake tell me if theres anything the matter cant you see its now or never youre keeping something back from me i could see it all along ever since i came arent you two getting on well together not very she said in a low shamed tone why in heavens name didnt you let me know i was ashamed but you just now said he was kind to you i have nothing to reproach him with i tell you i felt there was something wrong i knew you couldnt be happy with him a girl like you with your education and refinement and a man like him a hired man oh the whole thing would have been ridiculous if it werent horrible not that hes not a good fellow and as straight as they make them but well thank god im here and youve got this chance eddie what do you mean youre not fit for this life i mean youve got your chance to go back home to england for gods sake take it in six months time all youve gone through here will seem nothing but a hideous dream the expression of her face was so extraordinary such a combination of fear bewilderment and something that was far deeper than dismay that he stared at her for a moment without speaking nora whats the matter i dont know she said hoarsely but she did she did at his words the picture of the little shack her home now as it had looked the first time she saw it in all its comfortlessness its untidy squalor rose before her eyes and she saw a lonely man clumsily busying himself about the preparation of an illycooked meal and later sitting smoking in the desolate silence she saw him go forth to his daily toil with all the lightness gone from his step to return at nightfall with a heaviness born of more than mere physical fatigue to the same bleak bareness and she saw herself back at tunbridge wells no longer the mistress but the underpaid underling eating once more off fine old china at a table sparkling with silver and glass but the bread was bitter the bread of the dependent and she came and went at anothers bidding and the yoke was not easy she trod once more round and round in that little circle which she knew so well she used to think that the walls would stifle her how much more would they not stifle her now that she had known this larger freedom i say said reggies voice from the doorway heres someone coming to see you chapter xvii it was mrs sharp making her laborious way slowly up the path why said nora in a low voice its mrs sharp the wife of our neighbor whatever brings her here on foot she never walks a step if she can help it good afternoon mrs sharp she called mrs sharp had apparently come on some sudden impulse usually well as they knew each other by this time she always made more or less of a toilet before having her husband drive her over but today she had evidently come directly from her work she wore a battered old skirt and a faded shirtwaist none too clean on her head was an old sunbonnet the strings of which were tied in a hard knot under her fat chin come right in said nora cordially you do look warm good afternoon to you mrs taylor yes im all in a perspiration ive not walked so far well goodness alone knows when this is my brother said nora presenting eddie your brother is that who it is why you seem surprised mrs sharp forbore any explanation for the moment sinking heavily into the rocking chair she accepted with a grateful nod the fan that nora offered her there was nothing to do but to give her time to recover her breath nora and eddie sat down and waited i was so anxious mrs sharp at length managed to say still panting whether with exhaustion or emotion nora could not tell between her sentences i simply couldnt stay indoors another minute i went out to see if i could catch a sight of sid and i walked on and on and then i saw the rig whats outside and it gave me such a turn i thought it was the inspector i just had to come i was that nervous but why is anything the matter asked nora completely puzzled youre not going to tell me you dont know about it when sid and frank havent been talking about anything else since frank found it found it found what the weed said mrs sharp simply youve got it then said marsh with a slight gesture of his head toward the table where noras flowers made a bright spot of color its worse here at taylors but weve got it too what does she mean nora addressed herself to eddie abandoning all hope of getting anything out of her friend we cant make out who reported us it isnt as if we had any enemies went on mrs sharp gloomily as if nora wasnt present or at least hadnt spoken it isnt as if we had any enemies she repeated goodness knows weve never done anything to anybody oh theres always someone to report you after all its not to be wondered at no ones going to run the risk of letting it get on his own land and she has them in the house as if they were flowers exclaimed mrs sharp addressing the ceiling eddie i insist that you tell me what you two are talking about demanded nora hotly my dear said her brother these pretty little flowers which youve picked to make your shack look bright and and homelike may mean ruin eddie you must have heard why i remember telling you about it myself about this mustard this weed we farmers in canada have three enemies to fight frost hail and weed mrs sharp confirmed his words with a despairing nod of her head we was hailed out last year she said lost our whole crop never got a dollar for it and now if we lose it this year too why we might just as well quit and be done with it when it gets into your crop marsh explain for noras benefit youve got to report it if you dont one of the neighbors is sure to and then they send an inspector along and if he condemns it why you just have to destroy the whole crop and all your years work goes for nothing youre lucky in that case if youve got a bit of money laid by in the bank and can go on till next year when the next crop comes along weve only got a quartersection and weve got five children its not much money you can save then but began nora are they out with the inspector now asked marsh yes he came out from prentice this morning early this will be a bad job for frank yes but he hasnt got the mouths to feed that we have i cant think whats to become of us he can hire out again noras face flushed i i wonder why he hasnt told me anything about it i asked him only this morning what was troubling him i was sure there was something but he said not she said sadly oh i guess hes always been in the habit of keeping his troubles to himself and you havent taught him different yet nora was about to make a sharp retort but realizing that her good neighbor was half beside herself with anxiety and nervousness she said nothing a fact which the unobservant eddie noted with approval well he said as cheerfully as he could you must hope for the best mrs sharp sid says weve only got it in one place but perhaps hes only saying it so as i shouldnt worry but you know what them inspectors are they dont lose nothin by it it dont matter to them if you starve all winter suddenly she began to cry great sobs wracked her heavy frame the big tears rolled down her cheeks nora had never seen her give way before even when she talked of the early hardships she had endured or of the little one she had lost she was greatly moved for this good brave woman who had already suffered so much oh dont dont cry dear mrs sharp after all it may all turn out right they wont condemn the whole crop unless its very bad you know marsh reminded her too many people have got their eyes on it the machine agent and the loan company mrs sharp had regained her selfcontrol in sufficient measure to permit of her speaking she still kept making little dabs at her eyes with a red bandanna handkerchief and her voice broke occasionally what with the hail that comes and hails you out and the frost that kills your crop just when youre beginning to count on it and now the weed she had to stop again for a moment i cant bear any more if we lose this crop i wont go on ill make sid sell out and well go back home well take a little shop somewhere thats what i wanted to do from the beginning but sid sid always had his heart set on farming but you couldnt go back now said nora her face aglow you couldnt you never could be happy or contented in a little shop after the life youve had out here and think if youd stayed back in england youd have always been at the beck and call of somebody else and you own your land you couldnt do that back in england every time you come out of your door and look at the growing wheat arent you proud to think that its all yours i know you are ive seen it in your face you dont know all that ive had to put up with when the children came only once did i have a doctor all the rest of the times sid was all the help i had i might as well have been an animal i wish id never left home and come to this country that i do how can you say that look at your children how strong and healthy they are and think what a future they will have why theyll be able to help you both in your work soon youve given them a chance theyd never have had a chance back home you know that oh its all very well for them theyll have it easy i know that easier than their poor father and mother ever had but weve had to pay for it all in advance sid and me theyll never know what we paid ah but dont you see that it is because you were the first said nora going over to her and laying a friendly hand upon her arm mrs sharp was of course too preoccupied with her own troubles to realize even if she had known that the question of noras return to england had come up that her friend was doing some special pleading for herself against herself but to her brother who years before had in a lesser degree gone through the same searching experience the cause of her warmth was clear he nodded his approval its bitter work opening up a new country i realize that nora went on her eyes dark with earnestness unknown to herself she had a larger audience for hornby and frank stood silently in the open door marsh saw them and shook his head slightly he wanted nora to finish what if it is the others who reap the harvest dont you really believe that those who break the ground are rewarded in a way that the later comers never dream of i do shes right there broke in marsh i shall never forget mrs sharp what i felt when i saw my first crop spring up the thought that never since the world began had wheat grown on that little bit of ground before oh it was wonderful i wouldnt go back to england now to live for anything in the world i couldnt breathe youre a man you have the best of it and all the credit not with everyone said nora she fell on her knees beside the elder womans chair and stroked her workroughened old hand the outsiders dont know you mustnt blame them how could they its only those whove lived on the prairie who could know that the chief burden of the hardships of opening up a new country falls upon the women but the men who are the husbands they know and in their hearts they give us all credit i guess they do mrs sharp said marsh earnestly mrs sharp smiled gratefully on nora through her tears thank you for speaking so kindly to me my dear i know that you are right in every blessed thing youve said you must excuse me for being a bit downhearted for the moment the fact is im that nervous that i hardly know what im saying but youve done me no end of good thats right nora got slowly to her feet sid and frank will be here in a minute or two i am sure and youre perfectly right both of you mrs sharp repeated i couldnt go back and live in england again if we lose our crop well we must hang on some way till next year we shant starve exactly a persons got to take the rough with the smooth and take it by and large its a good country ah now youre talking more like yourself the self that used to cheer me up when turning she saw her husband standing in the doorway frank he was looking at her with quite a new expression how long had he been there had he heard all she had been saying to mrs sharp carried away by the emotion aroused by the secret conflict within her own heart she both hoped and feared that he had wheres sid said mrs sharp starting to her feet why hes up at your place hulloa ed saw you coming along in the rig earlier in the morning but i was surprised to find reg here didnt recognize him so far away in his store clothes must have been a pleasant surprise for you said hornby with conviction whats happened tell me whats happened mrs sharp came on here because she was too anxious to stay at home nora explained oh youre all right we are mrs sharp gave a sobbing gasp of relief only a few acres got to go that wont hurt you thank god for that and its goin to be the best crop we ever had its the finest country in the world her face was beaming youd better be getting back warned taylor sids taken the inspector up to give him some dinner he hasnt said mrs sharp indignantly if that isnt just like a man she made a gesture condemning the sex its a mercy theres plenty in the house but i must be getting along right away she bustled but you mustnt think of walking all that way back in the hot sun expostulated nora theres eddies rig reggie here will drive you over oh thank you kindly im not used to walking very much you know and id be all tuckered out by the time i got back home goodby all good afternoon mrs taylor good afternoon reggie you wont mind driving mrs sharp back its only just a little over a mile not a bit of it said hornby goodnaturedly ill come and help you put the mare in said marsh starting to follow hornby and mrs sharp down the path i guess its a relief to you now you know he called back to his brotherinlaw terrible i want to have a talk with you presently ed ill go on out with him i guess he said turning to his wife she nodded silently she was grateful to him for leaving her alone for a time they would have much to say to each other a little later hold on ed im coming right you are he ran lightly down the path where his brotherinlaw stood waiting for him she stood for a long moment looking down at the innocentlooking little blossoms on her table and they could cause such heartbreak and desolation ranking as engines of destruction with the frost and the hail could make such seasoned and tried women as mrs sharp weep and bring the gray look of apprehension into the eyes of a man like her husband those innocentlooking little flowers what must he have felt as he saw her arranging them so lightheartedly in her puddingdish that morning and yet rather than mar her pleasure he had choked back the impulse to speak yes that was like him for a moment they blurred as she looked at them she checked her inclination to throw them into the stove to burn them to ashes so that they could work their evil spells no more later on she would do so but she wanted them there until he returned she looked about the little room yes it was pretty and homelike deserving all the nice things people said about it and what a real pleasure she had had in transforming it from the dreadful little place it was when she first saw it into what it was now not that she could ever have worked the miracle alone she smiled sadly to herself how all her thoughts like homing pigeons had the one goal and how proud he was of it all with what delighted almost childlike interest he had watched each little change and how he had acquiesced in every suggestion and helped her to plan and carry out the things she could not have done alone she lived again those long winter evenings when snug and warm the grim cruelty of the storms shut out she had read aloud to him while he worked on making the chairs how long would it keep its prettiness with no womans eye to keep its jealous watch on it the process of reversion to its old desolation would be gradual the curtains the bright ribands the cushions would slowly become soiled and faded and there would be no one here to renew them for a moment the thought of asking mrs sharp to look after them came into her mind but no she certainly had enough to do and besides the thought thrilled her with delight he would not like having anyone else to touch them and she she would be back in that old life where such simple little things were a commonplace a matter of course and what interest would they be to her she could see herself ripping the ribands from an old hat to tie back curtains for mrs hubbard certainly that excellent lady would be astonished if she suggested doing anything of the sort and small wonder she hired the proper people to keep her house in order just as she was going to hire her she found it in her heart to be sorry for mrs hubbard she had always had her money the joy of these little miracles of contrivance had never been hers she had bought her home she had never in all her pampered life made one home what a desolating word it could be to the homeless she knew since her faroff childhood she had never called a place home till now and just as the word began to take on a new meaning she was going to leave it had anyone told her a few short months ago on the night that she had first seen what she had inwardly called a hovel that she would ever leave it with any faintest feeling of regret she would have called him mad regret why the thought of leaving tore her very heartstrings what if it had been only a few short months that had passed since then ones life is not measured by the ticking of a clock but by emotion and feeling she had crowded more emotion into these few short months than in all the rest of her dull uneventful life put together fear terror hatred murderous rage bitter humiliation she had felt them all within the small compass of these four walls and greatest of all why try to deceive her own heart any longer here she had known love she had fought off the acknowledgment of this the crowning experience and humiliation as long as she could she had called on her pride that pride which had never before failed her and now to herself she had to acknowledge that she was beaten they were all against her her own brother had spoken only a few moments ago of her marriage as horrible a girl like you and a hired man she could hear him now and he had spoken of her leaving as a matter of course he couldnt have done it if he had cared he liked the comforts that a woman brings to a house the little touches that no mans hand can give that a woman even as unskillful as she brings about instinctively that was all almost any other woman could do as well he did not prize her for herself and she would go back to england and as hornby had gleefully said no one need ever know she would have a place on sufferance in other peoples homes the only change that the year would have made in her life would be that the check in her pocket safely invested might save her eventually when she was too old to serve as a companion from being dependant on actual charity and to all outward intents and purposes the year would be as if it had never been in six months all youve gone through here will seem nothing but a hideous dream her brother had promised her was there ever a man since the world began that understood a woman a dream the only time in her life that she had really lived no all the rest of her life might be of the stuff that dreams are made on but not this and like a sleepwalker dead to all sensation she must go through with it and she was not yet thirty all of her fathers family and she was physically the daughter of her father not of her mother lived to such a great age in all human probability there would be at least fifty years of life left to her fifty years with all that made life worth living behind one she supposed he would eventually get a divorce she remembered to have heard that such things were easy out here not like it was in england and he was a man who would be sure to marry again he would want a family and it was some other woman who would be the mother of his children the wave of passion that swept her now made up of bitter regret of longing and of jealousy overwhelmed her as never before she had been pacing the room up and down up and down stopping now and then to touch some little familiar object with a touch that was a caress but at this last thought she sank into a chair and buried her face in her hands the storm of weeping which shook her had nearly spent itself when she heard steps coming toward the house a step that her heart had known for many a day drying her eyes quickly she went to the window and made a pretense of looking out that he might not see her tearstained face she made a last call on her pride and strength to carry her through the coming interview he should never know what leaving cost her that she promised herself chapter xviii ed drove over with reg and emma i guess he wont be very long there was something he wanted to say to old man sharp that hed forgot about then you didnt get your talk with him she was glad of that it was better to have their own talk first but as it had been he who had broached the subject of her leaving it was he who must reopen it no but i guess anything ive got to say to him will keep till he gets back eds thinking of buying a clearingmachine thats for sale over prentice way yes he told me without turning her head she could tell that he was looking around for the matches he never could remember that they were kept in a jar over on the shelf back of the stove he was going to smoke his pipe of course when men were nervous about anything they always flew to tobacco women were denied that poor consolation but she too felt the necessity of having something to occupy her hands she went back to the table and taking some of franks thick woolen socks from her basket sat down and began mechanically to darn them she purposely placed herself so that he could only see her profile even then he would see that her eyes were still red she hadnt had time to bathe them i suppose i look a sight but poor mrs sharp was so upset she broke down and cried and of course ive been crying too im so thankful its turned out all right for her poor thing i never saw her in such a state theyve got five children to feed i guess it would make a powerful lot of difference to them he said quietly i wish youd told me all about it before i felt that something was worrying you and i didnt know what there was a pause why didnt you tell me if i saved the crop there didnt seem any use fussing and if i didnt youd know soon enough how could you bear to let me put those dreadful flowers here in the house she said pointing to the bowl on the table oh i guess i didnt mind if it gave you any pleasure you didnt know they was only a weed and a poisonous one for us farmers you thought them darned pretty that was very kind of you frank said nora her voice shook a little in spite of her effort to control it i guess its queer that a darned little flower like that should be able to do so much damage that subject exhausted there came another pause he was very evidently waiting her lead could eddie have told him anything about the news from england no he hadnt had any opportunity besides it would have been very unlike eddie who as a general rule had a supreme talent for minding his own affairs how did it happen that you didnt tell me that you had written to eddie i guess i forgot she waited a few moments to make sure that her voice was quite steady frank eddie brought me some letters from home from england i mean today ive had an offer of a job back in england he got up slowly and went over to the corner where the broom hung to get some straws to run through the mouthpiece of his pipe his face was turned from her so that she could not see that he had closed his eyes for a moment and that his mouth was drawn with pain when he turned he had resumed his ordinary expression his voice was perfectly steady when he spoke an offer of a job gee i guess youll jump at that its funny it should have come just when you had been talking of my going away very not even a comment oh why didnt he say that he would be glad to have her gone and be done with it anything almost would be easier to bear than this total lack of interest she tried another tack have you any any objection i guess it wouldnt make a powerful lot of difference to you if i had he could actually smile his goodnatured indulgent smile which she knew so well what makes you think that oh i guess you only stayed on here because you had to noras work dropped in her lap is life always like that she said with bitter sadness the things youve wanted so dreadfully seem only to bring you pain when they come he gave her a swift glance but went on smoking quietly she went over to the window again and stood looking out at the stretch of prairie presently she spoke in a low voice but her words were addressed as much to herself as to him month after month this winter i used to sit here looking out at the prairie sometimes i wanted to scream at the top of my voice i felt that i must break that awful silence or go mad there were times when the shack was like a prison i thought i should never escape i was hemmed in by the snow and the cold and the stillness cut off from everything and everybody from all that had been the world i knew are you going to quit right now with ed he asked gently nora went slowly back to her chair you seem in a great hurry to be rid of me she said with the flicker of a smile well i guess we aint made a great success of our married life my girl he went over to the stove to knock the ashes from his pipe its rum when you come to figure it out he said when it was once more lighted i thought i could make you do everything i wanted just because i was bigger and stronger it sure did look like i held a straight flush and you beat me i said nora in astonishment why sure you dont mean to say you didnt know that i dont know at all what you mean i guess i was pretty ignorant about women his began pacing up and down the floor as he talked i guess i didnt know how strong a woman could be you was always givin way you done everything i told you and all the time you was keeping something back from me that i couldnt get at whenever i thought i was goin to put my hand on you zip you was away again i guess i found id only caught hold of a shadow i dont know what more you expected i didnt know you wanted anything more i guess i wanted love he said in a tone so low that she barely caught it he stood over by the table looking down on her from his great height his face was flushed but his eyes were steady and unashamed you she looked at him in absolute consternation her breath came in hurried gasps but her heart sang in her breast and the little pathetic droop of her mouth disappeared her telltale eyes dropped on her work not yet not yet she was greedy to hear more i know you now less well than when youd been only a week up to eds he resumed his pacing up and down i guess ive lost the trail im just beating round floundering in the bush i never knew you wanted love she said softly i guess i didnt know it until just lately either i suppose partings always rather painful she said with just the beginning of a little smile creeping round the corners of her lips if you go back when you go back he corrected himself to the old country i guess i guess youll never want to come back perhaps youll come over to england yourself one of these days if you only have a couple of good years you could easily shut up the place and run over for the winter she said shyly i guess that would be a dangerous experiment youll be a lady in england i guess id still be only the hired man youd be my husband nooo he said with a shake of the head i guess i wouldnt chance it she tried another way she was sure of her happiness now she could play with it a little longer youll write to me now and then and tell me how youre getting on wont you will you care to know he asked quickly why yes of course i shall well he said throwing back his head proudly ill write and tell you if im making good if i aint i guess i shant feel much like writing but you will make good frank i know you well enough for that do you his tone was grateful i have learned to to respect you during these months weve lived together you have taught me a great deal all sorts of qualities which i used to think of great value seem unimportant to me now i have changed my ideas about many things we have each learned something i guess he said generously nora gave him a grateful glance he stood for a moment at the far end of the room and watched her roll up the socks she had just darned how neat and deft she was after all there was something in being a lady as mrs sharp had said neither she nor gertie both capable women could do things in quite the same way that nora did oh why had she come into his life at all she had given him the taste for knowledge for better things of all sorts and now she was going away going away forever he had no illusions about her ever returning not she once she had escaped from a life she hated had she not just said as much when she said that the shack had seemed like a prison to her and now in place of going on in the old way that had always seemed good enough to him before he knew anything better mulling about getting his own meals with only one thought one ambition in the world the success of his crops and the acquisition of more land that he might some day in the dim future have a few thousands laid by he would always be wanting something he could never get without her more knowledge of the things that made life fuller and wider and broader the things that she prized and had known from her childhood it was cruel and unfair of her to have awakened the desire in him only to abandon him to have held the cup of knowledge to his lips for one brief instant and then leave him to go through life with his thirst unslaked not that she was intentionally cruel no he thought he knew all of her little faults of temper and of pride by this her heart was too kindly to let her wound him knowingly witness her tenderness to poor mrs sharp only this afternoon but it hurt none the less she had said that she had not known he wanted love how should she have guessed it but the real thing that tortured him most was the fact that he wanted her her her she had been his his woman no other woman in this broad earth could take her place a little sound like a groan escaped him youll think of me sometimes my girl wont you he said huskily i dont suppose i shall be able to help it she smiled at him over her shoulder as she crossed the room to restore her basket to its place i was an ignorant uneducated man i didnt know how to treat you properly i wanted to make you happy but i didnt seem to know just how to do it youve never been unkind to me frank youve been very patient with me i guess youll be happier away from me though and ill be able to think that youre warm and comfortable and at home and that youve plenty to eat do you think thats all i want she suddenly flashed at him he gave her a quick glance and looked away immediately i couldnt expect you to stay on here not when youve got a chance of going back to the old country this life is all new to you you know that one oh yes i know it i should think i did she gave a little mirthless laugh and went over to her chair again at eight oclock every morning a maid will bring me tea and hot water and i shall get up and i shall have breakfast and presently i shall interview the cook and i shall order luncheon and dinner and i shall brush the coats of mrs hubbards little dogs and take them for a walk on the common all the paths on the common are asphalted so that elderly gentlemen and ladys companions shant get their feet wet gee what a life she hardly gave him time for his exclamation as she went on mirth scorn hatred and dismay came into her voice but she was unconscious of it for the moment everything else was forgotten but the vivid picture which memory conjured up for her and which she so graphically described and then i shall come in and lunch and after luncheon i shall go for a drive one day we will turn to the right and one day we will turn to the left and then i shall have tea and then i shall go out again on the neat asphalt paths to give the dogs another walk and then i shall change my dress and come down to dinner and after dinner i shall play bezique with my employer only i must take care not to beat her because she doesnt like being beaten and at ten oclock i shall go to bed a wave of stifling recollection choked her for a moment so that she could not go on presently she had herself once more in hand at eight oclock next morning a maid will bring in my tea and hot water and the day will begin again each day will be like every other day and can you believe it there are hundreds of women in england strong and capable with red blood in their veins who would be eager to get this place which is offered to me almost a lady and thirtyfive pounds a year she did not look toward him or she would have seen a look of wonder of comprehension and of hope pass in turn over his face it seems a bit different from the life youve had here he said looking out through the open doorway as if to point his meaning and you she said turning her eyes upon him you will be clearing the scrub cutting down trees plowing the land sowing and reaping every day you will be fighting something frost hail or weed you will be fighting and i will know that you must conquer in the end where was wilderness will be cultivated land and who knows what starving child may eat the bread that has been made from the wheat that you have grown my life will be ineffectual and utterly useless while yours what do you mean nora nora he said more to himself than to her while i was talking to mrs sharp just now i didnt know what i was saying i was just trying to comfort her when she was crying and it seemed to me as if someone else was speaking and i listened to myself i thought i hated the prairie through the long winter months and yet somehow it has taken hold of me it was dreary and monotonous and yet i cant tear it out of my heart theres beauty and a romance about it which fills my very soul with longing i guess we all hate the prairie sometimes but when youve once lived on it it aint easy to live anywhere else i know the life now its not adventurous and exciting as they think back home for men and women alike its the same hard work from morning till night and i know its the women who bear the greater burden the men go into the towns they have shooting now and then and the changing seasons bring variety in their work but for the women its always the same weary round cooking washing sweeping mending in regular and ceaseless rotation and yet its all got a meaning we too have our part in opening up the country we are its mothers and the future is in us we are building up the greatness of the nation it needs our courage and strength and hope and because it needs them they come to us oh frank i cant go back to that petty narrow life what have you done to me i guess if i asked you to stay now youd stay he said hoarsely you said you wanted love the lovely color flooded her face didnt you see love has been growing in me slowly month by month and i wouldnt confess it i told myself i hated you its only today when i had the chance of leaving you forever that i knew i couldnt live without you im not ashamed any more frank my husband i love you he made a stride forward as if to take her in his arms and then stopped short smitten by a recollection i i guess ive loved you from the beginning nora he stammered she had risen to her feet and stood waiting him with shining eyes but why do you say it as if what is it frank i cant ask you to stay on now i guess youll have to take that job in england for a while anyway why the inspectors condemned my whole crop im busted oh why didnt you tell me i just guess i couldnt i made up my mind when i married you that id make good i couldnt expect you to see that it was just bad luck anyone may get the weed in his crop but i guess a man oughtnt to have bad luck the odds are that its his own fault if he has ah now i understand about your sending for eddie i wrote to him when i knew id been reported but what are you going to do its all right about me i can hire out again its you im thinking of i felt pretty sure you wouldnt go back to eds i dont fancy you taking a position as lady help i didnt know what was going to become of you my girl and when you told me of the job youd been offered in england i thought id have to let you go without letting me know you were in trouble why if i wasnt smashed up dyou think id let you go by god i wouldnt id have kept you by god id have kept you then youre going to give up the land she made a sweeping gesture which took in the prospect without no he said shaking his head i guess i cant do that ive put too much work in it and ive got my back up now i shall hire out for the summer and next winter i can get work lumbering the lands my own now ill come back in time for the plowing next year he had been gazing sadly out of the door as he spoke he turned to her now ready to bring her what comfort he could but in place of the tearful face he had expected to see he saw a face radiant with joy and the light of love in her hand was a little slip of colored paper which she held out to him look whats that the nephew of the lady i was with so long miss wickham you know has made me a present of it five hundred pounds thats twentyfive hundred dollars isnt it you can take the quartersection youve wanted so long next to this one you can get all the machinery you need and she gave a little happy mirthful laugh you can get some cows ive learned to do so many things i guess i can learn to milk if youll teach me and be very very patient about it anyway its yours to do what you like with now will you keep me oh my girl how shall i ever be able to repay you good heavens i dont want thanks theres nothing in all the world so wonderful as to be able to give to one you love frank wont you kiss me he folded her in his arms i guess its the first time you ever asked me to do that im sure im the happiest woman in all the world she said happily as they stood in the doorway he with his arm about her they saw eddie coming up the path toward them marshs honest face never a good mask for hiding his feelings wore an expression of bewildered astonishment at their lovelike attitude its all right old dear said nora with a happy laugh dont try to understand it youre only a man but im not going back to england to mrs hubbard and her horrid little dogs im going to stay right here this overgrown baby has worked on my feelings by pretending that he needs me and now if youll be good enough to hurry reggie a little well all have some supper its long past the proper time and as she bustled about her preparations her brother heard her singing one of the longago
