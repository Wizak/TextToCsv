television at first i did not think about my father then i remembered he was flying back from sydney on that day oh no i cried i telephoned the airport but they did not know the names of all the passengers then perhaps my father didnt get that plane i thought oh please please my mother was at work and i called her on the telephone she came home quickly and we went to the airport and waited for news later we learned my father was on the plane its not true i shouted but it was true and i began to cry i cried for weeks and weeks i spent many days alone in my room i was lonely and sad and i wanted to die too i stopped going out with my friends i didnt want to see other people i stopped listening to jake rossos records and took his pictures off my bedroom wall i didnt listen to music or watch television nothing mattered any more then i stopped crying i stopped feeling sad and began to feel angry why did it happen to him i asked my mother why do the best people die jake rosso my father i i dont know carol my mother said she was unhappy too at the time of the plane crash i was a student at college i enjoyed the work and college life very much but after my fathers death i

thought i hope my mother gets the job soon after the door opened and my mother came out she was smiling greta ross said please wait here for a minute mrs sanders i want to make a phone call she went back into the room and closed the door i was sitting on a chair near the door and i could just hear greta rosss voice speaking on the phone i think ive found someone she was saying she has a daughter

came out of the room youve got the job she told my mother my mother was pleased thank you she replied i was pleased too but now i was worried about that phone call i didnt understand it chapter two the island we went to scotland the next day first by plane then by train greta ross travelled with us i looked out of the train window and saw fields and villages and mountains mum is right i thought scotland is a very beautiful place youre going to be my husbands secretary greta ross told my mother hes a businessman but he never leaves the island he does all his work by telephone and letter and computer he invests money in companies all over the world do many people live on the island i asked not many said greta ross youll meet them soon greta ross is young i thought is her husband young too how can a young man buy an island is he very rich after the train we went on mr rosss boat which took us out to the island the boatman was a young man he had dark hair and was brown from the sun this is tony said greta ross he works for mr ross hi said tony soon we were near the island i could see the beaches and the cliffs the boat slowed down there are dangerous rocks around the island explained tony a lot of them are under the water and you cant see them i have to be careful but the rocks keep other boats away and that pleases mr ross why i asked tony looked at greta ross but she wasnt listening mr ross doesnt like visitors to the island tony said in a quiet voice then greta ross looked at us and tony said no more why doesnt mr ross like visitors i thought has he something to hide when we arrived on the island my mother and i followed greta up to the house it was very big and there were trees all around it a woman was waiting inside the house this is mrs duncan tonys mother said greta shes the housekeeper and her husband is the gardener mrs duncan will take you up to your rooms im going to tell mr ross youve arrived the housekeeper was a little woman with short hair she went up the stairs and my mother and i went after her my room was next to my mothers i looked out of the window and saw the gardens at the back of the house a man was working in the garden near some trees is that mr duncan i thought i looked between the trees and saw the sea its a beautiful house and a beautiful island that evening we had dinner with mr and mrs duncan and tony we ate in the big kitchen what happened to mr rosss last secretary asked my mother shes in hospital replied mrs duncan shes going to be away all summer isnt mrs ross lonely here i said no said mrs duncan she likes painting a lot she has a room upstairs and goes there to paint shes very good sometimes she goes to different places on the island to paint pictures we finished eating our meal soon after greta ross came into the kitchen mr ross wants to see you and your daughter now mrs sanders she said follow me please we followed her through the house and into a big room this was mr rosss office and he was sitting behind a desk i was surprised he was a young man about thirty he had a moustache short dark hair and he wore glasses mr ross was speaking into the telephone who does he look like i thought is it tony duncan mr ross is talking to a business friend in new york said greta please sit down while we waited i looked around the office there were three telephones a computer and lots of books and papers there was another door and i could see a smaller room next to the office there was a smaller desk and another computer in there mr ross finished speaking on the phone then looked carefully at my mother and me for a few seconds he didnt speak and just watched us then he said im pleased to meet you mrs sanders i need some help with my work my secretary is in hospital and theres a lot of work to do sometimes youll have to work late at night because of time differences in new york and tokyo is that all right yes thats all right said my mother can you use a computer yes good he looked at me is this your daughter yes this is carol said my mother hallo i said greta says you like gardening theres a big garden here so you can help mr duncan and theres a farm dan and stella parks live in the farmhouse and work on the farm you can help them too we have some animals some sheep a few cows and chickens and theres a horse called smoke hes grey like his name can you ride yes i said i can ride a horse you can ride smoke around the island if you like id like that i said thank you and we grow vegetables and fruit he said i work on the farm sometimes i enjoy it i smiled at him but he didnt smile back carol will enjoy working on the farm said my mother wont you carol yes i said mr ross looks sad i thought but how did he get all his money and why does he hide away on an island chapter three the photograph i worked in the garden for the first two days the weather was hot and sunny i liked working with mr duncan and he was pleased with my work youre a good gardener he said ive always liked gardening i said but im studying at college to be a farmer sometimes i saw greta ross she likes to be alone i thought once or twice i saw greta go out with her painting things she went up on the hills or down to the beach mr duncan took me to the farm and i met dan and stella parks they were very friendly you can work on the farm for the next three days said dan parks mr duncan says youre a good gardener are you a good farmer too i smiled at him i am i said he smiled back so i worked on the farm with mr and mrs parks they were nice people i helped with the cows and the chickens and went up on the hills with mr parks and his dog to look at the sheep one afternoon i went out riding smoke was a big lazy friendly horse i enjoyed riding and smoke knew his way around the island very well i learned new places to go to i rode along the cliff top and then in between some trees when we came out of the trees i saw the house from the other side i tried to find the window of my room which one was it suddenly i saw a face at one of the windows the face was looking at me it was there for just a second or two then it moved away quickly who was that i thought was it mr ross and which room was it i didnt see my mother very much that first week she worked all day and in the evenings she wrote letters to south america japan canada and australia sometimes she worked after i was in bed mr ross works hard she told me he invests money in many companies and countries but its not his money its not i was surprised by this no its his wifes money and she bought the island its her island her house her farm everything belongs to her how strange but why does mr ross always look sad and why does he never leave the island i asked i dont know said my mother he says he likes it here and likes working on his farm its strange i know sometimes when i finished work i walked along the beaches or the cliffs or i went swimming in the sea i liked swimming greta ross often came to the beach to swim but mr ross never came stay away from the rocks carol greta ross told me theyre very dangerous i will i said sometimes i took my camera to the beach and took photographs of some of the boats that went by i took photographs of the birds on the cliffs there were other small islands near our island and boats with tourists stopped at them but no boats stopped at our island they kept away from the dangerous rocks tony was right the island did not have visitors one day i was walking back to the house and had my camera with me i stopped and looked at the big house mr duncan was working in the garden in front of it at first he didnt see me im going to take a photograph of the house i thought the sun is in just the right place and it will make a good picture i looked at the building through my camera and took the photograph mr ross was coming out of a door he was in my picture too and he looked angry thats all right i thought its still a good photograph but mr duncan was running across the grass he came quickly up to me and said give me your camera he looked very worried whats wrong i asked in surprise i gave him the camera never take photographs of mr ross he said and then he opened the back of my camera and took out the film hey what are you doing i said youll spoil my film but he didnt stop sorry he said and he put the film into his pocket but no pictures of mr ross he doesnt like people to take pictures of him mr ross was watching us he saw the camera and he saw mr duncan take out the film but he said nothing then he turned and went back into the house later i told my mother about mr duncan and the camera he spoiled my film i said i dont understand she said why did he do that i dont know i said but theres something strange about mr ross about a week later i finished work early one day and came back to the house my mother was working in her small room next to mr rosss office mrs duncan was in the kitchen greta ross was painting in her room upstairs i went to my room and began reading a book i was sitting beside the window after half an hour i got tired of reading i looked out at the rain and the grey sea and rocks between the trees my book isnt very interesting i thought i got up and went out of my room i walked along the passage and turned a corner then i saw the door at the end of the passage there was a large plant in a plant pot outside the door where does that door go i thought i havent seen it before i remembered the face at the window in my first week on the island perhaps its the door to that room i thought i walked along to the door and turned the handle the door didnt move it was locked what are you doing said a voice behind me i turned round quickly and saw greta ross she looked angry that room is private she said im sorry i said i didnt stay away from there she told me i told my mother about the locked door whats behind it i said is it a secret i dont know said my mother it doesnt matter mr ross can have locked rooms if he wants them i think he does have secrets i said theres something strange about him theres something strange about this island somebody isnt telling us something something important my mother laughed stop playing detective carol she said chapter four the locked room two days later there was a storm in the middle of the night i was hot and i couldnt sleep i got out of bed went across to the window and looked out at the night black clouds hurried across the sky and the trees moved wildly in the wind the rain made a loud noise on the window i opened my window and put my head out into the wind and the rain i looked at the other windows in the house most of them were dark but one window had a light in it somebody isnt sleeping i thought which room is that there were six windows between my window and the room with the light and there are six doors between my room and the locked door i thought that light is in the locked room somebodys in there i put on my dressinggown and went out of my room the house was dark and at first i couldnt see very well i walked along the passage and turned the corner there it was the locked room and there was a light under the door i went nearer and heard noises somebodys moving about in the locked room i thought who is it then the light went off and the door opened i was afraid to move somebody came out of the room and into the dark passage lightning suddenly lit up the house and i saw who it was its mr ross i thought what was he doing in that room in the middle of the night i didnt move and he didnt see me he locked the door of the room carefully he didnt put the key in his pocket but hid it in the plant pot next to the door hes coming along here i thought i must get back to my room and i ran back along the passage mr ross heard me whos that he called i didnt answer but ran into my room and closed the door he came along the passage and stopped outside my door then he walked past and went on down the stairs i took off my dressinggown and went back to bed i was shaking because i was afraid now i know how to get into the locked room i thought but whats in there there was no storm in the morning but it was still raining i got up early and worked on the farm there were eggs from the chickens and i put them in boxes i helped to milk the cows and then took them out to the field later i went back into the house for breakfast did you sleep all right last night asked mrs duncan or did the storm wake you up i slept all right i said i didnt want to tell her about the light in the locked room or about mr ross after breakfast i went back upstairs mr ross was talking on the telephone in his office my mother was working at her desk i knew that mrs duncan was in the kitchen and that mr duncan was working in the garden wheres mrs ross i thought then i looked out of the window and saw her with tony duncan they were walking to the boat hes taking her out in the boat i thought perhaps shes going to edinburgh the boat moved away from the island and i waited until it was out at sea then i opened the door of my room there was nobody in the passage and i ran along to the locked room the key was still in the plant pot and i took it out my hand was shaking then i unlocked the door chapter five a dead man i went into the room and i was very surprised the room was full of strange things colored shirts and suits three guitars and there were posters and photographs on the walls i looked at the posters jake rossos face looked down at me i looked at the dead jake rossos picture and i remembered all the photographs on the walls of my room in hong kong i could never forget that face the face of my favourite singer then while i looked at his face something strange happened i began to see another face in the posters an older face and with a moustache but the same face i saw the face of mr ross no i said its not true but it was i knew it was mr ross is jake rosso no said a voice behind me i turned round and saw mr ross he was standing in the doorway he looked afraid i dont believe you i said you have to believe me i looked at the posters who is that if its not you its jake rosso he was my brother thats not true i shouted i dont believe you listen jake rosso was my favourite singer i had hundreds of photos of him i still have all his records i loved him do you understand thousands of people loved him hes dead mr ross said quietly no i shouted youre jake rosso you look different now yes youve got short hair youve got a moustache now and you wear glasses but youre jake rosso you were my favourite pop star so i know mr ross said nothing and watched my face he doesnt know what to do i thought he knows i dont believe him and hes afraid then he said it was you in the passage last night wasnt it yes i answered he
