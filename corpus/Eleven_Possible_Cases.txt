nym crinkle shall he marry her anna katherine green the only girl at overlook by franklin fyles chapter i two names were used for the only girl at overlook in addressing her the men of the place always said miss warriner in mentioning her they often said mary mite the reason for this distinctive difference was revealed by the sight of miss mary warriner herself as she sat on a high stool behind a rude desk under a roughlyboarded shelter and with rapid fingers clicked the key of a telegraphic instrument there was a perfect poise of quiet selfpossession which would have been very impressive dignity in an older and bigger person and which although here limited by eighteen years and one hundred pounds still made a demand for respectful treatment therefore the men when in her presence never felt like calling her anything else than miss warriner if she had been less like a stately damsel in miniature and more like such a child as she was in size only if her employment had been something not so near to science as that of telegraphy and not so far off from juvenile simplicity if her brown hair had been loosely curled instead of closely coiled and if her skirts had stopped at her ankles instead of reaching to her feet then she might have been nicknamed mary mite within her own hearing as she was beyond it by those who described her smallness in a sobriquet there may have been a variance of opinion among those dwellers at overlook who had made any estimate of her composure but if there was one who believed that she merely assumed a reserve of manner because she was among two hundred men he had not yet tried his chances of exceptional acquaintance overlook was crude and temporary the inhabitants were making a roadbed for a new railway at a spot where the job was extraordinary requiring an uncommonly large proportion of brain to brawn in the work those who were mental laborers in the remarkable feat of engineering or were at least bosses of the physical toil were the ones who had errands at the telegraphic shed and for whom mary sent and received messages over the wires the isolated colony of workers was one hundred miles deep in a wilderness of mountain and forest but not as many seconds distant measured by the time necessary for electrical communication from the construction companys headquarters in a great city must you wait for an answer mary said as she clicked the last word of a message its an hour since your first telegram went and they seem in no hurry to reply polite indifference and nothing else was in her clear gentle voice there was neither boldness nor shyness in the eyes that opened wide and blue as she lifted them from the paper to the man whom she questioned there was no more of a smile than of a pout on the mouth that worded the inquiry she did not indicate the faintest interest as to whether he went or stayed although she did suggest that he might as well go id rather lounge here if you dont mind was gerald heaths answer here the alertness of the placid girl was faintly shown by a quick glance but it was so furtive that the subject of her wariness did not know his face was being scrutinized and she was quickly convinced that she was not the cause of his remaining for he said ill tell you why im anxious about the telegram and in a hurry to get it gerald heath had been lazily leaning against the makeshift desk of the telegrapher as he waited and for pastime had whittled the smooth birch sapling that formed its outer edge he had chipped and shaved after the manner of those to whom a sharp pocket knife and a piece of wood provide a solace there had been no conversation except a few words concerning the messages but now he heightened himself to six feet by standing erect and took on the outlines of a magnificent physique his proportions had not been realized before by the girl at the other side of the counter she comprehended too that if his somewhat unkempt condition were changed to one which included a face cleaned of stubbed beard a suit of modish clothes to replace the halfworn corduroys and the shine of a silk hat and polished boots at his now dusty extremities he would become a young gentleman whose disregard might be an appreciable slight that was the conclusion which she reached without any visible sign that her careless eyes were conveying any sort of impression to her mind as it was he looked an unusually burly specimen of the men to whom isolation from city life had imparted an aspect of barbarians before he had uttered another word she realized that he was wholly engrossed in the matter of his telegrams and had no thought of the individuality of the listener not only was she not the thing that made him wait but she might as well have been old ugly or a man if only she had ears to hear it was a summer afternoon and the clear balmy weather was seasonable the removal of protective canvas had left the structure an open shed over the front of which hung the boughs of the two trees against whose massive trunks it leaned gerald heath reached up with both hands and held the foliage aside do you get an unobstructed view he said now ive helped lay out railroads through many a place where it was a shame to let trains go faster than a mile a day ive surveyed routes that ought to provide special trains for passengers with eyes in their heads trains with speed graduated between sixty miles an hour and sixty hours a mile it is an outrage on nature and art that travelers should ever be whisked past overlook without a good chance to see what were looking at thats why i wrote to the president of the company a month ago telling him how a slight deviation from the surveyed line would enable passengers to get whats in our view now he asked how much the line would be lengthened by my plan a hundred yards i answered and i submitted a map showing how the tracks after coming out from the tunnel might make a small detour to this very spot instead of going behind a mass of rocks that will completely hide this and a comprehensive gesture of one arm followed his sweep of vision places that get their names on impulse are apt to have appropriate ones camps of railway makers in a hitherto unbroken country are not often miscalled an ensuing town on the same site may be unmeaningly named as a permanency but the inspirations that afford transient nomenclature are usually descriptive it was so in the case of overlook the railway tunneled through the mountain and emerged at a height of feet above a wide valley mary had daily and all day long sat overlooking the prospect it had astonished and enchanted her at first but familiarity had blunted the keenness of her appreciation as shown to her anew it was like a fresh disclosure gerald heath stood holding aside the boughs which otherwise obscured a part of the landscape and seemed like an exhibitor of some wondrously big and beautiful picture miles away were hills rising behind one another until they left only a little of sky to be framed by the eave of the shed as seen by the telegrapher the diversities of a wilderness distantly strong in rugged forms but indistinct in details became gradually definite and particular as they came nearer and were suggestive of conscious design where they edged a broken tumultuous river overlook was shelved so high on a precipitous mountain that from marys point of vision the foreground almost directly underneath passed out of her sight and it was as though the spectator stood on a platform before a painted canvas too spacious for exhibition in an ordinary manner but in this work the shapes and the colors the grandeur and the beauty were inconceivably beyond human copying gerald heath appeared to feel however that if he was not the painter of this enormous landscape he at least had the proprietary interest of a discoverer and it was with something of the air of an art collector proudly extolling his choicest possession that he turned his eyes from it to mary warriner the expression of admiration on her face although quiet and delicate was quite satisfactory for a moment only and then the denotement of delight passed out of her visage as though expelled by some physical pang it was the suddenness of the change for it was of itself very slight that made it perceptible gerald instinctively turned to look for the cause into the picture had come a human figure a few yards in front of the hut stood a man in relation to the landscape far beyond he was gigantic and the shade of the trees made him devilishly black by contrast with the sunlight of heaven that illumined the rest he was thus for an instant in silhouette and it chanced that his sharp outlines included a facial profile with the points of a mustache and beard giving satanic suggestion to an accidental attitude of malicious intrusion the illusion was almost startling but it was momentary and then the form became the commonplace one of tonio ravelli who walked under the shelter doa i eentrude he asked with an italian accent and an italian bearing i suppose no eh thece ees a placa beesness marys small departure from a businesslike perfunctory manner ended at once she took the scrap of paper which ravelli laid on her desk and without a word translated its writing into telegraphic clicks ravelli was a subcontractor and this was one of his frequent communications with officials at the companys city office the response was likely to be immediate and he waited for it to get the full value of this view gerald heath resumed and now he addressed himself to mary directly as though with almost a purpose of ignoring ravelli to whose greeting he had barely responded you need to come upon it suddenly as i once did we had been for months blasting and digging through the mountain every days duty in that hole was like a spell of imprisonment in a dark damp dungeon and your men ravelli looked like a chaingang of convicts you woulda no dare say so mooch to theira faces ravelli retorted with an insolence that was unmistakably intentional o i didnt mean a reflection on them said gerald disregarding the others quarrelsome aggressiveness we all look rascally in the mud drip and grime of tunnel work and your gang of swarthy italians are bound to have a demoniac aspect underground it was more careless than intentional that gerald thus provoked ravelli there had been dislike between them growing out of friction between their respective duties as a civil engineer and a subcontractor for the former was necessarily a critic of the latters work but they had never quarreled and gerald saw nothing in this occasion as ravelli seemed to for any outbreak of temper bettare be civvil witha your tongue ravelli sneered well i think so too as we are with a lady zat ees whya i inseest you treata me as one gentleman so it seemed that he was especially regardful of how he figured in the presence of mary warriner like one gentleman oh i will treat you like two gentlemen so politely and gerald began to again nonchalantly whittle the birchen pole i was going to tell how when at last we broke through the rock at this end of the tunnel i happened to be right there a blast tore out an aperture several feet wide we saw daylight through the smoke we rushed pellmell over the broken stone and struggled with one another to get through first it was why it was you ravelli wasnt it whom i tussled with yes we got into the breach together you tried to push me back you couldnt of course you couldnt and the narrators reference to his own superior strength was exasperatingly accompanied by a glance not free from contempt eet wasa all een fun ravelli smilingly explained to mary and then his eyes turned darkly upon gerald eef eet hada been one earnest fight the different result was vaguely indicated by a hard clinch of fists and a vicious crunch of teeth it was beyond a doubt that ravelli could not bear to be belittled to mary but she and gerald were alike inattentive to his exhibition of wrath no prisoner was ever more exultant to escape heath went on than i was to get out of that dark noisome hole into clean sunlight i ran to this very spot and well the landscape was on view just as it is now it was like getting from gloom out into glory the young mans exuberant words were not spoken with much enthusiasm and yet they had sufficient earnestness to prove their sincerity he had stopped whittling and his knife lay on the desk as he turned his back against the sapling and rested both elbows on it so ive been writing to the president of the company urging him to deflect the route a trifle so that passengers might come out of the tunnel to see a landscape worth a thousand miles of special travel and to be had by going less than as many feet this is the very latest day for changing the survey tomorrow will be too late that is why im telegraphing so urgently click click click mary went to the telegraphic instrument she delivered the message by word of mouth instead of taking it down in the usual manner with a pen gerald heath overlook she translated from the metallic language of the instrument your idea is foolish we cannot entertain it henry deckerman president gerald looked like a man receiving a jurys verdict involving great pecuniary loss if not one of personal condemnation as he listened to the telegram zat ees whata i theenk remarked ravelli with insolent elation you arre onea fool as ze president he say gerald was already angered by the dispatch the taunting epithet was timed to excite him to fury which he impulsively spent upon the more immediate provoker he seized ravelli by the throat but without choking him and almost instantly let him go as though ashamed of having assailed a man of not much more than half his own strength and nearly twice his age with italian quickness ravelli grabbed geralds knife from the desk against which he was flung he would have used it too if selfdefense had been necessary but he saw that he was not to be further molested and so he concealed the weapon under his arm while gerald strode away unaware of his escape from a stab he isa one beeg bully said ravelli with forced composure eef a lady hada not been here you tormented him the girl interrupted i once saw the bestnatured mastiff in the world lose his temper and turn on a she stopped before saying cur and added instead if he was foolish you were not very wise to tease him he isa what to you zat you takea hees part she bit her lip in resentment but made no reply parehaps he is onea lover oof you still she would not reply to his impertinence that angered him more than the severest rejoinder would have done oh i am surea zat he ees one suitor she gave way at length to his provocation and yet without any violent words for she simply said you are insulting while he is at least reasonably polite when he heeds me at all which isnt often nota often but somewhat closely he heeda you see zat with an open palm he struck the place on the sapling where gerald had whittled the spot was on the outer edge where mary could not see it from her seat she went around to the front of the primitively constructed desk or high counter to gratify her curiosity there she saw that gerald had carved a hand her own hand as she instantly perceived the small and shapely member was reproduced in the fresh pale wood with rare fidelity she had unconsciously posed it while working the key of the telegraphic instrument under the jackknife sculptors eyes and there had been ample time for him to whittle a facsimile into the birch he is almost as impertinent as you are she said and turned to see how ravelli took the comment but ravelli had disappeared then being alone she laid a hand of her own coquettishly alongside its wooden counterpart and critically admired the likeness it was an unwarranted liberty she said to herself but he did it very well the delicate fiber of the wood had favored the carvers purpose the imitation hand bore a shade of flattery in the barely tinted birchen white and in the fine grained satin smoothness that the keen blade had wrought but this was not too much for more than a reasonable compliment as to the modeling that was sincerely accurate and the fingers rested on the key precisely as mary had seen them during many hours of many days it is an excessively vain girl who admires herself as actually as she does a portrait and the telegrapher really saw more beauty in the birchen hand than she had ever observed in the live one as she contemplated it ravelli returned noiselessly behind her i awish to say something mees warriner the italian accent of ravelli grated with unnatural harshness on marys ears and if he had been an intruder upon her privacy instead of a man in a really public place she would not have been surprised into a deep flush she snatched her hand away from its wooden counterpart and clasped it with its mate behind her as she leaned her shoulder against the carving to hide it if you have a message to send she said i cant get it on the wire too soon its within five minutes of time to shut off she started to go behind the desk he stopped her with a touch upon her shoulder and she shrank away reprovingly although it was solely the mans earnestness that had made him do it no no it ees not words fora ze wire zat i havea for you he said i wisha to tell to yourself something will you leesten yes if it is something that i ought to hear thees eez it i am amore than i seem here deeferent so deeferent you would hardly knowa me in zis place i am only a contractor for ze laborer i ama as common as my gang ina clothes ina manner too eh but een one hour een one minute i coulda conveence you zat i ama something finer mary did not show in her perfectly regained composure that she was so much as puzzled by the mans enigmatic talk she said i dont see how it could be worth while mr ravelli o yes i bega pardon for ze contradiction yes it ees wortha while away froma here mary i woulda be so deeferent zat you alove me stop mr ravelli stop the command was positive but it was not obeyed i lovea you he caught her by one wrist as he began she was utterly unresistant if she had struggled or cried out he would have gone on with his voluble excited declaration but her placidity was incomprehensible to him mr ravelli she began after a moment you understand english perfectly mees warriner well here is plain english for you i would use italian if i could so that you mightnt mistake me you are to let go of my hand he did it you are to go away instantly and never come here again except on business go at once that he did not do for whata did you come here into one camp oof men eef if i didnt expect to be unsafe ill tell you it was a mistake operator no was ordered to this post no had been a man who had within a week been discharged and his number given to me by an oversight no alteration was made in the record to show the sex of the new no i couldnt afford to lose the work besides wella besides besides i reasoned that every man at overlook would protect me against all the other men if yes eef yes if i cared absolutely nothing for any single one of them therefore i am not afraid but you must not annoy me fury flashed into the mans eyes into his reddened face into the sudden tension of his gripped hands the girls contemptuous indifference maddened him she saw this and was at once alarmed for she realized that here was a reckless lover one who heated dangerously where another would have chilled under disdain but she maintained an unshaken voice as she said you may as well know however that i am amply protected the night watchman is ordered to include this combined office and residence of mine in every round he makes so i sleep quite unconcernedly in the daytime too i shall have defense if it becomes necessary o havea no alarm mees warriner and the mans facial expression softened singularly as he gazed wistfully at the girl i haf said i lovea you then with a startlingly quick transition he glared menacingly off in the direction that gerald heath had gone it seemed curious to mary too that in his rage his english was clearer than usual as he growled it is your lover that should be afraid of me he flung out one fist in a fierce menace and added in italian nel vindicarvi bisogna chegli mi rende la sua vita chapter ii the full moon looked for mary warriners little house that night as soon as a clearance of the sky permitted and then beamed down on her abode effulgently but it was eleven oclock before the gusty wind blew the thick clouds aside and let the orb illumine overlook back of the shed in which the telegrapher worked by day was a structure in which she slept at night it was built of slabs with big growing trees to form its irregular corners and their lowest limbs contributed the rafters while stripped bark and evergreen boughs made the roof the foliage swayed above in the fitful wind and covered the cabin and the grass around it with commingling separating capering shadows of leaves as though a multitude of little black demons were trying to get to the slumberer within their antics looked spiteful and angry at first but as the wind lessened to a breeze and as the moon seemed to mollify them they became frolicsome without malice and at length when the merest zephyrs impelled their motions they gambolled lazily goodhumoredly above and around the couch of mary mite it was midnight when a man shot into the open space around the cabin like a missile he ran first to the front of the structure where a tarpaulin curtained the shed for the night and gazed for a moment blankly at this indication that the hour was not one of business tremendous haste was denoted in his every step and gesture he plucked twice at the canvas as though to pull it down then he skurried around to the single window of marys apartment whose only door opened into the shed and pounded with his knuckles on the illfitted sash making it clatter loudly silence within followed this noise without hello wake up he cried dont fool for a minute wake up there was no response and he skipped to and fro in his impatience he was an ordinary shoveler and pounder with nothing to distinguish him from the mass of manual laborers at overlook but unlike the usual man with an errand at the telegraphic station flourished a scrap of paper i want to telegraph he shouted and struck the window again get up quick its life and death mary warriner was convinced that her services were urgently and properly required she peeped warily out to inspect the man estimated him to be merely a messenger and then opened wide the sash which swung laterally on hinges her delicate face bore the same sort of calm that characterized it in business hours but the moon shone on it now the hair had got loose from the bondage of knot and pin and for an outer garment she was carelessly enwrapped in a white fleecy blanket the man did not give her time to inquire what was wanted youre the telegraph girl aint you he exclaimed well heres something to telegraph its in a hurry hurry hurry dont lose a minute i couldnt send it tonight mary said you must it isnt possible there is nobody at the other end of the line to receive it the wire is private belongs to the railroad company isnt operated except in the daytime youll have to wait until tomorrow tomorrow ill be a hundred years old or else dead the man almost wailed in despair what i was only ten years old yesterday tonight im sixty tomorrowll be too late here here send it tonight miss please send it tonight the mystified girl mechanically took the piece of paper which he thrust into her hands but her eyes did not drop before they discovered the insanity in his face and when they did rest on the paper they saw a scrawl of hieroglyphics it was plain that this midnight visitor was a maniac she screamed for help a watchman responded almost instantly to her call upon seeing the cause of the girls fright he treated the incident as a matter of course the lunatic wobbled like a drunken man about to collapse as he mumbled his request over and over again here now eph the watchman said with as much of cajolery as command you mustnt bother the young lady aint you ashamed to scare her this way get right out of this the watchman took the other by the arm and as they started off one insisting and one objecting the official looked back to say he wont hurt nobody miss warriner hes just a little cranky thats all mary watched them out of sight and while she was doing so gerald heath approached from the contrary direction he had heard the girls scream why he was within earshot he might not have been able to explain satisfactorily for it was not his habit to take midnight walks even when the air was so brightly moonlit and so temporarily fine but if crossquestioned he would doubtless have maintained that he had sought only to escape from the darkness and closeness of his shanty quarters besides where would he so likely wander in quest of good sight and breath as to the spot whence he could view the scenery which he in vain asked the railway company to exhibit to their passengers as he turned the corner of the cabin he saw eph and the watchman departing and comprehended the disturbance eph has been frightening you miss warriner he said mary screamed again but this time it was a low musical little outcry of modesty she had not observed geralds approach she clutched the blanket closely around her white throat which had been almost as much exposed as by an ordinary cut of frock and drew under cover the gleaming wrists which had all day been bared to a greater extent by sleeves of handy working length then she reached out one taper arm and swung the sash around on its hinges so its inner covering of muslin made a screen between her and the visitor he did not apologize for his intrusion and she pouted a little on her safe side of the sash at his failure to do so i see it was eph that alarmed you he said what did he do she told him and then asked who is he and what ails him he is a common laborer with an uncommon affliction was the reply one day an excavation caved in and for an hour he was buried some timbers made a little space around his head but the rest of him was packed in earth he had breathed the inclosed air two or three times over and was almost suffocated when we got him out he was insensible he never came back to his senses he believes he is living at the rate of more than a year every hour this is why he was in such a hurry with his imaginary message poor fellow came from the obverse side of the sash yes poor fellow the narrator assented i understood his hallucination at once when a man is suddenly placed in mortal peril his past life dashes before him half drowned men afterward tell of reviewing in a minute the events of years it is a curious mental phenomenon well this poor chap had that familiar experience but with a singular sequence the impression that all his lifetime before the accident happened in a brief time has remained in his disordered mind he believes that his whole earthly existence is condensed that future years as well as his past ones are compressed into days and his days into minutes nothing can disabuse him of this idea everything is to him ephemeral thats why i nicknamed him eph short for ephemeral you see he doesnt remember his real name and on the roll he had only a number he has done his work well enough until within a few days but now his malady seems to have turned to the worst he has talked wildly of getting some physicians to check the speed of time with him and it may have been that he wished to telegraph to this fancied expert it is singular mary said and very sad the midnight incident seemed to have come to a conclusion it was a proper time for gerald to say goodnight and go away he still stood on the opposite side of the halfopen sash around the edge of which appeared a small set of finger tips which pulled the screen a little closer showing that the girl was minded to shut herself in but a hand twice as big opposed hers gently yet strongly and in doing so it touched hers upon which she let go and the window flew open oh you mustnt see me mary exclaimed as gerald got a vanishing glimpse of the whitedraped figure goodnight you will be afraid if left alone gerald protested you cant go to sleep nervous as you must be i surely cant go to sleep talking was her rejoinder with the first touch of coquetry she had indulged in at overlook i wont talk then ill only keep guard out here until daylight eph may return but theres the watchman it is his duty it would be my delight that silenced the invisible inmate of the cabin the moon shone into the square opening but mary was ensconced somewhere in the darkness that bordered the income of light should i apologize gerald at length began again it is like this miss warriner i used to know how to behave politely to a lady but for six years ive lived in wildernesses in railroad camps from canada to mexico weve had no ladies in these rough places no women except once in a while some mannish washerwoman or cook thats what makes you so rare so unexpected that is why it would be a delight to be a patrolman outside your quarters that is why i dont wish to go away oh oh i am interesting because i am the only specimen of my sex at overlook that isnt a doubtful compliment it is no compliment at all goodnight you misconstrue me altogether i mean i am sure you do not mean and now the tone was pleadingly serious to remain here at my window after i request you to go away i am as you have said the only girl at overlook if there were a thousand girls at overlook not one of them i trust would prolong a dialogue with a young gentleman at night through the open window of her bedroom half in respectful deference to marys unassailable statement of the rule of propriety applicable to the situation and half in inconsiderate petulance at being dismissed gerald let go of the sash with an impulse that almost closed it this time two miniature hands came out under the swinging frame would more than one hand have been naturally used was it not an awkward method of shutting a window and mary warriner was not a clumsy creature but there were the hands and gerald grasped them they fluttered for freedom like birds held captive in broad palms by completely caging fingers then he uncovered them but for an instant kept them prisoners by encircling the wrists long enough to impetuously kiss them another second and they were gone the window was closed and they were alone he walked slowly away accusing himself of folly and ungentlemanliness and he felt better upon getting out of the clear searching moonshine into the dim obscuring shade of rocks and trees among which the path wound crookedly there rapid footsteps startled him as though he was a skulking evildoer and the swift approach of a man along an intersecting pathway made him feel like taking to cowardly flight but he recognized the monomaniac eph who was in a breathless tremor mr heath could a man walk to dimmersville before the telegraph station there opens in the morning eph asked with several catches of breath and a reeling movement of physical weakness you go to bed eph was the reply meant to be soothing and ill see that your telegram goes from here the earliest thing in the morning that wont be more than six or seven hours from now six or seven hours the poor fellow deploringly moaned ill be a good many years older by that time oh its awful to have your life go whizzing away like mine does and he clutched at gerald with his fidgety hands with a vague idea of slowing himself by holding to a normal human being then he darted away swaying from side to side with faintness and disappeared in the foliage which lined the path he was following gerald watched him out of sight and was about to resume his own different way when the voice of tonio ravelli was heard with its italian extra a to the short words and a heavy emphasis on the final syllable of the long ones mistair heath he said i sawa your affectionate parting weez mees warriner gerald had just then the mind of a culprit and he began to explain apologetically it was cowardly in me to insult a defenseless girl she didnt invite it i am ashamed of myself he hardly realized to whom he was speaking the two men were now walking rapidly ravelli taking two strides to one of the bigger gerald in order to keep alongside youa should be ashamed youa scoundrel as much of jealous fury and venomous malice as could be vocalized in six words was in ravellis sudden outbreak gerald was astounded he turned upon his companion caught him by both lapels of the coat and shook him so violently that his bootsoles pounded the ground ravelli staggered back upon being loosed and threw one arm around a tree to steady himself i didnt mean to hurt you said gerald but you shouldnt be reckless with your language perhaps you dont know what scoundrel means in english i saw youa kiss her hands did you well do you know what id do to you ravelli if i saw you kiss her hands as i did without her consent id wring your miserable neck now what are you going to do to me i ama going to keel you the blade of a knife flashed in ravellis right hand as he made a furious onslaught but the stronger and quicker man gripped both of his assailants wrists threw him violently to the ground and tortured him with wrenches and doublings until he had to drop the weapon in the encounter the clothes of both men were torn and when ravelli regained his feet blood was dripping from his hand the blade had cut it you meant to kill me gerald exclaimed i saida so was the sullen menacing response and with my own knife and gerald picking up the knife recognized it your own knife ze one zat you carvea marys hand with so lovingly ravelli had retained it since the previous afternoon when he had picked it up from mary warriners desk its blade was now red with blood as gerald shut and pocketed it you cowardly murderer murderer nota yet but i meant to be ravelli turned off by the crosspath and gerald passed on chapter iii the first man to go to work at overlook in the morning was jim wilson because he had to rouse the fire under a boiler early enough to provide steam for a score of rock drills the night watchman awakened him at daybreak according to custom and then got into a bunk as the other got out of one everything all right jim asked i guess so the other replied but i haint seen your boiler sence before midnight eph was disturbin mary mite and so i hung round her cabin pretty much the last half of the night jim went to his post at the boiler and at an unaccustomed pace from the point where he first saw and heard steam hissing upward from the safety valve on quitting the night previous he had banked the fire as usual and this morning he should have found it burning so slowly that an hour of raking replenishing and open draughts would no more than start the machinery at seven oclock going nearer he found that open dampers and a fresh supply of coal had set the furnace raging what was that which protruded from the open door and so nearly filled the aperture that the draught was not impaired a glance gave the answer it was the legs and half the body of a man whose head and shoulders were thoroughly charred as jim was horrified to see when he pulled the remains out upon the ground jim ran to tell the superintendent and within a few minutes a knot of excited men surrounded the body the gathering grew in numbers rapidly by means of the clothing the dead and partially burned man was identified at once as tonio ravelli that he had been murdered was an equally easy conclusion the murderer had apparently sought to cremate the corpse whether he had found it physically impossible or had been frightened away could only be conjectured who can have done it was the question asked by superintendent brainerd the autocrat of overlook there was a minute of silence with all staring intently at the body as though half expecting it to somehow disclose the truth the night watchman was first to speak eph might have done it he said then he told of the monomaniacs visit to the telegraph station and of the acute stage which his malady had reached nobody else present had seen him since the previous evening superintendent brainerd ordered a search of the lodgings ten minutes were sufficient for a round of the different quarters eph was in none of them the searchers returned to the furnace and with them came gerald heath i met eph yonder where the paths cross not a hundred yards from here a little past midnight gerald said he was terribly excited that was after he had tried in vain to telegraph a crazy message evidently his delusion that his whole life was condensed into a brief space had driven him to a frenzy he spoke of walking to dimmersville but i tried to quiet him and he disappeared dimmersville was a town about ten miles distant in a direction opposite to that from which the railroad had worked its way through the mountains no wire connected it with overlook and there was no public road for the nearest third of the way although a faint trail showed the course that a few persons had taken on foot or horseback very likely eph has gone toward dimmersville brainerd argued and we must try to catch him before the order could be specifically given a horse and a rider arose over the edge of the level ground and came into the midst of the assemblage the man in the saddle had a professional aspect imparted chiefly by his smoothly shaven face in this era of mustaches a hairless visage is apt to be assigned to a clergyman who shaves thus from a motive of propriety an actor who does it from necessity or somebody who aims at facial distinction without the features suitable to that purpose a countenance of which it can only be said that it has one nose one mouth and two eyes all placed in expressive nonentity and which is dominated utterly by hair on and around it may be less lost to individuality if entirely shaven of such seemed the visage of the dark man who calmly rode into the excitement at overlook which way have you come brainerd asked from dimmersville was the reply did you see anybody on the way i started very early folks were not out of their beds in the houses as long as there were any houses and that is only for five or six miles you know after that yes i did see one man a curiously excited chap he looked tired out he asked the distance to dimmersville and whether the telegraph office would be open by the time he got there then he skurried on before id half answered him all that was known of the murder was told to the stranger by half a dozen glib tongues and it was explained to him that he had encountered the maniacal fugitive i knew there was something wrong about him said the stranger it is my business to be observant he dismounted and hitched his horse to a tree the dead body was shown to him he examined it very thoroughly all the particulars were related to him over and over then he drew superintendent brainerd aside my name is terence oreagan he said and in his voice was faintly distinguishable the brogue of the land whence the oreagans came i am a government detective i have been sent to work up evidence in the case of some italian counterfeiters we had a clew pointing to a subcontractor here the very man who lies there dead our information was that he used some of the bogus bills in paying off his gang now it isnt going outside my mission to investigate his death if you dont object i would be glad to have you take hold of it brainerd replied we cant bring the authorities here before noon at the earliest and in the mean time you can perhaps clear it all up the eagerly curious men had crowded close to this brief dialogue and had heard the latter part of it oreagan became instantly an important personage upon whose smallest word or movement they hung expectantly and nobody showed a keener interest than gerald heath the detective first examined the body the pockets of ravellis clothes contained a wallet with its money untouched beside a gold watch so robbery was not the object said oreagan to brainerd the motive is the first thing to look for in a case of murder next he found blood on the waistcoat a great deal of it but dried by the fire that had burned the shoulders and head and in the baked cloth were three cuts under which he exposed three stab wounds strokes of a knife had it seemed killed the victim before he was thrust partially into the furnace a storm was coming to overlook unperceived for the men were too much engrossed in what lay there on the ground ghastly and horrible to pay any attention to the clouding sky gloom was so fit for the scene too that nobody gave a thought from whence it came to gerald heath the going out of sunlight and the settling down of dusky shadows seemed a mental experience of his own he stood bewildered transfixed vaguely conscious of peril and yet too numb to speak or stir detective oreagan straightening up from over the body looked piercingly at gerald and then glanced around at the rest is there anybody here who saw tonio ravelli last night he asked i did gerald replied where and when at the same place where i met eph and immediately afterward ah now we are locating eph and ravelli together that looks like the lunatic being undoubtedly the stabber and we must catch him brainerd interposed ill send riders toward dimmersville immediately no great hurry about that the detective remarked he is too crazy to have had any clear motive or any idea of escape it will be easy enough to capture him then he turned to gerald and questioned with the air of a crossexaminer did the two men have any words together no was the ready answer i dont know that they even saw each other at that time eph went away an instant before ravelli came did you talk with ravelli yes about what not about eph at all about what then now the reply came reluctantly a personal matter something that had occurred between us an incident at the telegraph station the station where eph had awakened the girl operator was it a quarrel about her that is no concern of yours you are impertinent well sir the question is pertinent as the lawyers say and the answer concerns you whether it does me or not you and ravelli quarreled about the girl the young lady shall not be dragged into this she wasnt responsible for what happened between ravelli and me what did happen between you and ravelli the two men stood close to and facing each other the eyes of the detective glared gloatingly at an upward angle into the pale but still firm face of the taller gerald and then dropped slowly until they became fixed on a red stain on the sleeve of the others coat did he possess the animal scent of a bloodhound what is that he sharply asked he seized the arm and smelled of the spotted fabric it is blood let me see your knife quite mechanically gerald thrust one hand into his trousers pocket and brought out the knife which he had taken back from ravelli whose blood was on it yet the storm was overhead a first peal of thunder broke loudly it came at the instant of the assemblages tensest interest at the instant when gerald heath was aghast with the revelation of his awful jeopardy at the instant of his exposure as a murderer it impressed them and him with a shock of something supernatural the reverberation rumbled into silence which was broken by oreagan therell be no need to catch eph he said in a tone of professional glee this man is the murderer again thunder rolled and rumbled angrily above overlook and the party stood aghast in the presence of the man dead and the man condemned bring him to the telegraph station oreagan commanded nobody disputed the detectives methods now not even gerald and a prisoner as completely as though manacled although not touched by any one he went with the rest mary warriner had taken down the tarpaulin front of her shed when the men approached in the ordinary course of her early morning doings she would wait an hour to dispatch and receive the first telegrams of the day and then go to breakfast alone at the table where the engineers and overseers would by that time have had their meal she was astonished to see nearly the whole population of overlook crowd around her quarters while a few entered but she went quickly behind the desk and took her place on the stool the soberness of the faces impressed her but nothing indicated that gerald was in custody and her quick thought was that some disaster made it necessary to use the wire importantly i wish to send a message said oreagan stepping forward the eyes of the girl rested on him inquiringly and he palpably flinched but as obviously nerved himself to proceed and when he spoke again the irish accent became more pronounced to hear although not sufficiently to be shown in the printed words i will dictate it slowly so that you can transmit it as i speak are you ready marys fingers were on the key and her bright alert face was an answer to the query to henry deckerman president the detective slowly said waiting for the clicks of the instrument to put his language on the wire tonio ravelli a subcontractor here was murdered last night marys hand slid away from the key after sending that and the always faint tint in her cheeks faded out and her eyes flickered up in a scared way to the stern faces in front of her the shock of the news that a man had been slain and that he was a man who only the previous day had proffered his love to her was for a moment disabling but the habit of her employment controlled her and she awaited the further dictation his body was found this morning in the furnace of the steam boiler oreagan resumed deliberately where it had evidently been placed in a vain attempt to destroy it a shudder went through mary and she convulsively wrung her small hands together as though to limber them from a cramp but her fingers went back to the key the murderer has been discovered the detective slowly continued and the operator kept along with his utterance word by word he killed ravelli for revenge it was a love affair here the girl grew whiter still and the clicks became very slow but they did not cease oreagans voice was cold and ruthless the motive of the murderer was revenge his name is gerald heath all but the name flashed off on the wire mary warriners power to stir the key stopped at that she did not faint she did not make any outcry for a moment she looked as though the soul had gone out of her body leaving a corpse sitting there a grievous wail of wind came through the trees and a streak of lightning zigzagged down the blueclouded sky go on said oreagan i will not was the determined response why not because it is not so gerald heath never murdered ravelli gerald had stood motionless and silent now he gave way to an impulse as remarkable as his previous composure had been singular if there had been stagnation in his mind it was now displaced by turbulence he grasped marys hands in a fervid grip then dropped them and faced the others i did not kill the italian he said he attacked me with my knife which he had stolen in the struggle his hand was cut but i took the weapon away from him he quitted me alive and unhurt i never saw him again you dont believe it mary does and that is more than all else the circumstances dont favor you the detective retorted they convict you you killed ravelli because you and he were both in love with this young lady isnt it the rejected suitor who kills the other one for spite this was in mary warriners voice weak but still steady ravelli loved me i knew and i drove him away mr heath loved me i believed and i had not repulsed him if i were the cause of a murder between them it should be ravelli who killed gerald you detested ravelli oreagan asked with a strange bitterness yes and you love heath the answer was no more hesitant than before yes send the rest of my message and the detective was boisterous send the name gerald heath is the murderer he roughly seized her hand and clapped it on the key she drew it away leaving his there a blinding flash of lightning illumined the place and what looked like a missile of fire flew down the wire to the instrument where it exploded oreagan fell insensible from the powerful electrical shock the rest did not altogether escape and for a minute all were dazed the first thing that they fully comprehended was that oreagan was getting unsteadily to his feet he was bewildered staggering and reeling he began to talk mary was first to perceive the import of his utterance he was merely going on with what he had been saying but the manner not the matter was astounding he spoke with an italian accent and made italian gestures youa send ze message he said heath ees ze murderare senda ze message i say tonio ravelli had unwittingly resumed his italian style of english his plenitude of hair and whiskers was gone and in the face thereby uncovered nobody could have recognized him in detective oreagan but for his lapse into the foreign accent and he said so much before discovering his blunder that his identification as indeed ravelli was complete who then was the dead man why he was eph nothing but the fear of being himself condemned as a murderer of the maniac as a part of the scheme of revenge against gerald induced ravelli to explain he had found eph lying dead in the path after both had parted from gerald the plot to exchange clothes with the corpse drag it to the furnace burn away all possibility of recognition and thus make it seem to be his murdered self was carried out with all the hot haste of a jealous vengeance ravelli was not an italian although very familiar with the language of italy and able by a natural gift of mimicry to hide himself from pursuit for a previous crime overlook had been a refuge until his passion for mary warriner led him to abandon his disguise thereupon he had turned himself into terence oreagan a detective whose malicious work wrought happiness for gerald heath and mary warriner a thing that glistened by frank r stockton in the fall of the steamship sunda from southampton was running along the southern coast of long island not many hours from port when she was passed by one of the great british liners outward bound the tide was high and the course of both vessels was nearer the coast than is usual that of the sunda being inside of the other as the two steamers passed each other there was a great waving of hats and handkerchiefs suddenly there was a scream from the sunda it came from signora rochita the prima donna of an opera troupe which was coming to america in that ship i have lost my bracelet she cried in italian and then turning to the passengers she repeated the cry in very good english the situation was instantly comprehended by every one it was late in the afternoon the captain had given a grand dinner to the passengers at which the prima donna had appeared in all her glories of ornamentation and the greatest of these glories a magnificent diamond bracelet was gone from the arm with which she had been enthusiastically waving her lace handkerchief the second officer who was standing near dashed into the captains office and quickly reappeared with chart and instruments and made rapid calculation of the position of the vessel at the time of the accident making an allowance for the few minutes that had passed since the first cry of the signora after consultation with the captain and recalculations of the distance from land and some other points he announced to the weeping signora that her bracelet lay under a little black spot he had made on the chart and that if she chose to send a diver for it she might get it for the depth of water at that place was not great by profession i am a diver and the next day i was engaged to search for the diamond bracelet of signora rochita i had a copy of the chart and having hired a small schooner with several men who had been my assistants before and taking with me all the necessary accouterments and appliances i set out for the spot indicated and by afternoon we were anchored we believed at or very near it i lost no time in descending i wore of course the usual divers suit but i took with me no tools nor any of the implements used by divers when examining wrecks but carried in my right hand a brilliant electric lamp connected with a powerful battery on the schooner i held this by an insulated handle in which there were two little knobs by which i could light or extinguish it the bottom was hard and smooth and lighting my lamp i began to look about me if i approached the bracelet i ought to be able to see it sparkle but after wandering over considerable space i saw no sparkles nor anything like a bracelet suddenly however i saw something which greatly interested me it was a hole in the bottom of the ocean almost circular and at least ten feet in diameter i was surprised that i had not noticed it before for it lay not far from the stern of our vessel standing near the rocky edge of the aperture i held out my lamp and looked down not far below i saw the glimmer of what seemed to be the bottom of this subterranean well i was seized with a desire to explore this great hole running down under the ordinary bottom of the sea i signaled to be lowered and although my comrades were much surprised at such an order they obeyed and down i went to the well the sides of this seemed rocky and almost perpendicular but after descending about fifteen feet they receded on every side and i found myself going down into a wide cavern the floor of which i touched in a very short time holding up my lamp and looking about me i found myself in a sea cave some thirty feet in diameter with a domelike roof in which a little to one side of the center was the lower opening of the well i became very much excited this was just the sort of place into which a bracelet or anything else of value might be expected to have the bad luck to drop i walked about and gazed everywhere but i found nothing but rocks and water i was about to signal to be drawn up when above me i saw what appeared to be a flash of darkness coming down through the well with a rush and a swirl it entered the cavern and in a moment i recognized the fact that a great fish was swooping around and about me its movements were so rapid and irregular now circling along the outer edge of the floor of the cavern then mounting above me until its back seemed to scrape the roof that i could not form a correct idea of the size of the creature it seemed to me to be at least twenty feet along i stood almost stupefied keeping my eyes as far as possible fixed upon the swiftly moving monster sometimes he came quite near me when i shuddered in every fiber and then he shot away but ever gliding with powerful undulations of his body and tail around about and above me i did not dare to signal to be drawn up for fear that the terrible creature would enter the well hole with me then he would probably touch me perhaps crush me against the wall but my mind was capable of forming no plans i only hoped the fish would ascend and disappear by the way he came my mind was not in its strongest condition being much upset by a great trouble and i was so frightened that i really did not know what i ought to do but i had sense enough left to feel sure that the fish had been attracted into the cavern by my lamp obviously the right thing to do was to extinguish it but the very thought of this nearly drove me into a frenzy i could not endure to be left alone with the shark in darkness and water it was an insane idea but i felt that whatever happened i must keep my eyes upon him now the great fish began to swoop nearer and nearer to me and then suddenly changing its tactics it receded to the most distant wall of the cavern where with its head toward me it remained for the first time motionless but this did not continue long gently turning over on its side it opened its great mouth and in an instant with a rush it came directly at me my light shone full into its vast mouth glistening with teeth and there was a violent jerk which nearly threw me from my feet and all was blackness the shark had swallowed my lamp by rare good fortune he did not take my hand also now i frantically tugged at my signal rope without my lamp i had no thought but a desire to be pulled out of the water no matter what happened in a few minutes i sat divested of my diving suit and almost insensible upon the deck of the schooner as soon as i was able to talk i told my astonished comrades what had happened and while we were discussing this strange occurrence one of them looking over the side saw slowly rising to the surface the body of a dead shark by george he cried here is the beast he has been killed by the current from the battery we all crowded to the rail and looked down upon the monster he was about ten feet long and it was plain that he had died for making himself the connection between the poles of the battery well said the captain pleasantly i suppose you are not going down again not i i replied i give up this job then suddenly i cried come boys all of you make fast to that shark and get him on board i want him some of the men laughed but my manner was so earnest that in a moment they all set about to help me a small boat was lowered lines were made fast to the dead fish with block and tackle and we hauled him on deck i then got a butchers knife from the cabin and began to cut him open look here tom exclaimed the captain thats nonsense your lamps all smashed to pieces and if you get it out it will never be any good to you i dont care for the lamp i answered working away energetically but an idea has struck me its plain that this creature had a fancy for shining things if he swallowed a lamp there is no reason why he should not have swallowed anything else that glittered oho cried the captain you think he swallowed the bracelet do you and instantly everybody crowded more closely about me i got out the lamp its wires were severed as smoothly as if they had been cut by shears then i worked on suddenly there was a cry from every man something glimmered in the dark interior of the fish i grasped it and drew it out it was not a bracelet but a pint bottle which glimmered like a glowworm with the bottle in my hand i sat upon the deck and gazed at it i shook it it shone brighter a bit of oiled silk was tied tightly over the cork and it was plain to see that it was partly filled with a light colored oil into which a bit of phosphorous had been dropped which on being agitated filled the bottle with a dim light but there was something more in the bottle than phosphorus and oil i could see a tin tube corked at each end and the exposed parts of the corks spreading enough to prevent the tin from striking the glass we all knew that this was one of those bottles containing a communication of some sort which are often thrown into the sea and float about until they are picked up the addition of the oil and phosphorus was intended to make it visible by night as well as by day and this was plainly the reason why it had been swallowed by a lightloving shark i poured out the oil and extracted the tube wiping it carefully i drew out the corks and then from the little tin cylinder i pulled a half sheet of note paper rolled up tightly i unrolled it and read these words before i jump overboard i want to let people know that i killed john polhemus so i have fixed up this bottle i hope it may be picked up in time to keep jim barker from being hung i did think of leaving it on the steamer but i might change my mind about jumping overboard and i guess this is the best way the clothes i wore and the hatchet i did it with are under the woodshed back of polhemuss house henry ramsey i sprang to my feet with a yell jim barker was my brother now lying in prison under sentence of death for the murder of polhemus all the circumstantial evidence and there was no other had been against him the note was dated eight months back oh cruel fool of a murderer the shark was thrown overboard and we made best speed to port and before the end of the afternoon i had put ramseys note into the hands of the lawyer who had charge of my brothers case fortunately he was able to identify the handwriting and signature of ramsey a man who had been suspected of the crime but against whom no evidence could be found the lawyer was almost as excited as i was by the contents of this note and early the next morning we started together for the house of the polhemus family there under the woodshed we found carefully buried a bloodstained shirt and vest and the hatchet my impulse was to fly to my brother but this my lawyer forbade he would take charge of the affair and no false hopes must be excited but he confidently assured me that my brother was as good as free returning to the city i thought i might as well make my report to signora rochita the lady was at home and saw me she showed the most intense interest in what i told her and insisted upon every detail of my experiences as i spoke of the shark and the subterranean cave she nearly fainted from excitement and her maid had to bring her smelling salts when i had finished she looked at me steadily for a moment and then said i have something to tell you but i hardly know how to say it i never lost my bracelet i intended to wear it at the captains dinner but when i went to put it on i found the clasp was broken and as i was late i hurried to the table without the bracelet and thought of it no more until when we were all waving and cheering i glanced at my wrist and found it was not there then utterly forgetting that i had not put it on i thought it had gone into the sea it was only this morning that opening what i supposed was the empty box i saw it here it is i never saw such gorgeous jewels madame said i i am glad you thought you lost it for i have gained something better than all these you are a good man said she and then she paid me liberally for my services when this business had been finished she asked are you married i answered that i was not is there any one you intend to marry yes said i what is her name she asked sarah jane mcelroy wait a minute said she and she retired into another room presently she returned and handed me a little box give this to your ladylove said she when she looks at it she will never forget that you are a brave man when sarah jane opened the box there was a little pin with a diamond head and she gave a scream of delight but i saw no reason for jumping or crying out for after having seen the signoras bracelet this stone seemed like a pea in a bushel of potatoes i dont need anything she said to remind me that you are a brave man i am going to buy furniture with it i laughed and remarked that every little helps when i sit with my wife by my side before the fire in our comfortable home and consider that the parlor carpet and the furniture and the pictures and the hall and stair carpet and all the diningroom furniture with the china and the glass and the linen and all the kitchen utensils and two bedroom suits on the second story both hardwood and all the furniture and fittings of a very pleasant room for a single man the third story front were bought with the pin that the signora gave to sarah jane i am filled with profound respect for things that glitter and when i look on the other side of the fire and see jim smoking his pipe just as happy as anybody then i say to myself that if there are people who think that this story is too much out of the common i wish they would step in here and talk to jim about it there is a fire in his eyes when he tells you how glad he is that it was the shark instead of him that is very convincing a lion and a lioness by joaquin miller chapter i i doubt if you will find either profit or pleasure in reading this incident of my third voyage up the nile it is really not worth reading i have written it down merely for a few friends who know something of the facts and also to escape the annoyance of having to tell it over as one of the features of my four years travel in the orient but to begin wearying of the levant i was resting a time in rome when i was formally invited as well as specially urged to witness the marriage ceremony between the grand duchess alexandria and the duke of edinburgh let us pass over these wasteful follies the waste of time the waste of sense of soul i have only mentioned the reason for my presence in st petersburg have only mentioned the fact of my being there because i saw a face in that gathering of people that could not be forgotten it was the face of a tall dark and serenely silent dolores a young woman who had surely met and made the acquaintance of sorrow early in the morning of life i sometimes wonder if i could ever have known or cared to know any one who had not sorrowed deeply and yet i now know very well that in whatever guise that woman could have come there could have been no two roads for us from the day of her coming to the day of her going let me be a little confidential right here i knew i had always known i should meet this woman i had waited for her worked hard built up the battlements and the fortress of my soul so that i might receive her into it and defend her well against my baser self when she should come and now tell me have you never had a thought a conviction like this a certainty in your own heart that your other and better self would come to you complete and entire some day soon or late so soon as you might have the fortress ready the doctors said she was dying she had been trying to stand between the czar and the jews she may not have been of that peculiar people but i think she had the money of rothschilds and sir moses montefiore behind her there had been attempts at assassination followed by executions some of the condemned were women it was as if this woman herself had been condemned to death i think she suffered more than all the others put together she was so very very sensitive to the pain and sorrow of others there are souls like that but there is a good god the soul that suffers keenly can and shall enjoy keenly you can if you care to persist in it make yourself as the centuries wheel past more than an entire nation in this we had common ground to work on in the cause of the condemned people it was on this ground that we first met as two swift streams that flow in the same direction and so finally unite forever all that could be done was done speedily for the laws delay whatever else must be laid to the door of russia is not one of her sins as summer took flight we went south with the birds for she surely felt that she was dying besides she had been impressed with the idea of restoring jerusalem and having this homeless race reestablished in the holy city her religion i think it was all religions i saw her kneel in the kremlin at moscow cross herself in st peters at rome and bend low at prayer in the synagogue at alexandria i think she would have done the same in a mosque as stated before i had previous to meeting her been all over syria and so whenever she referred to her cherished idea as she so often did of forming jewish settlements in and about jerusalem and restoring israel i took occasion to explain how impossible and impractical it all was i remember telling her how that in a whole days ride from babylon toward jerusalem i had seen no living thing save a single grasshopper i explained to her that the path of civilization had been in the track of the setting sun ever since the dawn of history and that it was not in the power of man to reverse this course i attempted to show that the tide of population would pour upon the salubrious and fertile shores of the farthest west till the heart of civilization would beat right there i explained to her that wherever the great strong heart of commerce beat strongest there would be found the strongest and best of these people whom she hoped to help while the weak and helpless of that race would remain stranded by the waters of the levant as in russia now why not then let us anticipate this and build the city of refuge by your great sea in the path of this civilization which you say will so surely come like the golden doors of dawn was the great earnest idea to me as she spoke but of course i know as i said before that the peculiar people could not be induced to brave the desert they do not seek rest but action employment in the marts they would rest but a single night even by the sweet waters of jacobs well chapter ii as winter came on and egypt began to be oppressively full of tourists it was decided that we should make our escape up the nile and haunt the ruin of kamak and other places until the outgoing tide set in once fairly on our way it did not take long to persuade me that she was not only gaining strength each day in body but in soul we had been more than a month on the nile a tattered palm tree here tossing in the wind and sand a gaunt claycolored camel yonder all legs and hair beggars disease despair all around us a land to fly from fit place for tombs jackals and famishing lions but she was stronger there were roses in her face her glorious black hair had not the dampness of death in it now but was luxuriously sensate with renewed life and health and possible happiness one warm sunset as the boat lay with its prow in the yellow sand that seemed to stretch away into infinity she proposed that she and i should ascend to the top of the tall ruins on a hill a little distance back from the river and there wait and watch and listen for the coming day it was a dreadful place i had already walked a little way out but on seeing a shriveled black hand stretching up from the sand i had turned back only to stumble over the head of a mummy which i had afterward seen one of our servants gather up and take to his arab camp for firewood still we had been pent up in the boat much and then would not she be with me two arabs were taken with us to carry a bottle of water and the rugs and robes the hill was steeper than it at first seemed and the ascent through the sand heavy i was having an opportunity to test her strength and endurance i might also have an occasion to test her courage before the break of morning for as we entered between two towering columns of red granite one of the arabs dropped on a knee and spread his hand as wide as he could in the sand but wide as he spread it he could not more than half cover the fresh footprint of a huge lion the clamber to the top was steep and hard yet it was not nearly so steep and hard as i could have wished it when i reflected that very likely before midnight a lion might pass that way we found that these wonderful columns of granite were coped with great slabs of granite these granite slabs were of astonishing breadth and thickness this temple as it is called had probably been a tomb i took good care to see that there was no other means of ascent to the place where we had chosen to spend the night than the one by which we had ascended and i remember how eagerly i wished for a crowbar in order that i might break down a little of the dйbris so that the ascent might be less easy for prowling beasts but as there was nothing of the sort at hand i dismissed the two arabs and resolved to be as brave if possible as the singularly brave and beautiful woman who had come here to hear the voices of desolation the sky was rimmed with yellow yellow to the east yellow to the west a world of soft and restful yellow that melted away by gradations as the eye ascended from the desert it was like melody in its serene harmonies and awful glory and she at my side partook of it all she breathed it absorbed it literally became a part of it i saw her grow and glow soul and body i saw her dilate and expand till she was in absolute harmony with the awe and splendor that encompassed us i felt that she had been in the midst of even a part of this tawny desolation ages and ages before perhaps her soul had been born here born before the pyramids chapter iii with my own hands i spread her couch of skins and rugs in the remotest corner of a great stone slab that still lifted its unbroken front in defiance of time high above the tawny sands of the desert the night was very sultry even here on this high and roomy summit the broad deep slab of granite was still warm with sunshine gone away and gave out heat like a dying furnace the steep and arduous ascent had taxed her strength and unloosing her robe as i turned to examine more minutely our strange quarters on the top of this lofty tomb or temple she sank to rest half reclining on her arm her chin in her upturned palm her face lifted away toward the rising moon half a dozen paces to the right i saw two tall and ponderous columns of granite standing in line with those that supported the great slab on which she rested evidently these grand and solitary columns had also once been topped by granite slabs but these had fallen to the ground under the leveling feet of many centuries and now lay almost swallowed up in the sea of yellow sands below i put out my foot carefully trying to reach the broad top of the nearest column of granite but it was beyond me stepping back a couple of paces and quietly removing my boots i gathered up my strength and made a leap landing almost in the center of the columns top a half step backward another leap who could resist the challenge of that lone and kingly column that remained i landed securely as before then turned about her face had not lifted an instant from the awful majesty of the orient slowly wearily the immense moon came shouldering up through the seas of yellow sand these billows of sand seemed to breathe and move the expiring heat of the departed sun made them scintillate and shimmer in a soft and undulating light and yet it was not light only the lone and solemn ghost of a departed day yellow and huge and startling stood the moon at last full grown and fearful in its nearness and immensity on the topmost lift of yellow sands in the yellow seas before us distance seemed to be annihilated the moon seemed to have forgotten her place and all proportion looking down into the sullen nile it seemed a black and bottomless chasm and it seemed so far away and the moon so very near black as blackest egypt rolled the somber nile down and on and on through this world of yellow light this light that was not light silence desolation death lay on all things below about above the west was molten yellow gold faint and fading it is true but where the yellow sands left off and the yellow skies began no man could say or guess save by the yellow stars that studded the west with an intense yellow yellow to the right and yellow to the left yellow overhead and yellow underfoot with only this endless chasm of erebus cleaving the yellow earth in halves with its bottomless pit of endless and indissoluble blackness after a time and all the world still one sea of softened yellow torn in two by charons chasm of black waters i silently leaped back replaced my boots on my feet and then held my breath for i had seen or perhaps felt an object move on the lifted levels of sand between us and the moon cautiously i sank down on my breast and peered low and long up the horizon i saw heard nothing glancing around to where my companion lay i saw that she still had not stirred from the half reclining position she had first taken with half lifted face in her upturned palm then she had seen nothing heard nothing this however did not argue much her life had not been of the desert she had spent her years in the study of men and women i had spent mine with wild beasts i could trust her to detect motives in men give the warning note of danger from dangerous men but the wild beasts and wilder men of the border were mine to watch and battle with not hers she had seen nothing evidently she feared nothing and so was resting resting in mind as in body and as i glanced again over my shoulder and saw how entirely content she seemed i was glad surely she depended entirely on me on my watchfulness and my courage and this made me more watchful and more resolute and stout of heart a man likes to be trusted a true man likes a true womans trust much indeed a strong man likes to be leaned upon it makes him stronger braver better let women never forget this admit that she too has her days of strength and endurance and admit that she too has her peculiar fortress of strength and courage and these also man respects and regards with piteous tenderness but man incapable of her finer and loftier courage and endurance resents her invasion of his prerogative it is only a womanly man who can really love a manly woman but to continue looking up a third time to this woman at my side i saw that she had let her head sink low on her leaning arm she was surely sleeping how i liked her trust and her faith in me and how i liked her courage too and her high quality of endurance it was her courage that had brought me up here this night to the contemplation of awful and allglorious africa silently and without lifting a finger she had shown me a world of burnished gold i had surely seen god through her we stood nearer together now than ever before this single hour of indescribable glory should forever stand as an altar in the desert our souls had melted and flown and tided on intermingled like molten gold in the golden atmosphere and the yellow scene that wrapped us round about and no word had been said when god speaks so audibly let man be silent i must have looked longer on the sleeping and trustful woman at my side than i ought to have looked for on turning my eyes again to the horizon there distinctly on the yellow sand and under the yellow moon moved stealthily as a cat yet graceful and grand the most kingly beast i ever beheld he did not look right nor left but moved along with huge head in the air slow and stately and triumphant in his fearful symmetry and strength chapter iv i half arose and felt for a trusty sixshooter this pistol was not one that had been purchased for this or any other occasion as the worthless pistols of the time are usually purchased but it had been my companion from boyhood as i half arose the lion suddenly halted he lifted his proud head higher still in the air and to my consternation half turned about and looked straight in my direction then a sidewise and circuitous step or two with his long reach of hinder leg his wide and deep and flexible flank slow and kingly splendid to see i sank down again quite willing to let him interview the land of arabs in the black chasm below they had spears and guns and everything down there everything but courage to face a lion with and i was not going to interfere with a fight which at the first had promised to be entirely their own but this new movement of mine only accentuated his graceful motion the head now turned in the air like the head of a man i had time to note and i record it with certainty that the massive head and the tumbled mane towered straight above the shoulder in fact the lower parts of the long mane looked most like the long shaggy beard of a man falling down upon his broad breast this i noted as he still kept on in his sidewise circuit above us and around us on the yellow sand and under the yellow moon at times he was almost indistinct but the carriage of that head there was a fine fascination in the lift and the movement and the turn of that stately head that must ever be remembered but can never be described as he came nearer for his sidewise walk was mainly in our direction i saw that he too was yellow as if born of this yellow world in this yellow night but his was a more ponderous yellow the yellow of red and rusty old gold at times he seemed almost black and all the time terrible in half a minute more he would be too close for comfort and i decided to arouse my companion she wakened fully awake if i may be allowed to express a fact so awkwardly you may know that there are people like that what is it a lion are you sure certain where right before your eyes why i see nothing she had looked and was still looking far out against the yellow horizon where her eyes had rested when she fell asleep and as she looked or rather before i ventured to point her to the spot almost under the tomb where the lion strode he passed on and was by this time perhaps almost quite under the great slab of granite where we rested i was about to whisper the fact in her ear when i fancied i felt the whole tomb tremble then it seemed to shake or rather rumble again then again it rumbled then again then there was a roar that literally shook the sand i heard the sand sift and rattle down like drops of rain from where it lay in the crevices as i listened to find whether or not he was moving forward toward the place by which we had ascended he was surely moving forward i felt rather than heard him move i assert and i must content myself for the present with merely asserting that you can feel the movements of an animal under such circumstances and i assert further that an animal especially a wild beast can feel your movements under almost any circumstances the undeveloped senses deserve a book by themselves but just now with the largest lion i ever saw coming straight upon me is hardly the time or place to write such a treatise pistol in hand i sprang to the steep and rugged passage and not a second too soon his mighty head was almost on a level with the granite slab and he was half crouching for a bound and a spring upward which would perhaps land him in our faces i could see or did i feel that his huge hinder feet were spread wide out and sunken in the sand with preparation to bend all their force toward bearing him upward in one mighty bound i fired fired right into his big red mouth between two hideous pickets of ugly yellow teeth he fell back and then gathering his ferocious strength he bounded up and forward again this time striking his left shoulder heavily against a projecting corner of the granite slab fortunately the ascent was slightly curving so that the distance could not be made at a single bound without collision else had we both surely been destroyed again the supple and comely beast disdaining to creep or crawl made a mighty leap upward but only to strike the rounding corner of the great granite slab and fall back as before but i knew he would reach us in time and if ever man did wish for fitting arms to fight with and defend woman it was i at that time true i had five shots left but what were they in the face of this furious king of beasts i began to fear that they would only serve to enrage him still he should have all i had to give death is has been and will be the best we can make of it all is to try and see that we shall not die ingloriously the woman had been by my side all this time and now as the lion paused as if to gather up the broken thunderbolts of his strength she laid a hand on my arm never so gently and said let me go down and meet him face to face i think he will not harm me madam i exclaimed impetuously you will meet him up here and face to face soon enough i think no that will not do you must trust the lion as daniel did i pushed her back as she tried to pass down almost violently there i cried as i wheeled about and forced her before me for an instant if you have real courage leap to the head of yonder column then on to the next quick be brave enough to save yourself and no i will not run away and leave you to die for gods sake you will run away and save me why how i will join you there go quick or it will be too late another leap of the lion bang bang this time he did not fall back but held on by sheer force of his powerful arms his terrible claws tearing at the granite slab as they hung and hooked over its outer edge bang bang bang the last shot i hurled my revolver in his face for he had not flinched or given back a single grain his breath and my breath were mingled there in the smoke of my pistol i heard or did i feel his great hinder feet fastening in the steep earth under him for his final struggle to the top i turned saw that she had reached the farther column and with three leaps and a bound i had crossed the granite slabs and stood erect on the nearer one not a moment had i left the lion with great noise of claws on the granite came tearing to the surface i crouched down out of breath on the outer edge of my column so as to be surely out of reach of his ponderous paws i expected him to decide the matter at once to reach us or give it up instantly but he seemed in no haste now he scarcely advanced at all for what seemed to me to be a long time finally jerking his tail like the swift movement of a serpent he strode along the farthest edge of the granite slab and seemed to take no notice of us whatever blood was dripping from his mouth but he did not seem to heed it once more he strode with his old majesty and seemed ashamed that he should have descended to the indignity of a struggle to gain the place where he now stood sullen and triumphant enraged he was choking dying with rage and yet this kingly creature would not even condescend to look in our direction why i could feel his fearful rage as he now walked on and around the edge of that granite slab at length he came opposite to where i lay crouching on the farther edge of my column he passed on without so much as turning his eyes in my direction and yet i felt i felt and knew as distinctly as if he could have talked and told me that he was carefully measuring the distance when the lion in his stately round came to the narrow pass by which he had ascended he paused an instant and half lowered his head ah how devoutly i did pray that he would be generous enough to descend to the sands and gracefully present us with his absence but no lifting his huge head even higher in the air than before he now passed on hurriedly came on around to where in his stately majesty he stood with quivering flank and flashing eye almost within reach of me yet he still disdained to even so much as look at me his head was far above me as i crouched there on the farther edge of my column his flashing eyes were lifted and looking far above me and beyond me maybe he was on the lookout over the desert for the coming of his companion soon however he set his huge paws on the very edge of the great slab on which he stood and then suddenly threw his right paw out toward me and against the edge of my column with the force and velocity of a catapult i heard the sharp keen claws strike and scrape on the granite as if they had been hooks of steel then he threw himself on his breast and hitching himself a little to one side he threw his right paw so far that it landed full in the center of my columns top and tore a bit of my coat sleeve then he hitched his huge body a little farther on over the edge and again threw his huge paw right at my face it fell short of its mark only a few inches as it seemed to me but having hastily gathered in my garments his claws did not find anything to fasten on and they drew back empty at this point three dusky etchings stood out against the golden east on the yellow sands and looked intently at us with their enormous heads high in the air and now the beast slowly arose and moved on a lions head seems always disproportionately large but when he is exercising for an appetite to eat you it looks large indeed the monster who was occupying the platform with us surely saw his followers indeed he must have seen them long before but his unbending dignity seemed to forbid that he should take any heed of them the newborn hope that he would descend and join his followers died as he came on around and now something strange and notable transpired this one incident is my excuse for thus elaborating this otherwise passive and tediously dull sketch of this night i had risen to my feet and as the lion came on around this woman with a force that was irresistible sprang to my side thrust me behind her and stepping forward with a single spring she stood on the edge of the column nearest to the lion i would have followed but that same force which i can now understand was a mental force and not at all a physical force held me hard and fast to where i stood she had let her robe fall as she sprang forward and now stood only as the hand of god had fashioned her a snowwhite silhouette of perfect comeliness against the terrible and bloody mouth and tossing mane of the lion she leaned forward as he came on around and close to the edge of his slab she looked him firmly and steadily in the face her wondrous eyes her midnight eyes of all israel the child of the wilderness had once more met the lion of the desert as of old who was this woman here who stepped between death and me and stood looking a wounded lion in the face was this judith again incarnate or was this something more than judith was it the priestess and the prophetess miriam back once more to the banks of the nile was it the old and forgotten mastery of all things animate which moses and his sister knew that gave her dominion over the king of the desert or was her name mary that other mary if you will who won all things to her side god in heaven god upon earth by the sad sweet pity of her face and the story of holy love that was written there the lions head for a moment forgot its lofty defiance as she leaned a little forward then the tossed and troubled mane rose up and rolled forward like an inflowing sea it never seemed so terrible he was surely about to spring and she too her right foot settled solidly back her left knee bent like a bow her shapely and snowy shoulders under their glory of black hair bowed low her dauntless and defiant spirit had already precipitated itself forward and was smiting the imperious beast full in his blazing eyes i knew that her body would follow her spirit in an instant more face to face spirit to spirit soul to soul a second only the combat lasted the awful ferocity and force of the brute was beaten down melted like lofty battlements of snow before the burning arrows of the sun and he slowly surlily shrank in size in spirit in space a paw drew back from the edge of the block the eyes drooped the head dropped a little and the terrible mane seemed terrible no more as slowly doggedly mightily aye doggedly and majestically too at the same time this noble creature forced himself sidewise and back a little then he hesitated rebellion was in his mighty heart he turned suddenly and looked her full in the face once more all the beast that was in him rose up the terrible mane now seemed more terrible than before with great head tossed tail whipped back and teeth in the air talons unsheathed and legs gathered under him he was about to bound forward but the woman was before him with eyes still fastened on his face she with one long leap forward drove not only her shining soul but her snowy body right against his teeth or rather she had surely done so had not the lion half turned about shrank back as she leaped forward then slowly looking back with his blazing but cowering eyes feeling back with his spirit still defiant if but to see whether her courage failed her in the least or her mighty spirit was still in battle armor and then he passed his companions had drawn back and into a depression in the desert where he slowly and sullenly joined them one two three four dim yet distinct black silhouettes against the yellow east then but a single confused black etching away away smaller and smaller gone i gathered up her robe crossed over and letting it fall on her shoulders where she still stood looking down and after the beast i picked up my pistol from where it had fallen a few feet below and as she turned about carefully reloaded it from cartridges by chance in my vest pocket returning to the summit i found her again resting on her couch at the corner of the huge slab tranquilly as if we had not been disturbed i did not speak not a single word had been uttered all this time i sat down at the feet of this woman not at her side as before and let my own feet dangle down over the edge on the side farthest away from the isolated columns neither of us spoke nor did she move hand or foot till morning the cheated juliet by q extracted from the memoirs of a retired burglar the house in question was what peter the scholar who corrects my proofsheets calls one of the rusinurby sort the front facing a street and the back looking over a turfed garden with a lime tree or two a laburnum and a lawntennis court marked out its white lines plain to see in the starlight at the end of the garden a door painted dark green led into a narrow lane between high walls where if two persons met one had to turn sideways to let the other pass the entrance to this lane was cut in two by a wooden post about the height of your hip and just beyond this in the high road george was waiting for us with the dogcart we had picked the usual time the dinnerhour it had just turned dark and the churchclock two streets away was chiming the quarter after eight when peter and i let ourselves in by the green door i spoke of and felt along the wall for the gardeners ladder that we knew was hanging there a simpler job there never was the bedroom window we had marked on the firstfloor stood right open to the night air and inside there was the light of a candle or two flickering just as a careless maid will leave them after her mistress has gone down to dinner to be sure there was a chance of her coming back to put them out but we could hear her voice going in the servants hall as we lifted the ladder and rested it against the sill shes good for half a hour yet peter whispered holding the ladder while i began to climb but if i hear her voice stop ill give the signal to be cautious i went up softly pushed my head gently above the level of the sill and looked in it was a roomy place with a great halftester bed hung with curtains standing out from the wall on my right the curtains were of chintz a dark background with flaming red poppies sprawling over it and the further curtain hid the dressingtable and the candles upon it and the jewelcase that i confidently hoped to stand upon it also a bright brussels carpet covered the floor and the wallpaper i remember though for the life of me i cant tell why was a pale grey ground worked up to imitate watered silk with sprigs of gilt honeysuckle upon it i looked round and listened for half a minute the house was still as death up here not a sound in the room or in the passages beyond with a nod to peter to hold the ladder firm i lifted one leg over the sill then the other dropped my feet carefully upon the thick carpet and went quickly round the bed to the dressingtable but at the corner and as soon as ever i saw round the chintz curtain my knees gave way and i put out a hand towards the bedpost before the dressingtable and in front of the big glass in which she could see my white face was an old lady seated she wore a blaze of jewels and a low gown out of which rose the scraggiest neck and shoulders i have ever looked on her hair was thick with black dye and fastened with a diamond star the powder between the two candles showed on her cheekbones like flour on a millers coat chin on hand she was gazing steadily into the mirror before her and even in my fright i had time to note that a glass of sherry and a plate of rice and curry stood at her elbow among the rougepots and powderpuffs while i stood stock still and pretty well scared out of my wits she rose still staring at my image in the glass folded her hands modestly over her bosom and spoke in a deep tragical voice the prince then facing sharply round she held out her thin arms you have come at last there wasnt much to say to this except that i had so i confessed it even with the candles behind her i could see her eyes glowing like a dogs and an uglier poor creature this world could scarcely show is the ladder set against the window since you seem to know maam said i it is ah romeo your cheeks are ruddy your poppies are too red then im glad my colours come back for to tell the truth you did give me a turn just at first you were looking out for me no doubt my prince she stretched out her arms again and being pretty well at my wits end i let her embrace me it has been so long she said oh the weary while and they illtreat me here where have you been all this tedious time i wasnt going to answer that you may be sure it appeared to me that twas my right to ask questions rather than stand there answering them if theyve been illtreating you maam said i they shall answer for it my love yes maam would it be taking a liberty if i asked their names there is gertrude gertrudes hash is as good as settled maam i checked gertrude off on my thumb thats my niece for a moment i feared id been a little too prompt but she went on and next theres henry and the children who have more than once made faces at me and phipson phipsons in it too you know her dont i it surprised me a trifle to find that phipson was a female three times tonight she pulled my hair and the rice she brought me look at it all stuck together and sodden phipson shall pay for it with her blood my hero my darling dont spare phipson she screams bitterly if a pin is stuck into her i did it once stick her all over with pins by this id begun to guess what was pretty near the truth that i was talking with a mad aunt of the family below and that the game was in my hands if i played it with decent care so i brought her to face the important question look here i said all this shall be done when you are out of their hands at present im running a considerable risk in braving these persecutors of yourn dearest madam the ladders outside and the carriage waiting hadnt we better elope at once she gave a sob and fell on my shoulders oh is it true is it true pinch me that i may awake if this is but a happy dream you are ready this moment theres just one other little matter maam your jewels you wont leave them to your enemies i suppose this was the dangerous moment and i felt a twitch of the nerves as i watched her face to see how she would take the suggestion but the poor silly soul turned up her eyes to mine all full of tears and confidence dearest i am old old had you come earlier my beauty had not wanted jewels to set it off but now i must wear them to look my best as your bride she hid her face in her hands for a second then turned to the dressingtable lifted her jewelcase and put it into my hands i am ready she repeated let us be quick and stealthy as death she followed me to the window and looking out drew back what horrible black depths its as easy said i as pie you could do it on your head look here i climbed out first and helped her setting her feet on the rungs we went down in silence i choking with laughter all the way at the sight of peter below who was looking with his mouth open and his lips too weak to meet on the curses and wonderment that rose up from the depths of him when i touched turf and handed him the jewelcase he took it like a man in a trance we put the ladder back into its place and stole over the turf together but outside the gardendoor peter could stand no more of it ive a firearm in my pocket whispered he pulling up and im going to fire it off to relieve my feelings if you dont explain here and now who in pitys name is she you mug shes the original sleeping beauty im eloping with her and youve got her jewels pardon me jem he says in his gentlemanly way if i dont quite see are you taking her off to melt her or marry her for how to get rid of her else the poor old creature had halted too three paces ahead of us and waited while we whispered with the moonlight that slanted down into the lane whitening her bare neck and flashing in her jewels one moment i said and stepped forward to her you had better take off those ornaments here my dear and give them to my servant to take care of theres a carriage waiting for us at the end of the lane and when he has stowed them under the seat we can climb in and drive off to the end of the world to the very rim of it my hero she pulled the gems from her ears hair and bosom and handed them to peter who received them with a bow next she searched in her pocket and drew out a tiny key peter unlocked the case and having carefully stowed the diamonds inside locked it again handed back the key touched his hat and walked off towards the dogcart my dearest lady i began as soon as we were alone between the high walls if the devotion of a life her bare arm crept into mine there is but a little time left for us in which to be happy year after year i have marked off the almanack day by day i have watched the dial i saw my sisters married and my sisters daughters and still i waited each had a man to love her and tend her but none had such a man as i would have chosen there were none like you my prince no i daresay not oh but my heart is not so old take my hand it is firm and strong touch my lips they are burning a low whistle sounded at the top of the lane as i took her hands i pushed her back and turning ran for my life i suppose that as i ran i counted forty before her scream came and then the sound of her feet pattering after me she must have run like a demon for i was less than ten yards ahead when peter caught my wrist and pulled me up on to the backseat of the dogcart and before george could set the horse going her hand clutched at the flap on which my feet rested it missed its grasp and she never got near enough again but for half a minute i looked into that horrible face following us and working with silent rage and for half a mile at least i heard the patter of her feet in the darkness behind indeed i can hear it now the mystic krewe by maurice thompson chapter i about seventy years ago a young man of strong physique and prepossessing appearance arrived at new orleans he had come from new york of which city he was a native and had brought with him a considerable sum of money supplemented by a letter of introduction to judge favart de caumartin who was then at the flood tide of his fame it would not be fair to call our young man our hero would be the good old phrase an adventurer without taking pains to qualify the impression that might be produced hepworth coleman had his own way of looking at life fifty years later he would have been a tragedian probably a famous one but the conditions were not favorable to awakening histrionic ambition at the time when his character his tastes his ambition should have been forming what he saw that was most fascinating to him had no distinct form it lay along the southwestern horizon a dreamy mistcovered something not unlike the confines of romance hepworth coleman was rich and what was perhaps a greater misfortune he had no living kinsfolk for whom he cared or who cared for him practically speaking he was alone in the world moreover he had an imagination scotts novels byrons poetry the french romances and i know not what else of the sort had been his chief reading for physical recreation he had turned to fencing and pistol practice when i add that he was but twentytwo and unmarried the rest might be guessed but coleman was not a young man of the world in the worst sense he had not turned to evil sources of dissipation healthy vigorous full of spirit he nevertheless had sentimental longings as indefinite as they were persistent youth is the spring time when longen folk to gon on pilgrimages as old chaucer words it and it would be hard to find the young man who has not felt the vaguely outlined yet irresistible desire to wander to go over the horizon into a strange new world hepworth coleman when he was taken with this longing felt no restraint cast around him he was absolutely free had all the means necessary why should he not go where he pleased if it seems strange that he should have been attracted to new orleans rather than to the old world we must remember what new orleans was in no other city not even paris could at that time compare with it as a center of genuine romance nor was this romance unmixed with lawlessness of the most picturesque kind money poured into it from a hundred sources more or less illegitimate besides the streams of wealth produced by cotton sugar and rice industries gambling was indeed a fine art duelling appeared more a pastime than anything else and what went on in the gilded halls and melodyfilled salles may be imagined i suppose though i do not care to cast a glance that way hepworth coleman had heard much of the gay city of its warm odorous atmosphere its hospitality its social charm the smack of reckless romance in all its ways somehow the desire to go there got hold of his imagination and he went the letter to judge favart de caumartin was given to coleman by his banker who in handing it to him said i dont know the judge personally never saw him but he has done a lot of business through us he is very rich evidently very influential and certainly will be of use to you i feel that i can take the liberty of sending you to him because well he is under many obligations to the bank and is likely to want many more large favors i fancy that youll find him a trifle eccentric but enthusiastically hospitable a creole of the creoles i judge him to be and a representative of the nabobs young coleman considered himself lucky to carry with him a document that would give him introduction to a person so renowned as judge favart de caumartin of whom he had been recently reading a good deal owing to a duel fought between the judge and one colonel sam smith of the united states army in which the latter had been killed the duel had brought out history from which it appeared that judge favart de caumartin had fought before not once only but many times and always to the death of his antagonist along with these facts were disclosed numerous picturesque details of the judges past life with more than hints that in his young days he had been a pirate or something of the sort the account also made the most of his wealth his almost reckless liberality his eccentricity and most of all the air of mystery which still hung over his business operations all this was rich food for an imagination already thoroughly saturated with the spirit of romantic adventure and during the voyage from new york to new orleans hepworth coleman found deep satisfaction in anticipating what he felt was in store for him in every fiber of his frame he felt the assurance that he was on the way to new and strange experiences his banker had sent a letter to precede his arrival by a few days asking a friend to secure suitable apartments for mr hepworth coleman gentleman the consequence being that a dark young man small but wellbuilt and handsome met him at the landing to conduct him to his suit of elegant rooms on royal street is you meestu coleman sah inquired this young stranger in a musical and respectful tone of voice i look fo zat ma at prayson yes sir that is my name said coleman briskly at the same time he showed by his look that he would like to know whom he was meeting varee glad you come meestu coleman varee glad sah indeed got your rooms all prepare fo you sah yes sah zey is beautifu an sharming rooms thank you i am much indebted are you the gentleman to whom mr cartwright the banker wrote in my behalf nah sah not any banker write to me i been told to meet you at zis place at prayson happy to see you mist coleman varee happy there was an elegant carriage at hand waiting for our friend a negro driver in livery and a small black footman stood by coleman entered the vehicle followed closely by the young creole who had met him on the landing he saw his baggage hoisted into a little wagon to come after the carriage for some reason not exactly explained this whole proceeding affected coleman peculiarly he felt a sort of vague uneasiness as if he were passing into an atmosphere of mystery if not of danger as he was whirled through the narrow streets he caught glimpses of queer tilecovered houses with curious hanging galleries high walls and gloomy courts flanked these and here and there a dusky palm or a bright orange tree flung up its foliage blooming magnolia clumps filled the air with a heavy languid odor but what most attracted the attention of coleman was a company of four or five young men dressed like dandies swaggering along on one of the banquettes sidewalks and singing a drinking song at the top of their voices one of these hilarious fellows made a lasting impression on our young friends imagination he was a tall oliveskinned handsome man apparently about twentyfive strikingly dressed in a plaid coat a vest of red and black velvet gray trousers and a profusely ruffled shirt evidently he was the leading spirit of the party at all events he was somewhat in front with his black cap set well back on his shapely head while his jet black hair fell in shining curls over his strong shoulders he was shouting forth the french drinking carol in a voice as sweet as it was loud and at the same time waving in the air a small cane the entire group looked the worse for wine their faces flushed and their eyes brilliant who is that strangelooking man in front inquired coleman of his creole companion as they passed them by zat geman ees ze goozh favart de caumartin was the answer that fairly startled the interrogator coleman actually grew red in the face and exclaimed that judge favart de caumartin surely sir you are mistaken beg pahdon sah zat ees monsieur le juge favart de caumartin i him know varee well myself at prayson coleman turned and stared back through the window at the strutting youthful figure leading the noisy rout how could that be the celebrated duellist the guardian pirate it cannot be he muttered aloud it is impossible varee well meestu coleman said the young creole dryly but i mus inqui yo pahdon sah monsieur le juge favart de caumartin ees to me well acquainted i wemark to you sah zat zare ees not any mistake oh certainly sir i beg a thousand pardons exclaimed coleman pulling himself together and seeing his breach of etiquette of course you were right but i was so surprised to see the judge looking so young i had supposed he was an aged man i am astonished oh monsieur le juge ees not so young not so varee hees hair not much gray while they were still discussing this matter the carriage stopped in front of a square heavylooking house which painted a dull red and projecting its upper gallery over the banquette flung out on either side a heavy brick wall on whose top was a jagged dressing of broken bottles and jags it looked more like a convent than like an apartmenthouse hepworth coleman found his suit of rooms admirable in every respect large airy luxuriously furnished his creole conductor parted with him at the door without giving his name or address and without any explanation whatever of his connection with the matter of securing these elegant apartments or with making his arrival easy and pleasant some silent and obsequious negro servants were at hand to do his bidding but he soon dismissed them while he flung himself upon a sofa and lit his pipe altogether incomprehensible to him were the suggestions of secrecy and mystery connected with his reception scarcely less so was the youthful nay boyish appearance of judge favart de caumartin as if the mysterious atmosphere meant to continue growing denser it was while he lay along the luxuriant scarlet sofa smoking resting and meditating that a beautiful girl came and stood for a moment in the doorway of his chamber she blushed sweetly at sight of him recoiled violently and then slipped swiftly away leaving behind her a rustle of fine stuff a sparkle of rare jewels and a lingering bouquet of violets and roses coleman felt the delicious shock of her magnetic beauty thrill through him a sort of shimmering outline of her body wavered or appeared to waver in the door after she had gone so dazzling had been the effect of her fresh pure flowerlike yet intensely human beauty he heard her feet tap swiftly and lightly along the hall involuntarily and with unpardonable curiosity he sprang up and hurrying to the door looked out but she was not in sight for the first time in his life he felt his heart beating unnaturally chapter ii evening was drawing on sending a soft twilight into the room when colemans dinner was brought in by a shy and silent old colored woman he had not ordered the meal nor had he felt the need of it doubtless the stimulus afforded by the unusual character of his surroundings held his sense of hunger in abeyance the old woman retired as soon as she had arranged the repast on a round mahogany table coleman found the oysters the wine the broiled fish the french bread and the black coffee excellent to such a degree that he ate almost everything before him then leaning far back in his chair he began to study the silver set from which all those good things had been taken the platter was in the form of a flounder the sugar bowl was a frog the cream pitcher a heron the coffeepot a pelican these curious pieces were exquisitely carved and on each was cut the name favart de caumartin in plain bold letters even on the fivearmed silver candlestick in which burned fragrant myrtle wax tapers appeared that striking inscription he surveyed the room now with a more critical eye discovering at once that the pictures the curtains the carpets and indeed all the articles of furniture were costly and beautiful beyond anything he had ever seen before evidently he was in judge favart de caumartins house the moon was shining brilliantly when coleman went forth for a short walk in the street not many people were abroad it being the dinnerhour but certain cafйs were crowded with men and women who were drinking champagne and discussing the dishes on wellspread tables at the door of one these gorgeous rooms coleman met the young man whom a few hours before he had seen leading the singers in the street it occurred to him that now was as good as any time to present his letter to the judge so he forthwith stepped near him and said lifting his hat i believe i have the honor of meeting judge favart de caumartin the gentleman stared at him a moment very deliberately then with just a suspicion of a smile and with a courteous dignity wholly inimitable and indescribable doffed his queer little black cap as he spoke and who does me the honor of addressing me i am hepworth coleman of new york ah i hold a letter to you from mr phineas cartwright of the firm of cartwright vanderveer bankers indeed i feel honored coleman produced the letter and tendered it but not without a vague feeling of insecurity of some sort he had not expected this peculiar reserve and caution on the part of the judge could it be that he was to be treated as an infliction to be borne for mere policys sake his distrust and doubt however were of short duration for the judge had no sooner read the epistle which was much longer than any mere letter of introduction than his whole manner changed he held out his hand i am charmed delighted sir he said with a slight creole accent that made his voice very pleasing i am proud to see you i hope you find your rooms agreeable coleman clasped his hand and felt that measure of relief which comes when one is suddenly lifted out of a very awkward situation the judge read the bankers letter over again with great deliberation and apparently with much concentration of mind while coleman who could not remove his eyes from his fascinating dark face stood waiting for an opportunity to say you do me infinite honor judge in quartering me in your own house i had not expected and could not expect such hospitality the judge hesitated then with a calm smile remarked that whatever he could do for so distinguished a visitor would be but a small expression of the greater hospitality that he would like to bestow were he able and now he presently continued come with me to my own private apartments where we can have some quiet conversation and a smoke coleman could not fail to see that the judge was still somewhat touched with wine though the mood of wild hilarity had passed off they passed along the street until they reached a narrow blind alley into which the moonlight fell but dimly between dusky walls to colemans surprise the judge led the way into this then up a flight of winding and rather rickety stairs to a dark hall along which they passed to what seemed a great distance at the end the judge fumbled for some time and by some means opened a low heavy door leading into a room that reeked with the odor of tobacco and the fumes of wine passing across this by the light of a dim dormer window they reached a close passageway which led to another prisonlike door which the judge managed to open after a great deal of trouble the room that they now entered was exceedingly small a mere cell in extent as coleman felt rather than saw the walls damp and grimy being almost within reach on either hand stand here for one moment please said the judge touching colemans arm until i call a servant then he stepped briskly back through the doorway and drew the solid shutter to with a hollow clang some strange echoes went wandering away as if from distance to distance above below around followed by absolute silence a faint flicker of light came from above but it seemed a reflection rather than a direct beam from the moon and the air was close heavy atrociously bad coleman stood amazed for a few moments before going to the door which he found immovable he groped around the wall only to discover that there was no other outlet chapter iii judge favart de caumartins residence was a large rambling structure more like a hotel than like a private house considering that his wife was dead and that he had but one living child a daughter of seventeen it was strange that he kept up such an extensive establishment in which perhaps twenty rooms stood richly furnished but unoccupied it was his pleasure however and his pleasure was law mlle olympe de caumartin was greatly surprised when by merest chance she discovered hepworth coleman making himself quite at home in a remote room of the house we have seen how she showed her confusion as she stepped into the doorway and found herself face to face with the young man the glance that passed between them wrought a wonder in the heart of each i shall not say that they fell in love at first sight love cannot be so accurately traced that its origin can be exactly found out in any particular case it is enough to record that mlle olympe de caumartin caught something new something sweet from that momentary gaze and shut it up in her heart involuntarily with a thrill that never again quite left her breast she was back through halls and rooms to her own boudoir her cheeks and lips rosy with excitement and a gentle tremor in her limbs that evening in the library the judge told his daughter that he had given a suit of rooms in the farthest wing of the mansion to a wealthy young gentleman from new york i have had letters from mr cartwright my banker there asking me to take care of him and this seemed the best i could do under the circumstances i did not see my way to bringing him any nearer to us we dont care to have another member added to our family eh olympe dear mlle de caumartin blushed she may have felt a touch of guilt because she could not muster courage to tell her father that she had already visited mr coleman i have not seen him yet continued the judge i thought it best to let him have some rest before calling upon him cartwright advises me that he is of an excellent family a man to be given the greatest attention and for my bankers sake if for nothing else i must meet the demand upon my hospitality he came a fortnight earlier than i expected but i had jules watching for him and you know jules never fails but you should have told me before father dear said mlle olympe only a while ago while wandering through the distant wing of the house i invaded this young gentlemans apartment it surprised him evidently as much as it abashed me the obvious moral of which is replied the judge quickly that you are hereafter to be more careful about what rooms you are stumbling into as he spoke his dark oval face with its fine grave smile was almost like a boys the flush that lay under the skin shone through with a suggestion of some repressed stimulus as if a great passion had forced it up in his eyes an underglow so to call it smoldered with fascinating vagueness mlle olympe sat for a moment on his knee and stroked his long black hair you will stay with me tonight father dear she presently murmured coaxingly you will not go out tonight i must be gone a little while he said rising at once but just a little while she clung close to him not this night please she urged with a touching tremor in her voice oh you remember this night a year ago you had that dreadful adventure in the dark room you must not go out please for my sake do not an expert observer could have seen while this was going on a strange halfworried almost fiercely concentrated expression in the judges eyes it was as if he mightily wished to remain with his child but could not by any effort resist some powerful temptation tugging at him and drawing him away he kissed her tenderly pushed her gently from him and went out the girl cast herself upon a sofa and buried her face in her hands as a vision of that night one year before came up before her eyes some strange masked men had brought her father home far in the night white as a ghost helpless speechless apparently dead they put him down there in the room and vanished he had no wound no bruise no mark of any violence but he recovered very slowly and he never told what had befallen him mlle olympe knew of her fathers frequent duels and if he had been brought in dead or badly off on account of pistol ball or rapier thrust she would not have been surprised beyond measure but this mysterious performance of the masked men and the unaccountable condition of the judge were taken hold upon by her imagination and raised to the highest power of romantic meaning a year had passed and she might not have recalled the exact anniversary but for the prattle of an old servant to the effect that she had seen her master the judge marching at the head of a company of masked men himself wearing an invisible mask and a queer black velvet cap mlle olympe observed that her father was flushed as if with wine and his bearing was indicative of some subtile and indescribable excitement within him when he went away she felt that something startling was going to happen soon chapter iv when hepworth coleman suddenly found himself a prisoner in that close dark room he did not at first suspect any treachery on the part of judge favart de caumartin he expected that gentleman to return in the course of a few minutes but this favorable impression was soon removed by certain startling events that crowded one upon another first a low rumbling clanging sound like the beating of metallic gongs in the distance came through the walls and filled the cell then as this died away to utter silence he heard tumultuous whispering all around above below the thousand voices all seemed to be saying the same thing which presently he made out to be the words the krewe is coming make ready for the krewe when the whispering ended little purple lights began to flash here and there but so mysteriously glinted that he could not locate them and these were followed by phantom faces wan waxen faintly luminous appearing and fading instantly succeeded by intense darkness now hepworth coleman was a man of iron nerve an athlete in body and spirit who although full of romantic and poetic impulses was at the base of his character as brave and steadfast as a lion still even the best courage has its moment of faltering and just at the point when one whole wall of his cell was withdrawn so that he stood in the full glare of twenty brilliant chandeliers that lighted a large gorgeously decorated hall he felt the blood grow stiflingly heavy on his heart before him stood a file of fantastic figures men oddly clad and strangely armed who clashed their brazen shields together and pointed their swords at his breast on the walls of the spacious room hung weirdlooking trophies skulls pictures of dead men ghastly and livid pistols swords and strange banners the floor was carpeted with heavy persian tapestry thickly padded underneath coleman stood gazing while the file of armed men perhaps platoon would be more correct went through some silent but intricate evolutions after beating their shields together and threatening him with their swords when the movements were ended one of the masters came up to him and struck him lightly with the flat of his weapon across the cheek saying in a loud whisper beware you are in imminent danger coleman took him at his word and instantly let go a blow from the shoulder his closeset fist met the maskers jaw with a sound of crushing pasteboard and down went the man outstretched at full length on the floor his shield and sword giving forth a muffled clang as they crossed upon the soft carpet quick as a cat coleman leaped forward and picked up the sword a beautiful rapier and assuming a defensive attitude cried out boldly come one at a time and i will fight you all the fantastic figures looked at one another with evident questioning though not a word was said meantime the fallen one scrambled to his feet and swore two or three bitter french oaths the leader rebuked him with gestures come one at a time you cowardly villains repeated coleman and ill soon finish you all come on the first one if you dare meet a man he was terribly angry but his voice was steady and even there was a space of silence then the leader said something to one of the men who immediately cast aside his shield and advanced with his rapier it was a short conflict coleman disarmed his antagonist with ease in less than a minute another man came on and shared the same fate with the addition of a prick through the wrist of the swordarm this was exhilarating to coleman in his exasperation at being made the butt of some mysterious trick come next he cried i want the best of you and the best is a coward come on evidently the mystic band now felt the gravity that the occasion was assuming the maskers looked to their leader dont stand there afraid sneered coleman come on and get your turn whos next one after another responded only to fare badly as yet however all had escaped without deadly hurt when the leader himself made ready to fight those who had come to grief were quietly cared for by others and all seemed to treat the proceedings as by no means startling or even unusual when the leader threw aside his shield and took off his tall plumecovered hat coleman was able to recognize judge favart de caumartin more by his form and bearing than by any disclosure of his features as the judge handled his rapier all the company of maskers even the sorelywounded ones came forward to look on with eager expectation his was steel that never yet had failed to find the vitals of his opponent but on the other hand there stood coleman steadfast and alert the very picture of strength and will and the embodiment of quickness and certainty his sword bearing at its point a tiny red clot of blood they looked with straining eyes and did not feel sure of the result even with their captain as their champion come on sir and take your punishment you cowardly leader of cowards exclaimed coleman in a most exasperating tone dont stand there dreading it pluck up a little nerve and come on it is useless to say that judge favart de caumartin needed no bullying of this sort to urge him into combat with beautiful swiftness and grace he sprang forward and at once took the offensive then followed sword play that was amazing to look at each combatant showed that mastery of the fencing art which makes the weapon appear to be a part of the man so swiftly leaped the shining shafts of steel that the eye saw only fine symmetrical figures shimmering between the fighters while spangles of fire leaped from the crossing edges coleman felt at once that he had met his match the judge tingled with the discovery that here at last was a master from the first it was a fight to the death if possible neither could hope to disarm the other nor was there probability of any mere disablement ending the contest the watchers looking on in breathless suspense heard with intensely straining ears the almost magically rapid clinking of the blades coleman fought as if with the energy of all the accumulated romance of his recent experiences half recognizing as he parried and thrust and feinted and recovered guard the vivid picturesqueness the melodramatic unreality and yet the deadly intensity of the situation he did not know where he was or why he had been brought there the whole affair had mystery enough in it to have destroyed the will power of any weaker man but to him while the strangeness affected his imagination there was nothing in the matter to make him falter or to weaken the force of his arm a fine glow of enthusiasm flashed indeed into his blood and with it an access of cunning grace and swift certainty of hand and eye the feeling prevailed that he had in some strange way stepped out of the real world into the world of romance and as he fought the charm of heroism fell upon him and like the knights of old he felt the strength of a glorious desperation all round him the vague spirit of dreamland seemed to hover though the hideous pictures of skeletons and cadavers gleamed real enough in the glare of the chandeliers what inspired him most however was the knowledge that he was trying his force with that of the greatest duellist in the world and one who had always killed his man there was something more that gave spirit and courage to coleman he was in some indirect way remembering the beautiful girl who had appeared at the door of his room and he half imagined that he was doing battle for the right to know more of her youth is a mystery in itself and love knows no law of origin or of progress by some cerebral slight some trick of thinking under a thought so to say coleman was making a love dream keep time to the ringing strokes of his sword a girl whose name he did not know whose voice he had never heard was inspiring him as he strained every nerve as the combat proceeded the lookerson saw that colemans play was new to the judge who found great difficulty in meeting and parrying certain eccentric movements that invariably ended in a thrust of lightning quickness presently the judge tore off his mask with his left hand he had to do this at the risk of his life for he could not breath freely with it on but his great skill saved him even then nay more it came near giving him the victory as coleman lunged the agile creole leaped aside and returned quickly with a wicked thrust that barely reached his adversarys breast piercing it to the depth of a half inch now the fight took on more of passion and less of grace as if the men felt that it was to be a test of strength at last round and round back and forth this way and that they leaped and recoiled and advanced their faces one dark and beautiful as a southern night the other fair and magnetic as a new england june day fixed and staring the white froth gathering on their lips when the end came it was like nothing ever before witnessed in a new orleans duel how it happened not one of the observers could tell but the two men appeared to rush into each others arms and then it was seen that each had run the other through that broke the charm the masked men sprang forward and separated the combatants and all began to speak at once chapter v judge favart de caumartin and hepworth coleman were by order of the judge himself taken to the judges mansion where their wounds were examined by physicians and surgeons quickly summoned mlle olympe de caumartin found herself nursing two almost dying patients at the same time although she suspected that this was the result of a duel between her father and the young stranger she was not told the secret of the affair until long afterward strange to say although the judge was much the older man and was wounded much nearer the heart he recovered and was walking about in his house before coleman had even taken a turn for the better the first thing he did was to order his daughter to cease her nursing of the young man it is not proper he said for a young girl to be the nurse of a man who is a stranger mlle olympe blushed scarlet and was so much confused that she could not find a word to say it had been a great pleasure to her to wait upon coleman who though for the greater part of the time quite insensible of her presence seemed to respond better to her care than to the treatment of the doctors she had been having her sweet dream was in love with him indeed and the command of her father struck her like a blow judge favart de caumartin suspected the truth about his daughter and was not slow in making up his mind in the matter he gave strict orders that the hall between colemans rooms and the rest of the mansion should be kept at all times locked and barred love laughs at such precautions hepworth coleman during his convalescence lay on his back and thought of nobody but mlle olympe and when at last he was able to get up he sent for her it so chanced that the judge having got well in a measure was gone up to natchez on business mlle olympe did not go to see the young man but she wrote him a note explaining her fathers wishes but he has never forbidden you to come to see me when you are able to walk so far as to the library she added very frankly and i see no reason why you should stay away when the judge returned it was too late to interfere as he soon discovered and he had to bow to the inevitable the mystery of the adventure with the masked men in that secret salle has never been further explained judge favart de caumartin would not consent to his daughters marriage until he had exacted a promise from coleman that he would never divulge what he knew the truth was that coleman knew very little he tried to discover the blind alley into which the judge had led him on that eventful evening but there was no such alley to discover the whereabouts of the mysterious hall cannot be pointed out today although from that memorable tuesday in the spring of up to the mardigras of every anniversary of the mystic krewe has been duly celebrated by a fantastic band that at a certain hour of the night parades the streets of new orleans i do not refer to the regular carnival societies these are but playful imitations of mystery the genuine krewe as weirdly strange and mysterious as ever may be seen only on royal street a small band headed by a tall slender dark man who wears an invisible mask and a quaint black velvet cap where they come from nobody has ever been able to discover who they are is not known even to the great rex the king of the carnival hepworth coleman and mlle olympe de caumartin were married in due time and lived on royal street all their lives every year on the evening of mardigras they were called upon to give dinner to the mystic krewe thirteen in number who ate in silence with their masks on the last of these dinners was in that year saw the twain who for forty years had been happy together laid in their tomb side by side strangely enough there is no record whatever of judge favart de caumartins death indeed there is a tradition to the effect that he it is who still leads the mystic krewe strange adventures of a million dollars by ingersoll lockwood old new yorkers may remember dingees famous club house in lower greene street from to it was the most fashionable gambling house in the metropolis its founder alphonse dingee having been the first to introduce roulette and rouge et noir into the new world it was in or a little later that ill health obliged his son cyrill to sell the business out he retired to his country seat at bricksburg quite a palatial residence for those days where he died shortly after leaving a round million dollars and one child a daughter daisy spite of the fact that she was popularly known throughout the country as the gamblers daughter there were several respectable young men in the place who would have been only too happy to administer an estate worth a round million with daisy thrown in for better or worse but daisy dingee knew what she wanted and it was nothing more nor less than an alliance with the most aristocratic family in the country to wit the delurys whose large white mansion at the other end of the town was as tumbledown and shabby looking as daisys was neat fresh and well kept miss dingee therefore proceeded to throw herself at the head of one monmouth delury mentally and physically a colorless sort of an individual who for want of sufficient intellect to make an honest living passed his time going to seed with the thousand or so acres of land belonging to him and his maiden sisters hetty prudence and martha three women who walked as stiff as they talked although they never were known to discuss any subject other than the delury family when daisys proposition was made known to them they tried to faint but were too stiff to fall over and were obliged to content themselves with gasping out what daisy dingee marry our brother the head of the delury family but it was the first idea that had ever entered the brothers head and he clung to it with a parents affection for his first born in a few months mr and mrs monmouth delury set out for paris with that proverbial speed with which americans betake themselves to the french capital when occasion offers they found it a much pleasanter place than bricksburg delury improved rapidly and daisy fell quite in love with him made her will in his favor contracted the typhoid fever and died whereupon the really disconsolate widower sent for his three sisters to join him they had but one objection to going that was to part company with the dear old homestead but they overcame it the day after receiving monmouths letter which happened to be a friday and took the saturdays steamer to confess the truth the delurys had been so landpoor that their spare aristocratic figures were rather the result of necessity than inclination six months of paris life under the benign protection of dingees round million made different women of them it was wonderful what a metamorphosis parisian dressmakers and restaurateurs effected in their figures they became round and plump they stopped talking about bricksburg signed themselves the misses delury of new york enrolled themselves as patrons of art gave elegant dinners and in a very short time set up pretensions to being the leaders of the american colony but remorseless fate was at their heels figaro unearthed the secret of old dingees million and the delurys suddenly found themselves the sensation of paris the butt of ridicule in the comic papers monmouth had been in poor health for several months and this killed him dingees million was now in the eye of the law divided up among his three sisters but fate willed it otherwise for the following year hetty the eldest died of roman fever and six months later prudence fell a victim to rat poison in a small hotel at grasse city of delightful odors in the south of france whither she had gone in search of balmy air for her sister martha who had suddenly developed symptoms of consumption left thus alone in the world with old dingees million and an incurable ailment marthas only ambition was to reach bricksburg and die in the old white delury mansion it seemed to her that its great spacious rooms would enable her to breathe more easily and to fight death off for possibly another year but it was not to be she got as far as paris when old dingees million again changed hands going this time by will to marthas only relatives twin brothers john and william winkletip produce dealers in washington street new york the will was a peculiar one as was to be expected i give devise and bequeath all the property popularly known as the dingee million to my cousins john and william winkletip produce dealers of new york as joint tenants for their lives and the life of each of them with remainder over to the eldest son of the survivor his heirs and assigns forever provided that said remainder man shall be of full age at the time of his fathers decease and shall thereupon enter the ministry of the methodist episcopal church and devote his life and the income of this estate to the encouragement of legislative enactment throughout the united states for the suppression of gambling and wager laying in default of such male heir the dingee million was to be divided up among certain religious and eleemosynary institutions when the cablegram from paris informing them of their extraordinary luck reached the winkletip brothers they were down in the cellar of the old tenement which served as their place of business with their long jean coats on busily engaged in sorting onions as the winkletips were only a little past fifty and as strong as hickory knobs their families were quite satisfied to get only a life estate in the dingee million for barring accidents the brothers had twentyfive or thirty years to live yet true brother john had a son cyrus who would soon be of age but he was a worthless wight whose normal condition was alcoholic stupor barely characterized with sufficient lucidity to enable him to distinguish rotten vegetables from sound he will die years before his father every one remarked and then the gamblers money will go where it ought to go there had been a fire next door to the winkletips about the time the good news had arrived from paris a huge warehouse had burned down leaving a brick wall towering sixty feet above the old wooden tenement in which the brothers did business they had given notice to the authorities but the inspectors had pronounced the wall perfectly safe so the two brothers continued to come and go in their best sunday clothes however for they were only engaged in settling up the old business suddenly without the slightest warning the huge wall fell with a terrific crash upon the wooden tenement crushing it like an eggshell when the two brothers were taken out from the ruins john was pronounced dead and a coroners permit was given to remove him to a neighboring undertakers establishment william lived six hours conscious to the last and grateful to an allwise providence that his worthless nephew would now be excluded from any control over the dingee million john winkletip was a grass widower his wife an englishwoman having abandoned him and returned to england and for many years he had made his home with his only other child a widowed daughter mrs timmins who was openly opposed to many of her fathers peculiar notions as she termed them one of which was his strong advocacy of cremation he being one of the original stockholders and at the time of his death a director of the long island cremation society consequently mrs timmins gave orders that immediately after the coroners inquest her fathers body should be removed to her residence in harlem but as the officers of the cremation society held the solemnly executed direction and authorization of their late friend and associate to incinerate his remains they were advised by the counsel of their corporation that such an instrument would justify them in taking possession of the remains at the very earliest moment possible and removing it to the crematory warned by the undertakers of mrs timmins threatened interference they resolved not to risk even the delay necessary to procure a burial casket in fact it would be a useless expense anyway and consequently john winkletip began his last ride on earth lying in the cool depths of the undertakers ice box as mrs timminss cab turned into washington street she met a hearse but not until she had reached the undertakers establishment was her suspicion transformed into certainty by being told that her fathers body was already on its way to the crematory mrs timmins was a longheaded woman she knew the uncertainties of cab transportation through the crowded streets below canal and dismissing her cab at the chambers street station of the third avenue elevated she was soon speeding on her way to the long island city ferry this she reached just as a boat was leaving the slip misfortune number one when she finally reached the long island side she threw herself into the carriage nearest at hand crying out to the crematory five dollars extra if you get me there in time it was not many minutes before mrs timmins became aware of the fact that the horse was next to worthless and could scarcely be lashed into a respectable trot mrs timmins was nearly frantic every minute her head was thrust out of the window to urge the hackman to greater speed there was but one consoling thought the hearse itself might get blocked or might have missed a boat as again and again her head was thrust out of the carriage window her hair became disheveled for she had removed her hat and the superstitious hibernian on the box was upon the point of abandoning his post at sight of the wild and crazed look presented by mrs timmins was she not some ones ghost making this wild and mysterious ride but the promise of an extra five dollars kept the man at his post suddenly a cry of joy escaped mrs timminss lips the hearse was just ahead of them but its driver had the better horses and half suspecting that something was wrong he whipped up vigorously and disappeared in a cloud of dust mrs timminss horse was now as wet as if he had been dipped into the river and she expected every minute to see him give out but strange to say he had warmed up to his work and now in response to the drivers urging broke into a run again mrs timmins caught a glimpse of the black coach of death in the dust clouds ahead of her the race became every instant more exciting it was a strange sight and instinctively the farmers in their returning vegetable wagons drew aside to let them pass once more the hearse disappeared in the dust clouds this was the last mrs timmins saw of it until she drew up in front of the crematorium there it stood with its black doors thrown wide open she had come too late her fathers body had already been thrust into the fiery furnace the antagonism of winkletips family to his views concerning the cremation of the dead was an open secret with every attachй of the society and the men in charge were determined that the society should come out the winner they were on the lookout for the body everything to the minutest detail was in readiness the furnace had been pushed to its greatest destroying power and hence was it that haste overcame dignity when the foamflecked and panting horses of the undertaker drew up in front of the entrance of the crematory the icechest was snatched from the hearse borne hurriedly into the furnaceroom set upon the iron platform wheeled into the very center of the white flames whose waving curling twisting tongues seemed reaching out to their fullest length impatient for their prey and the iron doors slammed shut with a loud resounding clangor at that instant a woman hatless and breathless with disheveled hair burst into the furnaceroom hold hold she shrieked and then her hands flew to her face and staggering backward and striking heavily against the wall she sank limp and lifeless in a heap on the stone floor of the furnaceroom but the two men in charge had neither eyes nor ears for mrs timmins as the doors closed they sprang to their posts of observation in front of the two peepholes and stood watching the effect of the flames upon the huge icechest its wooden covering parted here and there with a loud crack laying bare the metal case from the seams of which burst fitful puffs of steam now came a sight so strange and curious that the two men held their breath as they gazed upon it by the vaporizing of the water from the melted ice the flames were pushed back from the chest and it lay there for an instant as if protected by some miraculous aura then happened something which caused the men to reel and stagger as if their limbs were paralyzed by drink and which painted their faces with as deep a pallor as deaths own hand could have laid upon them from the furnace depths came forth a dull muffled cry of help help making a desperate effort the men tore open first the outer and then the inner doors of the fire chamber as the air rushed in the lid of the metal chest burst silently open again the cry of help rang out and two hands quivered for an instant above the edge of the chest then with a loud and defiant roar the flames closed in upon it and began to lick it up ravenously the doors were banged shut and john winkletip had his way but the dingee million seemed to draw back instinctively from the touch of the worthless cy winkletip with loud cries of joy the various beneficiaries under martha delurys will now discovered that cyrus winkletip was born on the th day of august and that as his father had departed this life on the th day of august the son was not of full age when his father died but the law put an end to this shortlived joy by making known one of its curious bits of logic which so often startle the layman it was this the law takes no note of parts of a day and therefore as cyrus winkletip was of age on the first minute of his twentyfirst birthday he was also of age on the last minute of the day before consequently on the first minute of the day before he was twentyone this gave the dingee million to cy winkletip under constant and stringent surveillance and tutelage cy winkletip was after several years of as close application as was deemed safe in view of his weak mental condition admitted to the ministry in accordance with the provisions of miss delurys will at last the wicked dingee million seemed safely launched upon its task of undoing the wrong it had done but cy winkletips mind ran completely down in five years and he died a wretched slavering idiot mrs timmins was inclined to warn off the dingee million with a gesture of horror but yielding to the solicitation of her friends she consented to take title in order that she might create a trust with it for some good and noble purpose to this end by a last will and testament she created and endowed the american society for the suppression of gambling and wagerlaying and then died the trustees at once began to erect the buildings called for but before the society had had an opportunity to suppress a single gaming establishment the lawyers at the prayer of mrs john winkletip mrs timmins mother fell tooth and nail upon the trust which was declared too vague shadowy and indefinite to be executed and the dingee million its roundness now sadly shrunken made its way across the ocean to mrs john winkletip of clapham common london she died last year and with her the wanderings of the dingee million came to an end she willed it to trustees for building and maintaining a hospital for stray dogs and homeless cats and those learned in the law say that the trust will stand a lost day by edgar fawcett my family john dalrymple would say have the strange failing that is nearly all of them except myself on the paternal side of and then somebody would always try to interrupt him at the gramercy the small but charming club of which he had been for years an honored member they made a point of interrupting him when he began on his family failing not a few of them held to the belief that it was a myth of dalrymples imagination still others argued all of the clan except john himself had been a queer lot there was no real certainty that they had not done extraordinary acts meanwhile apart from his desire to delve among ancestral records and repeat tales which had been told many times before he was a genuine favorite with his friends but that series of family anecdotes remained a standing joke they all pitied him when it became known that his engagement to the pretty winsome widow mrs carrington was definitely broken he was past forty now and had not been known to pay serious court to any woman before in at least ten years of course mrs carrington was rich but then her money could not have attracted dalrymple for he was rich himself in spite of his plain way of living there in that small twentysecond street basement house but the widows money had doubtless lured to her side the gentleman who had cut poor dalrymple out a number of years ago when this little occurrence which we are chronicling took place it was not so easy as it is now to make sure of a foreigners credentials and antecedents the count de pommereul a reputed french nobleman of high position had managed to get into the gramercy as a sixmonths member and had managed also to cross the thresholds of numerous select new york drawingrooms at the very period of his introduction to mrs carrington her engagement with dalrymple had already become publicly announced then in a few weeks society received a shock dalrymple was thrown over and it transpired that the brilliant young widow was betrothed to the count dalrymple calm and selfcontained had nothing to say on the subject of why he had received such shabby treatment and nobody ventured to interrogate him some people believed in the count others thought that there was a ring of falsity about him for all his frame was so elegantly slender and supple for all his mustache was so glossily dark and his eyes so richly lustrous dalrymple meanwhile hid his wound met the count constantly at the club though no longer even exchanging bows with him and worked at his revenge in secret as a beaver works at the building of his winter ranch he succeeded too in getting superb materials for that revenge they surprised even himself when a few relatives and friends in paris mailed him appalling documentary evidence as to what sort of a character this count really was there is no doubt that he now held in his hand a thunderbolt and had only to hurl it when he pleased he did not tell a single soul what he had learned the thought of just how he should act haunted him for several days one evening he went home from the club a little earlier than usual and tossed restlessly for a good while after going to bed when sleep came it found him still irresolute as to what course he should take it seemed to him that he had now a succession of dreams but he could recall none of them on awaking and he awoke in a peculiar way there was yet no hint of dawn in the room and only the light from his gas turned down to a very dim star he was sitting bolt upright in bed and feverish fatigued sensations oppressed him what have i been dreaming he asked himself again and again but as only a confused jumble of memories answered him he sank back upon the pillows and was soon buried in slumber it was past nine oclock in the morning when he next awoke he felt decidedly better both the feverishness and the fatigue had left him he went to the club and breakfasted there it was almost empty of members as small clubs are apt to be at that hour of the morning but in the hall he met his old friend langworth and bowed to him langworth who was rather nearsighted gave a sudden start and a stare how odd thought dalrymple as he passed on into the readingroom i hope theres nothing unexpected about my personal appearance just at the doorway of the room he met another old friend summerson a man extremely strict about all matters of propriety summerson saw him and then plainly made believe that he had not seen as they moved by one another dalrymple said lightly goodmorning old chap hows your gout summerson who was very tall and excessively dignified gave a comic squirm then his eyelids fluttered and with the tips of his lips he murmured better as he glided along pooh said dalrymple to himself getting touchy i suppose in his old age how longevity disagrees with some of us mortals he nearly always took a bottle of seltzer before breakfast and this morning old andrew a servant who had been in the club many years poured it out for him i hope youre all right again this mornin sorr said andrew with his celtic accent and in an affable half whisper all right andrew was the reply why you must be thinking of some one else i havent been ill my health has been excellent for a long time past yes sorr said andrew lowering his eyes and respectfully retiring that last yes sorr had a dubious note about its delivery that almost made dalrymple call the faithful old fellow back and further question him all right again as if he had ever been all wrong oh well poor andrew was ageing others had remarked that fact months ago a different servant came to announce breakfast there were only about five men in the diningroom as dalrymple entered it all of them gazed at him in an unusual way or had late events led him to think that they did so at the table nearest him sat everdell one of the jolliest men in the club a person whose face was nearly always wreathed in smiles goodmorning said dalrymple as he caught everdells eye goodmorning the tones were replete with mild consternation and the look that went with them was smileless to the degree of actual gloom then everdell who had just finished his breakfast rose and drew near to dalrymple pon my word he said im delighted to see you all right again so soon all right again so soon was the reply what in mercys name do you mean oh my dear old fellow began everdell fumbling with his watchchain it was pretty bad you know yesterday pretty bad yesterday i saw you in the morning and for an hour or so in the afternoon perhaps no one would have noticed it if you hadnt stayed here all day and poured those confidences into peoples ears about de pommereul you didnt appear to have drank a drop in the club theres the funny part of it you went out several times though and came back again all that you had to drink except some wine here at dinner you remember you must have got outside i wasnt here at ten oclock when de pommereul came in im glad i wasnt you must have been dreadful if summerson and joyce hadnt rushed in between you and the count heaven knows what would have happened as it is at this point dalrymple broke in with cold harshness look here everdell i always disliked practical jokes and ive known for a number of years that youre given to them youve never attempted to make me your butt before however and youll have the kindness to discontinue any such proceeding now everdell drew back for a moment frowned shrugged his shoulders and then muttering oh if youre going to put it in that way strode quickly out of the diningroom dalrymple scarcely ate a morsel of breakfast after he had gulped down some hot coffee he repaired to the readingroom as he reentered it a waiter handed him several letters one which he opened first was marked immediate and had been sent him from his own house by an intelligent and devoted woman servant there who had been for a long period in his employ this letter made poor dalrymples head swim as he read it written and signed by mr summerson himself as chairman of the house committee of the club it ordered him to appear that same evening before a meeting of the governors and answer to a charge of disorderly conduct on the previous night then it went on to state that he dalrymple had been seen throughout the previous day at the club in a state of evident intoxication and had finally between the hours of and p m accosted and grossly insulted the count de pommereul in the main drawingroom of the gramercy disorderly conduct evident intoxication grossly insulted the count de pommereul these words were trembling on dalrymples lips as he presently approached summerson himself the very gentleman who had signed the letter and who stood in the hall arrayed for the street what what does it all mean gasped dalrymple i i never was intoxicated in my life lawrence summerson you ought to know that i played euchre last night up in the cardroom from nine oclock till twelve with ogden and folsom and yourself if theres any practical joke being got up against me for gods sake wait a minute please said summerson he went back into the coatroom disarrayed himself of his street wraps and finally joined dalrymple his first words low and grave ran thus can it be possible you dont recollect that our game of euchre was played the night before last and not last night then he went with dalrymple into a corner of the reading room and they talked together for a good while dalrymple went back to his home that day in a mental whirl it still wanted a number of hours before the governing committee would meet he had lost a day out of his life there could be no doubt of that if he had moved about the club at all yesterday with a drunken manner reviling de pommereul to everybody who would lend him an ear if he had afterward met de pommereul in the club and directed toward him in loud and furious tones a perfect torrent of accusation he himself was completely blankly ignorant for a good while he sat quite still and thought then he summoned ann the elderly and very trustworthy ann who had been his dear mothers maid and was now his housekeeper he questioned ann and after dismissing her he pondered her answers three times yesterday she had seen him and regarding his appearance ann had her distinct opinions suddenly a light flashed upon dalrymple while he sat alone and brooded he sprang up and a cry half of awe half of gladness left his lips the baffling problem had been solved that evening he presented himself before the governing committee all assembled were sorry for him of course punishment must be dealt but for an old and popular member like dalrymple it must not be expulsion the general feeling of the club had indeed already been gauged and it was in favor of suspension for six months or a year at the farthest dalrymple however was determined that he should be visited with no punishment at all and he meant to state why the judges as he faced them all looked politely grim the president after a few suave preliminaries asked dalrymple if he had anything to say concerning the charges preferred against him dalrymple then proceeded to speak with a clear voice and composed demeanor his first sentences electrified his hearers i have no possible recollection of yesterday he began and it is precisely as much of a lost day to me as though i had lain chloroformed for twentyfour hours on wednesday night i returned home from this club and went to rest i never really woke until friday possibly a little while after midnight and then within my own bed on thursday morning i must have risen in a state of somnambulism hypnotism mental aberration whatever you please and not come to myself until thursday had passed and i had once more retired of what yesterday occurred i therefore claim to have been the irresponsible agent and to have become so through no fault of my own i am completely innocent of the misdemeanors charged against me and i now solemnly swear this on my word of honor as a gentleman here dalrymple paused the members of the committee interchanged glances amid profound silence on some faces doubt could be read but on others its veriest opposite the intense stillness had become painful when dalrymple spoke again i had hoped that i should escape throughout my own lifetime all visitations of this distressing kind my grandfather and two of my uncles not only walked in their sleep to an alarming degree but were each subject to strange conditions of mind in which acts were performed by them that they could not possibly remember afterward here the speaker paused soon continuing however in a lower and more reflective tone yes my family have had the strange failing that is nearly all of them except myself on the paternal side of but he said no more the tension was loosened and a great roar of laughter rose from the whole committee how often every man there had joked him about that marvelous budget of stories which he infallibly began one way and one way only and when the familiar formula sounded forth it was all the funnier to those who heard it because of the solemn judicial circumstances in which it again met their hearing the plaintiff was honorably acquitted as for de pommereul as every word that dalrymple had said concerning his past life in france happened to be perfectly true the count never reappeared at the gramercy his engagement with mrs carrington was soon afterward broken off by the lady herself and for a good while it was rumored that this lady had repentantly made it optional with dalrymple whether he should once more become her accepted sweetheart but dalrymple remained a bachelor he is quite an old man now yet he may be found in the cardroom of the gramercy nearly every evening he is very willing to tell you the story of his lost day if you ask him courteously for it and not in any strain of funpoking but he attempts no more voluntary recitals on the subject of his familys maladies or mishaps a tragedy of high explosives by brainard gardner smith i in the course of my work last year i had occasion to go over a file of old liverpool newspapers and thus came upon a remarkable paragraph in the ship news translated out of the language of commerce it was to the effect that the good ship empress just arrived from australia reported that while rounding the cape of good hope she had been driven southward far out of her course by a storm and that away down in the southern atlantic had sighted a vessel drifting aimlessly about the first mate boarded her and returning reported that the derelict was the ship albatross that she had been abandoned was plain for all the boats were gone and so were the log and the ships instruments on the deck close by the companion hatch lay two bodies or rather skeletons clad in weatherrotted garments that showed them to have been man and woman these bodies were headless but the heads were nowhere to be found on the deserted deck the mate found on the cabin table an open book with writing on its pages a pen lay on the table and a small inkstand in which the ink had evidently long since dried the book was evidently a journal or diary so the mate reported and he put it in his pocket meaning to carry it aboard the empress but when he was getting down into his small boat the book slipped from his pocket dropped into the water and sunk the albatross was badly waterlogged and he thought could not have floated much longer to this report the editor of the paper added a note saying that the readers would all doubtless remember that the albatross had sailed from liverpool several years before bound for australia and it was thought to have gone down with all on board as no news of her had since been received that was the substance of the remarkable paragraph what was almost as remarkable to me a newspaper man was that the liverpool paper had evidently made no effort to learn the owners of the albatross the name of her captain and crew or whether or not she carried any passengers i carefully searched files to see if there was any further reference to the case there was none after the manner of his kind the editor of the paper had so it seemed taken it for granted that his intelligent readers would remember all the particulars that they wanted to know i was much impressed by the paragraph my professional instinct told me that there was a good newspaper story there and i was disgusted that any editor could let it go untold i also experienced more than usual curiosity to know how those headless bodies came there or rather why they should lie there on the deck headless then there was that journal that had been found lying open on the cabin table as though the writer had been interrupted in the writing which had never been finished what light might that little book not throw on the mystery and now it was lying fathoms deep in the southern atlantic of what use to speculate over the matter thanks to the careless mate and the stupid editor that mystery would remain forever unsolved but in spite of reason i did speculate considerably over the matter and try as i did could not banish the story from my mind a few weeks after that i went into northern vermont to report the benton murder trial which was attracting much more than local attention i was pleased to find that the prosecuting attorney was an old classmate of mine george judson i had known him pretty well as a hardworking and remarkably bright man with a curious streak in his mental makeup that led him to investigate every new ism that appeared we used to call him a spiritualist and had the word been in use i am sure would have called him a crank he was five years older than i had married immediately after graduating had prospered as a lawyer and now had a good home for his wife and two children he seemed much pleased to renew the acquaintance of college days and insisted that i should make his house my home during my stay in the town one saturday evening as we sat in his comfortable library smoking after dinner judson said with some apparent hesitation theres going to be a show here this evening that may interest you yes yes theres a woman living here who does some remarkable things when in a trance there are a few of us who are curious about such things and ive asked her and them here to my house this evening what is it i asked lightly the cabinet act judson looked a trifle hurt yes he answered slowly shes a medium and you newspaper men have said that shes a fraud but ive seen manifestations that i cant explain on any theory other than that they were the work of higher powers and im going to look into it further the same old judson i thought he was evidently more in earnest than his assumed indifference indicated i marveled that the shrewd successful lawyer could be so easily deluded for i was sure that he was deluded i had attended many a sйance and had helped to expose more than one medium and knew that the whole matter of manifestations was nothing but a more or less clumsy juggle but i kept my thoughts to myself experience had taught me that when it was known that there was present at a sйance a pronounced unbeliever in that phase of spiritualism the conditions were usually unfavorable for a manifestation so i said that i should be glad to see the show as he called it then i encouraged judson to talk and he talked well from mediums and cabinets and manifestations and the ways of spirits generally our conversation drifted to the marvelous and the mysterious and finally i told the story of the albatross and the headless skeletons judson was much impressed by the story he joined me in anathematizing the careless mate of the empress and the stupid editor of the liverpool paper his lifelong habit of seeking to know the unknowable reenforced by the detective instinct that is developed in every good lawyer as well as newspaper man made him unnaturally anxious to solve the mystery the thought came to me just then that if spiritualism was good for anything it would be in such a case what i said was i have often wondered whether the peculiar power of the trance medium might not be employed in such cases now is it impossible that that journal found on the albatross and which i believe contains the solution of our mystery should be materialized for us here judson jumped at the idea yes yes he said hurriedly it shall be it must be how fortunate he spoke with such earnestness and confidence that i showed my surprise in my face i also voiced it you talk as though the thing were already accomplished my experience with mediums has led me to consider them a trifle unreliable but you seem to be sure of this one not of the medium but of myself i had better tell you now what but one other living person knows that i have a very peculiar power i dont attempt to explain it but it is no less a fact i seem to be able by mere force of will to control certain persons this medium is one of them i have never been able to produce any results unaided but more than once have i thought into visible form those who had long before died the same old story you see judson was apparently an outandout spiritualist ready to be humbugged by the first shrewd trickster that came along he went on now this evening you will see a remarkable woman i have been able to control her in a remarkable way i confess that i had never thought of seeking the materialization of an inanimate object but i believe that it can be done it shall be done we shall have that journal this night i was almost convinced by my friends absolute confidence then saddened by the thought that this usually hardheaded keen young lawyer had such a weak spot in his brain he was the last man you would expect to be deluded by the tricks of the medium at the same time i found myself in spite of my skepticism wondering what would come of it all that evening i was seated in judsons large parlor one of about twenty persons of the sort usually seen at such sйances the spiritualists of the place i thought the room had been arranged after the fashion customary there was an improvised cabinet in one corner chairs in a semicircle in front of it not too near judson seemed a sort of master of ceremonies passing in and out greeting newcomers whispering a word here and there he was pale i thought and seemed rather preoccupied we waited perhaps a quarter of an hour and then judson ushered into the room a tall slender woman middleaged grayhaired with rather strongly marked features and dark eyes that had a tired look she seemed a person of nerves a trifle above the average medium in appearance of intelligence and refinement and with rather less of the selfassertive boldness usually displayed by the women who make a business of communing with spirits there was no preliminary nonsense she entered the cabinet in a businesslike way judson turned the gas down low so that we were in the dimmest sort of a dim religious light just the light i have always observed that seemed most congenial to spirits or rather that aided most effectually in the tricks played by the mediums then he sat down by my side and said let us all clasp hands i grasped with my left the fat hand of a large woman next to me and judson seized my right with his left hand it was quite cold and i thought trembled a little he leaned over me and whispered in my ear i am determined to see that journal tonight if will can do it it shall be done join your will with mine you are a man of will let us force the powers to yield to our combined wills i was startled by the intensity of his manner more than by the words in spite of my half disgust at the whole proceedings that were such an exact repetition of more than one humbugging sйance i was forced into a respectful attitude of mind and at once became an interested assistant where a moment before i had been an unbelieving critical observer i nodded my head and judsons grasp of my hand became firm then there was complete silence for many moments i bent all my mind to the one thought that i would see that journal wherever in the large world it might be at first my thoughts would wander but then it seemed to me that judsons grasp tightened and drew the desultory thought back to the one subject of his own thoughts i have considered this a good deal since and conclude that judson did for the time at least possess some extraordinary power possibly pure force of will at all events i grew more and more determined to have my will done then there came a calm voice from behind the curtain of the cabinet what is your wish no one spoke for a moment and then a weak voice at my left said something about a desire to see a child that had died and another voice expressed the wish to look upon the form of a departed husband i was too much occupied with my own thoughts to notice then that this was the same old scene enacted as at all the other sйances again there was perfect silence it seemed interminable i could hear the breathing of the fat woman on my left i could hear my watch ticking in my pocket i thought that i could hear my heart beat but all the time there was the firm pressure of the cold hand of my friend and the constant thought now shaped into words and the words into a sentence and that sentence continually repeating itself until i seemed to hear that too i will see that journal tonight and still that strange silence the air in the room became close every door and window had been carefully closed and the breathing of twenty or more persons had made large drafts on the oxygen suddenly a breath fanned my cheek then a stronger draught and then a steady current of air set against my face i felt it move my hair and it smelled of the sea it was salty yes undoubtedly a strong steady sea breeze was in that room and it brought with it the smell of a ship tar and oakum and pitch the odor that arises when the sun beats hotly down upon the unprotected deck and the boards shrink and the great pine masts feel the fierce heat but there was no heat only at first that cool sea breeze and then the patter of rain seemingly on the floor of the room in which we sat then a low moan came from behind the curtains of the cabinet and then the sound of a heavy fall at this some of the women shrieked weakly there was a general letting go of hands and judson sprang to the cabinet and disappeared behind its folds after an instant of silence we heard his voice more light i hastened to turn on the gas judson pulled aside the curtains and we saw that the woman was lying outstretched on the floor she has fainted said judson calmly that is all i believe that she is subject to such attacks i doubt my friends if we shall have any manifestations tonight may i ask you all to consider the meeting adjourned i will give our friend here all medical attention he spoke so calmly and with such authority that without a word the little company passed out of the room and out of the house judson and i raised the woman to a couch and he brought water and bathed her face she opened her eyes sighed deeply and then sat up there was a strange scared look on her face where is it she asked faintly here said judson and he drew from beneath his coat a small book and handed it to her she turned away with a shudder no no take it away take it away judson handed it to me will you kindly take this book to the library said he i will join you in a moment i obeyed mechanically before going into the library i stepped to the broad piazza and looked out into the night the snow lay white on the ground stars twinkled in the frosty sky it was very cold and i could hear the snow creak under the feet of passersby and yet i had felt that sea breeze and heard the patter of rain what did it mean i shivered entered the warm house turned the light high in the library shut the door and not till then looked at the book in my hand it was a small blankbook about six inches long and four inches wide well bound in leather and thoroughly watersoaked i opened it the leaves were wet and discolored and i could see that the pages were covered with writing i turned to the flyleaf and there read these words arthur hartleys journal begun on board the ship albatross march i stood in a daze glaring at the written words utterly confounded the door opened and judson entered hurriedly his cheeks were now flushed his eyes fairly blazed with light his face was bright with a smile of triumph i knew it i knew it he said loudly what a victory what a victory even nature yields to the power of will he paced back and forth rapidly showing no desire to see the book that had come to us so strangely then he threw himself into a big chair lighted a cigar puffed at it vigorously a moment then became quiet looked intently at the glowing coals in the grate and said calmly well lets see what mr hartley has to say for himself read the journal please i had been standing all this time by the table with the little damp book in my hand and watching judson curiously i drew up a chair opened to the first page and began to read ii march i begin this journal for two reasons first my dear mother asked me to keep a record of my voyage and of my life that she might read it when i got back home she thinks that i am coming home again i promised her to do so but i shall never see england again i hope the day may come when i can take my dear mother to my australian home but i shall never set foot on the island that holds the woman i hate and that holds so many women like her in the second place i want to write down not only my impressions in this new experience but my thoughts i have many of them i want to see them spread out before me we are now well started on the voyage five days out from liverpool uncle john is still ill enough and says that he wants to die captain raymond laughs at him and says that a little seasickness will do him good i like captain raymond he is big and burly and has a deep voice and a heavy brown beard hes just the typical sea captain an interesting person to a man who saw the sea for the first time six days ago im glad to find that im a good sailor and can thoroughly enjoy the new experiences that present themselves in the beginning of the long voyage we have started upon i have written the word enjoy let it stand i thought i never should have known enjoyment again but i do theres enjoyment in the knowledge that each hour puts miles of ocean between me and the woman that has spoiled my life no i wont admit that she shant have the satisfaction of spoiling my life she tried hard enough god knows she played with my heart much as though it were a mouse and she a cat she is a cat a sleek soft purring cat and with claws i could eat out my own heart when i think how she played with it i was fair game for this experienced coquette and now i suppose she is boasting of another conquest telling of her victory over the simple country lad well let her enjoy her conquest while she may the country boy will one day come back with money enough to buy her and her purseproud heart yes i will go back to england and ill humble her at my feet what rot im writing mother if you ever see these pages read these words with sympathy as the idle ravings of a man wellnigh gone mad over a womans false beauty i never told the story even to you my dear mother i dare say you guessed much of it you know how helen rankine came down from london to our quiet country home you know how beautiful and gracious she was how kind and loving to you how apparently frank and friendly with me she was the first woman i ever saw to whom i gave a second thought save you dear mother we rode and drove and chatted together she drew my very heart from me i told her all my plans and hopes and aspirations of my love of the art to which i had devoted my life that i hoped to go to london and study and then to rome that i wanted to become a great painter she was so full of hearty sympathy so kind so womanly that before i knew it she had me enslaved for all the graciousness and frankness and sympathy were but the means she used in her heartlessness to enslave me then came a day a day to be remembered a day like that when beguiled by another beautiful fiend in woman form our first father poor foolish man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and so lost his paradise i told helen of my love and how i did love that woman and she put on an appearance of surprise and squeezed a cold tear or two from her beautiful eyes and said that she thought i knew and understood and when half dazed i asked her what she meant what it was that i was thought to have known she had to blush and said that she had long been engaged to her cousin john bruce who was now with his regiment in india and that when he came home they were to be married and then she said something about my being so young and having a great career before me and that she should always be my friend and pray for my success and she stretched out her hand toward me i think she must have seen the hate in my face for my great love turned to great hate even while she spoke and all the wholesome currents of my being seemed poisoned by the supreme passion and she turned pale and her hand dropped and i cursed her march a call from uncle john interrupted me the other day and i have had no heart to write since my moods shame me i wrote those words with burning cheek and throbbing heart i have just read them without an emotion why cant i be a man and not a silly raving boy not that the hate that burns in my heart is abating it can never abate it will grow and grow and keep me true to my purpose no more mooning over art and the hope of a great name but hard work and moneymaking uncle john promises us both fortunes he feels confident that his explosive will work such wonders in australian mines that within ten years we can go back to england rich beyond the dreams of avarice but i shall never see england again no matter what i may have written here never shall i set foot on the land that rears such women as the one i hate captain raymond was almost angry when he learned that in uncle johns innocentlooking boxes was a compound powerful enough to blow us all out of the water but he was somewhat reassured when uncle insisted that as long as the albatross floated she and we were safe for he says that the explosive is only an explosive when wet captain raymond said that hed try and keep it dry then and he sent men into the hole where the boxes were stored and had them placed carefully in an unused cabin we are the only passengers i made sure that no woman was to be on board during the long voyage i came near being disappointed in this for captain raymond tells me that his wife was to sail with him and had made all preparations even to sending some boxes of clothing aboard when the sudden death of her father prevented her from going im sure im sorry that mrs raymonds father is dead but im very glad that mrs raymond is not on this ship i dont want to look on womans face nor hear womans voice theres but one woman to me in the wide world and dear mother forgive me if sometimes i cannot thank her for bringing me into the world you understand me mother you know what i have suffered you can sympathize with me when i say that i exult at the thought that leagues of ocean lie between me and that other woman who march a strange thing has happened since i last wrote in this book as i was writing i heard quite a commotion on deck cries of the sailors sharp orders from officers and the tramping of feet i rushed on deck uncle john and the captain were standing on the poop looking intently across the water the first mate was shouting orders that i couldnt understand and the crew were lowering the long boat whats the matter i asked joining uncle and the captain theres a little boat adrift out yonder answered uncle john pointing and the lookout says that there are a couple of bodies lying in it there do you see it on the top of that wave i saw it a mere shell it seemed poised for a moment on the top of a swell and then sliding down into the trough of the sea quite out of sight the long boat was soon lowered and guided by the cries of the lookout made straight for the little boat it seemed very long before it was reached and then we saw the sailors make it fast to the long boat and begin to pull slowly back toward the albatross it was slow and hard work towing that boat small as it seemed through the rather heavy sea there was no sign of life in her what was behind those low gunwales what were the men bringing to us at length they came alongside and then we saw that there were two bodies lying there a man and a woman sir called up the mate theres life in em both but precious little it was nice work getting the two boats alongside and the bodies out of them and up to the deck but it was done by the aid of slings the woman being brought up first uncle john by virtue of his profession gave directions as to placing her on the deck and then knelt by her side i stood aloof why had that woman come to us in midocean why was it fate she is alive cried uncle john captain we must get her below at once i glanced at the woman thick locks of matted black hair lay around a face on which the sun and wind and the salt seawater had done fearful work and yet those blackened and blistered features somehow had a familiar look where had i seen them i could not tell four sailors carried her below and i turned to look at her companion who had been laid on the deck uncle john just took time to grasp his wrist and said hes alive too then he dropped the limp hand and hurried below always the way women first this dying man might get what attention he could the woman must be nursed back to life to deceive the first fool that takes her fancy i turned to the man a common sailor evidently brawny and bearded the mate was by his side and together we did what we could to nourish the spark of life that kept the pulse feebly fluttering in the big brown wrist it was afternoon when these two waifs were found and all night we fought with death now uncle john says that he thinks that they will live neither of them has spoken but each has taken a little nourishment and the pulse shows gaining strength captain raymond has turned his cabin over to the woman and as i write uncle is sitting by her side for the time he has forgotten his wonderful explosive the old professional air has come back and he is like the dr hartley of the days before he gave up medicine for chemical investigation the question continually repeats itself to me what has brought this woman here reason as i may i feel i know that she has come to me to me who was happy in the thought of not seeing her kind for months another question asks itself has she come for good or ill there can be but one answer to that question march the sailor whom we rescued gains strength fast he was able to talk a little today briefly told his story as far as i got it is that he was one of the crew of the vulture bound from england to india with army stores and arms including a large consignment of powder one day he cant say how many days ago the ship caught fire in the hold there were frantic and unavailing efforts made to get at the flames and extinguish them and then the order was given to flood the hold but before it could be executed there was a tremendous roar and the sailor knew nothing else until he found himself in the water clinging to a fragment of the wreckage that strewed the sea the ship had been blown up and had sunk at once not far from him floated one of the quarterboats apparently uninjured he managed to swim to it and clamber in there he was able to stand up and look around him at first he could see no sign of life but in another moment he heard a faint cry behind him and turning saw a woman clinging to a broken spar with a bit of broken board he paddled to her and got her into the boat like himself she was unharmed save by the awful shock and fright he paddled around and around but saw no further sign of life once a mans body rose near the boat rose slowly turned and sank again and that was the last they saw of the twoscore men that but a little moment before had been full of life and vigor this much i heard the sailor tell and then stopped him for he was tired the woman still sleeps and has showed no signs of consciousness march the sailor whose name is richard jones was able to crawl out on deck this morning he completed his story the young woman he said was the only passenger on the vulture he did not know her name it had been talked among the crew that she was going out to her lover an officer in the indian army who had been wounded that she would not wait for the regular east indiaman but had managed to secure passage on the vulture when she realized that she and the sailor jones were the only ones alive of all those that had been on the vanished ship and that they were quite alone on the ocean in a small boat without oars or sail or food or drink she cried a little and wrung her hands and became very quiet she took her place in the bow and there she sat jones sat in the stern and paddled clear of the wreckage and then using the piece of board for a rudder kept the boat before the wind luckily there was very little sea he thought that they were in the track of indiamen and so kept good hope he tried to encourage the young woman but she seemed to prefer silence and so he kept still thus they drifted the sun beat down upon their unprotected heads they began to want for water they did not think so much of food as of water jones doesnt know how long they were adrift he doesnt know when the girl lost consciousness he remembers that one day she moaned a little and in the night he thought that he heard her whispering to herself he thought that she was praying perhaps then he began to lose consciousness he remembers seeing a beautiful green field with trees and a brook running through it he says that men suffering from thirst on the ocean often have such visions he remembers nothing else until he opened his eyes and saw me bending over him uncle john reports no change in the condition of the young woman she lies in a stupor apparently the pulse daily grows stronger he says and she swallows freely the nourishment administered iii april it is more than two weeks since i wrote in my journal i have been ill a sort of low fever that kept me in my cabin nothing serious uncle john said and so it has proved except that i am very weak uncle has been kind but most of his time has been devoted to that woman he says that it is a very interesting case she became conscious a few days ago and has gained strength since she will be on deck in a day or two he thinks im anxious to see her i want to see if there really is anything familiar in her face its fortunate for her that clothing of mrs raymonds is on board shed be in a plight else i asked uncle john what her name was he looked queer and said that he didnt know strange that he hasnt asked her the sailor jones seems quite recovered and has taken his place among the crew we were rather shorthanded and the captain was glad enough to have him he can be of service but the woman can be nothing but a trouble to me at least for i must see her daily i suppose and yet i am anxious to see her too this fever has left me rather childish as well as weak april thank god for these pages to which i can talk else i should go mad i think could you read these words as they flow from my pen mother you might well wonder whether i had not indeed gone mad but i will be quite calm while i tell of what fate or satan or whatever evil power it is has done for me i was sitting on the deck this morning still very weak when i heard footsteps behind me and uncle johns voice saying goodmorning arthur i turned and saw him standing near me and leaning on his arm helen rankine i write these words calmly enough now can you imagine what i felt when i saw her i staggered to my feet muttered some incoherent words and would have fallen had not uncle john sprang to my side and caught me why whats the matter arthur calm yourself my boy is it possible that you know this young lady by a supreme effort of will aided by the memory of that day when we last parted i drew myself up and bowed and i said that i had had the great honor of once knowing miss helen rankine and that i had had no idea that it was she we were fortunate enough to have rescued uncle looked at me in wonder as i said these words with sneering politeness the girl looked at me questioningly but there was no shadow of recognition on her face then your name is helen rankine said uncle john kindly turning toward the girl and speaking as though to a little child a troubled look passed over her face and then she said quietly i do not know i cannot remember do you know this gentleman mr arthur hartley he asked in the same kindly way again the troubled look an apparent effort to seize some elusive thought and then again the voice i knew so well but now so unnaturally calm i do not know him i stood aghast at what seemed the consummate acting of a heartless and conscienceless woman and yet on the instant i saw that there was no acting there let me stop a moment mother and describe her you remember how beautiful she was with that rich dark beauty you once spoke of as italian it was that beauty that enslaved me you remember that i have written of her appearance as she lay on the deck the day she was saved the days of illness and quiet in the cabin below had almost obliterated all the ravages done by wind and sun and sea the olive cheeks were a little darker than of old and the hands browner the face was not quite so pure an oval as when you saw it last the color of lip and cheek not quite so vivid the large brown eyes had lost the sparkle and the changing light that once pierced my boyish foolish heart clad in a simple gown belted at the waist and hanging in folds to the deck her dark hair parted across her broad forehead and confined in a simple knot and with a strange calm on the face that once expressed her varying moods as they came and went she seemed to me to be another a better an almost unearthly helen come to me here to atone for the great wrong that she had done me and for the moment i forgot my hate my uncle gave his arm to helen and they walked the deck while i watched them what did it mean this failure of helen to recognize me was i right in thinking the girl to be helen rankine yes i could not be mistaken that graceful walk some of its oldtime spring and elasticity gone to be sure was the walk of helen the turn of the lovely neck the pose of the head were hers then the story of the sailor jones the forecastle gossip that she was going out to india to join her soldierlover how well it tallied with what she had told me on that fatal day when she spurned my proffered love but i would not dwell more on that i will not now i must force myself to forget just for a little time the past that i may solve the mystery of the present my head throbs my brain is in a whirl april after writing this i threw myself into my berth and tried to think over clearly the strange occurrences of the day i was aroused by uncle john asking me if i felt well enough to take a turn with him on deck i joined him at once and we paced the deck without speaking it was a lovely night and the stars filled the heavens at length uncle john said arthur heres a very remarkable case this poor girl has lost her memory completely and no wonder after her terrible sufferings she cannot remember an event that happened before she opened her eyes in the cabin below she can talk well reads readily shows the breeding of a lady but as far as the past is concerned she might as well be a weekold baby you say that her name is helen rankine who is helen rankine where did you meet her uncle john had never known why i was so ready to give up my dreams of artist life and join him in his australian scheme i told him the whole story of my infatuation for helen and her heartless perfidy he listened intently when i had finished he said my boy let me say one thing first of all on your own evidence forming my opinion solely from what you have told me i think you have done a good girl injustice i dont believe that helen rankine coquetted with you like many a young fellow before you you thought that the frank friendliness of a young woman who looked upon you as a boy though perhaps not your senior in years was encouragement to make love to her she thought that you knew of her engagement so she said and felt a security that misled you you are not the first lad that has had such an experience and cursed all women and vowed that hed never trust one again ill trot your children on my knee yet well so much for the helen of the past now for the helen of the present for we might as well call her helen as anything else but she is helen helen rankine i can swear it i interrupted well well so be it i confess it looks so i have taken a physicians liberty and examined her clothing for marks i find it marked h r isnt that proof enough i asked eagerly yes i dare say it is still there are other girls whose initials are h r you and i have our task it is to try and lead this poor girl back to the past the awful experiences and sufferings of those days in the boat have affected her brain whether beyond cure or not i know not now remember arthur and uncle john looked at me seriously remember that even if this girl is the girl you think has wronged you in fact she is not the same girl she knows no more of you than she knows of me whom she never saw in her life before another thing if she is helen rankine she is engaged to john bruce perhaps she wears his ring on her finger you and i as gentlemen are bound to do what we can to deliver her to him as speedily as possible and i pray god that we may see her meet him in her right mind the same freehearted english girl that he is now dreaming of i bowed my head but could not say a word is uncle john right and have i been a weak blind fool of a boy thinking that the girl who was merely kind was encouraging me to love her i feel my face burn at the thought i cant think clearly yet but i see my duty april if i lacked proof of the girls identity i have it now yesterday we sat together on the deck for hours i trying gently to lead her back to the past helen rankine used to wear several valuable rings now she wears but one you have a pretty ring i said pointing to her hand how white and dimpled it used to be how i longed to catch it to my lips to kiss the pretty rosytipped fingers her hand now brown with wind and sun but still dimpled and rosy tipped like a child she laid it in mine yes she said it is a pretty ring where did you get it helen i asked i dont remember she said quietly may i look at it i asked oh yes and she slipped it from her finger and laid it in my hand what are these letters engraved within i asked are there letters there she said i didnt know it so there are to h r from j b what does that mean dont you know i asked oh it was hard to see that calm face to hear that calm voice better the blush and silent avowal of love even for another than that blank gaze no i do not know what those letters mean she answered perhaps h r stands for your own name said i she smiled like a happy child yes yes that must be it but the j b what do they stand for i hesitated who would not perhaps they stand for for john bruce i said slowly looking her steadily in the eyes she returned the gaze with the calm confidence of a child who is john bruce she asked i cant remember john bruce my heart gave a great leap then sank like lead am i then such a villain that i rejoice at the thought that helen rankine has no memory of her lover where is the hate that i boasted of it has gone it could not live before the calm eyes of the girl by my side but i had my duty to do john bruce is in india helen said i dont you remember and you were going to him and when you reached him you were to marry him he loves you dearly and you loved him dearly cant you remember the troubled look came to the dark eyes and ruffled the calm brow a faint flush passed across the rich warm cheeks then like a spoiled child she shook her head and said no no no no with a little pat of the foot and nod at the last no i do not know anything about it at all i do not know john bruce and of course i do not love him how could i but i know you arthur and i love you and she laid her hand in mine with a pretty smile i wonder if im the same man that set sail in the albatross six short weeks ago the arthur hartley then was a mad foolish boy the arthur hartley now is a grave serious man i feel that years and years have passed instead of weeks how much i am changed let this prove i held helens hand in mine and answered gently i am very glad you love me helen i hope you will ever love me i certainly love you dearly i could not love a sister more she smiled at this and patted my hand and then we sat hand in hand without speaking until the shadows deepened on the deck may you have been much in my thoughts of late dear mother but you will never know it you will never see these words i had thought not to write in this book again for i feel sure that it will never reach you but i seem to be urged to keep some record of our eventful voyage we are lying becalmed far in the southern atlantic so captain raymond says an awful storm that drove us at its will and before which it seemed possible for no ship to live has driven us here far out of our course for six days we have been lying here motionless the storm that raged with such terrible fury seems to have exhausted all the winds of the heavens i never knew anything more thoroughly depressing than this calm even writing seems a task beyond me but indeed i am not as strong as before the attack of fever i do not seem to regain my strength i had in mind to describe the storm it is beyond my powers we lost a long boat and a quantity of spars two sailors one of them richard jones saved but to be lost were washed overboard and never seen again there is no change in helen she is apparently perfectly happy but it is the happiness of a contented and healthy child she takes much pleasure in being with me and sits by the hour with her hand in mine while i talk of the england that we have left and of the scenes of other days but nothing awakens the dormant memory uncle john has got back to his studies and talks explosives to any one who will listen may here we lie still becalmed it is horrible what will come of it all the sailors are ready to take to the boats and quit the ship and it requires all of captain raymonds firmness and kindness for he is a kind captain and all of mate robinsons sternness to deal with the crew the steward tells me in great confidence that the men say that the albatross is bewitched and that helen is the witch that has done it i can see that they follow her with black looks in which is something of fear as she walks the deck singing softly to herself and happy as a bird the only happy soul aboard why should she not be happy she has no past looks forward to no future she lives in the present natures own child the ocean that gave her to us seems to have claimed her as its own she loves the sea in all its moods when the storm was at its fiercest and the huge waves swept over us she insisted on being on deck and clapped her hands and laughed in glee as thoughtless of danger as one of mother carys chickens now when this horrible calm is drawing the very life out of us all she sings and laughs and is merry or when not merry wears a calm passionless almost soulless face i dont wonder that the men think that she is a witch she has bewitched me more than once iv may l i am sitting alone in the cabin writing it is very late i hear the steps of the mate as he paces the deck the calm still holds us in its fearful clasp great god what is to be the end of it all there has been a break in the monotony of our existence today uncle john got into a hot discussion with captain raymond at the dinner table about the efficacy of the wonderful explosive compound the captain seemed doubtful uncle john was for the instant angry ill show you then he said and he rushed into the cabin where his boxes are stored and came out shortly with two tin cans each holding something less than a pint he unscrewed the top of one disclosing a brownish powder take care said the captain who seemed needlessly cautious and almost fearful why i thought you said it was useless said uncle john with a laugh and yet you are afraid of it look here he lighted a match and held it close to the powder a dark smoke arose that instantly extinguished the little flame and floated off leaving a queer smell behind that was all perfectly harmless captain continued uncle who had now recovered his usual good nature perfectly harmless unless you wet it then look out the cook had made a sort of dumpling for dinner and a great lot of it remained uncle john took a mess of this dough for it was little else squeezed it until it was quite dry and molded it into a ball come with me he said and arthur bring a plate of that dough with you he took the cans and we followed him to the deck there he carefully covered the ball of dough with the powder and going to the rail threw it as far as he could out over the placid sea as the ball struck the water there was a loud explosion and the spray was thrown high into the air the crew who had been hanging over the port rail forward turned and rushed over to see what was up uncle john made another ball and threw it with like result oh houly torpeter growled one of the men and they turned back to their former places uncle john now evidently anxious to give us thorough proof of the value of his compound was for throwing more balls when the boatswain rolling aft touched his hat and said to the captain please sur theres a big shark as has showed his fin hoff the port bow and if so be that the doctorll wait a bit with his torpeters well show im some fun acatchin of it all right bosun said the captain and we all went over to the port rail there he is said the captain pointing to a sharp black thing that rising just above the water was cutting quietly through it that is his fin and theres a big shark under it or im much mistaken the sailors had got a large hook and had baited it with a piece of salt beef and made it fast to a stout line with a chain that the fish couldnt bite off this tempting morsel was flung overboard and as it fell with a splash into the water we saw the fin cut toward it and then disappear the next instant there was a great tug at the rope hurrah weve got um yelled the boatswain walk away with im now my hearties a dozen sailors had manned the rope and now started to drag the big fish out of the water there was a tremendous pull a great splashing and then the men tumbled in a heap on the dock and the hook was jerked sharply over the rail cuss the luck growled the boatswain the ook didnt old the taste of salt beef evidently suited the shark for he was soon right alongside cruising back and forth looking for more we could see him distinctly and a tremendous fellow he was again the men baited the hook and dropped it overboard we saw the big fish dart forward turn on his side and grab the bait with a sharp snap of his terrible jaws again the hook would not catch and the shark was waiting for more beef the men were about to make a third attempt when uncle john started wait a bit men he said ive got a hook that will hold give me a piece of the meat the men fell back and looked eagerly the cook handed up a big chunk of meat wipe it as dry as you can said uncle and tie it firmly to the rope when this was done he sprinkled the powder from the can carefully over the meat then he carried it cautiously to the rail the shark was cruising back and forth uncle lowered the meat slowly into the water right in front of the monster he saw the bait and darted at it and then there was a tremendous report and the spray flew into our faces as we leaned over the rail the next moment we saw the big fish floating motionless on the water blessed if e asnt blowed is ead clean hoff said the boatswain it was so that terrible compound of uncle johns had needed only the impact of the sharks teeth to explode it with deadly effect uncle looked perfectly happy the effect on helen was strange for the first time since she had been with us she seemed to be angry i think you are very cruel she said to uncle john to kill that beautiful shark he had not harmed you i shall not love you any more as she said this she stepped to my side and grasped my hand as though she feared uncle and wanted my protection the men heard her words and the effect was marked they had been in high good humor over the death of the shark the sailors most dreaded enemy but at these strange words they shrank away with gloomy faces and i could hear muttered curses and the words witch and shedevil that put an end to the good humor that for the first time in days seemed to pervade the becalmed vessel uncle john made one more torpeter with the little powder that remained in the open can the other he carried to his cabin when i left the deck just before beginning this writing the sailors were huddled together forward and eagerly talking but very quietly the sea was like a glass in which the stars of this strange southern sky were all mirrored again impelled by i know not what power i come to my journal for what strange eyes am i writing these words i doubt whether i shall have strength to put down the record that i feel ought to be put down perhaps the power that impels me to write at all will give me the needed strength i have lost the reckoning of the days but that matters not after writing the words with which my last entry closed i went to my little cabin and was soon asleep i was awakened by stealthy feet without my door followed by sounds of a struggle on deck two or three pistol shots curses and groans and the trampling of feet i jumped from my bunk threw on some clothing and hurried out the large cabin was in total darkness i rushed to the companion way as i stepped upon the deck i saw before me a struggling throng and then there was a crash and i knew no more for a time i know now that i was struck on the head by one of the crew who had been watching for me when i recovered consciousness i was lying bound hand and foot on the deck it was early daylight i struggled to rise but could not stir i saw the crew carrying bags and casks and clothing and lowering them over the side two or three forms lay on the deck but i could not see who or what they were i recognized the boatswains voice giving orders he asked if there was water enough and food if the log and chronometer and compasses had been stowed away it was all confusion and my brain seemed on fire but i knew that the crew were preparing to quit the ship where was uncle john where was captain raymond and where was helen at this i again struggled and strove to rise and the noise i made attracted the boatswain and he came to me youre fast enough my lad said he smiling grimly best lie quiet and listen th lads ave ad enough of this bediviled ship and the witch that as bediviled er so were goin to ship our cable and put hoff you seem so fond o the witch that well leave you with er shell care for thee never fear and he turned on his heel i tried to speak but must have fainted with the effort when i again became conscious i was still lying on the deck but my bonds had been cut and i managed to stagger to my feet i looked all around not a living being could i see just then the sun came up and as his glowing disc showed above the quiet water i caught far away in the south a faint sparkle and then saw two small dark spots that before my straining gaze disappeared i doubt not that what i saw were the boats containing the crew of the albatross i turned and looked around the deck the forms that i had seen were no longer visible but just aft of the wheel was a piece of canvas covering something i walked over feebly for the blow that i had received had shaken me badly and lifted the canvas there lay the dead bodies of my dear uncle and captain raymond and big first mate robinson like a man in a dream i covered them again and again looked about the deck where was helen not on the deck had the villains taken her with them i made my feeble way below and went to helens cabin the door was shut i tried to open it it was locked i examined the lock the key was in it and on the outside they had locked her in i cautiously turned the key opened the door and entered there lay helen her dark hair streaming back over the pillow one round cheek rested softly on her brown dimpled hand the other bore a lovely flush the halfparted lips were like crimson rosebuds and over her bosom her white nightrobe rose and fell gently she was asleep as i stood there she opened her eyes when she saw me she smiled happily and said in a sweet sleepy voice is it time to get up arthur why how pale you look are you ill and she rose on one arm and the smile faded away yes helen i said as steadily as i could its time to get up come into the cabin as quickly as you can i am not at all well and i left the little cabin still like a man in a dream helen soon joined me i asked her if she had slept well she had had she heard no unusual noises in the night no she had not awakened once so it was like a tired healthy child helen had slept through all that awful tragedy i shant attempt to try and tell of the task i had in making her comprehend our awful situation she did not comprehend it she wept bitterly when i told her of the three dead bodies on the deck she moaned over my poor bruised head and with gentle hands bathed and bound it up then she said that she was hungry we found the lockers in great confusion but the crew had left food enough of one sort or another to satisfy our immediate needs there was an awful task before us and i explained it to helen we must consign those dead bodies to the sea she shuddered at the thought but like an obedient child tried to help me how i managed to encase those silent forms in canvas i hardly know but i did and got them to the side of the ship then i got my prayer book and read the blessed burial service while helen looked on in troubled wonder then came the hardest task of all but it was done and the bodies one after the other fell with a great splash into the still sea i had thought to bind heavy weights to the feet and they sank at once and helen and i were left quite alone i am writing this with great difficulty for we are dying dying of thirst why i write i do not know there is no water on board the sailors after filling their casks from the great casks in the hold left the water running when we sought to draw there was not a drop left there is a change coming over helen she sometimes looks at me strangely she seems almost shy i wonder what it is is memory coming back or has she learned that she is a woman and i a man but she is not for me there is john bruce and i vowed to take her safely to him and i shall mother good i cant write more i see that the end is v the writing in the little watersoaked book became entirely illegible indeed the last few lines were very indistinct and showed the failing of mental and physical strength i sat staring at the yellow page and then looked up at judson he was gazing intently at me well go on go on he said impatiently thats all said i he seized the book from my hands and turned the leaves feverishly yes yes that is all why man were not much wiser than we were weve got something but we havent solved the mystery of the headless skeletons no nor are we likely to said i not likely to we must said judson in a sharp strained voice he seemed to be much excited i looked at my watch its sunday morning said i and luckily sunday i thought judson wouldnt be good for much in a trial after such an evening as this as for myself i was tired and hungry and i said so so am i said judson dropping the excited air but with an effort sit still a moment he came back soon with a tray on which were cold meat and bread and butter and crackers and rochefort cheese and a bottle of macon vieux you evidently know what a hungry newspaper man wants in the middle of the night said i i know what a hungry lawyer wants and he drew the cork now said he after we had taken the edge off our appetites and were enjoying the burgundy we must know the rest of that story easier said than done why so does it seem more difficult to get a message directly from arthur hartley than to get that journal from the bottom of the ocean i do not think so this nights experience has given me a confidence in the power of will over nature that nothing can shake there is but one obstacle that stands in the way of our success the woman whom you call the medium was thoroughly prostrated as you saw she seemed badly frightened too she said that she had never had such an experience that she felt that she could not live through another as she expressed it she felt that she had been the battle ground where two great forces had met and contended i soothed her as best i could and sent her home i did not tell her that i thought that she was right she was she was the unconscious medium through which will overcame the forces of nature this evening she must be the medium through which in obedience to our will the spirit of arthur hartley shall speak with us suppose she refuses she will obey me or rather my will said judson quietly its merely a question of whether it is safe to subject her to the ordeal but as it will be nothing compared with that she has just been through i shall attempt it if she is at all able to bear it i must have that mystery solved i slept very late that morning and joined the family at the sunday afternoon dinner and then went with judson to the library to smoke its all right he said as soon as we were seated she will come this evening will all those other persons be here i asked oh no you and i and the woman only it was ten oclock that evening when judson entered the library where i sat reading before the glowing grate and said shes here come into the parlor it was with more than ordinary emotions that i followed him the medium was the only person in the room the cabinet still stood where it had stood twentyfour hours before she looked the picture of ill health great hollows were beneath the tired eyes and she moved feebly she bowed gravely to me and entered the cabinet judson turned the gas down low if you will remain entirely passive he said softly i think we shall get the communication without trouble there was a calm confidence in his voice quite different from the intensity of his manner the night before we sat quietly for many minutes until i began to grow uneasy i tried to think of nothing with very poor success but while i was making the effort strenuously there came from the cabinet a clear firm voice its tones were something like those in which the woman the night before had said what do you wish but as the voice proceeded it took on a manlier tone with that indescribable accent we call english these were the words since you wish it i will finish the story of my life on earth listen when i ceased writing in my book on the albatross it was because i had lost control of my pen and of my mind as well i managed to crawl to the deck helen was lying motionless in the shadow of the companion hatch i threw myself down by her side she put out her hand and grasped mine and a flush crossed her face i was too weak to speak and thus hand in hand we lay for i dont know how long gradually i lost consciousness perhaps in sleep at all events my spirit was not free the frail body still had strength enough to retain it i was aroused by something dropping on my face as consciousness came back i saw that the sky had become overcast that a cool breeze was blowing and that a gentle rain was falling helen was sitting erect and with parted lips drinking in the grateful rainladen air i tried to rise but could not she was much stronger than i and at my direction went below and brought blankets and clothes which she spread on the deck that they might catch the falling drops she seemed quite vigorous and already i felt my own strength coming back soon she was able to squeeze water from a blanket into a small can which stood by the mast we were in too great agony of thirst to think of small matters of neatness she offered the can to me drink yourself helen i said no she answered with a smile no you need it most and kneeling by my side she slipped her arm under my head and with her other hand held the water to my lips i drank eagerly the draught was life to me never had water such strengthgiving power i hardly noticed that it left a queer taste upon my lips i sat erect helen with her arm still around my neck drank what remained in the can then she looked me full in the face there was a new expression in the lovely eyes the old vague calm look had gone a deep flush was on her brow as she spoke arthur she said and there was a tremor in the rich deep voice arthur my memory has come back no do not speak but hear me the past all returned the night after that awful day when we buried those dead bodies in the sea i now remember and understand all that you and the dear doctor said to me i remember our parting in england i remember john bruce i remember why i set out for india so suddenly i heard that he was wounded i thought duty called me for i did not love him arthur how could i i had not seen him since we were children and our fathers betrothed us but arthur a higher power than hate or love has given us to each other and i can tell you dear that i love you oh i love you my darling my noble faithful darling oh arthur arthur she threw herself upon my breast with burning face and streaming eyes the blood leaped through my veins she raised her sweet face and our lips met for the first time there was an awful crash and our freed spirits took their happy flight together we had drank from the can that had contained uncle johns explosive a little of the powder had clung to the can floated on the water and adhered to our lips when we drank the impact of that first ecstatic kiss had exploded the compound and our heads were blown from our shoulders thats all goodby the bushwhackers gratitude by kirke munroe as we sat over our afterdinner coffee and cigars in the majors cosy library one evening last winter i discovered my host to be in a reminiscent mood and ventured to ask him a question that i had frequently meditated he smiled and was silent for a moment before answering yes i have as you suggest experienced a number of what may be termed adventures since entering uncle sams service of them all however i have no difficulty in recalling one that stands out preeminently as the most thrilling experience of my life and then he gave this narrative shortly after the close of the war i was ordered to a remote section of the south not far from the gulf coast to investigate certain claims against the government that involved what for that part of the country was a large sum of money as for several reasons it was deemed advisable that my real business there should be kept secret i assumed the rфle of a settler took possession of a vacant tract of land built a twopen log cabin engaged a negro servant and proceeded to explore the country with a view to making the acquaintance of my neighbors the place in which i was located was remote from railroads or regular routes of travel and was about as wild and lawless a district as could well be found east of the mississippi it was a limestone country abounding in sinkholes caverns and underground rivers and thickly covered with a primeval growth of timber a few clearings at long intervals marked the fields and garden patches of its widely scattered inhabitants who were as primitive a set of people as i had ever encountered during the war it had been a very hotbed of bushwhacking and its men had plundered and killed on both sides with a slight predilection in favor of southerners and a bitter hatred of yankees although i carefully concealed my connection with the army and was most guarded in my remarks whenever forced to allude to the war i could not hide the fact that i was a northern man on that account alone i was from the first an object of suspicion and close scrutiny to my neighbors by most of whom my friendly overtures were received with a sullen unresponsiveness that was to say the least discouraging my nearest neighbor was a giant of a man named case haffner who as i learned before leaving washington was the acknowledged leader of the district and foremost in all its deeds of deviltry he better than any other could furnish me with the information i wished to acquire for this reason i had taken up my abode as near to him as the unwritten law of the country which forbade neighbors to live within less than a mile of each other allowed in vain did i strive to cultivate his acquaintance he would have nothing to do with me only by stratagem did i succeed in meeting him when he simply ignored my presence and walked away without a word he lived alone with his son abner a bright keenwitted lad of about fifteen the pride of his fathers life and the sole object of his ambitions with this boy i also tried to scrape an acquaintance hoping to win the fathers confidence through him but to no purpose he either eluded me or fled like a startled deer if by chance we met while others of the neighborhood sought my house with a view to satisfy their curiosity with case haffner and his son ab i could hold no intercourse so matters stood at the end of a month when late one evening on returning from an all days ride to a remote corner of the settlement i was overtaken by a terrific thunder storm while still some distance from home i was accompanied by cжsar my negro servant and we were on horseback bewildered by the storm we lost our way and after a half hour of hopeless wandering floundering and general discomfort i was more than thankful to discover a feeble light twinkling in the window of a log cabin receiving no response to my repeated knockings at the door i pushed it open and entered i had not recognized the cabin and did not know until i saw case haffner sitting on a stool before the great mudchinked fireplace that it was his the mans face was buried in his hands and he did not look up at my entrance nor in any way betray a consciousness of my presence as i glanced about the rudelyfurnished room in search of abner my eye fell upon a bed on which lay the motionless form of the boy the light was dim and fancying him to be asleep i called him by name at this the man by the fire sprang to his feet and glaring at me like a wild beast cried out with a terrible oath that his son was dead and for me to be gone before he killed me for intruding on his misery instead of obeying him i stepped to the bedside the boy was to all appearance lifeless but disregarding the fathers protest and making a careful examination of the body i became convinced that the vital spark had not yet fled he had been stricken with one of the quick fevers of that country and had apparently succumbed to it with a slight medical knowledge gained in the army i saw that there was still a chance of saving him cжsar was at once dispatched to fetch my traveling medicine case while i heated a kettle of water case haffner meantime regarding my movements with an apathetic indifference to make a long story short i succeeded before morning in restoring the boy to life and a healthful sleep at the end of a week during which i visited him daily his recovery was assured in all this time though the father watched my every movement with a catlike intentness he never spoke to me if he could help it nor did he express the slightest gratitude for the service i had rendered him thus when the boy was so far recovered that i had no longer an excuse for visiting the haffners cabin i was apparently as far from gaining their friendship or confidence as i had been before the night of the storm this state of affairs continued unchanged when at the end of three months from my arrival in that place i found my business there nearly concluded i had established the validity of the claims i had been sent to investigate had reported upon them and had been ordered to settle them with the money that would be forwarded to me for that purpose at the same time i imagined that all this business had been conducted with such secrecy as to be unsuspected by a human being beside myself and my principals in the matter thus thinking i went alone and without a feeling of insecurity to the nearest railway station where i expected to receive the money it did not arrive on that day but instead i found a cipher dispatch stating that it would be sent a week later accepting the situation with as good grace as possible i purchased some provisions placed them in the canvas bag that i had provided for the money and returned to my temporary forest home late that night i was awakened from a sound sleep by a knock at the door of my room in answer to my inquiry of whos there came a request in the voice of my negro man that i would give him some medicine to relieve de colic misery dat was like to kill him as he had made similar requests with which i had complied several times before i unsuspiciously opened the door the candle that i had just lighted gave me a glimpse of cжsar with ashen face and the muzzle of a revolver pressed against his head at the same moment a pistol was leveled at my own face and i was seized and bound by two masked men in vain did i demand the meaning of this outrage no answer was given and i was led outside while a hasty but thorough search was made of every portion of the cabin it was of course a fruitless one and after a while the two men who made it rejoined the one who was guarding me now one of them spoke and in a voice which in spite of its disguised tone i at once recognized as that of case haffner said you mought as well give us that money major fer were bound to have it and the quicker you surrender it the easier well let you off i answered that i had no money that it had not arrived they replied that they knew all about my business and that being closely watched i had been seen to bring that money which they knew i expected to receive home from the railway station the evening before finally their leader said well major ef you are bound not to own up till we force you to well have to try a dose of the black hole and i reckon thatll fetch you to terms quickern most anything i had heard of the black hole and the suggestion thrilled me with horror it was a pit in the lime rock reputed to be of fabulous depth and was located at some distance from my cabin in one of the most impenetrable of the forest recesses from it so the negroes had told me issued uncanny moanings and groans which they attributed to the ghosts of those who they declared had been flung into it by the bushwhackers when they wished to effectually remove all traces of some of their numerous deeds of blood i protested and made promises but to no purpose my money or the black hole was the only answer i received as i was hurried away through the forest no other word was spoken and left to my own bitter reflections i took no note of the direction in which we were going nor of the distance traversed when we at length halted i became conscious of a hollow moaning sound that seemed to come from the earth at my feet once more the question was asked will you give in major and tell us where the money is or shall we drop you into the back door of hell i answered for gods sake gentlemen believe me when i say that i have received no money if i had i would gladly give it as the price of my life a mocking laugh was their only reply in another moment a slender rope was knotted under my pinioned arms and a sudden push left me swinging helplessly in the mouth of the awful pit beside which we had halted well wait here just one hour major came to me in case haffners voice and give you a chance to consider the situation if you decide to let us have the money inside of that time jest holler and well pull you up if you decide to go to hell and take the greenbacks with you why well jest have ter bid you goodby thats all then i was slowly lowered down down down through the blackness so slow was my descent that i seemed to be suspended for hours and to sink miles into the heart of the earth the pain of the slender cord cutting into my flesh was wellnigh intolerable and i bear livid evidences of it to this day with each moment the moaning gurgling and groaning from the unknown depths into which i was sinking became more distinct and horrible suddenly those above let go of the rope and with a yell of despair i dropped i do not know how far into water that closed above my head as i rose to the surface choking and gasping for breath i felt that i was being swept forward by a powerful current and as i again sank my feet touched bottom a moment later i stood in water up to my shoulders and again breathed freely for some time i was confused beyond the power of thought by the hollow roar of the black waters rushing through those awful caverns all surrounding space seemed filled with snarling formless monsters cautiously advancing and making ready to spring at me even now i often awake at night with the horror of that moment strong upon me it was so unendurable that i resolved to end it it was with great difficulty that i maintained my footing i could not do so much longer why should i attempt to there was absolutely no hope of escape i tried to pray oh lord jesus receive my soul then my muscles relaxed and i was swept away by the rushing torrent i have no idea how far i was carried before my feet again touched bottom this time in water that was not above my waist i had closed my eyes now i opened them a bright light was swinging to and fro not a hundred feet from me i stared at it blankly and with little interest only wondering with a languid curiosity what sort of a subterranean ignis fatuus it might be when suddenly my bewildered senses were startled into renewed activity by the sound of a shout it was a human voice uttering a longdrawn hellooo that echoed and reechoed weirdly through the cavernous depths about me i essayed to answer but could not then i slowly made my way through the shoaling water toward the light in another minute i stood beside a boy the one whose life i had saved two months before and as he cut the thongs that bound my arms he said cheerily its all right major pawlowed youd be coming along this yere way bout this time o night en telled me to shorely be on hand to meet up with yer now ef yoll foller me well be outen this direckly the boy was standing in the mouth of a narrow passage that free from water led away almost at right angles to the main channel of the underground river it ended at a welllike opening in which stood a rude ladder climbing this we emerged through a well concealed trap door into the very room where abner haffner had laid at the point of death two months before is that all i asked as the major paused and lighted a fresh cigar yes its all of that story i could not cause the arrest of the gang even had i known who composed it without causing that of their leader and from the moment that blessed light illumined the black waters of that underground river i would not have harmed case haffner for anything the world holds best worth having no by daylight i was well out of that section of country nor have i ever since set foot in it have you ever heard again from that boy who abner well i should say i had i put him through college and he is in congress today if i should tell you his real name you would instantly recognize it as that of one of the smartest men ever sent to washington from the far south the end of all by nym crinkle the difficulty that i experience in complying with your request dear spirit springs from the terrestrial limitations of thought and expression from which as you may well know i have not been long enough with you to free myself i shall however give you a plain narrative of the events attending the extinction of life on our planet asking you only to remember that i am doing it just as i would have done it were it possible for a fellow human being while on earth using the phraseology and the terrestrial time divisions with which i am most familiar the circumstance which at our last intercourse i was trying to explain to you was simply this in the early summer of the year a sudden interruption of navigation occurred on the pacific coast which curiously enough attracted very little attention outside of scientific circles i was living at the house of my wealthy friend judge brisbane in gramercy park to tell you the truth i was in love with his beautiful daughter of whom i shall have to speak more fully to you for she was intimately associated with me in the appalling scenes which you desire me to describe i was sitting in the judges library on the night of june his daughter was present and i had been conversing with her in an undertone while the judge read the evening papers he suddenly laid down the paper took off his spectacles and turning round in his chair said to me did you see the brief dispatch in the morning papers two days ago from san francisco saying that all the easternbound vessels were overdue on that coast i replied at once that i had not noticed it it is astonishing he said that in our present system of journalism the most important events connected with the welfare of mankind receive the slightest attention from the newspapers and the trivialities of life are most voluminously treated a movement in the iron trade that affects millions of homes gets a brief paragraph in small type and the quarrel of a ballet girl with her paramour receives illuminated attention down whole columns here is something taking place in the pacific ocean of surpassing interest to the race and nobody pays the slightest attention to it except perhaps the consignees and shipping clerks what is it we both asked with the languid interest that young people having an overmastering personal affair on hand would be apt to take in matters of national or universal importance the judge got up and going to a side table where he kept his papers piled in chronological order pulled out a recent issue of a morning journal and after looking it over searchingly a moment said here i should think you would notice such a paragraph as this then he read as i recollect a telegraphic dispatch to this effect san francisco june considerable anxiety is felt here in commercial circles by the nonarrival of any eastwardbound vessels for a week the steamship cathay of the occidental line is overdue four days an unusual easterly wind has been blowing for twentyfour hours weather mild that dispatch you will perceive said the judge was sent two days ago now here on the th i read in the evening paper another dispatch from san francisco hidden away at the bottom of a column of commercial news listen to this san francisco june the entire suspension of travel from the west continues to excite the gravest apprehensions nothing but coastwise vessels have come in during the past eight days the u s cruiser mobile left honolulu three weeks ago for this coast there is no official intimation of a storm in the chinese seas the judge laid the paper down and regarded us both a moment in silence as if expecting to hear some remark that indicated our suddenly awakened curiosity i dont think we responded with any adequate interest to the occasion miss brisbane did indeed stare at her father in her dreamy abstracted way a moment and then got up and going to the open window began to arrange the curtains as if relinquishing whatever problem there was to the superior acumen of the masculine mind i think i said that it looked as if there had been a cyclone somewhere and if there had we should in all probability get the accounts of it soon enough but young man replied the judge with his majesterial emphasis cyclones do not extend from the fiftieth degree of north latitude to the fortieth degree of south latitude and vessels are due at san francisco from melbourne and japan what then other than a storm at sea could have caused a detention of all these vessels i asked and i must have unwittingly betrayed in the tone of my voice or the expression of my face that considerate superciliousness with which youth regards the serious notions of mature philosophers for the judge putting his gold spectacles upon his nose and regarding me over the top of them a moment said rather severely other than the known and regular phenomena of this planet do not interest young men if i could answer your question there would be no special interest in the matter i mention these trivial incidents because insignificant as they may seem they were the first ripples of that disaster which was soon enough to overwhelm us all and to show you what were the only premonitions the world had of the events which were to follow on june the subject did not occur to me a hundred other things of far more immediate consequence to me occupied my attention a young man who is preparing to get married is not apt to take somber views of anything nor is he very apt to allow the contumacy of age in his prospective fatherinlaw to aggravate him it was a pardonable freak i thought in a man who had retired in most respects from the active world to dogmatize a little about that world now that he judged it through his favorite evening paper when therefore on the night of the th while at the teatable the judge broke out again about the meteorological wave on the pacific coast his daughter kate and i exchanged a rapid but furtive glance which said in the perfect understanding of lovers there comes the old gentlemans new hobby again and we can well afford to treat it leniently the judge had the damp evening paper in his hand and he disregarded the steaming cup of tea which his daughter had poured for him well he said with a toss of selfsatisfied import now the newspapers are waking up to the significance of the california news he then read from the paper as nearly as i can recollect something like the following san francisco june there is an intense and growing anxiety on this coast with respect to the nonappearance of any eastwardbound vessels the breeze from the east continues and is unprecedented now i should like to know said the judge as he laid down the paper and took up his teacup why a breeze from the east in california should be unprecedented because i ventured to remark it usually blows from the sea at this season nonsense exclaimed the judge with vigor a variation for a few days in wind or weather is a common occurrence everywhere fancy a message sent all over the world from the west indies that the trade winds were six days late or a telegram from minnesota that the winter frosts had been interfered with for a week by pleasant sunshine no sir the event of importance to the californian at this moment is the mysterious something that has happened out at sea and there is no excuse for his associating a summer breeze from the east with it except that there is something peculiar about that breeze that associates it in the mind with the predominant mystery i smiled you will pardon me judge but it seems to me i said that you are trying to invest the whole affair with an occult significance that is subjective i suppose that in a few hours the matter will be explained and forgotten in a moment we were in one of those foolish little wrangles in which so far as argument is concerned the younger man is at a great disadvantage when the elder however unreasonable his claims enforces them with the advantage of age and position i remember that the desire to convince kate on the one hand that i was free from what i conceived to be her fathers unreasonableness and sustain my independence of views on the other hand led me to say much more than was polite for i exasperated the old gentleman and with a curt and not altogether complimentary remark he got up and left the room the moment he was gone i turned to the daughter and laughingly said well my dear i am afraid i have offended your father without intending it but you at least understand me and are free from his superstition to my surprise she regarded me with a serious air and replied i do not know what you mean by superstition my father believes that something has happened and i feel that he is right you do not mean to tell me i said that you believe anything has happened that can concern us she made no reply i looked at her with some astonishment and wondered if i had offended her by opposing her fathers childish views perhaps i persisted you too think i am stupidly unreasonable because i will not consent to be dishonestly chimerical i well remember the look of sad reproach with which she silently regarded me and i well remember too the thought that came into my mind i said to myself this is the same obduracy that her father has shown odd it is that i never noticed the trait in her before then i added with an equal obduracy that i was not conscious of perhaps you too have discovered some peculiarity of good sense in me that is offensive and you are afraid that something will happen if we here she interrupted me in her quiet resolute and reproachful way something has happened she said i was amazed if i had suddenly discovered that the woman i loved was unfaithful to me it could not have produced in my frame of mind at that moment a greater shock it seemed to me then that the wooing of months the confidence and affection of a year were to be sacrificed in a moment of infatuated stubbornness the very thought was so unnatural that it produced a revulsion in my own feelings my darling i said as i went toward her impulsively we are playing the unworthy part of fools nothing can ever happen that will make us love each other less or prevent you from being my wife i put my arm around her in the old familiar way she was passive and irresponsive she stood there limply holding the curtain with one white arm upraised her beautiful head bent over and her eyes cast down so that i could not look into her face this stony obduracy was so new and unlike her that i withdrew my arm and stepped back a little to regard her with astonishment not unmingled with pique at that moment she lifted her head slowly and as she looked at me with a dreamy and faraway pathos i saw that her eyes were filled with tears it seems to me she said with a voice that sounded as if it was addressed to an invisible phantom way beyond me it seems to me that i shall never be your wife i must have stared at her several seconds in silence then i said you are ill you are not yourself when you have recovered your normal condition i will come back i snatched a kiss from her lips that were strangely cold and rushed from the house it was not till the next morning when i woke up after a short and disturbed sleep that my mind reverted to the cause of all this purely sentimental disagreement and i felt a strong desire to have events prove that the judge was slightly monomaniacal and that i was right i went to riccadonnas for my breakfast and got all the morning papers as usual but this time with a distinct confidence that the news would be the best vindication of my good sense and that i should yet have a good laugh at the judge i opened the paper as i sipped my coffee and the first thing my eyes fell on were the headlines of a dispatch from st louis i read them with an inexplicable sense of something sinking in me as i recall them they ran as follows strange news from the west all communication west of salt lake city ceases meteorological puzzle what is the matter with the wires then followed the dispatch which i have not forgotten st louis june p m a dispatch received here from yuma on the texas pacific announces that no easternbound train has come in since morning and all attempts to open communication by telegraph with points west of that place have failed it is the opinion of railroad men that a great storm is raging in california weather here pleasant with a steady dry wind from the east blowing immediately following this was another news item which i can quote from memory denver june p m intelligence from cheyenne is to the effect that railway travel and telegraphic communication west of pocatello on the union pacific and ogden and on the central pacific have been interrupted by a storm the telegraph wires are believed to be in good condition but up to nine oclock there has been no return current i read these paragraphs over three or four times ordinarily i should have passed them by and given my attention to other and more congenial news but now a dull fear that events were conspiring to widen the breach between myself and the brisbanes focussed my interest on them there was that easterly wind blowing again was i too growing superstitious i turned over all the papers the news was the same in all but there was not an editorial paragraph of comment in any of the sheets which indeed teamed with all the details of active commercial political and social life i went down town after eating my breakfast and found that the intelligence had not awakened any public attention that was observable the two or three persons to whom i spoke with regard to it treated it as one of the passing sensations of the hour that would be explained sooner or later it was not till the evening papers of the th came out that the matter began to be discussed the dispatches in these papers were of a nature to arouse widespread anxiety it was very obvious from their construction and import that the feeling west of the mississippi was more intense than had up to this time been suspected the columns of the papers were filled with brief but rather startling telegrams from various points denver el paso salt lake city cheyenne st paul st louis and chicago sent anxious sentences which had a thrill of trepidation in their broken phrases and it was easy to see that this feeling of deep concern increased with each dispatch from a point further west telegrams sent to st louis chicago and st paul represented the condition of anxiety in ogden and pocatello to be bordering on excitement fears were entertained the dispatches said of a meteorological cataclysm and thousands who had friends either on the coast or in transit were besieging the telegraph offices in vain the hurried comments of the evening papers on the news were singularly unsatisfactory and noncommittal the unprecedented storm that is now raging on the pacific slope i read and which has temporarily cut off communications with the far west will by its magnitude fill the country with the most serious apprehensions the earliest news from california which shall give us the details of the storm said another paper will be looked for with eagerness and will be promptly and fully furnished to our readers as curious as anybody could be to know what kind of a storm it was that had stopped railroad travel from idaho to mexico and remarking with surprise that the signal office utterly refused to recognize a great storm anywhere i dismissed the subject from my mind with the reflection that there would in all probability be explanatory news in the morning and resolved to make my usual visit to the brisbane family to my surprise kate received me cordially and with no other allusion to the unpleasantness of the night before than a demure remark that she was afraid she had offended me let us not refer to it at all i said and thus avoid making idiots of ourselves i am glad you came tonight she remarked after a moments silence for i wanted to tell you of the change we are going to make a little pang darted through me it was said so seriously what is it my dear i asked trying to be as affectionate as if the conditions had not changed my father and i have determined to go to europe to europe i repeated aghast you surely do not mean it yes resolutely he wanted to consult you about it but was afraid you would disagree with his plans and when did he make up his mind to take this sudden move this morning and you intend to go with him yes and i was going to ask you to go too when do you propose to go immediately it was evident to my mind now that this old man was a panicstricken monomaniac and had infected his daughter with his fears kate i said as i took her by her hands and pulled her to the sofa beside me you are running away from something it is not from me is it i want you to go with us she answered but you knew when you asked me that i could not go so suddenly you expected me to refuse no she said i expect you to consent be careful in a moment of bravado i may take you at your word at any cost she caught hold of me do she said tremulously and i felt a little shiver in her hand do do i would rather go with you than lose you i said at a hazard and if you are determined to go i believe i will accompany you if your father will consent we are determined she calmly replied but i must put my affairs in order i suggested how many hours will it take you hours i repeated you would not like to start tonight surely yes she answered i would gladly start tonight my patience was giving way very fast at this imperturbable obduracy perhaps i said you will give me some adequate reason for a haste that i cannot comprehend she did not answer she was listening with her head averted and she held up her hand for me to listen also as if that were her answer then there came through the open window the hoarse cry of a distant newsboy who was bellowing an extra there was something weird in her attitude and action connecting as they did her motives with that discordant ominous cry its an extra i said as unconcernedly as possible ill get a copy there may be some good news for you and i made a move toward the window dont she said quietly we were talking about going to europe pa is not familiar with the business of securing passages and you are you could relieve him of a great deal of worry and if you would go with us kate i said do you want me to go yes i do she replied i do not want to leave you here then i said i will go i will see your father in the morning and tell him that i will attend to the whole business of securing passages i will set about arranging my affairs at once she then let me plague her a little about her timidity and after a half hour of playful badinage on my part i came away with a parting promise on my lips to lose no delay in making the arrangements for our departure such however was not my intention i felt sure that the judge and his daughter would change their minds if i could only manage to delay matters a few days to go running off to europe at a moments notice would be utter folly for me as i left the house i heard the voices of the newsboys in various keys still calling the extras i bought a paper and read it under the gaslight of the church on twentieth street display headlines announced as silent as the grave nothing heard from the pacific great excitement in chicago and st louis i must have stood there ten minutes poring over the strange news an expedition in a special train had been sent west from yuma that day with railroad men and doctors it had left at p m the train reached mesquite in less than an hour and word was sent back from that station all right here track clear will reach the springs at p m a dispatch from yuma sent at oclock and received at st louis said nothing further heard from the special news from chicago where the excitement appeared to be momentarily growing reflected intelligence from denver st paul and kansas city and it was vain to ignore the fact that the entire west was in an alarming condition of anxiety a special train was fitting out at cheyenne under government orders to start in the morning with a corps of signal service men army officers and electricians it was to go provided with every scientific appliance and to carry an insulated cable to be paid out from the car the accounts said that the people were all on the streets in cheyenne and an enormous mob surrounded the station where the preparations were making for the first time i felt as i threw the paper away what i can only call a sense of misgiving as i walked up the deserted avenue this feeling grew upon me and when i reached twentythird street on my way to the fifth avenue hotel a sudden and entirely new reflection made me stop unconsciously as i turned it over in my mind if this strange news has affected judge brisbane and his daughter so seriously why may it not be affecting millions of other people similarly if there is at this moment a panic in the west how long will it take the reflex wave to reach new york the next morning events or at least the publication of them had reached that condition which arrests public attention everywhere the news from the west swamped all else in the morning journals the editors by their work now acknowledged that the mysterious silence on the pacific slope was by far the most important subject for consideration before the world the moment i glanced at the sheets i saw that there was but one theme in the journalistic mind two days had passed and the silence was unbroken never before in the history of the world had the absence of news become such important news public attention was now mainly centered on the attempt to get a train of observation through from cheyenne there was a hopeful spirit to most of the accounts as if it was believed that science would unravel the mystery but there was nothing from any quarter of the globe that as yet afforded the feeblest gleam of comfort the government train was to start early on this the morning of the th and the papers were only able to furnish details of the preparation and reports of the public excitement in cheyenne and denver the officers on the train were to send dispatches from every station west of pocatello they were sagacious experienced men and the expedition was under the direction of the wellknown engineer general albert carrall i felt as i read the accounts that these men would probably clear up the mystery and i resolved to delay engaging the passages on the ocean steamer until the next day so i wrote a carefully worded note to judge brisbane informing him that i would attend to the matter immediately had i then had the slightest knowledge of the cumulative rapidity with which a panic moves i would not have taken this risk but my whole object was to gain time with the hope that something would occur to change the minds of my two timid friends on the night of the th i avoided the brisbane establishment although my desire drew me in that direction i resolved to wait until the morrow and if nothing happened to change the determination of the judge to go to europe to then make my arrangements to go with him and kate that night there was a visible change in the metropolis the theaters were deserted men and women were congregated at the corners and were walking in the roadways a sure indication in a great city of some popular disturbance the bulletins and news centers were crowded and the mystery of the great silence was being discussed by everybody one thing struck everybody with a vague terror and it was the accounts of the strange wind that was now blowing at cheyenne and denver one special correspondent at cheyenne said that it seemed to him that the atmosphere of the earth influenced by some incomprehensible suction was all rushing to an unseen vortex it was not in any sense a disturbance of the atmosphere that we usually call a wind but a steady silent draught and the spectacle of trees bent over and held all day by the pressure but unfluttered and unrelieved by fluctuant variations filled them with wonder and dread i got up early on the morning of the th for i had slept lightly and fitfully to my surprise i found that almost everybody else was up it made me realize as i had not done before the feverish tension of public expectation the news if news it can be called was startling let me try and repeat it to you just as it was presented to my sense the special train upon which the eyes of the whole country were fixed had been heard from it had gone west from cheyenne and passed through pocatello without interruption then followed the dispatches received from it at cheyenne as it passed the stations beyond pocatello they were in this order and to this effect michano a m all right instruments working well track clear inhabitants appear to be moving east no intelligence of a definite character obtained shoshone miles west expect to make it in four hours bannock p m conditions unchanged passed moving settlers all the way they are going east with chattels wind from the east has the pressure without the violence of a gale party in good spirits sunshine vast herds of wild cattle now impeding progress wind increasing road otherwise clear american falls signs of the exodus decreasing country strewn with household goods reports here that all the teams that went out on the roads west have not returned expect to hear something definite from minidoka minidoka electrical and barometrical indications unchanged signs of life disappearing party in excellent spirits and eager to reach the facts the next dispatch was from cheyenne and was sent at eight oclock it simply said nothing further heard from government party wire in good order then followed two telegrams of gruesome brevity and significance pocatello p m nothing here cheyenne p m nothing has come over the special wire up to this hour microphonic tests at pocatello indicate that the train is still moving electrical tests indicate that the current is unbroken finally there was a special message from the new york stars correspondent at cheyenne dated p m it was about to this effect the current on the government wire was broken at delicate tests show that the wire is now grounded the dire conclusion of experts here is that the train ran from some point west of minidoka from about to without human control and then met with an accident at the rate at which it was moving the train must have reached shoshone terrible excitement here my keen sense detected in the newspaper itself certain infallible little signs that the news had disturbed the precision and routine of the office lines of type were in the wrong place and typographical errors made it difficult to get the exact sense dispatch after dispatch all bearing the same import of panic was huddled into the column from st louis the announcement was an unprecedented excitement here over the news from cheyenne the authorities appear to have lost their heads and are unable to preserve order eastwardbound trains are carrying away people at a mob rate we are in the midst of chaos from chicago the intelligence was similarly appalling a panic prevails here said the dispatch impelled by a senseless apprehension of disaster people have lost their reason the mayor has just issued a call upon the best citizens to assist him in preserving order it required no news expert to see that all the issues of life were temporarily suspended by the tremendous and growing interest in this stupendous mystery channels of news worn smooth by the placid streams of everyday platitudes began to show the roll of this new freshet a dispatch from washington was unintentionally significant it read like this the only explanation forwarded by colonel sandford of the abandonment of the pikes peak signal station by himself and party is that of a coward he says the wind pressure indicated that the place would speedily become untenable i turned over the sheet in which these disheartening facts were presented and looked at the editorial page there was a doubleleaded leader evidently written late at night and its conclusions were more gruesome than the facts for while the facts could be interpreted in various ways according to the readers condition of mind there was no mistaking the official tone of the editor whose business it was to weigh and estimate the public value of news it seemed to me that this umpire to whom we instinctively looked for opinions had thrown up the sponge so to speak let me recall his words as they were impressed upon me that morning that a grave crisis has arrived in the conditions of life on this planet it would be folly and is impossible any longer to deny it is not our province nor is it within our power to offer any solution of the stupendous mystery that is now enveloping a part of our continent it is only imperative upon us as brave agents in the dispensing of truth to say with all the candor that we can summon that the effort of the government to open communication with the vast region west of what must now be known as the meridian of silence has dismally failed and it is the conviction of the maturest judgment based upon all the facts of the attempt that are obtainable that it failed because the explorers themselves ceased to exist when they had passed a certain pretty welldefined line which we now know extends north and south from helena in montana to yuma on the borders of mexico i found myself standing by my breakfast table reading this i had risen unconsciously my breakfast was unheeded an ungovernable impulse to go anywhere seized me to sit still with this crushing uncertainty was impossible i found myself in a coupй where i got it i do not distinctly remember but i do remember that it was by means of an extraordinary offer to the driver who like all his fellows was dashing through the streets at a headlong pace and i also have a very clear recollection of the strange nervous effect produced upon me by seeing the people along the curbs on broadway watching the flying vehicles with a mute terror as if the very recklessness of the drivers afforded them a palpable distraction from the unintelligible weight of their own fears i speedily noticed that the stream of humanity on the streets was tending down town and almost immediately i understood that it was heading like myself for the news centers i could get no farther than chambers street owing to the block of people and vehicles and the driver rudely refused to take the risk of a jam i looked at the city hall clock it was only eight my heart was beating rapidly and i knew enough of the effect of emotion on the cardiac system to understand that it was caused by suspense a thousand new terrors were in the air of which the experience and the sagacity of man were ignorant i forced my way with the greatest difficulty across the park which was full of restless but strangely mute people and got near enough to the newspaper bulletins to read the painted lines they were feverishly indicative of the cross currents of excitement in the country and were in short decisive sentences like this the president asked to appoint a day of humiliation and prayer immediately the governor of colorado crazed by the excitement commits suicide mob rule in chicago rioting in denver breakdown of the alton chicago road unparalleled scenes at el paso fanaticism in new orleans the christian pastors of this city will meet at cooper union at ten oclock irrespective of sect panic in milwaukee held by a numbing sort of fascination i read these sentences over and over across printing house square on another bulletin in big black letters i saw the line it baffles the world has annihilation set in there was something weird in the use of the pronoun it it seemed to be mans last effort in language to express a mystery that was specific and yet incomprehensible and i found that by the common consent of ignorance men were referring to the phenomenon as it i looked at the strained anxious faces of the mob and a great fear fell upon me with it came an awful reproach i would go instantly and redeem my word to kate by securing passages to europe i had to fight my way by inches out of the stolid and frightened crowd to the steamship office on lower broadway and there i found another jam the street was full of private carriages and it was impossible to get anywhere near the entrance to the office i saw a policeman who was on the outside of the press and who was walking up and down in a restless and unofficial manner what is the matter here i asked him he looked me all over as if he suspected that i had fallen out of the clouds then he said tryin to get tickets for europe where d you come frum and then after a restless turn or two he added as he passed me but it aint no use cause there aint steamships enough in the world then it was i think that the whole terrible truth first lit my consciousness like the sudden upflaring of a bale fire the inhabitants were fleeing from the country they were all affected as had been the brisbanes i was the only dolt and idiot and liar who had no instincts of danger and who had failed to rescue the woman i loved when she had appealed to me then i plunged wildly out into the street with a feeling of desperation and that sinking of the spirits that comes only in the worst crises and when one begins to comprehend how helpless man is i saw that in the brief time that had elapsed a change had taken place in the aspect of the crowds when i got to broadway again it was with the utmost difficulty that i could make my way at all against the surging mass of people that seemed momentarily to swell it was utterly unlike any crowd in numbers and disposition that i had ever encountered it was made up of all classes it had lost that american characteristic of goodhumor which had been swallowed up in a dire personal and selfish instinct of selfpreservation it was animated by a vague terror and disregarded every consideration but that of personal safety a horrible conviction seized me that the ordinary restraints of society were breaking down and that speedily panic would mount to chaos i saw that this dread was adding to the terror of everybody aside from the fear of it like an assemblage in a burning building the fear of each other was more subtile and operative than the fear of the elements by indefatigable labor i got off the main thoroughfare and reached hudson street and here in the crowd i learned the latest news and discovered the cause of the rapidly increasing excitement i had run against an intimate friend and associate by accident his first words were as he wiped the perspiration out of his eyes well this is awful eh whats the news i asked the latest is that the death line has moved the thurbers have a private wire and i just heard that denver is cut off now it looks as if it was every man for himself so terrible was this announcement and so engrossed was i with the despairing thoughts that it gave rise to that i took little heed of what was going on about me until i reached canal street the one dull conviction that it was useless to fight against now was that annihilation had set in that some destroying wave had started out to encircle the globe and that the race was doomed something god alone knew what had happened to our planet and humanity was to be swept away in one of those cataclysms with which soulless nature prepares for a new order of existence i was rudely awakened from this reverie of wretchedness by the crowd which surged against me with a blind unvindictive violence my one desire was to get uptown to the woman i loved and had neglected and i saw that every minute was adding to the difficulty how i reached the brevoort house i do not know but there i found a number of citizens who had not utterly lost their heads and who had come together for counsel there was a private wire in the house and they were receiving intelligence from several central points in the city the looks of these men who were huddled into the parlor were enough to dismay the most resolute observer their pale faces and painfully set mouths indicated the sense of an awful crisis which wisdom did not know how to meet or avoid a wellknown citizen read the dispatches to them as they were received and torn as i was by impatience my curiosity held me there to hear it was now about halfpast eleven in the morning the rapidity with which events had moved since i got up was made startlingly apparent by the information here furnished the authorities together with a number of influential citizens had come together as if by a common instinct at the fifth avenue hotel the mayor the police and fire commissioners several wealthy bankers and a number of prominent clergymen were holding some kind of council and sending out appeals for cooperation and addresses to the public which latter were entirely unheeded as i forced myself into the room i saw and heard a venerable and majestic gentleman evidently a clergyman addressing those present in an impassioned manner there were tears in his eyes and an awful sadness in his voice men and brethren he said it is appointed unto all men once to die if it be appointed unto us who remain to die together let us die like christians who still retain our faith in eternal justice and eternal mercy and not like wild beasts that devour each other a report came that the fatal east wind was blowing and at this there was a general movement of those present as if the time were too short to waste in longer listening i came up lafayette place to astor place with the intention of reaching fourth avenue both spaces were choked with people and on eighth street i saw a woman on the steps of a private residence wildly calling on the mob which paid no attention to her to repent for the day of judgment was at hand her white hair was blown over her face and her arms were frantically gesticulating into the great hall of the cooper union a mass of religious people had flocked and a number of speakers were making addresses and offering up prayers when i passed the woman who was exhorting the crowd i had noticed the manner in which her hair which was of soft flossy white streamed out straight in front of her but it did not occur to me until i reached the square in front of the cooper union that this was caused by the peculiar and ominous draft of wind from the east of which i had heard so much for it was there that i saw a crowd pointing up to the roof of the vast building known as the bible house which appeared to be covered with people some of them were holding flags and drapery and the material floated out westward without any of the undulating motion which always marks a flag in a disturbed current these extemporized pennants stood out as if they were starched i could see that this sign produced a dumb sort of terror in the crowd it seemed to me then that all emotion of which i was capable was centered in the one desire to get to the woman i loved and die with her a crushing and at the same time an animating remorse as if somehow i had been responsible for her death at least in disregarding her warnings and somehow doubly guilty in mistrusting her motives unmanned me and inflamed me it was with something of the same disregard of everybody but oneself that i had seen in others that i fought my way to twentyfirst street what brutalities i committed need not be recounted that hour remains with me an acute and jangled memory of frenzy i reached the steps of judge brisbanes house torn and bleeding the terrible scenes were in my eyes and the dreadful monotonous tumult of human desperation that vast sigh of doomed humanity pierced here and there by the wails and shrieks of despair and the cries of innocence for help was in my ears the celerity with which it had all come on left no chance for cool reason an invisible phantom was at the heels of the community and we were part of a mighty stampede after fumbling for an instant at the bell and pushing back several ghastly creatures who were on the steps i must have applied my shoulder to the door and pushed it in some one appeared to be resisting on the other side but it gave way and i half fell into judge brisbanes vestibule an instant later we were looking into each others faces i bloody and soiled and ragged and wild with the frenzy of fear and impatience he pale as death but resolute and holding an enormous bar over me quick he said help me fasten this door that sudden call of duty struck something habitual in me and without knowing exactly what i was doing i found myself assisting him in barricading the door the endeavor somewhat changed the current of my thoughts from the danger that was unseen to the danger that was storming under our windows i must have muttered some kind of excuse for my conduct to the judge for he said no time for apologies or recriminations now the house is full of my neighbors who have come here for protection go upstairs and look after the women the best and only thing we can do is to preserve a quiet place to die in and not be trampled to pieces are you armed i dashed up the broad staircase and found the upper rooms occupied by women some of whom in morning attire hastily thrown on were sitting around with their heads in their hands while others were huddled at the windows staring with strained looks of terror at the crowds on the street walking up and down the room wringing his hands a middleaged man was giving expression to the most terrible irony and cowardice without reference to his listeners i ran my eye over the huddled groups of frightened women the one i sought was not there i flew through the groaning figures on the stairway up to her chamber i knocked loudly and called her by name passionately then i listened i heard nothing but the dull sounds of the human tumult that came through the open casement and the sighing tones of the telegraph wires as the steady draft from the east swept through them i shook the door and abjured her to come to me then in my madness i burst it in she was on her knees at the bed with her hands on her ears and her head buried in the bedclothes i fell down on my knees beside her and put my arm around her kate i said we will die together look up love at least is eternal she was cold i caught her head between my hands and turned her beautiful face toward me my god she was dead dead with her staring eyes full of terror and her beautiful mouth set in hard and ghastly lines then it was that i felt rise up within me for the first time the rebellious bitterness of the natural man need i tell you that at such moments man is little better than an animal save in his free agency that enables him to defy i passed hours there moaning cursing bewailing when at last the force of the paroxysm had expended itself i shook my fist in the face of heaven with the obduracy of pagan greek and said come on now you envious fates and do your worst speedily or i will be too quick for you judge brisbane found me there raving do you know i asked yes he answered and i am grateful she is spared much that we must endure and so i said life love and the vaunted future of the race end in mockery it seems so he replied but we cannot be sure come with me we ascended to the roof the spectacle that greeted us was indescribable the tops of all the houses were black with people who were staring mutely and with childish terror into the west the steady subdued organ tone of the rushing atmosphere could now be heard above all else we stood there in silence a few moments and then i said its terrible what do you suppose is taking place i suppose replied the judge that we are losing our atmosphere reeling it off so to speak slowly as we revolve our planet has entered some portion of the ethereal space where the conditions are sucking us dry of oxygen as it recedes from the earth the water disappears and we shall be left to revolve like the moon without air and without liquid and consequently without life he said this meditatively less as if he were answering my question than if he were formulating his own fears then i remarked if this takes place gradually the millions have got to struggle and writhe and fight together in suffocation we can at least blow our brains out and cheat such a fate i should hate said the judge to think that the man who was to marry kate had not the bravery to face his destiny that was all that was said we came down and some ripples of intelligence reached us during the afternoon from one or two persons who made their way into the house we learned that in the frenzy of fear the populace were committing the most extraordinary excesses the shore line of the atlantic was crowded with people many of whom plunged into the ocean in the vain attempt to get away the scenes in the city were too revolting to narrate for a large class of the community released from all restraint of moral and civil law were bent on securing all the lawless pleasures that force could command during the few hours that was left to them and the line was steadily coming east chicago was cut off at twelve oclock and at four intelligence had ceased coming from buffalo at this time the sound of the winds was like the roar of the sea i had torn myself away from the window where i had been staring at the now packed and struggling masses of people and had locked myself in the room with the dead body of kate there was a vial of opium on her table that had been used for neuralgia i swallowed it and sat down by the bedside i know not how long i remained there but a loud report as of a discharged cannon roused me i remember staggering and panting in the dark with a semiconsciousness that the end had come and i now know that report was occasioned by the bursting of the drums of my ears i remember nothing more i have given you a plain statement of my experiences in that crisis and i dare say they are uneventful enough by the side of the experiences of millions shall he marry her by anna katherine green chapter i when i met taylor at the club the other night he looked so cheerful i scarcely knew him what is it cried i advancing with outstretched hand i am going to be married was his gay reply this is my last night at the club i was glad and showed it taylor is a man for whom domestic life is a necessity he has never been at home with us though we all liked him and he in his way liked us and who is the fortunate lady i inquired for i had been out of town for some time and had not as yet been made acquainted with the latest society news my intended bride is mrs walworth the young widow he must have seen a change take place in my expression for he stopped you know her of course he added after a short study of my face i had by this time regained my selfpossession of course i repeated and i have always thought her one of the most attractive women in town another shake upon it old man but my heart was heavy and my mind perplexed notwithstanding the forced cordiality of my tones and i took an early opportunity to withdraw by myself and think over the situation mrs walworth she was a pretty woman and what was more she was to all appearance a woman whose winning manners bespoke a kindly heart just the person i contemplated whom i would pick out for the helpmate of my somewhat exacting friend if i paused on that if it was a formidable one and grew none the smaller or less important under my broodings indeed it seemed to dilate until it assumed gigantic proportions worrying me and weighing so heavily upon my conscience that i at last rose from the newspaper at which i had been hopelessly staring and looking up taylor again asked him how soon he expected to become a benedict his answer startled me in a week he replied and if i have not asked you to the ceremony it is because helen is not in a position to i supposed he finished the sentence but i did not hear him if the marriage was so near of course it would be folly on my part to attempt to hinder it i drew off for the second time but i could not remain easy taylor is a good fellow and it would be a shame to allow him to marry a woman with whom he could never be happy he would feel any such disappointment so keenly so much more keenly than most men a lack of principle or even of sensibility on her part would make him miserable anticipating heaven it would not take a hell to make him wretched a purgatory would do it was i right then in letting him proceed in his intentions regarding mrs walworth when she possibly was the woman whoi paused and tried to call up her countenance before me it was a sweet one and possibly a true one i might have trusted her for myself but i do not look for perfection and taylor does and will certainly go to the bad if he is deceived in his expectations but in a week it is too late for interference only it is never too late till the knot is tied as i thought of this i decided impulsively and perhaps you may say unwisely to give him a hint of his danger and i did it in this wise taylor said i when i had him safely in my own rooms i am going to tell you a bit of personal history curious enough i think to interest you even upon the eve of your marriage i do not know when i shall see you again and i should like you to know how a lawyer and a man of the world can sometimes be taken in he nodded accepting the situation goodhumoredly though i saw by the abstraction with which he gazed into the fire that i should have to be very interesting to lure him from the thoughts that engrossed him as i meant to be very interesting this did not greatly concern me one morning last spring i began i received in my morning mail a letter the delicate penmanship of which at once attracted my attention and awakened my curiosity turning to the signature i read the name of a young lady friend of mine and somewhat startled at the thought that this was the first time i had ever seen the handwriting of one i knew so well i perused the letter with an interest that presently became painful as i realized the tenor of its contents i will not quote the letter though i could but confine myself to saying that after a modest recognition of my friendship for her quite a fatherly friendship i assure you as she is only eighteen and i as you know am well on toward fifty she proceeded to ask in an humble and confiding spirit for the loan do not start of fifty dollars such a request coming from a young girl well connected and with every visible sign of being generously provided for by her father was certainly startling to an old bachelor of settled ways and strict notions but remembering her youth and the childish innocence of her manner i turned over the page and read as her reason for proffering such a request that her heart was set upon aiding a certain poor family that stood in immediate need of food clothes and medicines but that she could not do what she wished because she had already spent all the money allowed her by her father for such purposes and dared not go to him for more as she had once before offended him by doing this and feared if she repeated her fault he would carry out the threat he had then made of stopping her allowance altogether but the family was a deserving one and she could not see any member of it starve so she came to me of whose goodness she was assured convinced i would understand her perplexity and excuse her and so forth and so forth in language quite childlike and entreating which if it did not satisfy my ideas of propriety at least touched my heart and made any action which i could take in the matter extremely difficult to refuse her request would be at once to mortify and aggrieve her to accede to it and give her the fifty dollars she asked a sum by the way i could not well spare would be to encourage an action easily pardoned once but which if repeated would lead to unpleasant complications to say the least the third course of informing her father of what she needed i did not even consider for i knew him well enough to be sure that nothing but pain to her would be the result i therefore compromised the affair by enclosing the money in a letter in which i told her that i comprehended her difficulty and sent with pleasure the amount she needed but that as a friend i must add that while in the present instance she had run no risk of being misunderstood or unkindly censured that such a request made to another man and under other circumstances might provoke a surprise capable of leading to the most unpleasant consequences and advised her if she ever again found herself in such a strait to appeal directly to her father or else to deny herself a charity which she was in no position to bestow this letter i undertook to deliver myself for one of the curious points of her communication had been the entreaty that i would not delay the help she needed by trusting the money to any hand but my own but would bring it to a certain hotel down town and place it at the beginning of the book of isaiah in the large bible i would find lying on a side table in the small parlor off the main one she would seek it there before the morning was over and so without the intervention of a third party acquire the means she desired for helping a poor and deserving family i knew the hotel she mentioned and i remembered the room but i did not remember the bible however it was sure to be in the place she indicated and though i was not in much sympathy with my errand i respected her whim and carried the letter down town i had reached main street and was in sight of the hotel designated when suddenly on an opposite corner of the street i saw the young girl herself she looked as fresh as the morning and smiled so gayly i felt somewhat repaid for the annoyance she had caused me and gratified that i could cut matters short by putting the letter directly in her hand i crossed the street to her side as soon as we were face to face i said how fortunate i am to meet you here is the amount you need sealed up in this letter you see i had it all ready the face she lifted to mine wore so blank a look that i paused astonished what do you mean she asked her eyes looking straight into mine with such innocence in their clear blue depths i was at once convinced she knew nothing of the matter with which my thoughts were busy i am very glad to see you but i do not in the least understand what you mean by the amount i need and she glanced at the letter i held out with an air of distrust mingled with curiosity i could not explain myself if she had been made the victim of a conspiracy to procure money from me it would not help to preserve that sweet innocence of hers to know it so with a laugh i put the letter in my pocket saying you cut me short in my efforts to do a charitable action i heard no matter how that you were interested just now in a destitute family and took this way of assisting you in their behalf her blue eyes opened wider the poor are always with us she replied but i know of no special family just now that requires any such help as you intimate if i did papa would give me what assistance i needed i was greatly pleased to hear her say this for i am very fond of my young friend but i was deeply indignant also against the unknown person who had taken advantage of my regard for this young girl to force money from me i therefore did not linger at her side but after due apologies hastened immediately here where there is a man employed who to my knowledge had once been a trusted member of the police telling him no more of the story than was necessary to insure his cooperation in the plan i had formed to discover the author of this fraud i extracted the banknotes from the letter i had written and put in their place stiff pieces of manilla paper taking the envelope so filled to the hotel already alluded to i placed it at the opening chapters of isaiah in the bible as described there was no one in either of the rooms when i went in and i encountered only a bellboy as i came out but at the door i ran against a young man whom i strictly forbore to recognize but whom i knew to be my improvised detective coming to take his stand in some place where he could watch the parlor and note who went into it at noon i returned to the hotel passed immediately to the small parlor and looked into the bible the letter was gone coming out of the room i was at once joined by my detective has the letter been taken he eagerly inquired i nodded his brows wrinkled and he looked both troubled and perplexed i dont understand it he remarked ive seen every one who has gone into that room since you left it but i do not know now any more than before who took the letter you see he continued as i looked at him sharply i had to remain out here if i had gone even into the large room the bible would not have been disturbed nor the letter either so in the hope of knowing the rogue at sight i strolled about this hall and kept my eye constantly on that door but he looked embarrassed and stopped you say the letter is gone he suggested after a moment yes i returned he shook his head nobody went into that room or came out of it he went on whom you would have wished me to follow i should have thought myself losing time if i had taken one step after any one of them but who did go into that room i urged impatient at his perplexity only three persons this morning he returned you know them all and he mentioned first mrs couldock taylor who was lending me the superficial attention of a preoccupied man smiled frankly at the utterance of this name of course she had nothing to do with such a debasing piece of business he observed of course not i repeated nor does it seem likely that miss dawes could have been concerned in it either yet my detective told me that she was the next person who went into the parlor i do not know miss dawes so well remarked taylor carelessly but i do said i and i would as soon suspect my sister of a dishonorable act as this noble selfsacrificing woman the third person suggested taylor i got up and crossed the floor when my back was to him i said quietly was mrs walworth the silence that followed was very painful i did not dare to break it and he doubtless found himself unable to do so it must have been five minutes before either of us spoke then he suddenly cried where is that detective as you call him i want to see him let me see him for you said i i should hardly wish sudley discreet as i consider him to know you had any interest in this affair taylor rose and came to where i stood you believe said he that she the woman i am about to marry is the one who wrote you that infamous letter i faced him quite frankly i do not feel ready to acknowledge that i replied one of those three women took my letter from out the bible where i placed it which of them wrote the lines that provoked it i do not dare conjecture you say it was not mrs couldock i say it was not miss dawes but he broke in upon me impetuously have you the letter he asked i had and showed it to him it is not helens handwriting he said nor is it that of mrs couldock or miss dawes he looked at me for a moment in a wild sort of way you think she got some one to write it for her he cried helen my helen but it is not so it cannot be so why huntley to have sent such a letter as that over the name of an innocent young girl who but for the happy chance of your meeting her as you did might never have had the opportunity of righting herself in your estimation argues a cold and calculating selfishness closely allied to depravity and my helen is an angel or so i have always thought her the depth to which his voice sank in the last sentence showed that for all his seeming confidence he was not without his doubts i began to feel very uncomfortable and not knowing what consolation to offer i ventured upon the suggestion that he should see mrs walworth and frankly ask her whether she had been to the hotel on main street on such a day and if so if she had seen a letter addressed to miss n lying on the table of the small parlor his answer showed how much his confidence in her had been shaken a woman who for the sake of paying some unworthy debt or of gratifying some whim of feminine vanity could make use of a young girls signature to obtain money would not hesitate at any denial she would not even blanch at my questions he was right i must be convinced in some other way he went on mrs couldock or miss dawes do not either of them possess any more truthful or ingenuous countenance than she does and though it seems madness to suspect such women wait i broke in let us be sure of all the facts before we go on you lie down here and close your eyes now pull the rug up so i will have sudley in and question him if you do not turn toward the light he will not know who you are taylor followed my suggestion and in a few moments sudley stood before me i opened upon him quite carelessly sudley said i throwing down the newspaper i had been ostensibly reading you remember that little business you did for me in main street last month something ive been reading made me think of it again yes sir have you never had a conviction yourself as to which of the three ladies you saw go into the parlor took the letter i left hid in the bible no sir you see i could not all of them are well known in society here and all of them belong to the most respectable families i wouldnt dare to choose between them sir certainly not i rejoined unless you had some good reason for doing so such as having been able to account for the visits of two of the ladies to the hotel and not of the third they all had good pretexts for being there mrs couldock gave her card to the boy before going into the parlor and left as soon as he returned with word that the lady she called to see was not in miss dawes gave no card but asked for a miss terhune i think and did not remain a moment after she was informed that that lady had left the hotel and mrs walworth she came in from the street adjusting her veil and upon looking around for a mirror was directed to the parlor into which she at once stepped she remained there but a moment and when she came out passed directly into the street these words disconcerted me the mirror was just over the table in the small room but i managed to remark nonchalantly could you not tell whether any of these ladies opened the bible not without seeming intrusive i sighed and dismissed the man when he was gone i approached taylor he can give us no assistance i cried my friend was already on his feet looking very miserable i know of but one thing to do he remarked tomorrow i shall call upon mrs couldock and miss dawes and entreat them to tell me if for any reason they undertook to deliver a letter mysteriously left in the bible of the hotel one day last month they may have been deputed to do so and be quite willing to acknowledge it and mrs walworth will you not ask her the same question he shook his head and turned away very well said i to myself then i will chapter ii accordingly the next day i called upon mrs walworth she lived as i already knew in a small and unpretentious house just on the verge of our most fashionable quarter but there was great taste displayed in the furnishing of that house and i was not at all surprised to see evidences here and there of a poverty which the general effect tended to make you forget i was fortunate enough to find her in and still more fortunate to find her alone but my courage fell as i confronted her for she has one of those appealing faces that equally interest and baffle you making you feel that unless your errand be one of peace and comfort you had better not confront so tremulous a mouth and so tender a hazel eye but i had steeled myself against too much sympathy when i entered her presence so barely pausing to make my most ingratiating bow i took her by the hand and gently forcing her to stand for a moment where the light from the one window fell full upon her face i said you must pardon my intrusion upon you at a time when you are naturally busy but there is something you can do for me that will rid me of a great anxiety you remember being in hotel one morning last month she was looking quietly up at me her lips parted her eyes smiling and expectant but at the mention of that hotel i thought and yet i may have been mistaken that a slight change took place in her expression if it was only that the glance grew more gentle and the smile more marked but her voice when she answered was the same as that with which she had uttered her greeting i do not remember she replied yet i may have been there i go to so many places why do you ask she inquired because if you were there on that morning and i have been told you were you may be able to solve a question that is greatly perplexing me still the same gentle inquiring look on her face only now there was a little furrow of wonder or interest between the eyes i had business in that hotel on that morning i continued i had left a letter for a young friend of mine in the bible that lies on the small table of the inner parlor and as she never received it i have been driven into making all kinds of inquiries in hope of finding some explanation of the fact as you were there at the time you may have seen something that would aid me is it not possible mrs walworth her smile which had faded reappeared on the lips which taylor so much admired a little pout became visible and she looked quite enchanting i do not even remember being at that hotel at all she protested did mr taylor say i was there she inquired with just that added look of exquisite naпvetй which the utterance of a lovers name should call up on the face of a prospective bride no i answered gravely mr taylor unhappily was not with you that morning she looked startled unhappily she repeated what do you mean by that word and she drew back looking very much displeased i had expected this and so was not thrown off my guard i mean i proceeded calmly that if you had had such a companion with you on that morning i should now be able to put my question to him instead of taking up your time and interrupting your affairs by my importunities she lost her look of anger and acquired one of doubt did she survey me so closely because she was anxious to know if i had compromised her in the eyes of her intended husband or was her expression merely that natural to innocence equally startled and perplexed i could not determine you will tell me just what you mean said she earnestly i was equally emphatic in my reply that is only just you ought to know why i trouble you with this matter it is because this letter of which i speak was taken from its hiding place by some one who went into the hotel parlor between the hours of half past ten and twelve and to my certain knowledge only three persons crossed its threshold on that especial morning at that especial time i naturally appeal to each of them in turn for an answer to the problem that is troubling me you know miss n seeing by accident a letter addressed to her lying in a bible in a strange hotel you might think it your duty to take it out and carry it to her if you did and if you lost it but i didnt she interrupted warmly i know nothing about any such letter and if you had not declared so positively that i was in that hotel on that especial day i should be tempted to deny that too for i have no recollection of going there last month not for the purpose of rearranging a veil that had been blown off oh she said but as one who recalls a forgotten fact not as one who is tripped up in an evasion i began to think her innocent and lost some of the gloom which had been oppressing me you remember now said i oh yes i remember that her manner so completely declared that her acknowledgments stopped there i saw it would be useless to venture further if she were innocent she could not tell more if she were guilty she would not so feeling that the inclination of my belief was in favor of the former hypothesis i again took her hand and said i see that you can give me no help i am sorry for the whole happiness of a man and perhaps that of a woman also depends upon the discovery as to who took the letter from out the bible where i had hidden it on that unfortunate morning and making her another low bow i was about to take my departure when she grasped me impulsively by the arm what man she whispered and in a lower tone still what woman i turned and looked at her great heaven thought i can such a face hide a selfish and intriguing heart and in a flash i summoned up in comparison before me the plain honest and reliable countenance of mrs couldock and that of the comely and unpretending miss dawes and knew not what to think you do not mean yourself she continued as she met my look of distress no i returned happily for me my welfare is not bound up in the honor of any woman and leaving that shaft to work its way into her heart if that heart was vulnerable i took my leave more troubled and less decided than when i entered for her manner had been absolutely that of a woman surprised by insinuations she was too innocent to rate at their real importance and yet if she did not take away that letter who did mrs couldock impossible miss dawes the thought was untenable even for an instant i waited in great depression of spirits for the call which i knew taylor would not fail to make me that evening when he came i saw what the result of my revelations was likely to be as plainly as i see it now he had conversed frankly with mrs couldock and with miss dawes and was perfectly convinced as to the utter ignorance of them both in regard to the whole affair in consequence mrs walworth was guilty in his estimation and being held guilty could be no wife for him much as he had loved her and urgent as may have been the causes for her act but said i in some horror of the consequences of an interference for which i was almost ready to blame myself now mrs couldock and miss dawes could have done no more than deny all knowledge of this letter now mrs walworth does that and you have seen her you have asked her yes i have seen her and i have asked her and not an eyelash drooped as she affirmed a complete ignorance of the whole affair taylors head fell i told you how that would be he murmured at last i cannot feel that it is any proof of her innocence or rather he added i should always have my doubts and mrs couldock and miss dawes ah he cried rising and turning away there is no question of marriage between either of them and myself i was therefore not astonished when the week went by and no announcement of his wedding appeared but i was troubled and i am troubled still for if mistakes are made in criminal courts and the innocent sometimes through the sheer force of circumstantial evidence are made to suffer for the guilty might it not be that in this letter question of morals mrs walworth has been wronged and that when i played the part of arbitrator in her fate i only succeeded in separating two hearts whose right it was to be made happy it is impossible to tell nor is time likely to solve the riddle must i then forever blame myself or did i only do in this matter what any honest man would have done in my place answer me some one for i do not find my lonely bachelor life in any wise brightened by the doubt and would be grateful to any one who would relieve me of it the end
