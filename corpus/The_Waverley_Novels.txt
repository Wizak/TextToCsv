the waverley novels advertisement sir walter scott transmitted from naples in february an introduction for castle dangerous but if he ever wrote one for a second edition of robert of paris it has not been discovered among his papers some notes chiefly extracts from the books which he had been observed to consult while dictating this novel are now appended to its pages and in addition to what the author had given in the shape of historical information respecting the principal real persons introduced the reader is here presented with what may probably amuse him the passage of the alexiad in which anna comnena describes the incident which originally no doubt determined sir walters choice of a hero may ad as for the multitude of those who advanced towards the great city let it be enough to say that they were as the stars in the heaven or as the sand upon the seashore they were in the words of homer as many as the leaves and flowers of spring but for the names of the leaders though they are present in my memory i will not relate them the numbers of these would alone deter me even if my language furnished the means of expressing their barbarous sounds and for what purpose should i afflict my readers with a long enumeration of the names of those whose visible presence gave so much horror to all that beheld them as soon therefore as they approached the great city they occupied the station appointed for them by the emperor near to the monastery of cosmidius but this multitude were not like the hellenic one of old to be restrained and governed by the loud voices of nine heralds they required the constant superintendence of chosen and valiant soldiers to keep them from violating the commands of the emperor he meantime laboured to obtain from the other leaders that acknowledgment of his supreme authority which had already been drawn from godfrey greek gontophre himself but notwithstanding the willingness of some to accede to this proposal and their assistance in working on the minds of their associates the emperors endeavours had little success as the majority were looking for the arrival of bohemund greek baimontos in whom they placed their chief confidence and resorted to every art with the view of gaining time the emperor whom it was not easy to deceive penetrated their motives and by granting to one powerful person demands which had been supposed out of all bounds of expectation and by resorting to a variety of other devices he at length prevailed and won general assent to the following of the example of godfrey who also was sent for in person to assist in this business all therefore being assembled and godfrey among them the oath was taken but when all was finished a certain noble among these counts had the audacity to seat himself on the throne of the emperor greek tolmaesas tis apo panton ton komaeton eugenaes eis ton skimpoda ton basileos ekathisen the emperor restrained himself and said nothing for he was well acquainted of old with the nature of the latins but the count baldwin greek baldoninos stepping forth and seizing him by the hand dragged him thence and with many reproaches said it becomes thee not to do such things here especially after having taken the oath of fealty greek douleian haeposchomeno it is not the custom of the roman emperors to permit any of their inferiors to sit beside them not even of such as are born subjects of their empire and it is necessary to respect the customs of the country but he answering nothing to baldwin stared yet more fixedly upon the emperor and muttered to himself something in his own dialect which being interpreted was to this effect behold what rustic fellow greek choritaes is this to be seated alone while such leaders stand around him the movement of his lips did not escape the emperor who called to him one that understood the latin dialect and enquired what words the man had spoken when he heard them the emperor said nothing to the other latins but kept the thing to himself when however the business was all over he called near to him by himself that swelling and shameless latin greek hypsaelophrona ekeinon kai anaidae and asked of him who he was of what lineage and from what region he had come i am a frank said he of pure blood of the nobles one thing i know that where three roads meet in the place from which i came there is an ancient church in which whosoever has the desire to measure himself against another in single combat prays god to help him therein and afterwards abides the coming of one willing to encounter him at that spot long time did i remain but the man bold enough to stand against me i found not hearing these words the emperor said if hitherto thou hast sought battles in vain the time is at hand which will furnish thee with abundance of them and i advise thee to place thyself neither before the phalanx nor in its rear but to stand fast in the midst of thy fellowsoldiers for of old time i am well acquainted with the warfare of the turks with such advice he dismissed not only this man but the rest of those who were about to depart on that expedition alexiad book x pp ducange as is mentioned in the novel identifies the church thus described by the crusader with that of our lady of soissons of which a french poet of the days of louis vii says veiller y vont encore li pelerin cil qui bataille veulent fere et fournir ducange in alexiad p the princess anna comnena it may be proper to observe was born on the first of december ad and was consequently in her fifteenth year when the chiefs of the first crusade made their appearance in her fathers court even then however it is not improbable that she might have been the wife of nicephorus bryennius whom many years after his death she speaks of in her history as greek ton emon kaisara and in other terms equally affectionate the bitterness with which she uniformly mentions bohemund count of tarentum afterwards prince of antioch has however been ascribed to a disappointment in love and on one remarkable occasion the princess certainly expressed great contempt of her husband i am aware of no other authorities for the liberties taken with this ladys conjugal character in the novel her husband nicephorus bryennius was the grandson of the person of that name who figures in history as the rival in a contest for the imperial throne of nicephorus botoniates he was on his marriage with anna comnena invested with the rank of panhypersebastos or omnium augustissimus but alexius deeply offended him by afterwards recognising the superior and simpler dignity of a sebastos his eminent qualities both in peace and war are acknowledged by gibbon and he has left us four books of memoirs detailing the early part of his fatherinlaws history and valuable as being the work of an eyewitness of the most important events which he describes anna comnena appears to have considered it her duty to take up the task which her husband had not lived to complete and hence the alexiad certainly with all its defects the first historical work that has as yet proceeded from a female pen the life of the emperor alexius says gibbon has been delineated by the pen of a favourite daughter who was inspired by tender regard for his person and a laudable zeal to perpetuate his virtues conscious of the just suspicion of her readers the princess repeatedly protests that besides her personal knowledge she had searched the discourses and writings of the most respectable veterans and that after an interval of thirty years forgotten by and forgetful of the world her mournful solitude was inaccessible to hope and fear that truth the naked perfect truth was more dear than the memory of her parent yet instead of the simplicity of style and narrative which wins our belief an elaborate affectation of rhetoric and science betrays in every page the vanity of a female author the genuine character of alexius is lost in a vague constellation of virtues and the perpetual strain of panegyric and apology awakens our jealousy to question the veracity of the historian and the merit of her hero we cannot however refuse her judicious and important remark that the disorders of the times were the misfortune and the glory of alexius and that every calamity which can afflict a declining empire was accumulated on his reign by the justice of heaven and the vices of his predecessors in the east the victorious turks had spread from persia to the hellespont the reign of the koran and the crescent the west was invaded by the adventurous valour of the normans and in the moments of peace the danube poured forth new swarms who had gained in the science of war what they had lost in the ferociousness of their manners the sea was not less hostile than the land and while the frontiers were assaulted by an open enemy the palace was distracted with secret conspiracy and treason on a sudden the banner of the cross was displayed by the latins europe was precipitated on asia and constantinople had almost been swept away by this impetuous deluge in the tempest alexius steered the imperial vessel with dexterity and courage at the head of his armies he was bold in action skilful in stratagem patient of fatigue ready to improve his advantages and rising from his defeats with inexhaustible vigour the discipline of the camp was reversed and a new generation of men and soldiers was created by the precepts and example of their leader in his intercourse with the latins alexius was patient and artful his discerning eye pervaded the new system of an unknown world the increase of the male and female branches of his family adorned the throne and secured the succession but their princely luxury and pride offended the patricians exhausted the revenue and insulted the misery of the people anna is a faithful witness that his happiness was destroyed and his health broken by the cares of a public life the patience of constantinople was fatigued by the length and severity of his reign and before alexius expired he had lost the love and reverence of his subjects the clergy could not forgive his application of the sacred riches to the defence of the state but they applauded his theological learning and ardent zeal for the orthodox faith which he defended with his tongue his pen and his sword even the sincerity of his moral and religious virtues was suspected by the persons who had passed their lives in his confidence in his last hours when he was pressed by his wife irene to alter the succession he raised his head and breathed a pious ejaculation on the vanity of the world the indignant reply of the empress may be inscribed as an epitaph on his tomb you die as you have lived a hypocrite it was the wish of irene to supplant the eldest of her sons in favour of her daughter the princess anna whose philosophy would not have refused the weight of a diadem but the order of male succession was asserted by the friends of their country the lawful heir drew the royal signet from the finger of his insensible or conscious father and the empire obeyed the master of the palace anna comnena was stimulated by ambition and revenge to conspire against the life of her brother and when the design was prevented by the fears or scruples of her husband she passionately exclaimed that nature had mistaken the two sexes and had endowed bryennius with the soul of a woman after the discovery of her treason the life and fortune of anna were justly forfeited to the laws her life was spared by the clemency of the emperor but he visited the pomp and treasures of her palace and bestowed the rich confiscation on the most deserving of his friends history of the decline and fall of the roman empire chap xlviii the year of annas death is

introductory address jedediah cleishbotham am to the loving reader wisheth health and prosperity it would ill become me whose name has been spread abroad by those former collections bearing this title of tales of my landlord and who have by the candid voice of a numerous crowd of readers been taught to think that i merit not the empty fame alone but also the more substantial rewards of successful pencraft it would i say ill become me to suffer this my youngest literary babe and probably at the same time the last child of mine old age to pass into the world without some such modest apology for its defects as it has been my custom to put forth on preceding occasions of the like nature the world has been sufficiently instructed of a truth that i am not individually the person to whom is to be ascribed the actual inventing or designing of the scheme upon which these tales which men have found so pleasing were originally constructed as also that neither am i the actual workman who furnished by a skilful architect with an accurate plan including elevations and directions both general and particular has from thence toiled to bring forth and complete the intended shape and proportion of each division of the edifice nevertheless i have been indisputably the man who in placing my name at the head of the undertaking have rendered myself mainly and principally responsible for its general success when a ship of war goeth forth to battle with her crew consisting of sundry foremastmen and various officers such subordinate persons are not said to gain or lose the vessel which they have

lost such a seventyfour or won that which by the united exertions of all thereto pertaining is taken from the enemy in the same manner shame and sorrow it were if i the voluntary captain and founder of these adventures after having upon three divers occasions assumed to myself the emolument and reputation thereof should now withdraw myself from the risks of failure proper to this fourth and last outgoing no i will rather address my associates in this bottom with the constant spirit of matthew priors heroine did i but purpose to embark with thee on the smooth surface of some summer sea but would forsake the waves and make the shore when the winds whistle and the billows roar as little nevertheless would it become my years and station not to admit without cavil certain errors which may justly be pointed out in these concluding tales of my landlord the last and it is manifest never carefully revised or corrected handiwork of mr peter pattison now no more the same worthy young man so repeatedly mentioned in these introductory essays and never without that tribute to his good sense and talents nay even genius which his contributions to this my undertaking fairly entitled him to claim at the hands of his surviving friend and patron these pages i have said were the ultimus labor of mine ingenious assistant but i say not as the great dr pitcairn of his hero ultimus atque optitmis alas even the giddiness attendant on a journey on this manchester railroad is not so perilous to the nerves as that too frequent exercise in the merrygo round of the ideal world whereof the tendency to render the fancy confused and the judgment inert hath in all ages been noted not only by the erudite of the earth but even by many of the thickwitted ofelli themselves whether the rapid pace at which the fancy moveth in such exercitations where the wish of the penman is to him like prince houssains tapestry in the eastern fable be the chief source of peril or whether without reference to this wearing speed of movement and dwelling habitually in those realms of imagination be as little suited for a mans intellect as to breathe for any considerable space the difficult air of the mountain top is to the physical structure of his outward frame this question belongeth not to me but certain it is that we often discover in the works of the foremost of this order of men marks of bewilderment and confusion such as do not so frequently occur in those of persons to whom nature hath conceded fancy weaker of wing or less ambitious in flight it is affecting to see the great miguel cervantes himself even like the sons of meaner men defending himself against the critics of the day who assailed him upon such little discrepancies and inaccuracies as are apt to cloud the progress even of a mind like his when the evening is closing around it it is quite a common thing says don quixote for men who have gained a very great reputation by their writings before they were printed quite to lose it afterwards or at least the greater part the reason is plain answers the bachelor carrasco their faults are more easily discovered after the books are printed as being then more read and more narrowly examined especially if the author has been much cried up before for then the severity of the scrutiny is sure to be the greater those who have raised themselves a name by their own ingenuity great poets and celebrated historians are commonly if not always envied by a set of men who delight in censuring the writings of others though they could never produce any of their own that is no wonder quoth don quixote there are many divines that would make but very dull preachers and yet are quick enough at finding faults and superfluities in other mens sermons all this is true says carrasco and therefore i could wish such censurers would be more merciful and less scrupulous and not dwell ungenerously upon small spots that are in a manner but so many atoms on the face of the clear sun they murmur at if aliquando dormitat homerus let them consider how many nights he kept himself awake to bring his noble works to light as little darkened with defects as might be but indeed it may many times happen that what is censured for a fault is rather an ornament as moles often add to the beauty of a face when all is said he that publishes a book runs a great risk since nothing can be so unlikely as that he should have composed one capable of securing the approbation of every reader sure says don quixote that which treats of me can have pleased but few quite the contrary says carrasco for as infinitus est numerus stultorum so an infinite number have admired your history only some there are who have taxed the author with want of memory or sincerity because he forgot to give an account who it was that stole sanchos dapple for that particular is not mentioned there only we find by the story that it was stolen and yet by and by we find him riding the same ass again without any previous light given us into the matter then they say that the author forgot to tell the reader what sancho did with the hundred pieces of gold he found in the portmanteau in the sierra morena for there is not a word said of them more and many people have a great mind to know what he did with them and how he spent them which is one of the most material points in which the work is defective how amusingly sancho is made to clear up the obscurities thus alluded to by the bachelor carrasco no reader can have forgotten but there remained enough of similar lacunas inadvertencies and mistakes to exercise the ingenuity of those spanish critics who were too wise in their own conceit to profit by the goodnatured and modest apology of this immortal author there can be no doubt that if cervantes had deigned to use it he might have pleaded also the apology of indifferent health under which he certainly laboured while finishing the second part of don quixote it must be too obvious that the intervals of such a malady as then affected cervantes could not be the most favourable in the world for revising lighter compositions and correcting at least those grosser errors and imperfections which each author should if it were but for shames sake remove from his work before bringing it forth into the broad light of day where they will never fail to be distinctly seen nor lack ingenious persons who will be too happy in discharging the office of pointing them out it is more than time to explain with what purpose we have called thus fully to memory the many venial errors of the inimitable cervantes and those passages in which he has rather defied his adversaries than pleaded his own justification for i suppose it will be readily granted that the difference is too wide betwixt that great wit of spain and ourselves to permit us to use a buckler which was rendered sufficiently formidable only by the strenuous hand in which it was placed the history of my first publications is sufficiently well known nor did i relinquish the purpose of concluding these tales of my landlord which had been so remarkably fortunate but death which steals upon us all with an inaudible foot cut short the ingenious young man to whose memory i composed that inscription and erected at my own charge that monument which protects his remains by the side of the river gander which he has contributed so much to render immortal and in a place of his own selection not very distant from the school under my care footnote see vol ii of the present edition for some circumstances attending this erection in a word the ingenious mr pattison was removed from his place nor did i confine my care to his posthumous fame alone but carefully inventoried and preserved the effects which he left behind him namely the contents of his small wardrobe and a number of printed books of somewhat more consequence together with certain wofully blurred manuscripts discovered in his repository on looking these over i found them to contain two tales called count robert of paris and castle dangerous but was seriously disappointed to perceive that they were by no means in that state of correctness which would induce an experienced person to pronounce any writing in the technical language of bookcraft prepared for press there were not only hiatus valde deflendi but even grievous inconsistencies and other mistakes which the penmans leisurely revision had he been spared to bestow it would doubtless have cleared away after a considerate perusal i no question flattered myself that these manuscripts with all their faults contained here and there passages which seemed plainly to intimate that severe indisposition had been unable to extinguish altogether the brilliancy of that fancy which the world had been pleased to acknowledge in the creations of old mortality the bride of lammermoor and others of these narratives but i nevertheless threw the manuscripts into my drawer resolving not to think of committing them to the ballantynian ordeal until i could either obtain the assistance of some capable person to supply deficiencies and correct errors so as they might face the public with credit or perhaps numerous and more serious avocations might permit me to dedicate my own time and labour to that task while i was in this uncertainty i had a visit from a stranger who was announced as a young gentleman desirous of speaking with me on particular business i immediately augured the accession of a new boarder but was at once checked by observing that the outward man of the stranger was in a most remarkable degree what mine host of the sir william wallace in his phraseology calls seedy his black cloak had seen service the waistcoat of grey plaid bore yet stronger marks of having encountered more than one campaign his third piece of dress was an absolute veteran compared to the others his shoes were so loaded with mud as showed his journey must have been pedestrian and a grey maud which fluttered around his wasted limbs completed such an equipment as since juvenals days has been the livery of the poor scholar i therefore concluded that i beheld a candidate for the vacant office of usher and prepared to listen to his proposals with the dignity becoming my station but what was my surprise when i found i had before me in this rusty student no less a man than paul the brother of peter pattison come to gather in his brothers succession and possessed it seemed with no small idea of the value of that part of it which consisted in the productions of his pen by the rapid study i made of him this paul was a sharp lad imbued with some tincture of letters like his regretted brother but totally destitute of those amiable qualities which had often induced me to say within myself that peter was like the famous john gay in wit a man simplicity a child he set little by the legacy of my deceased assistants wardrobe nor did the books hold much greater value in his eyes but he peremptorily demanded to be put in possession of the manuscripts alleging with obstinacy that no definite bargain had been completed between his late brother and me and at length produced the opinion to that effect of a writer or man of business a class of persons with whom i have always chosen to have as little concern as possible but i had one defence left which came to my aid tanquam deus ex machina this rapacious paul pattison could not pretend to wrest the disputed manuscripts out of my possession unless upon repayment of a considerable sum of money which i had advanced from time to time to the deceased peter and particularly to purchase a small annuity for his aged mother these advances with the charges of the funeral and other expenses amounted to a considerable sum which the poverty struck student and his acute legal adviser equally foresaw great difficulty in liquidating the said mr paul pattison therefore listened to a suggestion which i dropped as if by accident that if he thought himself capable of filling his brothers place of carrying the work through the press i would make him welcome to bed and board within my mansion while he was thus engaged only requiring his occasional assistance at hearing the more advanced scholars this seemed to promise a close of our dispute alike satisfactory to all parties and the first act of paul was to draw on me for a round sum under pretence that his wardrobe must be wholly refitted to this i made no objection though it certainly showed like vanity to purchase garments in the extremity of the mode when not only great part of the defuncts habiliments were very fit for a twelvemonths use but as i myself had been but yesterday as it were equipped in a becoming new stand of black clothes mr pattison would have been welcome to the use of such of my quondam raiment as he thought suitable as indeed had always been the case with his deceased brother the school i must needs say came tolerably on my youngster was very smart and seemed to be so active in his duty of usher if i may so speak that he even overdid his part therein and i began to feel myself a cipher in my own school i comforted myself with the belief that the publication was advancing as fast as i could desire on this subject paul pattison like ancient pistol talked bold words at the bridge and that not only at our house but in the society of our neighbours amongst whom instead of imitating the retired and monastic manner of his brother deceased he became a gay visitor and such a reveller that in process of time he was observed to vilipend the modest fare which had at first been esteemed a banquet by his hungry appetite and thereby highly displeased my wife who with justice applauds herself for the plentiful cleanly and healthy victuals wherewith she maintains her ushers and boarders upon the whole i rather hoped than entertained a sincere confidence that all was going on well and was in that unpleasant state of mind which precedes the open breach between two associates who have been long jealous of each other but are as yet deterred by a sense of mutual interest from coming to an open rupture the first thing which alarmed me was a rumour in the village that paul pattison intended in some little space to undertake a voyage to the continent on account of his health as was pretended but as the same report averred much more with the view of gratifying the curiosity which his perusal of the classics had impressed upon him than for any other purpose i was i say rather alarmed at this susurrus and began to reflect that the retirement of mr pattison unless his loss could be supplied in good time was like to be a blow to the establishment for in truth this paul had a winning way with the boys especially those who were gentletempered so that i must confess my doubts whether in certain respects i myself could have fully supplied his place in the school with all my authority and experience my wife jealous as became her station of mr pattisons intentions advised me to take the matter up immediately and go to the bottom at once and indeed i had always found that way answered best with my boys mrs cleishbotham was not long before renewing the subject for like most of the race of xantippe though my helpmate is a wellspoken woman she loves to thrust in her oar where she is not able to pull it to purpose you are a sharpwitted man mr cleishbotham would she observe and a learned man mr cleishbotham and the schoolmaster of gandercleuch mr cleishbotham which is saying all in one word but many a man almost as great as yourself has lost the saddle by suffering an inferior to get up behind him and though with the world mr cleishbotham you have the name of doing every thing both in directing the school and in this new profitable book line which you have taken up yet it begins to be the common talk of gandercleuch both up the water and down the water that the usher both writes the dominies books and teaches the dominies school ay ay ask maid wife or widow and shell tell ye the least gaitling among them all comes to paul pattison with his lesson as naturally as they come to me for their fourhours puir things and never ane things of applying to you aboot a kittle turn or a crabbed word or about ony thing else unless it were for licet exire or the mending of an auld pen now this address assailed me on a summer evening when i was whiling away my leisure hours with the end of a cutty pipe and indulging in such bland imaginations as the nicotian weed is wont to produce more especially in the case of the studious persons devoted musis severioribus i was naturally loth to leave my misty sanctuary and endeavoured to silence the clamour of mrs cleishbothams tongue which has something in it peculiarly shrill and penetrating woman said i with a tone of domestic authority befitting the occasion res tuas agas mind your washings and your wringings your stuffings and your physicking or whatever concerns the outward persons of the pupils and leave the progress of their education to my usher paul pattison and myself i am glad to see added the accursed woman that i should say so that ye have the grace to name him foremost for there is little doubt that he ranks first of the troop if ye wad but hear what the neighbours speak or whisper what do they whisper thou sworn sister of the eumenides cried i the irritating aestrum of the womans objurgation totally counterbalancing the sedative effects both of pipe and pot whisper resumed she in her shrillest note why they whisper loud enough for me at least to hear them that the schoolmaster of gandercleuch is turned a doited auld woman and spends all his time in tippling strong drink with the keeper of the publichouse and leaves school and bookmaking and a the rost ot to the care of his usher and also the wives in gandercleuch say that you have engaged paul pattison to write a new book which is to beat a the lave that gaed afore it and to show what a sair lift you have o the job you didna sae muckle as ken the name ot no nor whether it was to be about some heathen greek or the black douglas this was said with such bitterness that it penetrated to the very quick and i hurled the poor old pipe like one of homers spears not in the face of my provoking helpmate though the temptation was strong but into the river gander which as is now well known to tourists from the uttermost parts of the earth pursues its quiet meanders beneath the bank on which the schoolhouse is pleasantly situated and starting up fixed on my head the cocked hat the pride of messrs grieve and scotts repository and plunging into the valley of the brook pursued my way upwards the voice of mrs cleishbotham accompanying me in my retreat with something like the angry scream of triumph with which the broodgoose pursues the flight of some unmannerly cur or idle boy who has intruded upon her premises and fled before her indeed so great was the influence of this clamour of scorn and wrath which hung upon my rear that while it rung in my ears i was so moved that i instinctively tucked the skirts of my black coat under my arm as if i had been in actual danger of being seized on by the grasp of the pursuing enemy nor was it till i had almost reached the wellknown burialplace in which it was peter pattisons hap to meet the farfamed personage called old mortality that i made a halt for the purpose of composing my perturbed spirits and considering what was to be done for as yet my mind was agitated by a chaos of passions of which anger was predominant and for what reason or against whom i entertained such tumultuous displeasure it was not easy for me to determine nevertheless having settled my cocked hat with becoming accuracy on my wellpowdered wig and suffered it to remain uplifted for a moment to cool my flushed brow having moreover readjusted and shaken to rights the skirts of my black coat i came into case to answer to my own questions which till these manoeuvres had been sedately accomplished i might have asked myself in vain in the first place therefore to use the phrase of mr docket the writer that is the attorney of our village of gandercleuch i became satisfied that my anger was directed against all and sundry or in law latin contre omnes mortales and more particularly against the neighbourhood of gandercleuch for circulating reports to the prejudice of my literary talents as well as my accomplishments as a pedagogue and transferring the fame thereof to mine own usher secondly against my spouse dorothea cleishbotham for transferring the sad calumnious reports to my ears in a prerupt and unseemly manner and without due respect either to the language which she made use of or the person to whom she spoke treating affairs in which i was so intimately concerned as if they were proper subjects for jest among gossips at a christening where the womankind claim the privilege of worshipping the bona dea according to their secret female rites thirdly i became clear that i was entitled to respond to any whom it concerned to enquire that my wrath was kindled against paul pattison my usher for giving occasion both for the neighbours of gandercleuch entertaining such opinions and for mrs cleishbotham disrespectfully urging them to my face since neither circumstance could have existed without he had put forth sinful misrepresentations of transactions private and confidential and of which i had myself entirely refrained from dropping any the least hint to any third person this arrangement of my ideas having contributed to soothe the stormy atmosphere of which they had been the offspring gave reason a time to predominate and to ask me with her calm but clear voice whether under all the circumstances i did well to nourish so indiscriminate an indignation in fine on closer examination the various splenetic thoughts i had been indulging against other parties began to be merged in that resentment against my perfidious usher which like the serpent of moses swallowed up all subordinate objects of displeasure to put myself at open feud with the whole of my neighbours unless i had been certain of some effectual mode of avenging myself upon them would have been an undertaking too weighty for my means and not unlikely if rashly grappled withal to end in my ruin to make a public quarrel with my wife on such an account as her opinion of my literary accomplishments would sound ridiculous and besides mrs c was sure to have all the women on her side who would represent her as a wife persecuted by her husband for offering him good advice and urging it upon him with only too enthusiastic sincerity there remained paul pattison undoubtedly the most natural and proper object of my indignation since i might be said to have him in my own power and might punish him by dismissal at my pleasure yet even vindictive proceedings against the said paul however easy to be enforced might be productive of serious consequences to my own purse and i began to reflect with anxiety that in this world it is not often that the gratification of our angry passions lies in the same road with the advancement of our interest and that the wise man the vere sapiens seldom hesitates which of these two he ought to prefer i recollected also that i was quite uncertain how far the present usher had really been guilty of the foul acts of assumption charged against him in a word i began to perceive that it would be no light matter at once and without maturer perpending of sundry collateral punctiuncula to break up a jointstock adventure or society as civilians term it which if profitable to him had at least promised to be no less so to me established in years and learning and reputation so much his superior moved by which and other the like considerations i resolved to proceed with becoming caution on the occasion and not by stating my causes of complaint too hastily in the outset exasperate into a positive breach what might only prove some small misunderstanding easily explained or apologized for and which like a leak in a new vessel being once discovered and carefully stopped renders the vessel but more seaworthy than it was before about the time that i had adopted this healing resolution i reached the spot where the almost perpendicular face of a steep hill seems to terminate the valley or at least divides it into two dells each serving as a cradle to its own mountainstream the gruffquack namely and the shallower but more noisy gusedub on the left hand which at their union form the gander properly so called each of these little valleys has a walk winding up to its recesses rendered more easy by the labours of the poor during the late hard season and one of which bears the name of pattisons path while the other had been kindly consecrated to my own memory by the title of the dominies daidling bit here i made certain to meet my associate paul pattison for by one or other of these roads he was wont to return to my house of an evening after his lengthened rambles nor was it long before i espied him descending the gusedub by that tortuous path marking so strongly the character of a scottish glen he was easily distinguished indeed at some distance by his jaunty swagger in which he presented to you the flat of his leg like the manly knave of clubs apparently with the most perfect contentment not only with his leg and boot but with every part of his outward man and the whole fashion of his garments and one would almost have thought the contents of his pockets in this his wonted guise he approached me where i was seated near the meeting of the waters and i could not but discern that his first impulse was to pass me without any prolonged or formal greeting but as that would not have been decent considering the terms on which we stood he seemed to adopt on reflection a course directly opposite bustled up to me with an air of alacrity and i may add impudence and hastened at once into the middle of the important affairs which it had been my purpose to bring under discussion in a manner more becoming their gravity i am glad to see you mr cleishbotham said he with an inimitable mixture of confusion and effrontery the most wonderful news which has been heard in the literary world in my time all gandercleuch rings with it they positively speak of nothing else from miss buskbodys youngest apprentice to the minister himself and ask each other in amazement whether the tidings are true or false to be sure they are of an astounding complexion especially to you and me mr pattison said i i am quite at a loss to guess at your meaning

cleishbotham schoolmaster of the parish of gandercleuch and so forth all i have to inform you is that our hopeful scheme is entirely blown up the tales on publishing which we reckoned with so much confidence have already been printed they are abroad over all america and the british papers are clamorous i received this news with the same equanimity with which i should have accepted a blow addressed to my stomach by a modern gladiator with the full energy of his fist if this be correct information mr pattison said i i must of necessity suspect you to be the person who have supplied the foreign press with the copy which the printers have thus made an unscrupulous use of without respect to the rights of the undeniable proprietors of the manuscripts and i request to know whether this american production embraces the alterations which you as well as i judged necessary before the work could be fitted to meet the public eye to this my gentleman saw it necessary to make a direct answer for my manner was impressive and my tone decisive his native audacity enabled him however to keep his ground and he answered with firmness mr cleishbotham in the first place these manuscripts over which you claim a very doubtful right were never given to any one by me and must have been sent to america either by yourself or by some one of the various gentlemen to whom i am well aware you have afforded opportunities of perusing my brothers ms remains mr pattison i replied i beg to remind you that it never could be my intention either by my own hands or through those of another to remit these manuscripts to the press until by the alterations which i meditated and which you yourself engaged to make they were rendered fit for public perusal mr pattison answered me with much heat sir i would have you to know that if i accepted your paltry offer it was with less regard to its amount than to the honour and literary fame of my late brother i foresaw that if i declined it you would not hesitate to throw the task into incapable hands or perhaps have taken it upon yourself the most unfit of all men to tamper with the works of departed genius and that god willing i was determined to prevent but the justice of heaven has taken the matter into its own hands peter pattisons last labours shall now go down to posterity unscathed by the scalpingknife of alteration in the hands of a false friend shame on the thought that the unnatural weapon could ever be wielded by the hand of a brother i heard this speech not without a species of vertigo or dizziness in my head which would probably have struck me lifeless at his feet had not a thought like that of the old ballad earl percy sees my fall called to my recollection that i should only afford an additional triumph by giving way to my feelings in the presence of mr paul pattison who i could not doubt must be more or less directly at the bottom of the transatlantic publication and had in one way or another found his own interest in that nefarious transaction to get quit of his odious presence i bid him an unceremonious good night and marched down the glen with the air not of one who has parted with a friend but who rather has shaken off an intrusive companion on the road i pondered the whole matter over with an anxiety which did not in the smallest degree tend to relieve me had i felt adequate to the exertion i might of course have supplanted this spurious edition of which the literary gazettes are already doling out copious specimens by introducing into a copy to be instantly published at edinburgh adequate correction of the various inconsistencies and imperfections which have already been alluded to i remember the easy victory of the real second part of these tales of my landlord over the performance sent forth by an interloper under the same title and why should not the same triumph be repeated now there would in short have been a pride of talent in this manner of avenging myself which would have been justifiable in the case of an injured man but the state of my health has for some time been such as to render any attempt of this nature in every way imprudent under such circumstances the last remains of peter pattison must even be accepted as they were left in his desk and i humbly retire in the hope that such as they are they may receive the indulgence of those who have ever been but too merciful to the productions of his pen and in all respects to the courteous readers obliged servant j c gandercleuch th oct count robert of paris chapter the first leontius that power that kindly

taken from an aged tree it possesses indeed in exterior form the appearance of a youthful shoot but has in fact attained to the same state of maturity or even decay which has been reached by the parent stem hence it is said arises the general decline and death that about the same season is often observed to spread itself through individual trees of some particular species all of which deriving their vital powers from the parent stock are therefore incapable of protracting their existence longer than it does in the same manner efforts have been made by the mighty of the earth to transplant large cities states and communities by one great and sudden exertion expecting to secure to the new capital the wealth the dignity the magnificent decorations and unlimited extent of the ancient city which they desire to renovate while at the same time they hope to begin a new succession of ages from the date of the new structure to last they imagine as long and with as much fame as its predecessor which the founder hopes his new metropolis may replace in all its youthful glories but nature has her laws which seem to apply to the social as well as the vegetable system it appears to be a general rule that what is to last long should be slowly matured and gradually improved while every sudden effort however gigantic to bring about the speedy execution of a plan calculated to endure for ages is doomed to exhibit symptoms of premature decay from its very commencement thus in a beautiful oriental tale a dervise explains to the sultan how he had reared the magnificent trees among which they walked by nursing their shoots from the seed and the princes pride is damped when he reflects that those plantations so simply raised were gathering new vigour from each returning sun while his own exhausted cedars which had been transplanted by one violent effort were drooping their majestic heads in the valley of orez footnote tale of mirglip the persian in the tales of the genii it has been allowed i believe by all men of taste many of whom have been late visitants of constantinople that if it were possible to survey the whole globe with a view to fixing a seat of universal empire all who are capable of making such a choice would give their preference to the city of constantine as including the great recommendations of beauty wealth security and eminence yet with all these advantages of situation and climate and with all the architectural splendour of its churches and halls its quarries of marble and its treasurehouses of gold the imperial founder must himself have learned that although he could employ all these rich materials in obedience to his own wish it was the mind of man itself those intellectual faculties refined by the ancients to the highest degree which had produced the specimens of talent at which men paused and wondered whether as subjects of art or of moral labour the power of the emperor might indeed strip other cities of their statues and their shrines in order to decorate that which he had fixed upon as his new capital but the men who had performed great actions and those almost equally esteemed by whom such deeds were celebrated in poetry in painting and in music had ceased to exist the nation though still the most civilised in the world had passed beyond that period of society when the desire of fair fame is of itself the sole or chief motive for the labour of the historian or the poet the painter or the statuary the slavish and despotic constitution introduced into the empire had long since entirely destroyed that public spirit which animated the free history of rome leaving nothing but feeble recollections which produced no emulation to speak as of an animated substance if constantine could have regenerated his new metropolis by transfusing into it the vital and vivifying principles of old rome that brilliant spark no longer remained for constantinople to borrow or for rome to lend in one most important circumstance the state of the capital of constantine had been totally changed and unspeakably to its advantage the world was now christian and with the pagan code had got rid of its load of disgraceful superstition nor is there the least doubt that the better faith produced its natural and desirable fruits in society in gradually ameliorating the hearts and taming the passions of the people but while many of the converts were turning meekly towards their new creed some in the arrogance of their understanding were limiting the scriptures by their own devices and others failed not to make religious character or spiritual rank the means of rising to temporal power thus it happened at this critical period that the effects of this great change in the religion of the country although producing an immediate harvest as well as sowing much good seed which was to grow hereafter did not in the fourth century flourish so as to shed at once that predominating influence which its principles might have taught men to expect even the borrowed splendour in which constantine decked his city bore in it something which seemed to mark premature decay the imperial founder in seizing upon the ancient statues pictures obelisks and works of art acknowledged his own incapacity to supply their place with the productions of later genius and when the world and particularly rome was plundered to adorn constantinople the emperor under whom the work was carried on might be compared to a prodigal youth who strips an aged parent of her youthful ornaments in order to decorate a flaunting paramour on whose brow all must consider them as misplaced constantinople therefore when in it first arose in imperial majesty out of the humble byzantium showed even in its birth and amid its adventitious splendour as we have already said some intimations of that speedy decay to which the whole civilised world then limited within the roman empire was internally and imperceptibly tending nor was it many ages ere these prognostications of declension were fully verified in the year alexius comnenus footnote see gibbon chap xlviii for the origin and early history of the house of the comneni ascended the throne of the empire that is he was declared sovereign of constantinople its precincts and dependencies nor if he was disposed to lead a life of relaxation would the savage incursions of the scythians or the hungarians frequently disturb the imperial slumbers if limited to his own capital it may be supposed that this safety did not extend much farther for it is said that the empress pulcheria had built a church to the virgin mary as remote as possible from the gate of the city to save her devotions from the risk of being interrupted by the hostile yell of the barbarians and the reigning emperor had constructed a palace near the same spot and for the same reason alexius comnenus was in the condition of a monarch who rather derives consequence from the wealth and importance of his predecessors and the great extent of their original dominions than from what remnants of fortune had descended to the present generation this emperor except nominally no more ruled over his dismembered provinces than a half dead horse can exercise power over those limbs on which the hooded crow and the vulture have already begun to settle and select their prey in different parts of his territory different enemies arose who waged successful or dubious war against the emperor and of the numerous nations with whom he was engaged in hostilities whether the franks from the west the turks advancing from the east the cumans and scythians pouring their barbarous numbers and unceasing storm of arrows from the north and the saracens or the tribes into which they were divided pressing from the south there was not one for whom the grecian empire did not spread a tempting repast each of these various enemies had their own particular habits of war and a way of manoeuvring in battle peculiar to themselves but the roman as the unfortunate subject of the greek empire was still called was by far the weakest the most ignorant and most timid who could be dragged into the field and the emperor was happy in his own good luck when he found it possible to conduct a defensive war on a counterbalancing principle making use of the scythian to repel the turk or of both these savage people to drive back the fieryfooted frank whom peter the hermit had in the time of alexius waked to double fury by the powerful influence of the crusades if therefore alexius comnenus was during his anxious seat upon the throne of the east reduced to use a base and truckling course of policy if he was sometimes reluctant to fight when he had a conscious doubt of the valour of his troops if he commonly employed cunning and dissimulation instead of wisdom and perfidy instead of courage his expedients were the disgrace of the age rather than his own again the emperor alexius may be blamed for affecting a degree of state which was closely allied to imbecility he was proud of assuming in his own person and of bestowing upon others the painted show of various orders of nobility even now when the rank within the princes gift was become an additional reason for the free barbarian despising the imperial noble that the greek court was encumbered with unmeaning ceremonies in order to make amends for the want of that veneration which ought to have been called forth by real worth and the presence of actual power was not the particular fault of that prince but belonged to the system of the government of constantinople for ages indeed in its trumpery etiquette which provided rules for the most trivial points of a mans behaviour during the day the greek empire resembled no existing power in its minute follies except that of pekin both doubtless being influenced by the same vain wish to add seriousness and an appearance of importance to objects which from their trivial nature could admit no such distinction yet thus far we must justify alexius that humble as were the expedients he had recourse to they were more useful to his empire than the measures of a more proud and highspirited prince might have proved in the same circumstances he was no champion to break a lance against the breastplate of his frankish rival the famous bohemond of antioch footnote bohemond son of robert guiscard the norman conqueror of apulia calabria and sicily was at the time when the first crusade began count of tarentum though far advanced in life he eagerly joined the expedition of the latins and became prince of antioch for details of his adventures death and extraordinary character see gibbon chap lix and mills history of the crusades vol i but there were many occasions on which he hazarded his life freely and so far as we can see from a minute perusal of his achievements the emperor of greece was never so dangerous under shield as when any foeman desired to stop him while retreating from a conflict in which he had been worsted but besides that he did not hesitate according to the custom of the time at least occasionally to commit his person to the perils of close combat alexius also possessed such knowledge of a generals profession as is required in our modern days he knew how to occupy military positions to the best advantage and often covered defeats or improved dubious conflicts in a manner highly to the disappointment of those who deemed that the work of war was done only on the field of battle if alexius comnenus thus understood the evolutions of war he was still better skilled in those of politics where soaring far above the express purpose of his immediate negotiation the emperor was sure to gain some important and permanent advantage though very often he was ultimately defeated by the unblushing fickleness or avowed treachery of the barbarians as the greeks generally termed all other nations and particularly those tribes they can hardly be termed states by which their own empire was surrounded we may conclude our brief character of comnenus by saying that had he not been called on to fill the station of a monarch who was under the necessity of making himself dreaded as one who was exposed to all manner of conspiracies both in and out of his own family he might in all probability have been regarded as an honest and humane prince certainly he showed himself a goodnatured man and dealt less in cutting off heads and extinguishing eyes than had been the practice of his predecessors who generally took this method of shortening the ambitious views of competitors it remains to be mentioned that alexius had his full share of the superstition of the age which he covered with a species of hypocrisy it is even said that his wife irene who of course was best acquainted with the real character of the emperor taxed her dying husband with practising in his last moments the dissimulation which had been his companion during life footnote see gibbon chap lvi he took also a deep interest in all matters respecting the church where heresy which the emperor held or affected to hold in great horror appeared to him to lurk nor do we discover in his treatment of the manichaeans or paulicians that pity for their speculative errors which modern times might think had been well purchased by the extent of the temporal services of these unfortunate sectaries alexius knew no indulgence for those who misinterpreted the mysteries of the church or of its doctrines and the duty of defending religion against schismatics was in his opinion as peremptorily demanded from him as that of protecting the empire against the numberless tribes of barbarians who were encroaching on its boundaries on every side such a mixture of sense and weakness of meanness and dignity of prudent discretion and poverty of spirit which last in the european mode of viewing things approached to cowardice formed the leading traits of the character of alexius comnenus at a period when the fate of greece and all that was left in that country of art and civilization was trembling in the balance and likely to be saved or lost according to the abilities of the emperor for playing the very difficult game which was put into his hands these few leading circumstances will recall to any one who is tolerably well read in history the peculiarities of the period at which we have found a restingplace for the foundation of our story chapter the second othus this superb successor of the earths mistress as thou vainly speakest stands midst these ages as on the wide ocean the last spared fragment of a spacious land that in some grand and awful ministration of mighty nature has engulfed been doth lift aloft its dark and rocky cliffs oer the wild waste around and sadly frowns in lonely majesty constantine paleologus scene i our scene in the capital of the eastern empire opens at what is termed the golden gate of constantinople and it may be said in passing that this splendid epithet is not so lightly bestowed as may be expected from the inflated language of the greeks which throws such an appearance of exaggeration about them their buildings and monuments the massive and seemingly impregnable walls with which constantine surrounded the city were greatly improved and added to by theodosius called the great a triumphal arch decorated with the architecture of a better though already a degenerate age and serving at the same time as a useful entrance introduced the stranger into the city on the top a statue of bronze represented victory the goddess who had inclined the scales of battle in favour of theodosius and as the artist determined to be wealthy if he could not be tasteful the gilded ornaments with which the inscriptions were set off readily led to the popular name of the gate figures carved in a distant and happier period of the art glanced from the walls without assorting happily with the taste in which these were built the more modern ornaments of the golden gate bore at the period of our story an aspect very different from those indicating the conquest brought back to the city and the eternal peace which the flattering inscriptions recorded as having been extorted by the sword of theodosius four or five military engines for throwing darts of the largest size were placed upon the summit of the arch and what had been originally designed as a specimen of architectural embellishment was now applied to the purposes of defence it was the hour of evening and the cool and refreshing breeze from the sea inclined each passenger whose business was not of a very urgent description to loiter on his way and cast a glance at the romantic gateway and the various interesting objects of nature and art which the city of constantinople presented as well to the inhabitants as to strangers footnote the impression which the imperial city was calculated to make on such visitors as the crusaders of the west is given by the ancient french chronicler villehardouin who was present at the capture of a d when we had come he says within three leagues to a certain abbey then we could plainly survey constantinople there the ships and the galleys came to anchor and much did they who had never been in that quarter before gaze upon the city that such a city could be in the world they had never conceived and they were never weary of staring at the high walls and towers with which it was entirely encompassed the rich palaces and lofty churches of which there were so many that no one could have believed it if he had not seen with his own eyes that city the queen of all cities and know that there was not so bold a heart there that it did not feel some terror at the strength of constantinople chap again and now many of those of the host went to see constantinople within and the rich palaces and stately churches of which it possesses so many and the riches of the place which are such as no other city ever equalled i need not speak of the sanctuaries which are as many as are in all the world beside chap one individual however seemed to indulge more wonder and curiosity than could have been expected from a native of the city and looked upon the rarities around with a quick and startled eye that marked an imagination awakened by sights that were new and strange the appearance of this person bespoke a foreigner of military habits who seemed from his complexion to have his birthplace far from the grecian metropolis whatever chance had at present brought him to the golden gate or whatever place he filled in the emperors service this young man was about twoandtwenty years old remarkably finely formed and athletic qualities well understood by the citizens of constantinople whose habits of frequenting the public games had taught them at least an acquaintance with the human person and where in the select of their own countrymen they saw the handsomest specimens of the human race these were however not generally so tall as the stranger at the golden gate while his piercing blue eyes and the fair hair which descended from under a light helmet gaily ornamented with silver bearing on its summit a crest resembling a dragon in the act of expanding his terrible jaws intimated a northern descent to which the extreme purity of his complexion also bore witness his beauty however though he was eminently distinguished both in features and in person was not liable to the charge of effeminacy from this it was rescued both by his strength and by the air of confidence and selfpossession with which the youth seemed to regard the wonders around him not indicating the stupid and helpless gaze of a mind equally inexperienced and incapable of receiving instruction but expressing the bold intellect which at once understands the greater part of the information which it receives and commands the spirit to toil in search of the meaning of that which it has not comprehended or may fear it has misinterpreted this look of awakened attention and intelligence gave interest to the young barbarian and while the bystanders were amazed that a savage from some unknown or remote corner of the universe should possess a noble countenance bespeaking a mind so elevated they respected him for the composure with which he witnessed so many things the fashion the splendour nay the very use of which must have been recently new to him the young mans personal equipments exhibited a singular mixture of splendour and effeminacy and enabled the experienced spectators to ascertain his nation and the capacity in which he served we have already mentioned the fanciful and crested helmet which was a distinction of the foreigner to which the reader must add in his imagination a small cuirass or breastplate of silver so sparingly fashioned as obviously to afford little security to the broad chest on which it rather hung like an ornament than covered as a buckler nor if a wellthrown dart or stronglyshod arrow should alight full on this rich piece of armour was there much hope that it could protect the bosom which it partially shielded from betwixt the shoulders hung down over the back what had the appearance of a bearskin but when more closely examined it was only a very skilful imitation of the spoils of the chase being in reality a surcoat composed of strong shaggy silk so woven as to exhibit at a little distance no inaccurate representation of a bears hide a light crooked sword or scimitar sheathed in a scabbard of gold and ivory hung by the left side of the stranger the ornamented hilt of which appeared much too small for the largejointed hand of the young hercules who was thus gaily attired a dress purple in colour and setting close to the limbs covered the body of the soldier to a little above the knee from thence the knees and legs were bare to the calf to which the reticulated strings of the sandals rose from the instep the ligatures being there fixed by a golden coin of the reigning emperor converted into a species of clasp for the purpose but a weapon which seemed more particularly adapted to the young barbarians size and incapable of being used by a man of less formidable limbs and sinews was a battleaxe the firm ironguarded staff of which was formed of tough elm strongly inlaid and defended with brass while many a plate and ring were indented in the handle to hold the wood and the steel parts together the axe itself was composed of two blades turning different ways with a sharp steel spike projecting from between them the steel part both spike and blade was burnished as bright as a mirror and though its ponderous size must have been burdensome to one weaker than himself yet the young soldier carried it as carelessly along as if it were but a feathers weight it was indeed a skilfully constructed weapon so well balanced that it was much lighter in striking and in recovery than he who saw it in the hands of another could easily have believed the carrying arms of itself showed that the military man was a stranger the native greeks had that mark of a civilized people that they never bore weapons during the time of peace unless the wearer chanced to be numbered among those whose military profession and employment required them to be always in arms such soldiers by profession were easily distinguished from the peaceful citizens and it was with some evident show of fear as well as dislike that the passengers observed to each other that the stranger was a varangian an expression which intimated a barbarian of the imperial bodyguard to supply the deficiency of valour among his own subjects and to procure soldiers who should be personally dependent on the emperor the greek sovereigns had been for a great many years in the custom of maintaining in their pay as near their person as they could the steady services of a select number of mercenaries in the capacity of bodyguards which were numerous enough when their steady discipline and inflexible loyalty were taken in conjunction with their personal strength and indomitable courage to defeat not only any traitorous attempt on the imperial person but to quell open rebellions unless such were supported by a great proportion of the military force their pay was therefore liberal their rank and established character for prowess gave them a degree of consideration among the people whose reputation for valour had not for some ages stood high and if as foreigners and the members of a privileged body the varangians were sometimes employed in arbitrary and unpopular services the natives were so apt to fear while they disliked them that the hardy strangers disturbed themselves but little about the light in which they were regarded by the inhabitants of constantinople their dress and accoutrements while within the city partook of the rich or rather gaudy costume which we have described bearing only a sort of affected resemblance to that which the varangians wore in their native forests but the individuals of this select corps were when their services were required beyond the city furnished with armour and weapons more resembling those which they were accustomed to wield in their own country possessing much less of the splendour of war and a far greater portion of its effective terrors and thus they were summoned to take the field this body of varangians which term is according to one interpretation merely a general expression for barbarians was in an early age of the empire formed of the roving and piratical inhabitants of the north whom a love of adventure the greatest perhaps that ever was indulged and a contempt of danger which never had a parallel in the history of human nature drove forth upon the pathless ocean piracy says gibbon with his usual spirit was the exercise the trade the glory and the virtue of the scandinavian youth impatient of a bleak climate and narrow limits they started from the banquet grasped their arms sounded their horn ascended their ships and explored every coast that promised either spoil or settlement footnote decline and fall of the roman empire chap lv vol x p vo edition the conquests made in france and britain by these wild seakings as they were called have obscured the remembrance of other northern champions who long before the time of comnenus made excursions as far as constantinople and witnessed with their own eyes the wealth and the weakness of the grecian empire itself numbers found their way thither through the pathless wastes of russia others navigated the mediterranean in their seaserpents as they termed their piratical vessels the emperors terrified at the appearance of these daring inhabitants of the frozen zone had recourse to the usual policy of a rich and unwarlike people bought with gold the service of their swords and thus formed a corps of satellites more distinguished for valour than the famed praetorian bands of rome and perhaps because fewer in number unalterably loyal to their new princes but at a later period of the empire it began to be more difficult for the emperors to obtain recruits for their favourite and selected corps the northern nations having now in a great measure laid aside the piratical and roving habits which had driven their ancestors from the straits of elsinore to those of sestos and abydos the corps of the varangians must therefore have died out or have been filled up with less worthy materials had not the conquests made by the normans in the far distant west sent to the aid of comnenus a large body of the dispossessed inhabitants of the islands of britain and particularly of england who furnished recruits to his chosen bodyguard these were in fact anglosaxons but in the confused idea of geography received at the court of constantinople they were naturally enough called anglodanes as their native country was confounded with the thule of the ancients by which expression the archipelago of zetland and orkney is properly to be understood though according to the notions of the greeks it comprised either denmark or britain the emigrants however spoke a language not very dissimilar to the original varangians and adopted the name more readily that it seemed to remind them of their unhappy fate the appellation being in one sense capable of being interpreted as exiles excepting one or two chief commanders whom the emperor judged worthy of such high trust the varangians were officered by men of their own nation and with so many privileges being joined by many of their countrymen from time to time as the crusades pilgrimages or discontent at home drove fresh supplies of the anglo saxons or anglodanes to the east the varangians subsisted in strength to the last days of the greek empire retaining their native language along with the unblemished loyalty and unabated martial spirit which characterised their fathers this account of the varangian guard is strictly historical and might be proved by reference to the byzantine historians most of whom and also villehardouins account of the taking of the city of constantinople by the franks and venetians make repeated mention of this celebrated and singular body of englishmen forming a mercenary guard attendant on the person of the greek emperors footnote ducange has poured forth a tide of learning on this curious subject which will be found in his notes on villehardouins constantinople under the french emperors paris folio p gibbons history may also be consulted vol x p villehardouin in describing the siege of constantinople a d says li murs fu mult garnis danglois et de danois hence the dissertation of ducange here quoted and several articles besides in his glossarium as varangi warengangi c the etymology of the name is left uncertain though the german fortganger i e forthgoer wanderer exile seems the most probable the term occurs in various italian and sicilian documents anterior to the establishment of the varangian guards at constantinople and collected by muratori as for instance in an edict of one of the lombard kings omnes warengrangi qui de extens finibus in regni nostri finibus advenerint seque sub scuto potestatis nostrae subdiderint legibus nostris longobardorum vivere debeant and in another de warengangis nobilibus mediocribus et rusticis hominibus qui usque nune in terra vestra fugiti sunt habeatis eos muratori vol ii p with regard to the origin of the varangian guard the most distinct testimony is that of ordericus vittalis who says when therefore the english had lost their liberty they turned themselves with zeal to discover the means of throwing off the unaccustomed yoke some fled to sueno king of the danes to excite him to the recovery of the inheritance of his grandfather canute not a few fled into exile in other regions either from the mere desire of escaping from under the norman rule or in the hope of acquiring wealth and so being one day in a condition to renew the struggle at home some of these in the bloom of youth penetrated into a far distant land and offered themselves to the military service of the constantinopolitan emperor that wise prince against whom robert guiscard duke of apulia had then raised all his forces the english exiles were favourably received and opposed in battle to the normans for whose encounter the greeks themselves were too weak alexius began to build a town for the english a little above constantinople at a place called chevelot but the trouble of the normans from sicily still increasing he soon recalled them to the capital and intrusted the princial palace with all its treasures to their keeping this was the method in which the saxon english found their way to ionia where they still remain highly valued by the emperor and the people book iv p having said enough to explain why an individual varangian should be strolling about the golden gate we may proceed in the story which we have commenced let it not be thought extraordinary that this soldier of the life guard should be looked upon with some degree of curiosity by the passing citizens it must be supposed that from their peculiar duties they were not encouraged to hold frequent intercourse or communication with the inhabitants and besides that they had duties of police occasionally to exercise amongst them which made them generally more dreaded than beloved they were at the same time conscious that their high pay splendid appointments and immediate dependence on the emperor were subjects of envy to the other forces they therefore kept much in the neighbourhood of their own barracks and were seldom seen straggling remote from them unless they had a commission of government intrusted to their charge this being the case it was natural that a people so curious as the greeks should busy themselves in eyeing the stranger as he loitered in one spot or wandered to and fro like a man who either could not find some place which he was seeking or had failed to meet some person with whom he had an appointment for which the ingenuity of the passengers found a thousand different and inconsistent reasons a varangian said one citizen to another and upon duty ahem then i presume to say in your ear what do you imagine is his object enquired the party to whom this information was addressed gods and goddesses do you think i can tell you but suppose that he is lurking here to hear what folk say of the emperor answered the quidnunc of constantinople that is not likely said the querist these varangians do not speak our language and are not extremely well fitted for spies since few of them pretend to any intelligible notion of the grecian tongue it is not likely i think that the emperor would employ as a spy a man who did not understand the language of the country but if there are as all men fancy answered the politician persons among these barbarian soldiers who can speak almost all languages you will admit that such are excellently qualified for seeing clearly around them since they possess the talent of beholding and reporting while no one has the slightest idea of suspecting them it may well be replied his companion but since we see so clearly the foxs foot and paws protruding from beneath the seeming sheeps fleece or rather by your leave the bears hide yonder had we not better be jogging homeward ere it be pretended we have insulted a varangian guard this surmise of danger insinuated by the last speaker who was a much older and more experienced politician than his friend determined both on a hasty retreat they adjusted their cloaks caught hold of each others arm and speaking fast and thick as they started new subjects of suspicion they sped close coupled together towards their habitations in a different and distant quarter of the town in the meantime the sunset was nigh over and the long shadows of the walls bulwarks and arches were projecting from the westward in deeper and blacker shade the varangian seemed tired of the short and lingering circle in which he had now trodden for more than an hour and in which he still loitered like an unliberated spirit which cannot leave the haunted spot till licensed by the spell which has brought it hither even so the barbarian casting an impatient glance to the sun which was setting in a blaze of light behind a rich grove of cypress trees looked for some accommodation on the benches of stone which were placed under shadow of the triumphal arch of theodosius drew the axe which was his principal weapon close to his side wrapped his cloak about him and though his dress was not in other respects a fit attire for slumber any more than the place well selected for repose yet in less than three minutes he was fast asleep the irresistible impulse which induced him to seek for repose in a place very indifferently fitted for the purpose might be weariness consequent upon the military vigils which had proved a part of his duty on the preceding evening at the same time his spirit was so alive within him even while he gave way to this transient fit of oblivion that he remained almost awake even with shut eyes and no hound ever seemed to sleep more lightly than our anglosaxon at the golden gate of constantinople and now the slumberer as the loiterer had been before was the subject of observation to the accidental passengers two men entered the porch in company one was a somewhat slight made but alertlooking man by name lysimachus and by profession a designer a roll of paper in his hand with a little satchel containing a few chalks or pencils completed his stock in trade and his acquaintance with the remains of ancient art gave him a power of talking on the subject which unfortunately bore more than due proportion to his talents of execution his companion a magnificentlooking man in form and so far resembling the young barbarian but more clownish and peasantlike in the expression of his features was stephanos the wrestler well known in the palestra stop here my friend said the artist producing his pencils till i make a sketch for my youthful hercules i thought hercules had been a greek said the wrestler this sleeping animal is a barbarian the tone intimated some offence and the designer hastened to soothe the displeasure which he had thoughtlessly excited stephanos known by the surname of castor who was highly distinguished for gymnastic exercises was a sort of patron to the little artist and not unlikely by his own reputation to bring the talents of his friend into notice beauty and strength said the adroit artist are of no particular nation and may our muse never deign me her prize but it is my greatest pleasure to compare them as existing in the uncultivated savage of the north and when they are found in the darling of an enlightened people who has added the height of gymnastic skill to the most distinguished natural qualities such as we can now only see in the works of phidias and praxiteles or in our living model of the gymnastic champions of antiquity nay i acknowledge that the varangian is a proper man said the athletic hero softening his tone but the poor savage hath not perhaps in his lifetime had a single drop of oil on his bosom hercules instituted the isthmian games but hold what sleeps he with wrapt so close in his bearskin said the artist is it a club away away my friend cried stephanos as they looked closer on the sleeper do you not know that is the instrument of their barbarous office they do not war with swords or lances as if destined to attack men of flesh and blood but with maces and axes as if they were to hack limbs formed of stone and sinews of oak i will wager my crown of withered parsley that he lies here to arrest some distinguished commander who has offended the government he would not have been thus formidably armed otherwise away away good lysimachus let us respect the slumbers of the bear so saying the champion of the palestra made off with less apparent confidence than his size and strength might have inspired others now thinly straggling passed onward as the evening closed and the shadows of the cypresstrees fell darker around two females of the lower rank cast their eyes on the sleeper holy maria said one if he does not put me in mind of the eastern tale how the genie brought a gallant young prince from his nuptial chamber in egypt and left him sleeping at the gate of damascus i will awake the poor lamb lest he catch harm from the night dew harm answered the older and crosser looking woman ay such harm as the cold water of the cydnus does to the wildswan a lamb ay forsooth why hes a wolf or a bear at least a varangian and no modest matron would exchange a word with such an unmannered barbarian ill tell you what one of these english danes did to me so saying she drew on her companion who followed with some reluctance seeming to listen to her gabble while she looked back upon the sleeper the total disappearance of the sun and nearly at the same time the departure of the twilight which lasts so short time in that tropical region one of the few advantages which a more temperate climate possesses over it being the longer continuance of that sweet and placid light gave signal to the warders of the city to shut the folding leaves of the golden gate leaving a wicket lightly bolted for the passage of those whom business might have detained too late without the walls and indeed for all who chose to pay a small coin the position and apparent insensibility of the varangian did not escape those who had charge of the gate of whom there was a strong guard which belonged to the ordinary greek forces by castor and by pollux said the centurion for the greeks swore by the ancient deities although they no longer worshipped them and preserved those military distinctions with which the steady romans shook the world although they were altogether degenerated from their original manners by castor and pollux comrades we cannot gather gold in this gate according as its legend tells us yet it will be our fault if we cannot glean a goodly crop of silver and though the golden age be the most ancient and honourable yet in this degenerate time it is much if we see a glimpse of the inferior metal unworthy are we to follow the noble centurion harpax answered one of the soldiers of the watch who showed the shaven head and the single tuft footnote one tuft is left on the shaven head of the moslem for the angel to grasp by when conveying him to paradise of a mussulman if we do not hold silver a sufficient cause to bestir ourselves when there has been no gold to be had as by the faith of an honest man i think we can hardly tell its colour whether out of the imperial treasury or obtained at the expense of individuals for many long moons but this silver said the centurion thou shalt see with thine own eye and hear it ring a knell in the purse which holds our common stock which did hold it as thou wouldst say most valiant commander replied the inferior warder but what that purse holds now save a few miserable oboli for purchasing certain pickled potherbs and salt fish to relish our allowance of stummed wine i cannot tell but willingly give my share of the contents to the devil if either purse or platter exhibits symptom of any age richer than the age of copper i will replenish our treasury said the centurion were our stock yet lower than it is stand up close by the wicket my masters bethink you we are the imperial guards or the guards of the imperial city it is all one and let us have no man rush past us on a sudden and now that we are on our guard i will unfold to you but stop said the valiant centurion are we all here true brothers do all well understand the ancient and laudable customs of our watch keeping all things secret which concern the profit and advantage of this our vigil and aiding and abetting the common cause without information or treachery you are strangely suspicious tonight answered the sentinel methinks we have stood by you without taletelling in matters which were more weighty have you forgot the passage of the jeweller which was neither the gold nor silver age but if there were a diamond one peace good ismail the infidel said the centurion for i thank heaven we are of all religions so it is to be hoped we must have the true one amongst us peace i say it is unnecessary to prove thou canst keep new secrets by ripping up old ones come hither look through the wicket to the stone bench on the shady side of the grand porch tell me old lad what dost thou see there a man asleep said ismail by heaven i think from what i can see by the moonlight that it is one of those barbarians one of those island dogs whom the emperor sets such store by and can thy fertile brain said the centurion spin nothing out of his present situation tending towards our advantage why ay said ismail they have large pay though they are not only barbarians but pagan dogs in comparison with us moslems and nazarenes that fellow hath besotted himself with liquor and hath not found his way home to his barracks in good time he will be severely punished unless we consent to admit him and to prevail on us to do so he must empty the contents of his girdle that at least that at least answered the soldiers of the city watch but carefully suppressing their voices though they spoke in an eager tone and is that all that you would make of such an opportunity said harpax scornfully no no comrades if this outlandish animal indeed escape us he must at least leave his fleece behind see you not the gleams from his headpiece and his cuirass i presume these betoken substantial silver though it may be of the thinnest there lies the silver mine i spoke of ready to enrich the dexterous hands who shall labour it but said timidly a young greek a companion of their watch lately enlisted in the corps and unacquainted with their habits still this barbarian as you call him is a soldier of the emperor and if we are convicted of depriving him of his arms we shall be justly punished for a military crime hear to a new lycurgus come to teach us our duty said the centurion learn first young man that the metropolitan cohort never can commit a crime and next of course that they can never be convicted of one suppose we found a straggling barbarian a varangian like this slumberer perhaps a frank or some other of these foreigners bearing unpronounceable names while they dishonour us by putting on the arms and apparel of the real roman soldier are we placed to defend an important post to admit a man so suspicious within our postern when the event may probably be to betray both the golden gate and the hearts of gold who guard it to have the one seized and the throats of the others handsomely cut keep him without side of the gate then replied the novice if you think him so dangerous for my part i should not fear him were he deprived of that huge doubleedged axe which gleams from under his cloak having a more deadly glare than the comet which astrologers prophesy such strange things of nay then we agree together answered harpax and you speak like a youth of modesty and sense and i promise you the state will lose nothing in the despoiling of this same barbarian each of these savages hath a double set of accoutrements the one wrought with gold silver inlaid work and ivory as becomes their duties in the princes household the other fashioned of triple steel strong weighty and irresistible now in taking from this suspicious character his silver helmet and cuirass you reduce him to his proper weapons and you will see him start up in arms fit for duty yes said the novice but i do not see that this reasoning will do more than warrant our stripping the varangian of his armour to be afterwards heedfully returned to him on the morrow if he prove a true man how i know not but i had adopted some idea that it was to be confiscated for our joint behoof unquestionably said harpax for such has been the rule of our watch ever since the days of the excellent centurion sisyphus in whose time it first was determined that all contraband commodities or suspicious weapons or the like which were brought into the city during the nightwatch should be uniformly forfeited to the use of the soldiery of the guard and where the emperor finds the goods or arms unjustly seized i hope he is rich enough to make it up to the sufferer but still but still said sebastes of mitylene the young greek aforesaid were the emperor to discover ass replied harpax he cannot discover if he had all the eyes of arguss tail here are twelve of us sworn according to the rules of the watch to abide in the same story here is a barbarian who if he remembers any thing of the matter which i greatly doubt his choice of a lodging arguing his familiarity with the winepot tells but a wild tale of losing his armour which we my masters looking round to his companions deny stoutly i hope we have courage enough for that and which party will be believed the companions of the watch surely quite the contrary said sebastes i was born at a distance from hence yet even in the island of mitylene the rumour had reached me that the cavaliers of the cityguard of constantinople were so accomplished in falsehood that the oath of a single barbarian would outweigh the christian oath of the whole body if christians some of them are for example this dark man with a single tuft on his head and if it were even so said the centurion with a gloomy and sinister look there is another way of making the transaction a safe one sebastes fixing his eye on his commander moved his hand to the hilt of an eastern poniard which he wore as if to penetrate his exact meaning the centurion nodded in acquiescence young as i am said sebastes i have been already a pirate five years at sea and a robber three years now in the hills and it is the first time i have seen or heard a man hesitate in such a case to take the only part which is worth a brave mans while to resort to in a pressing affair harpax struck his hand into that of the soldier as sharing his uncompromising sentiments but when he spoke it was in a tremulous voice how shall we deal with him said he to sebastes who from the most raw recruit in the corps had now risen to the highest place in his estimation any how returned the islander i see bows here and shafts and if no other person can use them they are not said the centurion the regular arms of our corps the fitter you to guard the gates of a city said the young soldier with a horselaugh which had something insulting in it well be it so i can shoot like a scythian he proceeded nod but with your head one shaft shall crash among the splinters of his skull and his brains the second shall quiver in his heart bravo my noble comrade said harpax in a tone of affected rapture always lowering his voice however as respecting the slumbers of the varangian such were the robbers of ancient days the diomedes corvnetes synnes scyrons procrustes whom it required demigods to bring to what was miscalled justice and whose compeers and fellows will remain masters of the continent and isles of greece until hercules and theseus shall again appear upon earth nevertheless shoot not my valiant sebastes draw not the bow my invaluable mitylenian you may wound and not kill i am little wont to do so said sebastes again repeating the hoarse chuckling discordant laugh which grated upon the ears of the centurion though he could hardly tell the reason why it was so uncommonly unpleasant if i look not about me was his internal reflection we shall have two centurions of the watch instead of one this mitylenian or be he who the devil will is a bows length beyond me i must keep my eye on him he then spoke aloud in a tone of authority but come young man it is hard to discourage a young beginner if you have been such a rover of wood and river as you tell us of you know how to play the sicarius there lies your object drunk or asleep we know not which you will deal with him in either case will you give me no odds to stab a stupefied or drunken man most noble centurion answered the greek you would perhaps love the commission yourself he continued somewhat ironically do as you are directed friend said harpax pointing to the turret staircase which led down from the battlement to the arched entrance underneath the porch he has the true catlike stealthy pace half muttered the centurion as his sentinel descended to do such a crime as he was posted there to prevent this cockerels comb must be cut or he will become king of the roost but let us see if his hand be as resolute as his tongue then we will consider what turn to give to the conclusion as harpax spoke between his teeth and rather to himself than any of his companions the mitylenian emerged from under the archway treading on tiptoe yet swiftly with an admirable mixture of silence and celerity his poniard drawn as he descended gleamed in his hand which was held a little behind the rest of his person so as to conceal it the assassin hovered less than an instant over the sleeper as if to mark the interval between the illfated silver corslet and the body which it was designed to protect when at the instant the blow was rushing to its descent the varangian started up at once arrested the armed hand of the assassin by striking it upwards with the head of his battleaxe and while he thus parried the intended stab struck the greek a blow heavier than sebastes had ever learned at the pancration which left him scarce the power to cry help to his comrades on the battlements they saw what had happened however and beheld the barbarian set his foot on their companion and brandish high his formidable weapon the whistling sound of which made the old arch ring ominously while he paused an instant with his weapon upheaved ere he gave the finishing blow to his enemy the warders made a bustle as if some of them would descend to the assistance of sebastes without however appearing very eager to do so when harpax in a rapid whisper commanded them to stand fast each man to his place he said happen what may yonder comes a captain of the guard the secret is our own if the savage has killed the mitylenian as i well trust for he stirs neither hand nor foot but if he lives my comrades make hard your faces as flints he is but one man we are twelve we know nothing of his purpose save that he went to see wherefore the barbarian slept so near the post while the centurion thus bruited his purpose in busy insinuation to the companions of his watch the stately figure of a tall soldier richly armed and presenting a lofty crest which glistened as he stept from the open moonlight into the shade of the vault became visible beneath a whisper passed among the warders on the top of the gate draw bolt shut gate come of the mitylenian what will said the centurion we are lost men if we own him here comes the chief of the varangian axes the follower himself well hereward said the officer who came last upon the scene in a sort of lingua franca generally used by the barbarians of the guard hast thou caught a nighthawk ay by saint george answered the soldier and yet in my country we would call him but a kite what is he said the leader he will tell you that himself replied the varangian when i take my grasp from his windpipe let him go then said the officer the englishman did as he was commanded but escaping as soon as he felt himself at liberty with an alertness which could scarce have been anticipated the mitylenian rushed out at the arch and availing himself of the complicated ornaments which had originally graced the exterior of the gateway he fled around buttress and projection closely pursued by the varangian who encumbered with his armour was hardly a match in the course for the lightfooted grecian as he dodged his pursuer from one skulking place to another the officer laughed heartily as the two figures like shadows appearing and disappearing as suddenly held rapid flight and chase around the arch of theodosius by hercules it is hector pursued round the walls of ilion by achilles said the officer but my pelides will scarce overtake the son of priam what ho goddessborn son of the whitefooted thetis but the allusion is lost on the poor savage hollo hereward i say stop know thine own most barbarous name these last words were muttered then raising his voice do not outrun thy wind good hereward thou mayst have more occasion for breath tonight if it had been my leaders will answered the varangian coming back in sulky mood and breathing like one who had been at the top of his speed i would have had him as fast as ever greyhound held hare ere i left off the chase were it not for this foolish armour which encumbers without defending one i would not have made two bounds without taking him by the throat as well as it is said the officer who was in fact the acoulonthos or follower so called because it was the duty of this highly trusted officer of the varangian guards constantly to attend on the person of the emperor but let us now see by what means we are to regain our entrance through the gate for if as i suspect it was one of those warders who was willing to have played thee a trick his companions may not let us enter willingly and is it not said the varangian your valours duty to probe this want of discipline to the bottom hush thee here my simpleminded savage i have often told you most ignorant hereward that the skulls of those who come from your cold and muddy boentia of the north are fitter to bear out twenty blows with a sledgehammer than turn off one witty or ingenious idea but follow me hereward and although i am aware that showing the fine meshes of grecian policy to the coarse eye of an unpractised barbarian like thee is much like casting pearls before swine a thing forbidden in the blessed gospel yet as thou hast so good a heart and so trusty as is scarce to be met with among my varangians themselves i care not if while thou art in attendance on my person i endeavour to indoctrinate thee in some of that policy by which i myself the follower the chief of the varangians and therefore erected by their axes into the most valiant of the valiant am content to guide myself although every way qualified to bear me through the cross currents of the court by main pull of oar and press of sail a condescension in me to do that by policy which no man in this imperial court the chosen sphere of superior wits could so well accomplish by open force as myself what thinkst thou good savage i know answered the varangian who walked about a step and a half behind his leader like an orderly of the present day behind his officers shoulder i should be sorry to trouble my head with what i could do by my hands at once did i not say so replied the follower who had now for some minutes led the way from the golden gate and was seen gliding along the outside of the moonlight walls as if seeking an entrance elsewhere lo such is the stuff of what you call your head is made your hands and arms are perfect ahitophels compared to it hearken to me thou most ignorant of all animals but for that very reason thou stoutest of confidants and bravest of soldiers i will tell thee the very riddle of this nightwork and yet even then i doubt if thou canst understand me it is my present duty to try to comprehend your valour said the varangian i would say your policy since you condescend to expound it to me as for your valour he added i should be unlucky if i did not think i understand its length and breadth already the greek general coloured a little but replied with unaltered voice true good hereward we have seen each other in battle hereward here could not suppress a short cough which to those grammarians of the day who were skilful in applying the use of accents would have implied no peculiar eulogium on his officers military bravery indeed during their whole intercourse the conversation of the general in spite of his tone of affected importance and superiority displayed an obvious respect for his companion as one who in many points of action might if brought to the test prove a more effective soldier than himself on the other hand when the powerful northern warrior replied although it was with all observance of discipline and duty yet the discussion might sometimes resemble that between an ignorant macaroni officer before the duke of yorks reformation of the british army and a steady sergeant of the regiment in which they both served there was a consciousness of superiority disguised by external respect and half admitted by the leader you will grant me my simple friend continued the chief in the same tone as before in order to lead thee by a short passage into the deepest principle of policy which pervades this same court of constantinople that the favour of the emperor here the officer raised his casque and the soldier made a semblance of doing so also who be the place where he puts his foot sacred is the vivifying principle of the sphere in which we live as the sun itself is that of humanity i have heard something like this said by our tribunes said the varangian it is their duty so to instruct you answered the leader and i trust that the priests also in their sphere forget not to teach my varangians their constant service to their emperor they do not omit it replied the soldier though we of the exiles know our duty god forbid i should doubt it said the commander of the battleaxes all i mean is to make thee understand my dear hereward that as there are though perhaps such do not exist in thy dark and gloomy climate a race of insects which are born in the first rays of the morning and expire with those of sunset thence called by us ephemeras as enduring one day only such is the case of a favourite at court while enjoying the smiles of the most sacred emperor and happy is he whose favour rising as the person of the sovereign emerges from the level space which extends around the throne displays itself in the first imperial blaze of glory and who keeping his post during the meridian splendour of the crown has only the fate to disappear and die with the last beam of imperial brightness your valour said the islander speaks higher language than my northern wits are able to comprehend only methinks rather than part with life at the sunset i would since insect i must needs be become a moth for two or three dark hours such is the sordid desire of the vulgar hereward answered the follower with assumed superiority who are contented to enjoy life lacking distinction whereas we on the other hand we of choicer quality who form the nearest and innermost circle around the imperial alexius in which he himself forms the central point are watchful to womans jealousy of the distribution of his favours and omit no opportunity whether by leaguing with or against each other to recommend ourselves individually to the peliar light of his countenance i think i comprehend what you mean said the guardsman although as for living such a life of intrigue but that matters not it does indeed matter not my good hereward said his officer and thou art lucky in having no appetite for the life i have described yet have i seen barbarians rise high in the empire and if they have not altogether the flexibility the malleability as it is called that happy ductility which can give way to circumstances i have yet known those of barbaric tribes especially if bred up at court from their youth who joined to a limited portion of this flexile quality enough of a certain tough durability of temper which if it does not excel in availing itself of opportunity has no contemptible talent at creating it but letting comparisons pass it follows from this emulation of glory that is of royal favour amongst the servants of the imperial and most sacred court that each is desirous of distinguishing himself by showing to the emperor not only that he fully understands the duties of his own employments but that he is capable in case of necessity of discharging those of others i understand said the saxon and thence it happens that the under ministers soldiers and assistants of the great crownofficers are perpetually engaged not in aiding each other but in acting as spies on their neighbours actions even so answered the commander it is but few days since i had a disagreeable instance of it every one however dull in the intellect hath understood thus much that the great protospathaire footnote literally the first swordsman which title thou knowest signifies the generalinchief of the forces of the empire hath me at hatred because i am the leader of those redoubtable varangians who enjoy and well deserve privileges exempting them from the absolute command which he possesses over all other corps of the army an authority which becomes nicanor notwithstanding the victorious sound of his name nearly as well as a warsaddle would become a bullock how said the varangian does the protospathaire pretend to any authority over the noble exiles by the red dragon under which we will live and die we will obey no man alive but alexius comnenus himself and our own officers rightly and bravely resolved said the leader but my good hereward let not your just indignation hurry you so far as to name the most sacred emperor without raising your hand to your casque and adding the epithets of his lofty rank i will raise my hand often enough and high enough said the norseman when the emperors service requires it i dare be sworn thou wilt said achilles tatius the commander of the varangian imperial body guard who thought the time was unfavourable for distinguishing himself by insisting on that exact observance of etiquette which was one of his great pretensions to the name of a soldier yet were it not for the constant vigilance of your leader my child the noble varangians would be trode down in the common mass of the army with the heathen cohorts of huns scythians or those turband infidels the renegade turks and even for this is your commander here in peril because he vindicates his axemen as worthy of being prized above the paltry shafts of the eastern tribes and the javelins of the moors which are only fit to be playthings for children you are exposed to no danger said the soldier closing up to achilles in a confidential manner from which these axes can protect you do i not know it said achilles but it is to your arms alone that the follower of his most sacred majesty now intrusts his safety in aught that a soldier may do answered hereward make your own computation and then reckon this single arm worth two against any man the emperor has not being of our own corps listen my brave friend continued achilles this nicanor was daring enough to throw a reproach on our noble corps accusing them gods and goddesses of plundering in the field and yet more sacrilegious of drinking the precious wine which was prepared for his most sacred majestys own blessed consumption i the sacred person of the emperor being present proceeded as thou mayst well believe to give him the lie in his audacious throat burst in the varangian named a place of meeting somewhere in the vicinity and called the attendance of your poor follower hereward of hampton who is your bondslave for life long for such an honour i wish only you had told me to get my workday arms but however i have my battleaxe and here his companion seized a moment to break in for he was somewhat abashed at the lively tone of the young soldier hush thee my son said achilles tatius speak low my excellent hereward thou mistakest this thing with thee by my side i would not indeed hesitate to meet five such as nicanor but such is not the law of this most hallowed empire nor the sentiments of the three times illustrious prince who now rules it thou art debauched my soldier with the swaggering stories of the franks of whom we hear more and more every day i would not willingly borrow any thing from those whom you call franks and we normans answered the varangian in a disappointed dogged tone why listen then said the officer as they proceeded on their walk listen to the reason of the thing and consider whether such a custom can obtain as that which they term the duello in any country of civilization and common sense to say nothing of one which is blessed with the domination of the most rare alexius comnenus two great lords or high officers quarrel in the court and before the reverend person of the emperor they dispute about a point of fact now instead of each maintaining his own opinion by argument or evidence suppose they had adopted the custom of these barbarous franks why thou liest in thy throat says the one and thou liest in thy very lungs says another and they measure forth the lists of battle in the next meadow each swears to the truth of his quarrel though probably neither well knows precisely how the fact stands one perhaps the hardier truer and better man of the two the follower of the emperor and father of the varangians for death my faithful follower spares no man lies dead on the ground and the other comes back to predominate in the court where had the matter been enquired into by the rules of common sense and reason the victor as he is termed would have been sent to the gallows and yet this is the law of arms as your fancy pleases to call it friend hereward may it please your valour answered the barbarian there is a show of sense in what you say but you will sooner convince me that this blessed moonlight is the blackness of a wolfs mouth than that i ought to hear myself called liar without cramming the epithet down the speakers throat with the spike of my battleaxe the lie is to a man the same as a blow and a blow degrades him into a slave and a beast of burden if endured without retaliation ay there it is said achilles could i but get you to lay aside that inborn barbarism which leads you otherwise the most disciplined soldiers who serve the sacred emperor into such deadly quarrels and feuds sir captain said the varangian in a sullen tone take my advice and take the varangians as you have them for believe my word that if you could teach them to endure reproaches bear the lie or tolerate stripes you would hardly find them when their discipline is completed worth the single days salt which they cost to his holiness if that be his title i must tell you moreover valorous sir that the varangians will little thank their leader who heard them called marauders drunkards and what not and repelled not the charge on the spot now if i knew not the humours of my barbarians thought tatius in his own mind i should bring on myself a quarrel with these untamed islanders who the emperor thinks can be so easily kept in discipline but i will settle this sport presently accordingly he addressed the saxon in a soothing tone my faithful soldier he proceeded aloud we romans according to the custom of our ancestors set as much glory on actually telling the truth as you do in resenting the imputation of falsehood and i could not with honour return a charge of falsehood upon nicanor since what he said was substantially true what that we varangians were plunderers drunkards and the like said hereward more impatient than before no surely not in that broad sense said achilles but there was too much foundation for the legend when and where asked the anglosaxon you remember replied his leader the long march near laodicea where the varangians beat off a cloud of turks and retook a train of the imperial baggage you know what was done that day how you quenched your thirst i mean i have some reason to remember it said hereward of hampton for we were half choked with dust fatigue and which was worst of all constantly fighting with our faces to the rear when we found some firkins of wine in certain carriages which were broken down down our throats it went as if it had been the best ale in southampton ah unhappy said the follower saw you not that the firkins were stamped with the thrice excellent grand butlers own inviolable seal and set apart for the private use of his imperial majestys most sacred lips by good saint george of merry england worth a dozen of your saint george of cappadocia i neither thought nor cared about the matter answered hereward and i know your valour drank a mighty draught yourself out of my headpiece not this silver bauble but my steelcap which is twice as ample by the same token that whereas before you were giving orders to fall back you were a changed man when you had cleared your throat of the dust and cried bide the other brunt my brave and stout boys of britain ay said achilles i know i am but too apt to be venturous in action but you mistake good hereward the wine i tasted in the extremity of martial fatigue was not that set apart for his sacred majestys own peculiar mouth but a secondary sort preserved for the grand butler himself of which as one of the great officers of the household i might right lawfully partake the chance was nevertheless sinfully unhappy on my life replied hereward i cannot see the infelicity of drinking when we are dying of thirst but cheer up my noble comrade said achilles after he had hurried over his own exculpation and without noticing the varangians light estimation of the crime his imperial majesty in his ineffable graciousness imputes these illadvised draughts as a crime to no one who partook of them he rebuked the protospathaire for fishing up this accusation and said when he had recalled the bustle and confusion of that toilsome day i thought myself well off amid that seven times heated furnace when we obtained a draught of the barleywine drank by my poor varangians and i drank their health as well i might since had it not been for their services i had drunk my last and well fare their hearts though they quaffed my wine in return and with that he turned off as one who said i have too much of this being a finding of matter and ripping up of stories against achilles tatius and his gallant varangians now may god bless his honest heart for it said hereward with more downright heartiness than formal respect ill drink to his health in what i put next to my lips that quenches thirst whether it may be ale wine or ditchwater why well said but speak not above thy breath and remember to put thy hand to thy forehead when naming or even thinking of the emperor well thou knowest hereward that having thus obtained the advantage i knew that the moment of a repulsed attack is always that of a successful charge and so i brought against the protospathaire nicanor the robberies which have been committed at the golden gate and other entrances of the city where a merchant was but of late kidnapped and murdered having on him certain jewels the property of the patriarch ay indeed said the varangian and what said alex i mean the most sacred emperor when he heard such things said of the city warders though he had himself given as we say in our land the fox the geese to keep it may be he did replied achilles but he is a sovereign of deep policy and was resolved not to proceed against these treacherous warders or their general the protospathaire without decisive proof his sacred majesty therefore charged me to obtain specific circumstantial proof by thy means and that i would have managed in two minutes had you not called me off the chase of yon cutthroat vagabond but his grace knows the word of a varangian and i can assure him that either lucre of my silver gaberdine which they nickname a cuirass or the hatred of my corps would be sufficient to incite any of these knaves to cut the throat of a varangian who appeared to be asleep so we go i suppose captain to bear evidence before the emperor to this nights work no my active soldier hadst thou taken the runaway villain my first act must have been to set him free again and my present charge to you is to forget that such an adventure has ever taken place ha said the varangian this is a change of policy indeed why yes brave hereward ere i left the palace this night the patriarch made overtures of reconciliation betwixt me and the protospathaire which as our agreement is of much consequence to the state i could not very well reject either as a good soldier or a good christian all offences to my honour are to be in the fullest degree repaid for which the patriarch interposes his warrant the emperor who will rather wink hard than see disagreements loves better the matter should be slurred over thus and the reproaches upon the varangians said hereward shall be fully retracted and atoned for answered achilles and a weighty donative in gold dealt among the corps of the anglodanish axemen thou my hereward mayst be distributor and thus if well managed mayst plate thy battleaxe with gold i love my axe better as it is said the varangian my father bore it against the robber normans at hastings steel instead of gold for my money thou mayst make thy choice hereward answered his officer only if thou art poor say the fault was thine own but here in the course of their circuit round constantinople the officer and his soldier came to a very small wicket or sallyport opening on the interior of a large and massive advanced work which terminated an entrance to the city itself here the officer halted and made his obedience as a devotee who is about to enter a chapel of peculiar sanctity chapter the third here youth thy foot unbrace here youth thy brow unbraid each tribute that may grace the threshold here be paid walk with the stealthy pace which nature teaches deer when echoing in the chase the hunters horn they hear the court before entering achilles tatius made various gesticulations which were imitated roughly and awkwardly by the unpractised varangian whose service with his corps had been almost entirely in the field his routine of duty not having till very lately called him to serve as one of the garrison of constantinople he was not therefore acquainted with the minute observances which the greeks who were the most formal and ceremonious soldiers and courtiers in the world rendered not merely to the greek emperor in person but throughout the sphere which peculiarly partook of his influence achilles having gesticulated after his own fashion at length touched the door with a rap distinct at once and modest this was thrice repeated when the captain whispered to his attendant the interior for thy life do as thou seest me do at the same moment he started back and stooping his head on his breast with his hands over his eyes as if to save them from being dazzled by an expected burst of light awaited the answer to his summons the anglodane desirous to obey his leader imitating him as near as he could stood side by side in the posture of oriental humiliation the little portal opened inwards when no burst of light was seen but four of the varangians were made visible in the entrance holding each his battleaxe as if about to strike down the intruders who had disturbed the silence of their watch acoulouthos said the leader by way of password tatius and acoulouthos murmured the warders as a countersign each sentinel sunk his weapon achilles then reared his stately crest with a conscious dignity at making this display of court influence in the eyes of his soldiers hereward observed an undisturbed gravity to the surprise of his officer who marvelled in his own mind how he could be such a barbarian as to regard with apathy a scene which had in his eyes the most impressive and peculiar awe this indifference he imputed to the stupid insensibility of his companion they passed on between the sentinels who wheeled backward in file on each side of the portal and gave the strangers entrance to a long narrow plank stretched across the citymoat which was here drawn within the enclosure of an external rampart projecting beyond the principal wall of the city this he whispered to hereward is called the bridge of peril and it is said that it has been occasionally smeared with oil or strewed with dried peas and that the bodies of men known to have been in company with the emperors most sacred person have been taken out of the golden horn footnote the harbour of constantinople into which the moat empties itself i would not have thought said the islander raising his voice to its usual rough tone that alexius comnenus hush rash and regardless of your life said achilles tatius to awaken the daughter of the imperial arch footnote the daughter of the arch was a courtly expression for the echo as we find explained by the courtly commander himself is to incur deep penalty at all times but when a rash delinquent has disturbed her with reflections on his most sacred highness the emperor death is a punishment far too light for the effrontery which has interrupted her blessed slumber ill hath been my fate to have positive commands laid on me enjoining me to bring into the sacred precincts a creature who hath no more of the salt of civilization in him than to keep his mortal frame from corruption since of all mental culture he is totally incapable consider thyself hereward and bethink thee what thou art by nature a poor barbarian thy best boast that thou hast slain certain mussulmans in thy sacred masters quarrel and here art thou admitted into the inviolable enclosure of the blaquernal and in the hearing not only of the royal daughter of the imperial arch which means said the eloquent leader the echo of the sublime vaults but heaven be our guide for what i know within the natural hearing of the sacred ear itself well my captain replied the varangian i cannot presume to speak my mind after the fashion of this place but i can easily suppose i am but ill qualified to converse in the presence of the court nor do i mean therefore to say a word till i am spoken to unless when i shall see no better company than ourselves to be plain i find difficulty in modelling my voice to a smoother tone than nature has given it so henceforth my brave captain i will be mute unless when you give me a sign to speak you will act wisely said the captain here be certain persons of high rank nay some that have been born in the purple itself that will hereward alas for thee prepare to sound with the line of their courtly understanding the depths of thy barbarous and shallow conceit do not therefore then join their graceful smiles with thy inhuman bursts of cachinnation with which thou art wont to thunder forth when opening in chorus with thy messmates i tell thee i will be silent said the varangian moved somewhat beyond his mood if you trust my word so if you think i am a jackdaw that must be speaking whether in or out of place and purpose i am contented to go back again and therein we can end the matter achilles conscious perhaps that it was his best policy not to drive his subaltern to extremity lowered his tone somewhat in reply to the uncourtly note of the soldier as if allowing something for the rude manners of one whom he considered as not easily matched among the varangians themselves for strength and valour qualities which in despite of herewards discourtesy achilles suspected in his heart were fully more valuable than all those nameless graces which a more courtly and accomplished soldier might possess the expert navigator of the intricacies of the imperial residence carried the varangian through two or three small complicated courts forming a part of the extensive palace of the blaquernal footnote this palace derived its name from the neighbouring blachernian gate and bridge and entered the building itself by a side door watched in like manner by a sentinel of the varangian guard whom they passed on being recognized in the next apartment was stationed the court of guard where were certain soldiers of the same corps amusing themselves at games somewhat resembling the modern draughts and dice while they seasoned their pastime with frequent applications to deep flagons of ale which were furnished to them while passing away their hours of duty some glances passed between hereward and his comrades and he would have joined them or at least spoke to them for since the adventure of the mitylenian hereward had rather thought himself annoyed than distinguished by his moonlight ramble in the company of his commander excepting always the short and interesting period during which he conceived they were on the way to fight a duel still however negligent in the strict observance of the ceremonies of the sacred palace the varangians had in their own way rigid notions of calculating their military duty in consequence of which hereward without speaking to his companions followed his leader through the guardroom and one or two antechambers adjacent the splendid and luxurious furniture of which convinced him that he could be nowhere else save in the sacred residence of his master the emperor at length having traversed passages and apartments with which the captain seemed familiar and which he threaded with a stealthy silent and apparently reverential pace as if in his own inflated phrase afraid to awaken the sounding echoes of those lofty and monumental halls another species of inhabitants began to be visible in different entrances and in different apartments the northern soldier beheld those unfortunate slaves chiefly of african descent raised occasionally under the emperors of greece to great power and honours who in that respect imitated one of the most barbarous points of oriental despotism these slaves were differently occupied some standing as if on guard at gates or in passages with their drawn sabres in their hands some were sitting in the oriental fashion on carpets reposing themselves or playing at various games all of a character profoundly silent not a word passed between the guide of hereward and the withered and deformed beings whom they thus encountered the exchange of a glance with the principal soldier seemed all that was necessary to ensure both an uninterrupted passage after making their way through several apartments empty or thus occupied they at length entered one of black marble or some other darkcoloured stone much loftier and longer than the rest side passages opened into it so far as the islander could discern descending from several portals in the wall but as the oils and gums with which the lamps in these passages were fed diffused a dim vapour around it was difficult to ascertain from the imperfect light either the shape of the hall or the style of its architecture at the upper and lower ends of the chamber there was a stronger and clearer light it was when they were in the middle of this huge and long apartment that achilles said to the soldier in the sort of cautionary whisper which he appeared to have substituted in place of his natural voice since he had crossed the bridge of peril remain here till i return and stir from this hall on no account to hear is to obey answered the varangian an expression of obedience which like many other phrases and fashions the empire which still affected the name of roman had borrowed from the barbarians of the east achilles tatius then hastened up the steps which led to one of the sidedoors of the hall which being slightly pressed its noiseless hinge gave way and admitted him left alone to amuse himself as he best could within the limits permitted to him the varangian visited in succession both ends of the hall where the objects were more visible than elsewhere the lower end had in its centre a small lowbrowed door of iron over it was displayed the greek crucifix in bronze and around and on every side the representation of shackles fetter bolts and the like were also executed in bronze and disposed as appropriate ornaments over the entrance the door of the dark archway was half open and hereward naturally looked in the orders of his chief not prohibiting his satisfying his curiosity thus far a dense red light more like a distant spark than a lamp affixed to the wall of what seemed a very narrow and winding stair resembling in shape and size a drawwell the verge of which opened on the threshold of the iron door showed a descent which seemed to conduct to the infernal regions the varangian however obtuse he might be considered by the quickwitted greeks had no difficulty in comprehending that a staircase having such a gloomy appearance and the access to which was by a portal decorated in such a melancholy style of architecture could only lead to the dungeons of the imperial palace the size and complicated number of which were neither the least remarkable nor the least aweimposing portion of the sacred edifice listening profoundly he even thought he caught such accents as befit those graves of living men the faint echoing of groans and sighs sounding as it were from the deep abyss beneath but in this respect his fancy probably filled up the sketch which his conjectures bodied out i have done nothing he thought to merit being immured in one of these subterranean dens surely though my captain achilles tatius is under favour little better than an ass he cannot be so false of word as to train me to prison under false pretexts i trow he shall first see for the last time how the english axe plays if such is to be the sport of the evening but let us see the upper end of this enormous vault it may bear a better omen thus thinking and not quite ruling the tramp of his armed footstep according to the ceremonies of the place the largelimbed saxon strode to the upper end of the black marble hall the ornament of the portal here was a small altar like those in the temples of the heathen deities which projected above the centre of the arch on this altar smoked incense of some sort the fumes of which rose curling in a thin cloud to the roof and thence extending through the hall enveloped in its column of smoke a singular emblem of which the varangian could make nothing it was the representation of two human arms and hands seeming to issue from the wall having the palms extended and open as about to confer some boon on those who approached the altar these arms were formed of bronze and being placed farther back than the altar with its incense were seen through the curling smoke by lamps so disposed as to illuminate the whole archway the meaning of this thought the simple barbarian i should well know how to explain were these fists clenched and were the hall dedicated to the pancration which we call boxing but as even these helpless greeks use not their hands without their fingers being closed by st george i can make out nothing of their meaning at this instant achilles entered the black marble hall at the same door by which he had left it and came up to his neophyte as the varangian might be termed come with me now hereward for here approaches the thick of the onset now display the utmost courage that thou canst summon up for believe me thy credit and name also depend on it fear nothing for either said hereward if the heart or hand of one man can bear him through the adventure by the help of a toy like this keep thy voice low and submissive i have told thee a score of times said the leader and lower thine axe which as i bethink me thou hadst better leave in the outer apartment with your leave noble captain replied hereward i am unwilling to lay aside my breadwinner i am one of those awkward clowns who cannot behave seemly unless i have something to occupy my hands and my faithful battleaxe comes most natural to me keep it then but remember thou dash it not about according to thy custom nor bellow nor shout nor cry as in a battlefield think of the sacred character of the place which exaggerates riot into blasphemy and remember the persons whom thou mayst chance to see an offence to some of whom it may be ranks in the same sense with blasphemy against heaven itself this lecture carried the tutor and the pupil so far as to the sidedoor and thence inducted them into a species of anteroom from which achilles led his varangian forward until a pair of foldingdoors opening into what proved to be a principal apartment of the palace exhibited to the roughhewn native of the north a sight equally new and surprising it was an apartment of the palace of the blaquernal dedicated to the special service of the beloved daughter of the emperor alexius the princess anna comnena known to our times by her literary talents which record the history of her fathers reign she was seated the queen and sovereign of a literary circle such as an imperial princess porphyrogenita or born in the sacred purple chamber itself could assemble in those days and a glance around will enable us to form an idea of her guests or companions the literary princess herself had the bright eyes straight features and comely and pleasing manners which all would have allowed to the emperors daughter even if she could not have been with severe truth said to have possessed them she was placed upon a small bench or sofa the fair sex here not being permitted to recline as was the fashion of the roman ladies a table before her was loaded with books plants herbs and drawings she sat on a slight elevation and those who enjoyed the intimacy of the princess or to whom she wished to speak in particular were allowed during such sublime colloquy to rest their knees on the little dais or elevated place where her chair found its station in a posture half standing half kneeling three other seats of different heights were placed on the dais and under the same canopy of state which overshadowed that of the princess anna the first which strictly resembled her own chair in size and convenience was one designed for her husband nicephorus briennius he was said to entertain or affect the greatest respect for his wifes erudition though the courtiers were of opinion he would have liked to absent himself from her evening parties more frequently than was particularly agreeable to the princess anna and her imperial parents this was partly explained by the private tattle of the court which averred that the princess anna comnena had been more beautiful when she was less learned and that though still a fine woman she had somewhat lost the charms of her person as she became enriched in her mind to atone for the lowly fashion of the seat of nicephorus briennius it was placed as near to his princess as it could possibly be edged by the ushers so that she might not lose one look of her handsome spouse nor he the least particle of wisdom which might drop from the lips of his erudite consort two other seats of honour or rather thrones for they had footstools placed for the support of the feet rests for the arms and embroidered pillows for the comfort of the back not to mention the glories of the outspreading canopy were destined for the imperial couple who frequently attended their daughters studies which she prosecuted in public in the way we have intimated on such occasions the empress irene enjoyed the triumph peculiar to the mother of an accomplished daughter while alexius as it might happen sometimes listened with complacence to the rehearsal of his own exploits in the inflated language of the princess and sometimes mildly nodded over her dialogues upon the mysteries of philosophy with the patriarch zosimus and other sages all these four distinguished seats for the persons of the imperial family were occupied at the moment which we have described excepting that which ought to have been filled by nicephorus briennius the husband of the fair anna comnena to his negligence and absence was perhaps owing the angry spot on the brow of his fair bride beside her on the platform were two whiterobed nymphs of her household female slaves in a word who reposed themselves on their knees on cushions when their assistance was not wanted as a species of living bookdesks to support and extend the parchment rolls in which the princess recorded her own wisdom or from which she quoted that of others one of these young maidens called astarte was so distinguished as a calligrapher or beautiful writer of various alphabets and languages that she narrowly escaped being sent as a present to the caliph who could neither read nor write at a time when it was necessary to bribe him into peace violante usually called the muse the other attendant of the princess a mistress of the vocal and instrumental art of music was actually sent in a compliment to soothe the temper of robert guiscard the archduke of apulia who being aged and stonedeaf and the girl under ten years old at the time returned the valued present to the imperial donor and with the selfishness which was one of that wily normans characteristics desired to have some one sent him who could contribute to his pleasure instead of a twangling squalling infant beneath these elevated seats there sat or reposed on the floor of the hall such favourites as were admitted the patriarch zosimus and one or two old men were permitted the use of certain lowly stools which were the only seats prepared for the learned members of the princesss evening parties as they would have been called in our days as for the younger magnates the honour of being permitted to join the imperial conversation was expected to render them far superior to the paltry accommodation of a jointstool five or six courtiers of different dress and ages might compose the party who either stood or relieved their posture by kneeling along the verge of an adorned fountain which shed a mist of such very small rain as to dispel almost insensibly cooling the fragrant breeze which breathed from the flowers and shrubs that were so disposed as to send a waste of sweets around one goodly old man named michael agelastes big burly and dressed like an ancient cynic philosopher was distinguished by assuming in a great measure the ragged garb and mad bearing of that sect and by his inflexible practice of the strictest ceremonies exigible by the imperial family he was known by an affectation of cynical principle and language and of republican philosophy strangely contradicted by his practical deference to the great it was wonderful how long this man now sixty years old and upwards disdained to avail himself of the accustomed privilege of leaning or supporting his limbs and with what regularity he maintained either the standing posture or that of absolute kneeling but the first was so much his usual attitude that he acquired among his court friends the name of elephas or the elephant because the ancients had an idea that the halfreasoning animal as it is called has joints incapable of kneeling down yet i have seen them kneel when i was in the country of the gymnosophists said a person present on the evening of herewards introduction to take up their master on their shoulders so will ours said the patriarch zosimus with the slight sneer which was the nearest advance to a sarcasm that the etiquette of the greek court permitted for on all ordinary occasions it would not have offended the presence more surely literally to have drawn a poniard than to exchange a repartee in the imperial circle even the sarcasm such as it was would have been thought censurable by that ceremonious court in any but the patriarch to whose high rank some license was allowed just as he had thus far offended decorum achilles tatius and his soldier hereward entered the apartment the former bore him with even more than his usual degree of courtliness as if to set his own good breeding off by a comparison with the inexpert bearing of his follower while nevertheless he had a secret pride in exhibiting as one under his own immediate and distinct command a man whom he was accustomed to consider as one of the finest soldiers of the army of alexius whether appearance or reality were to be considered some astonishment followed the abrupt entrance of the new comers achilles indeed glided into the presence with the easy and quiet extremity of respect which intimated his habitude in these regions but hereward started on his entrance and perceiving himself in company of the court hastily strove to remedy his disorder his commander throwing round a scarce visible shrug of apology made then a confidential and monitory sign to hereward to mind his conduct what he meant was that he should doff his helmet and fall prostrate on the ground but the anglosaxon unaccustomed to interpret obscure inferences naturally thought of his military duties and advanced in front of the emperor as when he rendered his military homage he made reverence with his knee half touched his cap and then recovering and shouldering his axe stood in advance of the imperial chair as if on duty as a sentinel a gentle smile of surprise went round the circle as they gazed on the manly appearance and somewhat unceremonious but martial deportment of the northern soldier the various spectators around consulted the emperors face not knowing whether they were to take the intrusive manner of the varangians entrance as matter of illbreeding and manifest their horror or whether they ought rather to consider the bearing of the lifeguardsman as indicating blunt and manly zeal and therefore to be received with applause it was some little time ere the emperor recovered himself sufficiently to strike a keynote as was usual upon such occasions alexius comnenus had been wrapt for a moment into some species of slumber or at least absence of mind out of this he had been startled by the sudden appearance of the varangian for though he was accustomed to commit the outer guards of the palace to this trusty corps yet the deformed blacks whom we have mentioned and who sometimes rose to be ministers of state and commanders of armies were on all ordinary occasions intrusted with the guard of the interior of the palace alexius therefore awakened from his slumber and the military phrase of his daughter still ringing in his ears as she was reading a description of the great historical work in which she had detailed the conflicts of his reign felt somewhat unprepared for the entrance and military deportment of one of the saxon guard with whom he was accustomed to associate in general scenes of blows danger and death after a troubled glance around his look rested on achilles tatius why here he said trusty follower why this soldier here at this time of night here of course was the moment for modelling the visages regis ad exemplum but ere the patriarch could frame his countenance into devout apprehension of danger achilles tatius had spoken a word or two which reminded alexius memory that the soldier had been brought there by his own special orders oh ay true good fellow said he smoothing his troubled brow we had forgot that passage among the cares of state he then spoke to the varangian with a countenance more frank and a heartier accent than he used to his courtiers for to a despotic monarch a faithful lifeguardsman is a person of confidence while an officer of high rank is always in some degree a subject of distrust ha said he our worthy anglodane how fares he this unceremonious salutation surprised all but him to whom it was addressed hereward answered accompanying his words with a military obeisance which partook of heartiness rather than reverence with a loud unsubdued voice which startled the presence still more that the language was saxon which these foreigners occasionally used waes hael kaisar mirrig und machtigh that is be of good health stout and mighty emperor the emperor with a smile of intelligence to show he could speak to his guards in their own foreign language replied by the wellknown countersignal drink hael immediately a page brought a silver goblet of wine the emperor put his lips to it though he scarce tasted the liquor then commanded it to be handed to hereward and bade the soldier drink the saxon did not wait till he was desired a second time but took off the contents without hesitation a gentle smile decorous as the presence required passed over the assembly at a feat which though by no means wonderful in a hyperborean seemed prodigious in the estimation of the moderate greeks alexius himself laughed more loudly than his courtiers thought might be becoming on their part and mustering what few words of varangian he possessed which he eked out with greek demanded of his life guardsman well my bold briton or edward as men call thee dost thou know the flavour of that wine yes answered the varangian without change of countenance i tasted it once before at laodicea here his officer achilles tatius became sensible that his soldier approached delicate ground and in vain endeavoured to gain his attention in order that he might furtively convey to him a hint to be silent or at least take heed what he said in such a presence but the soldier who with proper military observance continued to have his eye and attention fixed on the emperor as the prince whom he was bound to answer or to serve saw none of the hints which achilles at length suffered to become so broad that zosimus and the protospathaire exchanged expressive glances as calling on each other to notice the byplay of the leader of the varangians in the meanwhile the dialogue between the emperor and his soldier continued how said alexius did this draught relish compared with the former there is fairer company here my liege than that of the arabian archers answered hereward with a look and bow of instinctive good breeding nevertheless there lacks the flavour which the heat of the sun the dust of the combat with the fatigue of wielding such a weapon as this advancing his axe for eight hours together give to a cup of rare wine another deficiency there might be said agelastes the elephant provided i am pardoned hinting at it he added with a look to the throne it might be the smaller size of the cup compared with that at laodicea by taranis you say true answered the lifeguardsman at laodicea i used my helmet let us see the cups compared together good friend said agelastes continuing his raillery that we may be sure thou hast not swallowed the present goblet for i thought from the manner of the draught there was a chance of its going down with its contents there are some things which i do not easily swallow answered the varangian in a calm and indifferent tone but they must come from a younger and more active man than you the company again smiled to each other as if to hint that the philosopher though also parcel wit by profession had the worst of the encounter the emperor at the same time interfered nor did i send for thee hither good fellow to be baited by idle taunts here agelastes shrunk back in the circle as a hound that has been rebuked by the huntsman for babbling and the princess anna comnena who had indicated by her fair features a certain degree of impatience at length spoke will it then please you my imperial and muchbeloved father to inform those blessed with admission to the muses temple for what it is that you have ordered this soldier to be this night admitted to a place so far above his rank in life permit me to say we ought not to waste in frivolous and silly jests the time which is sacred to the welfare of the empire as every moment of your leisure must be our daughter speaks wisely said the empress irene who like most mothers who do not possess much talent themselves and are not very capable of estimating it in others was nevertheless a great admirer of her favourite daughters accomplishments and ready to draw them out on all occasions permit me to remark that in this divine and selected palace of the muses dedicated to the studies of our well beloved and highlygifted daughter whose pen will preserve your reputation our most imperial husband till the desolation of the universe and which enlivens and delights this society the very flower of the wits of our sublime court permit me to say that we have merely by admitting a single lifeguardsman given our conversation the character of that which distinguishes a barrack now the emperor alexius comnenus had the same feeling with many an honest man in ordinary life when his wife begins a long oration especially as the empress irene did not always retain the observance consistent with his awful rule and right supremacy although especially severe in exacting it from all others in reference to her lord therefore though he had felt some pleasure in gaining a short release from the monotonous recitation of the princesss history he now saw the necessity of resuming it or of listening to the matrimonial eloquence of the empress he sighed therefore as he said i crave your pardon good our imperial spouse and our daughter born in the purple chamber i remember me our most amiable and accomplished daughter that last night you wished to know the particulars of the battle of laodicea with the heathenish arabs whom heaven confound and for certain considerations which moved ourselves to add other enquiries to our own recollection achilles tatius our most trusty follower was commissioned to introduce into this place one of those soldiers under his command being such a one whose courage and presence of mind could best enable him to remark what passed around him on that remarkable and bloody day and this i suppose to be the man brought to us for that purpose if i am permitted to speak and live answered the follower your imperial highness with those divine princesses whose name is to us as those of blessed saints have in your presence the flower of my anglo danes or whatsoever unbaptized name is given to my soldiers he is as i may say a barbarian of barbarians for although in birth and breeding unfit to soil with his feet the carpet of this precinct of accomplishment and eloquence he is so brave so trusty so devotedly attached and so unhesitatingly zealous that enough good follower said the emperor let us only know that he is cool and observant not confused and fluttered during close battle as we have sometimes observed in you and other great commanders and to speak truth have even felt in our imperial self on extraordinary occasions which difference in mans constitution is not owing to any inferiority of courage but in us to a certain consciousness of the importance of our own safety to the welfare of the whole and to a feeling of the number of duties which at once devolve on us speak then and speak quickly tatius for i discern that our dearest consort and our thrice fortunate daughter born in the imperial chamber of purple seem to wax somewhat impatient hereward answered tatius is as composed and observant in battle as another in a festive dance the dust of war is the breath of his nostrils and he will prove his worth in combat against any four others varangians excepted who shall term themselves your imperial highnesss bravest servants follower said the emperor with a displeased look and tone instead of instructing these poor ignorant barbarians in the rules and civilization of our enlightened empire you foster by such boastful words the idle pride and fury of their temper which hurries them into brawls with the legions of other foreign countries and even breeds quarrels among themselves if my mouth may be opened in the way of most humble excuse said the follower i would presume to reply that i but an hour hence talked with this poor ignorant anglodane on the paternal care with which the imperial majesty of greece regards the preservation of that concord which unites the followers of his standard and how desirous he is to promote that harmony more especially amongst the various nations who have the happiness to serve you in spite of the bloodthirsty quarrels of the franks and other northern men who are never free from civil broil i think the poor youths understanding can bear witness to this much in my behalf he then looked towards hereward who gravely inclined his head in token of assent to what his captain said his excuse thus ratified achilles proceeded in his apology more firmly what i have said even now was spoken without consideration for instead of pretending that this hereward would face four of your imperial highnesss servants i ought to have said that he was willing to defy six of your imperial majestys most deadly enemies and permit them to choose every circumstance of time arms and place of combat that hath a better sound said the emperor and in truth for the information of my dearest daughter who piously has undertaken to record the things which i have been the blessed means of doing for the empire i earnestly wish that she should remember that though the sword of alexius hath not slept in its sheath yet he hath never sought his own aggrandizement of fame at the price of bloodshed among his subjects i trust said anna comnena that in my humble sketch of the life of the princely sire from whom i derive my existence i have not forgot to notice his love of peace and care for the lives of his soldiery and abhorrence of the bloody manners of the heretic franks as one of his most distinguishing characteristics assuming then an attitude more commanding as one who was about to claim the attention of the company the princess inclined her head gently around to the audience and taking a roll of parchment from the fair amanuensis which she had in a most beautiful handwriting engrossed to her mistresss dictation anna comnena prepared to read its contents at this moment the eyes of the princess rested for an instant on the barbarian hereward to whom she deigned this greeting valiant barbarian of whom my fancy recalls some memory as if in a dream thou art now to hear a work which if the author be put into comparison with the subject might be likened to a portrait of alexander in executing which some inferior dauber has usurped the pencil of apelles but which essay however it may appear unworthy of the subject in the eyes of many must yet command some envy in those who candidly consider its contents and the difficulty of portraying the great personage concerning whom it is written still i pray thee give thine attention to what i have now to read since this account of the battle of laodicea the details thereof being principally derived from his imperial highness my excellent father from the altogether valiant protospathaire his invincible general together with achilles tatius the faithful follower of our victorious emperor may nevertheless be in some circumstances inaccurate for it is to be thought that the high offices of those great commanders retained them at a distance from some particularly active parts of the fray in order that they might have more cool and accurate opportunity to form a judgment upon the whole and transmit their orders without being disturbed by any thoughts of personal safety even so brave barbarian in the art of embroidery marvel not that we are a proficient in that mechanical process since it is patronized by minerva whose studies we affect to follow we reserve to ourselves the superintendence of the entire web and commit to our maidens and others the execution of particular parts thus in the same manner thou valiant varangian being engaged in the very thickest of the affray before laodicea mayst point out to us the unworthy historian of so renowned a war those chances which befell where men fought hand to hand and where the fate of war was decided by the edge of the sword therefore dread not thou bravest of the axe men to whom we owe that victory and so many others to correct any mistake or misapprehension which we may have been led into concerning the details of that glorious event madam said the varangian i shall attend with diligence to what your highness may be pleased to read to me although as to presuming to blame the history of a princess born in the purple far be such a presumption from me still less would it become a barbaric varangian to pass a judgment on the military conduct of the emperor by whom he is liberally paid or of the commander by whom he is well treated before an action if our advice is required it is ever faithfully tendered but according to my rough wit our censure after the field is fought would be more invidious than useful touching the protospathaire if it be the duty of a general to absent himself from close action i can safely say or swear were it necessary that the invincible commander was never seen by me within a javelins cast of aught that looked like danger this speech boldly and bluntly delivered had a general effect on the company present the emperor himself and achilles tatius looked like men who had got off from a danger better than they expected the protospathaire laboured to conceal a movement of resentment agelastes whispered to the patriarch near whom he was placed the northern battleaxe lacks neither point nor edge hush said zosimus let us hear how this is to end the princess is about to speak chapter the fourth we heard the tecbir so these arabs call their shout of onset when with loud acclaim they challenged heaven as if demanding conquest the battle joind and through the barbrous herd fight fight and paradise was all their cry the siege of damascus the voice of the northern soldier although modified by feelings of respect to the emperor and even attachment to his captain had more of a tone of blunt sincerity nevertheless than was usually heard by the sacred echoes of the imperial palace and though the princess anna comnena began to think that she had invoked the opinion of a severe judge she was sensible at the same time by the deference of his manner that his respect was of a character more real and his applause should she gain it would prove more truly flattering than the gilded assent of the whole court of her father she gazed with some surprise and attention on hereward already described as a very handsome young man and felt the natural desire to please which is easily created in the mind towards a fine person of the other sex his attitude was easy and bold but neither clownish nor uncourtly his title of a barbarian placed him at once free from the forms of civilized life and the rules of artificial politeness but his character for valour and the noble selfconfidence of his bearing gave him a deeper interest than would have been acquired by a more studied and anxious address or an excess of reverential awe in short the princess anna comnena high in rank as she was and born in the imperial purple which she herself deemed the first of all attributes felt herself nevertheless in preparing to resume the recitation of her history more anxious to obtain the approbation of this rude soldier than that of all the rest of the courteous audience she knew them well it is true and felt nowise solicitous about the applause which the daughter of the emperor was sure to receive with full hands from those of the grecian court to whom she might choose to communicate the productions of her fathers daughter but she had now a judge of a new character whose applause if bestowed must have something in it intrinsically real since it could only be obtained by affecting his head or his heart it was perhaps under the influence of these feelings that the princess was somewhat longer than usual in finding out the passage in the roll of history at which she purposed to commence it was also noticed that she began her recitation with a diffidence and embarrassment surprising to the noble hearers who had often seen her in full possession of her presence of mind before what they conceived a more distinguished and even more critical audience neither were the circumstances of the varangian such as rendered the scene indifferent to him anna comnena had indeed attained her fifth lustre and that is a period after which grecian beauty is understood to commence its decline how long she had passed that critical period was a secret to all but the trusted wardwomen of the purple chamber enough that it was affirmed by the popular tongue and seemed to be attested by that bent towards philosophy and literature which is not supposed to be congenial to beauty in its earlier buds to amount to one or two years more she might be sevenandtwenty still anna comnena was or had very lately been a beauty of the very first rank and must be supposed to have still retained charms to captivate a barbarian of the north if indeed he himself was not careful to maintain an heedful recollection of the immeasurable distance between them indeed even this recollection might hardly have saved hereward from the charms of this enchantress bold freeborn and fearless as he was for during that time of strange revolutions there were many instances of successful generals sharing the couch of imperial princesses whom perhaps they had themselves rendered widows in order to make way for their own pretensions but besides the influence of other recollections which the reader may learn hereafter hereward though flattered by the unusual degree of attention which the princess bestowed upon him saw in her only the daughter of his emperor and adopted liege lord and the wife of a noble prince whom reason and duty alike forbade him to think of in any other light it was after one or two preliminary efforts that the princess anna began her reading with an uncertain voice which gained strength and fortitude as she proceeded with the following passage from a wellknown part of her history of alexius comnenus but which unfortunately has not been republished in the byzantine historians the narrative cannot therefore be otherwise than acceptable to the antiquarian reader and the author hopes to receive the thanks of the learned world for the recovery of a curious fragment which without his exertions must probably have passed to the gulf of total oblivion the retreat of laodicea now first published from the greek of the princess comnenas history of her father the sun had betaken himself to his bed in the ocean ashamed it would seem to see the immortal army of our most sacred emperor alexius surrounded by those barbarous hordes of unbelieving barbarians who as described in our last chapter had occupied the various passes both in front and rear of the romans footnote more properly termed the greeks but we follow the phraseology of the fair authoress secured during the preceding night by the wily barbarians although therefore a triumphant course of advance had brought us to this point it now became a serious and doubtful question whether our victorious eagles might be able to penetrate any farther into the country of the enemy or even to retreat with safety into their own the extensive acquaintance of the emperor with military affairs in which he exceeds most living princes had induced him on the preceding evening to ascertain with marvellous exactitude and foresight the precise position of the enemy in this most necessary service he employed certain lightarmed barbarians whose habits and discipline had been originally derived from the wilds of syria and if i am required to speak according to the dictation of truth seeing she ought always to sit upon the pen of a historian i must needs say they were infidels like their enemies faithfully attached however to the roman service and as i believe true slaves of the emperor to whom they communicated the information required by him respecting the position of his dreaded opponent jezdegerd these men did not bring in their information till long after the hour when the emperor usually betook himself to rest notwithstanding this derangement of his most sacred time our imperial father who had postponed the ceremony of disrobing so important were the necessities of the moment continued until deep in the night to hold a council of his wisest chiefs men whose depth of judgment might have saved a sinking world and who now consulted what was to be done under the pressure of the circumstances in which they were now placed and so great was the urgency that all ordinary observances of the household were set aside since i have heard from those who witnessed the fact that the royal bed was displayed in the very room where the council assembled and that the sacred lamp called the light of the council and which always burns when the emperor presides in person over the deliberations of his servants was for that night a thing unknown in our annals fed with unperfumed oil the fair speaker here threw her fine form into an attitude which expressed holy horror and the hearers intimated their sympathy in the exciting cause by corresponding signs of interest as to which we need only say that the sigh of achilles tatius was the most pathetic while the groan of agelastes the elephant was deepest and most tremendously bestial in its sound hereward seemed little moved except by a slight motion of surprise at the wonder expressed by the others the princess having allowed due time for the sympathy of her hearers to exhibit itself proceeded as follows in this melancholy situation when even the bestestablished and most sacred rites of the imperial household gave way to the necessity of a hasty provision for the morrow the opinions of the counsellors were different according to their tempers and habits a thing by the way which may be remarked as likely to happen among the best and wisest on such occasions of doubt and danger i do not in this place put down the names and opinions of those whose counsels were proposed and rejected herein paying respect to the secrecy and freedom of debate justly attached to the imperial cabinet enough it is to say that some there were who advised a speedy attack upon the enemy in the direction of our original advance others thought it was safer and might be easier to force our way to the rear and retreat by the same course which had brought us hither nor must it be concealed that there were persons of unsuspected fidelity who proposed a third course safer indeed than the others but totally alien to the mind of our most magnanimous father they recommended that a confidential slave in company with a minister of the interior of our imperial palace should be sent to the tent of jezdegerd in order to ascertain upon what terms the barbarian would permit our triumphant father to retreat in safety at the head of his victorious army on learning such opinion our imperial father was heard to exclaim sancta sophia being the nearest approach to an adjuration which he has been known to permit himself and was apparently about to say something violent both concerning the dishonour of the advice and the cowardice of those by whom it was preferred when recollecting the mutability of human things and the misfortune of several of his majestys gracious predecessors some of whom had been compelled to surrender their sacred persons to the infidels in the same region his imperial majesty repressed his generous feelings and only suffered his army counsellors to understand his sentiments by a speech in which he declared so desperate and so dishonourable a course would be the last which he would adopt even in the last extremity of danger thus did the judgment of this mighty prince at once reject counsel that seemed shameful to his arms and thereby encourage the zeal of his troops while privately he kept this postern in reserve which in utmost need might serve for a safe though not altogether in less urgent circumstances an honourable retreat when the discussion had reached this melancholy crisis the renowned achilles tatius arrived with the hopeful intelligence that he himself and some soldiers of his corps had discovered an opening on the left flank of our present encampment by which making indeed a considerable circuit but reaching if we marched with vigour the town of laodicea we might by falling back on our resources be in some measure in surety from the enemy so soon as this ray of hope darted on the troubled mind of our gracious father he proceeded to make such arrangements as might secure the full benefit of the advantage his imperial highness would not permit the brave varangians whose battleaxes he accounted the flower of his imperial army to take the advanced posts of assailants on the present occasion he repressed the love of battle by which these generous foreigners have been at all times distinguished and directed that the syrian forces in the army who have been before mentioned should be assembled with as little noise as possible in the vicinity of the deserted pass with instructions to occupy it the good genius of the empire suggested that as their speech arms and appearance resembled those of the enemy they might be permitted unopposed to take post in the defile with their lightarmed forces and thus secure it for the passage of the rest of the army of which he proposed that the varangians as immediately attached to his own sacred person should form the vanguard the wellknown battalions termed the immortals came next comprising the gross of the army and forming the centre and rear achilles tatius the faithful follower of his royal master although mortified that he was not permitted to assume the charge of the rear which he had proposed for himself and his valiant troops as the post of danger at the time cheerfully acquiesced nevertheless in the arrangement proposed by the emperor as most fit to effect the imperial safety and that of the army the imperial orders as they were sent instantly abroad were in like manner executed with the readiest punctuality the rather that they indicated a course of safety which had been almost despaired of even by the oldest soldiers during the dead period of time when as the divine homer tells us gods and men are alike asleep it was found that the vigilance and prudence of a single individual had provided safety for the whole roman army the pinnacles of the mountain passes were scarcely touched by the earliest beams of the dawn when these beams were also reflected from the steel caps and spears of the syrians under the command of a captain named monastras who with his tribe had attached himself to the empire the emperor at the head of his faithful varangians defiled through the passes in order to gain that degree of advance on the road to the city of laodicea which was desired so as to avoid coming into collision with the barbarians it was a goodly sight to see the dark mass of northern warriors who now led the van of the army moving slowly and steadily through the defiles of the mountains around the insulated rocks and precipices and surmounting the gentler acclivities like the course of a strong and mighty river while the loose bands of archers and javelinmen armed after the eastern manner were dispersed on the steep sides of the defiles and might be compared to light foam upon the edge of the torrent in the midst of the squadrons of the lifeguard might be seen the proud warhorse of his imperial majesty which pawed the earth indignantly as if impatient at the delay which separated him from his august burden the emperor alexius himself travelled in a litter borne by eight strong african slaves that he might rise perfectly refreshed if the army should be overtaken by the enemy the valiant achilles tatius rode near the couch of his master that none of those luminous ideas by which our august sire so often decided the fate of battle might be lost for want of instant communication to those whose duty it was to execute them i may also say that there were close to the litter of the emperor three or four carriages of the same kind one prepared for the moon as she may be termed of the universe the gracious empress irene among the others which might be mentioned was that which contained the authoress of this history unworthy as she may be of distinction save as the daughter of the eminent and sacred persons whom the narration chiefly concerns in this manner the imperial army pressed on through the dangerous defiles where their march was exposed to insults from the barbarians they were happily cleared without any opposition when we came to the descent of the pass which looks down on the city of laodicea the sagacity of the emperor commanded the van which though the soldiers composing the same were heavily armed had hitherto marched extremely fast to halt as well that they themselves might take some repose and refreshment as to give the rearward forces time to come up and close various gaps which the rapid movement of those in front had occasioned in the line of march the place chosen for this purpose was eminently beautiful from the small and comparatively insignificant ridge of hills which melt irregularly down into the plains stretching between the pass which we occupied and laodicea the town was about one hundred stadia distant and some of our more sanguine warriors pretended that they could already discern its towers and pinnacles glittering in the early beams of the sun which had not as yet risen high into the horizon a mountain torrent which found its source at the foot of a huge rock that yawned to give it birth as if struck by the rod of the prophet moses poured its liquid treasure down to the more level country nourishing herbage and even large trees in its descent until at the distance of some four or five miles the stream at least in dry seasons was lost amid heaps of sand and stones which in the rainy season marked the strength and fury of its current it was pleasant to see the attention of the emperor to the comforts of the companions and guardians of his march the trumpets from time to time gave license to various parties of the varangians to lay down their arms to eat the food which was distributed to them and quench their thirst at the pure stream which poured its bounties down the hill or they might be seen to extend their bulky forms upon the turf around them the emperor his most serene spouse arid the princesses and ladies were also served with breakfast at the fountain formed by the small brook in its very birth and which the reverent feelings of the soldiers had left unpolluted by vulgar touch for the use of that family emphatically said to be born in the purple our beloved husband was also present on this occasion and was among the first to detect one of the disasters of the day for although all the rest of the repast had been by the dexterity of the officers of the imperial mouth so arranged even on so awful an occasion as to exhibit little difference from the ordinary provisions of the household yet when his imperial highness called for wine behold not only was the sacred liquor dedicated to his own peculiar imperial use wholly exhausted or left behind but to use the language of horace not the vilest sabine vintage could be procured so that his imperial highness was glad to accept the offer of a rude varangian who proffered his modicum of decocted barley which these barbarians prefer to the juice of the grape the emperor nevertheless accepted of this coarse tribute insert said the emperor who had been hitherto either plunged in deep contemplation or in an incipient slumber insert i say these very words and with the heat of the morning and anxiety of so rapid a march with a numerous enemy in his rear the emperor was so thirsty as never in his life to think beverage more delicious in obedience to her imperial fathers orders the princess resigned the manuscript to the beautiful slave by whom it was written repeating to the fair scribe the commanded addition requiring her to note it as made by the express sacred command of the emperor and then proceeded thus more had i said here respecting the favourite liquor of your imperial highnesses faithful varangians but your highness having once graced it with a word of commendation this ail as they call it doubtless because removing all disorders which they term ailments becomes a theme too lofty for the discussion of any inferior person suffice it to say that thus were we all pleasantly engaged the ladies and slaves trying to find some amusement for the imperial ears the soldiers in a long line down the ravine seen in different postures some straggling to the watercourse some keeping guard over the arms of their comrades in which duty they relieved each other while body after body of the remaining troops under command of the protospathaire and particularly those called immortals footnote the greek athanatoi or immortals of the army of constantinople were a select body so named in imitation of the ancient persians they were first embodied according to ducange by michael ducas joined the main army as they came up those soldiers who were already exhausted were allowed to take a short repose after which they were sent forward with directions to advance steadily on the road to laodicea while their leader was instructed so soon as he should open a free communication with that city to send thither a command for reinforcements and refreshments not forgetting fitting provision of the sacred wine for the imperial mouth accordingly the roman bands of immortals and others had resumed their march and held some way on their journey it being the imperial pleasure that the varangians lately the vanguard should now form the rear of the whole army so as to bring off in safety the syrian light troops by whom the hilly pass was still occupied when we heard upon the other side of this defile which he had traversed with so much safety the awful sound of the lelies as the arabs name their shout of onset though in what language it is expressed it would be hard to say perchance some in this audience may enlighten my ignorance may i speak and live said the acoulouthos achilles proud of his literary knowledge the words are alla illa alla mohamed resoul allafootnote i e god is god mahomet is the prophet of god these or something like them contain the arabs profession of faith which they always call out when they join battle i have heard them many times and so have i said the emperor and as thou didst i warrant me i have sometimes wished myself anywhere else than within hearing all the circle were alive to hear the answer of achilles tatius he was too good a courtier however to make any imprudent reply it was my duty he replied to desire to be as near your imperial highness as your faithful follower ought wherever you might wish yourself for the time agelastes and zosimus exchanged looks and the princess anna comnena proceeded in her recitation the cause of these ominous sounds which came in wild confusion up the rocky pass was soon explained to us by a dozen cavaliers to whom the task of bringing intelligence had been assigned these informed us that the barbarians whose host had been dispersed around the position in which they had encamped the preceding day had not been enabled to get their forces together until our light troops were evacuating the post they had occupied for securing the retreat of our army they were then drawing off from the tops of the hills into the pass itself when in despite of the rocky ground they were charged furiously by jezdegerd at the head of a large body of his followers which after repeated exertions he had at length brought to operate on the rear of the syrians notwithstanding that the pass was unfavourable for cavalry the personal exertions of the infidel chief made his followers advance with a degree of resolution unknown to the syrians of the roman army who finding themselves at a distance from their companions formed the injurious idea that they were left thereto be sacrificed and thought of flight in various directions rather than of a combined and resolute resistance the state of affairs therefore at the further end of the pass was less favourable than we could wish and those whose curiosity desired to see something which might be termed the rout of the rear of an army beheld the syrians pursued from the hill tops overwhelmed and individually cut down and made prisoners by the bands of caitiff mussulmans his imperial highness looked upon the scene of battle for a few minutes and much commoved at what he saw was somewhat hasty in his directions to the varangians to resume their arms and precipitate their march towards laodicea whereupon one of those northern soldiers said boldly though in opposition to the imperial command if we attempt to go hastily down this hill our rearguard will be confused not only by our own hurry but by these runaway scoundrels of syrians who in their headlong flight will not fail to mix themselves among our ranks let two hundred varangians who will live and die for the honour of england abide in the very throat of this pass with me while the rest escort the emperor to this laodicea or whatever it is called we may perish in our defence but we shall die in our duty and i have little doubt but we shall furnish such a meal as will stay the stomach of these yelping hounds from seeking any farther banquet this day my imperial father at once discovered the importance of this advice though it made him wellnigh weep to see with what unshrinking fidelity these poor barbarians pressed to fill up the number of those who were to undertake this desperate duty with what kindness they took leave of their comrades and with what jovial shouts they followed their sovereign with their eyes as he proceeded on his march down the hill leaving them behind to resist and perish the imperial eyes were filled with tears and i am not ashamed to confess that amid the terror of the moment the empress and i myself forgot our rank in paying a similar tribute to these bold and selfdevoted men we left their leader carefully arraying his handful of comrades in defence of the pass where the middle path was occupied by their centre while their wings on either side were so disposed as to act upon the flanks of the enemy should he rashly press upon such as appeared opposed to him in the road we had not proceeded half way towards the plain when a dreadful shout arose in which the yells of the arabs were mingled with the deep and more regular shouts which these strangers usually repeat thrice as well when bidding hail to their commanders and princes as when in the act of engaging in battle many a look was turned back by their comrades and many a form was seen in the ranks which might have claimed the chisel of a sculptor while the soldier hesitated whether to follow the line of his duty which called him to march forward with his emperor or the impulse of courage which prompted him to rush back to join his companions discipline however prevailed and the main body marched on an hour had elapsed during which we heard from time to time the noise of battle when a mounted varangian presented himself at the side of the emperors litter the horse was covered with foam and had obviously from his trappings the fineness of his limbs and the smallness of his joints been the charger of some chief of the desert which had fallen by the chance of battle into the possession of the northern warrior the broad axe which the varangian bore was also stained with blood and the paleness of death itself was upon his countenance these marks of recent battle were held sufficient to excuse the irregularity of his salutation while he exclaimed noble prince the arabs are defeated and you may pursue your march at more leisure where is jezdegerd said the emperor who had many reasons for dreading this celebrated chief jezdegerd continued the varangian is where brave men are who fall in their duty and that is said the emperor impatient to know distinctly the fate of so formidable an adversary where i am now going answered the faithful soldier who dropped from his horse as he spoke and expired at the feet of the litter bearers the emperor called to his attendants to see that the body of this faithful retainer to whom he destined an honourable sepulchre was not left to the jackal or vulture and some of his brethren the anglosaxons among whom he was a man of no mean repute raised the body on their shoulders and resumed their march with this additional encumbrance prepared to fight for their precious burden like the valiant menelaus for the body of patroclus the princess anna comnena here naturally paused for having attained what she probably considered as the rounding of a period she was willing to gather an idea of the feelings of her audience indeed but that she had been intent upon her own manuscript the emotions of the foreign soldier must have more early attracted her attention in the beginning of her recitation he had retained the same attitude which he had at first assumed stiff and rigid as a sentinel upon duty and apparently remembering nothing save that he was performing that duty in presence of the imperial court as the narrative advanced however he appeared to take more interest in what was read the anxious fears expressed by the various leaders in the midnight council he listened to with a smile of suppressed contempt and he almost laughed at the praises bestowed upon the leader of his own corps achilles tatius nor did even the name of the emperor though listened to respectfully gain that applause for which his daughter fought so hard and used so much exaggeration hitherto the varangians countenance indicated very slightly any internal emotions but they appeared to take a deeper hold on his mind as she came to the description of the halt after the main army had cleared the pass the unexpected advance of the arabs the retreat of the column which escorted the emperor and the account of the distant engagement he lost on hearing the narration of these events the rigid and constrained look of a soldier who listened to the history of his emperor with the same feelings with which he would have mounted guard at his palace his colour began to come and go his eyes to fill and to sparkle his limbs to become more agitated than their owner seemed to assent to and his whole appearance was changed into that of a listener highly interested by the recitation which he hears and insensible or forgetful of whatever else is passing before him as well as of the quality of those who are present as the historian proceeded hereward became less able to conceal his agitation and at the moment the princess looked round his feelings became so acute that forgetting where he was he dropped his ponderous axe upon the floor and clasping his hands together exclaimed my unfortunate brother all were startled by the clang of the falling weapon and several persons at once attempted to interfere as called upon to explain a circumstance so unusual achilles tatius made some small progress in a speech designed to apologize for the rough mode of venting his sorrows to which hereward had given way by assuring the eminent persons present that the poor uncultivated barbarian was actually younger brother to him who had commanded and fallen at the memorable defile the princess said nothing but was evidently struck and affected and not illpleased perhaps at having given rise to feelings of interest so flattering to her as an authoress the others each in their character uttered incoherent words of what was meant to be consolation for distress which flows from a natural cause generally attracts sympathy even from the most artificial characters the voice of alexius silenced all these imperfect speakers hah my brave soldier edward said the emperor i must have been blind that i did not sooner recognise thee as i think there is a memorandum entered respecting five hundred pieces of gold due from us to edward the varangian we have it in our secret scroll of such liberalities for which we stand indebted to our servitors nor shall the payment be longer deferred not to me if it may please you my liege said the anglodane hastily composing his countenance into its rough gravity of lineament lest it should be to one who can claim no interest in your imperial munificence my name is hereward that of edward is borne by three of my companions all of them as likely as i to have deserved your highnesss reward for the faithful performance of their duty many a sign was made by tatius in order to guard his soldier against the folly of declining the liberality of the emperor agelastes spoke more plainly young man he said rejoice in an honour so unexpected and answer henceforth to no other name save that of edward by which it hath pleased the light of the world as it poured a ray upon thee to distinguish thee from other barbarians what is to thee the fontstone or the priest officiating thereat shouldst thou have derived from either any epithet different from that by which it hath now pleased the emperor to distinguish thee from the common mass of humanity and by which proud distinction thou hast now a right to be known ever afterwards hereward was the name of my father said the soldier who had now altogether recovered his composure i cannot abandon it while i honour his memory in death edward is the title of my comrade i must not run the risk of usurping his interest peace all interrupted the emperor if we have made a mistake we are rich enough to right it nor shall hereward be the poorer if an edward shall be found to merit this gratuity your highness may trust that to your affectionate consort answered the empress irene his most sacred highness said the princess anna comnena is so avariciously desirous to do whatever is good and gracious that he leaves no room even for his nearest connexions to display generosity or munificence nevertheless i in my degree will testify my gratitude to this brave man for where his exploits are mentioned in this history i will cause to be recorded this feat was done by hereward the anglodane whom it hath pleased his imperial majesty to call edward keep this good youth she continued bestowing at the same time a ring of price in token that we will not forget our engagement hereward accepted the token with a profound obeisance and a discomposure which his station rendered not unbecoming it was obvious to most persons present that the gratitude of the beautiful princess was expressed in a manner more acceptable to the youthful life guardsman than that of alexius comnenus he took the ring with great demonstration of thankfulness precious relic he said as he saluted this pledge of esteem by pressing it to his lips we may not remain long together but be assured bending reverently to the princess that death alone shall part us proceed our princely daughter said the empress irene you have done enough to show that valour is precious to her who can confer fame whether it be found in a roman or a barbarian the princess resumed her narrative with some slight appearance of embarrassment our movement upon laodicea was now resumed and continued with good hopes on the part of those engaged in the march yet instinctively we could not help casting our eyes to the rear which had been so long the direction in which we feared attack at length to our surprise a thick cloud of dust was visible on the descent of the hill half way betwixt us and the place at which we had halted some of the troops who composed our retreating body particularly those in the rear began to exclaim the arabs the arabs and their march assumed a more precipitate character when they believed themselves pursed by the enemy but the varangian guards affirmed with one voice that the dust was raised by the remains of their own comrades who left in the defence of the pass had marched off after having so valiantly maintained the station intrusted to them they fortified their opinion by professional remarks that the cloud of dust was more concentrated than if raised by the arab horse and they even pretended to assert from their knowledge of such cases that the number of their comrades had been much diminished in the action some syrian horsemen despatched to reconnoitre the approaching body brought intelligence corresponding with the opinion of the varangians in every particular the portion of the bodyguard had beaten back the arabs and their gallant leader had slain their chief jezdegerd in which service he was mortally wounded as this history hath already mentioned the survivors of the detachment diminished by one half were now on their march to join the emperor as fast as the encumbrance of bearing their wounded to a place of safety would permit the emperor alexius with one of those brilliant and benevolent ideas which mark his paternal character towards his soldiers ordered all the litters even that for his own most sacred use to be instantly sent back to relieve the bold varangians of the task of bearing the wounded the shouts of the varangians gratitude may be more easily conceived than described when they beheld the emperor himself descend from his litter like an ordinary cavalier and assume his warhorse at the same time that the most sacred empress as well as the authoress of this history with other princesses born in the purple mounted upon mules in order to proceed upon the march while their litters were unhesitatingly assigned for the accommodation of the wounded men this was indeed a mark as well of military sagacity as of humanity for the relief afforded to the bearers of the wounded enabled the survivors of those who had defended the defile at the fountain to join us sooner than would otherwise have been possible it was an awful thing to see those men who had left us in the full splendour which military equipment gives to youth and strength again appearing in diminished numbers their armour shattered their shields full of arrows their offensive weapons marked with blood and they themselves exhibiting all the signs of desperate and recent battle nor was it less interesting to remark the meeting of the soldiers who had been engaged with the comrades whom they had rejoined the emperor at the suggestion of the trusty acoulouthos permitted them a few moments to leave their ranks and learn from each other the fate of the battle as the two bands mingled it seemed a meeting where grief and joy had a contest together the most rugged of these barbarians and i who saw it can bear witness to the fact as he welcomed with a grasp of his strong hand some comrade whom he had given up for lost had his large blue eyes filled with tears at hearing of the loss of some one whom he had hoped might have survived other veterans reviewed the standards which had been in the conflict satisfied themselves that they had all been brought back in honour and safety and counted the fresh arrow shots with which they had been pierced in addition to similar marks of former battles all were loud in the praises of the brave young leader they had lost nor were the acclamations less general in laud of him who had succeeded to the command who brought up the party of his deceased brother and whom said the princess in a few words which seemed apparently interpolated for the occasion i now assure of the high honour and estimation in which he is held by the author of this history that is i would say by every member of the imperial family for his gallant services in such an important crisis having hurried over her tribute to her friend the varangian in which emotions mingled that are not willingly expressed before so many hearers anna comnena proceeded with composure in the part of her history which was less personal we had not much time to make more observations on what passed among those brave soldiers for a few minutes having been allowed to their feelings the trumpet sounded the advance towards laodicea and we soon beheld the town now about four miles from us in fields which were chiefly covered with trees apparently the garrison had already some notice of our approach for carts and wains were seen advancing from the gates with refreshments which the heat of the day the length of the march and columns of dust as well as the want of water had rendered of the last necessity to us the soldiers joyfully mended their pace in order to meet the sooner with the supplies of which they stood so much in need but as the cup doth not carry in all cases the liquid treasure to the lips for which it was intended however much it may be longed for what was our mortification to behold a cloud of arabs issue at full gallop from the wooded plain betwixt the roman army and the city and throw themselves upon the waggons slaying the drivers and making havoc and spoil of the contents this we afterwards learned was a body of the enemy headed by varanes equal in military fame among those infidels to jezdegerd his slain brother when this chieftain saw that it was probable that the varangians would succeed in their desperate defence of the pass he put himself at the head of a large body of the cavalry and as these infidels are mounted on horses unmatched either in speed or wind performed a long circuit traversed the stony ridge of hills at a more northerly defile and placed himself in ambuscade in the wooded plain i have mentioned with the hope of making an unexpected assault upon the emperor and his army at the very time when they might be supposed to reckon upon an undisputed retreat this surprise would certainly have taken place and it is not easy to say what might have been the consequence had not the unexpected appearance of the train of waggons awakened the unbridled rapacity of the arabs in spite of their commanders prudence and attempts to restrain them in this manner the proposed ambuscade was discovered but varanes willing still to gain some advantage from the rapidity of his movements assembled as many of his horsemen as could be collected from the spoil and pushed forward towards the romans who had stopped short on their march at so unlooked for an apparition there was an uncertainty and wavering in our first ranks which made their hesitation known even to so poor a judge of military demeanour as myself on the contrary the varangians joined in a unanimous cry of bills footnote villehardouin says les anglois et danois mult bien rombattoint avec leurs haches that is in their language battleaxes to the front and the emperors most gracious will acceding to their valorous desire they pressed forward from the rear to the head of the column i can hardly say how this manoeuvre was executed but it was doubtless by the wise directions of my most serene father distinguished for his presence of mind upon such difficult occasions it was no doubt much facilitated by the good will of the troops themselves the roman bands called the immortals showing as it seemed to me no less desire to fall into the rear than did the varangians to occupy the places which the immortals left vacant in front the manoeuvre was so happily executed that before varanes and his arabs had arrived at the van of our troops they found it occupied by the inflexible guard of northern soldiers i might have seen with my own eyes and called upon them as sure evidences of that which chanced upon the occasion but to confess the truth my eyes were little used to look upon such sights for of varaness charge i only beheld as it were a thick cloud of dust rapidly driven forward through which were seen the glittering points of lances and the waving plumes of turband cavaliers imperfectly visible the tecbir was so loudly uttered that i was scarcely aware that kettledrums and brazen cymbals were sounding in concert with it but this wild and outrageous storm was met as effectually as if encountered by a rock the varangians unshaken by the furious charge of the arabs received horse and rider with a shower of blows from their massive battleaxes which the bravest of the enemy could not face nor the strongest endure the guards strengthened their ranks also by the hindmost pressing so close upon those that went before after the manner of the ancient macedonians that the finelimbed though slight steeds of those idumeans could not make the least inroad upon the northern phalanx the bravest men the most gallant horses fell in the first rank the weighty though short horse javelins flung from the rear ranks of the brave varangians with good aim and sturdy arm completed the confusion of the assailants who turned their back in affright and fled from the field in total confusion the enemy thus repulsed we proceeded on our march and only halted when we recovered our halfplundered waggons here also some invidious remarks were made by certain officers of the interior of the household who had been on duty over the stores and having fled from their posts on the assault of the infidels had only returned upon their being repulsed these men quick in malice though slow in perilous service reported that on this occasion the varangians so far forgot their duty as to consume a part of the sacred wine reserved for the imperial lips alone it would be criminal to deny that this was a great and culpable oversight nevertheless our imperial hero passed it over as a pardonable offence remarking in a jesting manner that since he had drunk the ail as they termed it of his trusty guard the varangians had acquired a right to quench the thirst and to relieve the fatigue which they had undergone that day in his defence though they used for these purposes the sacred contents of the imperial cellar in the meantime the cavalry of the army were despatched in pursuit of the fugitive arabs and having succeeded in driving them behind the chain of hills which had so recently divided them from the romans the imperial arms might justly be considered as having obtained a complete and glorious victory we are now to mention the rejoicings of the citizens of laodicea who having witnessed from their ramparts with alternate fear and hope the fluctuations of the battle now descended to congratulate the imperial conqueror here the fair narrator was interrupted the principal entrance of the apartment flew open noiselessly indeed but with both folding leaves at once not as if to accommodate the entrance of an ordinary courtier studying to create as little disturbance as possible but as if there was entering a person who ranked so high as to make it indifferent how much attention was drawn to his motions it could only be one born in the purple or nearly allied to it to whom such freedom was lawful and most of the guests knowing who were likely to appear in that temple of the muses anticipated from the degree of bustle the arrival of nicephorus briennius the soninlaw of alexius comnenus the husband to the fair historian and in the rank of caesar which however did not at that period imply as in early ages the dignity of second person in the empire the policy of alexius had interposed more than one person of condition between the caesar and his original rights and rank which had once been second to those only of the emperor himself chapter the fifth the storm increases tis no sunny shower fosterd in the moist breast of march or april or such as parched summer cools his lip with heavens windows are flung wide the inmost deeps call in hoarse greeting one upon another on comes the flood in all its foaming horrors and wheres the dike shall stop it the deluge a poem the distinguished individual who entered was a noble grecian of stately presence whose habit was adorned with every mark of dignity saving those which alexius had declared sacred to the emperors own person and that of the sebastocrator whom he had established as next in rank to the head of the empire nicephorus briennius who was in the bloom of youth retained all the marks of that manly beauty which had made the match acceptable to anna comnena while political considerations and the desire of attaching a powerful house as friendly adherents of the throne recommended the union to the emperor we have already hinted that the royal bride had though in no great degree the very doubtful advantage of years of her literary talents we have seen tokens yet it was not believed by those who best knew that with the aid of those claims to respect anna comnena was successful in possessing the unlimited attachment of her handsome husband to treat her with apparent neglect her connexion with the crown rendered impossible while on the other hand the power of nicephoruss family was too great to permit his being dictated to even by the emperor himself he was possessed of talents as it was believed calculated both for war and peace his advice was therefore listened to and his assistance required so that he claimed complete liberty with respect to his own time which he sometimes used with less regular attendance upon the temple of the muses than the goddess of the place thought herself entitled to or than the empress irene was disposed to exact on the part of her daughter the goodhumoured alexius observed a sort of neutrality in this matter and kept it as much as possible from becoming visible to the public conscious that it required the whole united strength of his family to maintain his place in so agitated an empire he pressed his soninlaws hand as nicephorus passing his fatherin laws seat bent his knee in token of homage the constrained manner of the empress indicated a more cold reception of her soninlaw while the fair muse herself scarcely deigned to signify her attention to his arrival when her handsome mate assumed the vacant seat by her side which we have already made mention of there was an awkward pause during which the imperial soninlaw coldly received when he expected to be welcomed attempted to enter into some light conversation with the fair slave astarte who knelt behind her mistress this was interrupted by the princess commanding her attendant to enclose the manuscript within its appropriate casket and convey it with her own hands to the cabinet of apollo the usual scene of the princesss studies as the temple of the muses was that commonly dedicated to her recitations the emperor himself was the first to break an unpleasant silence fair soninlaw he said though it now wears something late in the night you will do yourself wrong if you permit our anna to send away that volume with which this company have been so delectably entertained that they may well say that the desert hath produced roses and the barren rocks have poured forth milk and honey so agreeable is the narrative of a toilsome and dangerous campaign in the language of our daughter the caesar said the empress seems to have little taste for such dainties as this family can produce he hath of late repeatedly absented himself from this temple of the muses and found doubtless more agreeable conversation and amusement elsewhere i trust madam said nicephorus that my taste may vindicate me from the charge implied but it is natural that our sacred father should be most delighted with the milk and honey which is produced for his own special use the princess spoke in the tone of a handsome woman offended by her lover and feeling the offence yet not indisposed to a reconciliation if she said the deeds of nicephorus briennius are less frequently celebrated in that poor roll of parchment than those of my illustrious father he must do me the justice to remember that such was his own special request either proceeding from that modesty which is justly ascribed to him as serving to soften and adorn his other attributes or because he with justice distrusts his wifes power to compose their eulogium we will then summon back astarte said the empress who cannot yet have carried her offering to the cabinet of apollo with your imperial pleasure said nicephorus it might incense the pythian god were a deposit to be recalled of which he alone can fitly estimate the value i came hither to speak with the emperor upon pressing affairs of state and not to hold a literary conversation with a company which i must needs say is something of a miscellaneous description since i behold an ordinary lifeguardsman in the imperial circle by the rood soninlaw said alexius you do this gallant man wrong he is the brother of that brave anglodane who secured the victory at laodicea by his valiant conduct and death he himself is that edmund or edward or hereward to whom we are ever bound for securing the success of that victorious day he was called into our presence son inlaw since it imports that you should know so much to refresh the memory of any follower achilles tatius as well as mine own concerning some transactions of the day of which we had become in some degree oblivious truly imperial sir answered briennius i grieve that by having intruded on some such important researches i may have in some degree intercepted a portion of that light which is to illuminate future ages methinks that in a battlefield fought under your imperial guidance and that of your great captains your evidence might well supersede the testimony of such a man as this let me know he added turning haughtily to the varangian what particular thou canst add that is unnoticed in the princesss narrative the varangian replied instantly only that when we made a halt at the fountain the music that was there made by the ladies of the emperors household and particularly by those two whom i now behold was the most exquisite that ever reached my ears hah darest thou to speak so audacious an opinion exclaimed nicephorus is it for such as thou to suppose for a moment that the music which the wife and daughter of the emperor might condescend to make was intended to afford either matter of pleasure or of criticism to every plebeian barbarian who might hear them begone from this place nor dare on any pretext again to appear before mine eyes under allowance always of our imperial fathers pleasure the varangian bent his looks upon achilles tatius as the person from whom he was to take his orders to stay or withdraw but the emperor himself took up the subject with considerable dignity son he said we cannot permit this on account of some love quarrel as it would seem betwixt you and our daughter you allow yourself strangely to forget our imperial rank and to order from our presence those whom we have pleased to call to attend us this is neither right nor seemly nor is it our pleasure that this same hereward or edward or whatever be his name either leave us at this present moment or do at any time hereafter regulate himself by any commands save our own or those of our follower achilles tatius and now allowing this foolish affair which i think was blown among us by the wind to pass as it came without farther notice we crave to know the grave matters of state which brought you to our presence at so late an hour you look again at this varangian withhold not your words i pray you on account of his presence for he stands as high in our trust and we are convinced with as good reason as any counsellor who has been sworn our domestic servant to hear is to obey returned the emperors soninlaw who saw that alexius was somewhat moved and knew that in such cases it was neither safe nor expedient to drive him to extremity what i have to say continued he must so soon be public news that it little matters who hears it and yet the west so full of strange changes never sent to the eastern half of the globe tidings so alarming as those i now come to tell your imperial highness europe to borrow an expression from this lady who honours me by calling me husband seems loosened from its foundations and about to precipitate itself upon asia so i did express myself said the princess anna comnena and as i trust not altogether unforcibly when we first heard that the wild impulse of those restless barbarians of europe had driven a tempest as of a thousand nations upon our western frontier with the extravagant purpose as they pretended of possessing themselves of syria and the holy places there marked as the sepulchres of prophets the martyrdom of saints and the great events detailed in the blessed gospel but that storm by all accounts hath burst and passed away and we well hoped that the danger had gone with it devoutly shall we sorrow to find it otherwise and otherwise we must expect to find it said her husband it is very true as reported to us that a huge body of men of low rank and little understanding assumed arms at the instigation of a mad hermit and took the road from germany to hungary expecting miracles to be wrought in their favour as when israel was guided through the wilderness by a pillar of flame and a cloud but no showers of manna or of quails relieved their necessities or proclaimed them the chosen people of god no waters gushed from the rock for their refreshment they were enraged at their sufferings and endeavoured to obtain supplies by pillaging the country the hungarians and other nations on our western frontiers christians like themselves did not hesitate to fall upon this disorderly rabble and immense piles of bones in wild passes and unfrequented deserts attest the calamitous defeats which extirpated these unholy pilgrims all this said the emperor we knew before but what new evil now threatens since we have already escaped so important a one knew before said the prince nicephorus we knew nothing of our real danger before save that a wild herd of animals as brutal and as furious as wild bulls threatened to bend their way to a pasture for which they had formed a fancy and deluged the grecian empire and its vicinity in their passage expecting that palestine with its streams of milk and honey once more awaited them as gods predestined people but so wild and disorderly an invasion had no terrors for a civilized nation like the romans the brute herd was terrified by our greek fire it was snared and shot down by the wild nations who while they pretend to independence cover our frontier as with a protecting fortification the vile multitude has been consumed even by the very quality of the provisions thrown in their way those wise means of resistance which were at once suggested by the paternal care of the emperor and by his unfailing policy thus wisdom has played its part and the bark over which the tempest had poured its thunder has escaped notwithstanding all its violence but the second storm by which the former is so closely followed is of a new descent of these western nations more formidable than any which we or our fathers have yet seen this consists not of the ignorant or of the fanatical not of the base the needy and the improvident now all that wide europe possesses of what is wise and worthy brave and noble are united by the most religious vows in the same purpose and what is that purpose speak plainly said alexius the destruction of our whole roman empire and the blotting out the very name of its chief from among the princes of the earth among which it has long been predominant can alone be an adequate motive for a confederacy such as thy speech infers no such design is avowed said nicephorus and so many princes wise men and statesmen of eminence aim it is pretended at nothing else than the same extravagant purpose announced by the brute multitude who first appeared in these regions here most gracious emperor is a scroll in which you will find marked down a list of the various armies which by different routes are approaching the vicinity of the empire behold hugh of vermandois called from his dignity hugh the great has set sail from the shores of italy twenty knights have already announced their coming sheathed in armour of steel inlaid with gold bearing this proud greeting let the emperor of greece and his lieutenants understand that hugo earl of vermandois is approaching his territories he is brother to the king of kings the king of france footnote ducange pours out a whole ocean of authorities to show that the king of france was in those days styled rex by way of eminence see his notes on the alexiad anna comnena in her history makes hugh of vermandois assume to himself the titles which could only in the most enthusiastic frenchmans opinion have been claimed by his older brother the reigning monarch namely and is attended by the flower of the french nobility he bears the blessed banner of st peter intrusted to his victorious care by the holy successor of the apostle and warns thee of all this that thou mayst provide a reception suitable to his rank here are sounding words said the emperor but the wind which whistles loudest is not always most dangerous to the vessel we know something of this nation of france and have heard more they are as petulant at least as they are valiant we will flatter their vanity till we get time and opportunity for more effectual defence tush if words can pay debt there is no fear of our exchequer becoming insolvent what follows here nicephorus a list i suppose of the followers of this great count my liege no answered nicephorus briennius so many independent chiefs as your imperial highness sees in that memorial so many independent european armies are advancing by different routes towards the east and announce the conquest of palestine from the infidels as their common object a dreadful enumeration said the emperor as he perused the list yet so far happy that its very length assures us of the impossibility that so many princes can be seriously and consistently united in so wild a project thus already my eyes catch the wellknown name of an old friend our enemy for such are the alternate chances of peace and war bohemond of antioch is not he the son of the celebrated robert of apulia so renowned among his countrymen who raised himself to the rank of grand duke from a simple cavalier and became sovereign of those of his warlike nation both in sicily and italy did not the standards of the german emperor of the roman pontiff nay our own imperial banners give way before him until equally a wily statesman and a brave warrior he became the terror of europe from being a knight whose norman castle would have been easily garrisoned by six crossbows and as many lances it is a dreadful family a race of craft as well as power but bohemond the son of old robert will follow his fathers politics he may talk of palestine and of the interests of christendom but if i can make his interests the same with mine he is not likely to be guided by any other object so then with the knowledge i already possess of his wishes and projects it may chance that heaven sends us an ally in the guise of an enemy whom have we next godfrey footnote godfrey of bouillon duke of lower lorraine the great captain of the first crusade afterwards king of jerusalem see gibbon or mills passim duke of bouillon leading i see a most formidable band from the banks of a huge river called the rhine what is this persons character as we hear replied nicephorus this godfrey is one of the wisest noblest and bravest of the leaders who have thus strangely put themselves in motion and among a list of independent princes as many in number as those who assembled for the siege of troy and followed most of them by subjects ten times more numerous this godfrey may be regarded as the agamemnon the princes and counts esteem him because he is the foremost in the ranks of those whom they fantastically call knights and also on account of the good faith and generosity which he practises in all his transactions the clergy give him credit for the highest zeal for the doctrines of religion and a corresponding respect for the church and its dignitaries justice liberality and frankness have equally attached to this godfrey the lower class of the people his general attention to moral obligations is a pledge to them that his religion is real and gifted with so much that is excellent he is already although inferior in rank birth and power to many chiefs of the crusade justly regarded as one of its principal leaders pity said the emperor that a character such as you describe this prince to be should be under the dominion of a fanaticism scarce worthy of peter the hermit or the clownish multitude which he led or of the very ass which he rode upon which i am apt to think the wisest of the first multitude whom we beheld seeing that it ran away towards europe as soon as water and barley became scarce might i be permitted here to speak and yet live said agelastes i would remark that the patriarch himself made a similar retreat so soon as blows became plenty and food scarce thou hast hit it agelastes said the emperor but the question now is whether an honorable and important principality could not be formed out of part of the provinces of the lesser asia now laid waste by the turks such a principality methinks with its various advantages of soil climate industrious inhabitants and a healthy atmosphere were well worth the morasses of bouillon it might be held as a dependence upon the sacred roman empire and garrisoned as it were by godfrey and his victorious franks would be a bulwark on that point to our just and sacred person ha most holy patriarch would not such a prospect shake the most devout crusaders attachment to the burning sands of palestine especially answered the patriarch if the prince for whom such a rich theme footnote these provinces were called themes was changed into a feudal appanage should be previously converted to the only true faith as your imperial highness undoubtedly means certainly most unquestionably answered the emperor with a due affectation of gravity notwithstanding he was internally conscious how often he had been compelled by state necessities to admit not only latin christians but manicheans and other heretics nay mahomedan barbarians into the number of his subjects and that without experiencing opposition from the scruples of the patriarch here i find continued the emperor such a numerous list of princes and principalities in the act of approaching our boundaries as might well rival the armies of old who were said to have drunk up rivers exhausted realms and trode down forests in their wasteful advance as he pronounced these words a shade of paleness came over the imperial brow similar to that which had already clothed in sadness most of his counsellors this war of nations said nicephorus has also circumstances distinguishing it from every other save that which his imperial highness hath waged in former times against those whom we are accustomed to call franks we must go forth against a people to whom the strife of combat is as the breath of their nostrils who rather than not be engaged in war will do battle with their nearest neighbours and challenge each other to mortal fight as much in sport as we would defy a comrade to a chariotrace they are covered with an impenetrable armour of steel defending them from blows of the lance and sword and which the uncommon strength of their horses renders them able to support though one of ours could as well bear mount olympus upon his loins their footranks carry a missile weapon unknown to us termed an arblast or crossbow it is not drawn with the right hand like the bow of other nations but by placing the feet upon the weapon itself and pulling with the whole force of the body and it despatches arrows called bolts of hard wood pointed with iron which the strength of the bow can send through the strongest breastplates and even through stone walls where not of uncommon thickness enough said the emperor we have seen with our own eyes the lances of frankish knights and the crossbows of their infantry if heaven has allotted them a degree of bravery which to other nations seems wellnigh preternatural the divine will has given to the greek councils that wisdom which it hath refused to barbarians the art of achieving conquest by wisdom rather than brute force obtaining by our skill in treaty advantages which victory itself could not have procured if we have not the use of that dreadful weapon which our soninlaw terms the crossbow heaven in its favour has concealed from these western barbarians the composition and use of the greek fire well so called since by grecian hands alone it is prepared and by such only can its lightnings be darted upon the astonished foe the emperor paused and looked around him and although the faces of his counsellors still looked blank he boldly proceeded but to return yet again to this black scroll containing the names of those nations who approach our frontier here occur more than one with which methinks old memory should make us familiar though our recollections are distant and confused it becomes us to know who these men are that we may avail ourselves of those feuds and quarrels among them which being blown into life may happily divert them from the prosecution of this extraordinary attempt in which they are now united here is for example one robert styled duke of normandy who commands a goodly band of counts with which title we are but too well acquainted of earls a word totally strange to us but apparently some barbaric title of honour and of knights whose names are compounded as we think chiefly of the french language but also of another jargon which we are not ourselves competent to understand to you most reverend and most learned patriarch we may fittest apply for information on this subject the duties of my station replied the patriarch zosimus have withheld my riper years from studying the history of distant realms but the wise agelastes who hath read as many volumes as would fill the shelves of the famous alexandrian library can no doubt satisfy your imperial majestys enquiries agelastes erected himself on those enduring legs which had procured him the surname of elephant and began a reply to the enquiries of the emperor rather remarkable for readiness than accuracy i have read said he in that brilliant mirror which reflects the time of our fathers the volumes of the learned procopius that the people separately called normans and angles are in truth the same race and that normandy sometimes so called is in fact a part of a district of gaul beyond and nearly opposite to it but separated by an arm of the sea lies a ghastly region on which clouds and tempests for ever rest and which is well known to its continental neighbours as the abode to which departed spirits are sent after this life on one side of the strait dwell a few fishermen men possessed of a strange charter and enjoying singular privileges in consideration of their being the living ferrymen who performing the office of the heathen charon carry the spirits of the departed to the island which is their residence after death at the dead of night these fishermen are in rotation summoned to perform the duty by which they seem to hold the permission to reside on this strange coast a knock is heard at the door of his cottage who holds the turn of this singular service sounded by no mortal hand a whispering as of a decaying breeze summons the ferryman to his duty he hastens to his bark on the seashore and has no sooner launched it than he perceives its hull sink sensibly in the water so as to express the weight of the dead with whom it is filled no form is seen and though voices are heard yet the accents are undistinguishable as of one who speaks in his sleep thus he traverses the strait between the continent and the island impressed with the mysterious awe which affects the living when they are conscious of the presence of the dead they arrive upon the opposite coast where the cliffs of white chalk form a strange contrast with the eternal darkness of the atmosphere they stop at a landingplace appointed but disembark not for the land is never trodden by earthly feet here the passageboat is gradually lightened of its unearthly inmates who wander forth in the way appointed to them while the mariners slowly return to their own side of the strait having performed for the time this singular service by which they hold their fishinghuts and their possessions on that strange coast here he ceased and the emperor replied if this legend be actually told us by procopius most learned agelastes it shows that that celebrated historian came more near the heathen than the christian belief respecting the future state in truth this is little more than the old fable of the infernal styx procopius we believe lived before the decay of heathenism and as we would gladly disbelieve much which he hath told us respecting our ancestor and predecessor justinian so we will not pay him much credit in future in point of geographical knowledge meanwhile what ails thee achilles tatius and why dost thou whisper with that soldier my head answered achilles tatius is at your imperial command prompt to pay for the unbecoming trespass of my tongue i did but ask of this hereward here what he knew of this matter for i have heard my varangians repeatedly call themselves anglodanes normans britons or some other barbaric epithet and i am sure that one or other or it may be all of these barbarous sounds at different times serve to designate the birthplace of these exiles too happy in being banished from the darkness of barbarism to the luminous vicinity of your imperial presence speak then varangian in the name of heaven said the emperor and let us know whether we are to look for friends or enemies in those men of normandy who are now approaching our frontier speak with courage man and if thou apprehendest danger remember thou servest a prince well qualified to protect thee since i am at liberty to speak answered the lifeguardian although my knowledge of the greek language which you term the roman is but slight i trust it is enough to demand of his imperial highness in place of all pay donative or gift whatsoever since he has been pleased to talk of designing such for me that he would place me in the first line of battle which shall be formed against these same normans and their duke robert and if he pleases to allow me the aid of such varangians as for love of me or hatred of their ancient tyrants may be disposed to join their arms to mine i have little doubt so to settle our long accounts with these men that the grecian eagles and wolves shall do them the last office by tearing the flesh from their bones what dreadful feud is this my soldier said the emperor that after so many years still drives thee to such extremities when the very name of normandy is mentioned your imperial highness shall be judge said the varangian my fathers and those of most though not all of the corps to whom i belong are descended from a valiant race who dwelt in the north of germany called anglosaxons nobody save a priest possessed of the art of consulting ancient chronicles can even guess how long it is since they came to the island of britain then distracted with civil war they came however on the petition of the natives of the island for the aid of the angles was requested by the southern inhabitants provinces were granted in recompense of the aid thus liberally afforded and the greater proportion of the island became by degrees the property of the anglosaxons who occupied it at first as several principalities and latterly as one kingdom speaking the language and observing the laws of most of those who now form your imperial body guard of varangians or exiles in process of time the northmen became known to the people of the more southern climates they were so called from their coming from the distant regions of the baltic sea an immense ocean sometimes frozen with ice as hard as the cliffs of mount caucasus they came seeking milder regions than nature had assigned them at home and the climate of france being delightful and its people slow in battle they extorted from them the grant of a large province which was from the name of the new settlers called normandy though i have heard my father say that was not its proper appellation they settled there under a duke who acknowledged the superior authority of the king of france that is to say obeying him when it suited his convenience so to do now it chanced many years since while these two nations of normans and anglosaxons were quietly residing upon different sides of the saltwater channel which divides france from england that william duke of normandy suddenly levied a large army came over to kent which is on the opposite side of the channel and there defeated in a great battle harold who was at that time king of the anglosaxons it is but grief to tell what followed battles have been fought in old time that have had dreadful results which years nevertheless could wash away but at hastings o woes me the banner of my country fell never again to be raised up oppression has driven her wheel over us all that was valiant amongst us have left the land and of englishmen for such is our proper designation no one remains in england save as the thrall of the invaders many men of danish descent who had found their way on different occasions to england were blended in the common calamity all was laid desolate by the command of the victors my fathers home lies now an undistinguished ruin amid an extensive forest composed out of what were formerly fair fields and domestic pastures where a manly race derived nourishment by cultivating a friendly soil the fire has destroyed the church where sleep the fathers of my race and i the last of their line am a wanderer in other climates a fighter of the battles of others the servant of a foreign though a kind master in a word one of the banished a varangian happier in that station said achilles tatius than in all the barbaric simplicity which your forefathers prized so highly since you are now under the cheering influence of that smile which is the life of the world it avails not talking of this said the varangian with a cold gesture these normans said the emperor are then the people by whom the celebrated island of britain is now conquered and governed it is but too true answered the varangian they are then a brave and warlike people said alexius it would be base and false to say otherwise of an enemy said hereward wrong have they done me and a wrong never to be atoned but to speak falsehood of them were but a womans vengeance mortal enemies as they are to me and mingling with all my recollections as that which is hateful and odious yet were the troops of europe mustered as it seems they are likely to be no nation or tribe dared in gallantry claim the advance of the haughty norman and this duke robert who is he that answered the varangian i cannot so well explain he is the son the eldest son as men say of the tyrant william who subdued england when i hardly existed or was a child in the cradle that william the victor of hastings is now dead we are assured by concurring testimony but while it seems his eldest son duke robert has become his heir to the duchy of normandy some other of his children have been so fortunate as to acquire the throne of england unless indeed like the petty farm of some obscure yeoman the fair kingdom has been divided among the tyrants issue concerning this said the emperor we have heard something which we shall try to reconcile with the soldiers narrative at leisure holding the words of this honest varangian as positive proof in whatsoever he avers from his own knowledge and now my grave and worthy counsellors we must close this evenings service in the temple of the muses this distressing news brought us by our dearest soninlaw the caesar having induced us to prolong our worship of these learned goddesses deeper into the night than is consistent with the health of our beloved wife and daughter while to ourselves this intelligence brings subject for grave deliberation the courtiers exhausted their ingenuity in forming the most ingenious prayers that all evil consequences should be averted which could attend this excessive vigilance nicephorus and his fair bride spoke together as a pair equally desirous to close an accidental breach between them some things thou hast said my caesar observed the lady in detailing this dreadful intelligence as elegantly turned as if the nine goddesses to whom this temple is dedicated had lent each her aid to the sense and expression i need none of their assistance answered nicephorus since i possess a muse of my own in whose genius are included all those attributes which the heathens vainly ascribed to the nine deities of parnassus it is well said the fair historian retiring by the assistance of her husbands arm but if you will load your wife with praises far beyond her merits you must lend her your arm to support her under the weighty burden you have been pleased to impose the council parted when the imperial persons had retired and most of them sought to indemnify themselves in more free though less dignified circles for the constraint which they had practised in the temple of the muses chapter the sixth vain man thou mayst esteem thy love as fair as fond hyperboles suffice to raise she may be all thats matchless in her person and alldivine in soul to match her body but take this from me thou shalt never call her superior to her sex while one survives and i am her true votary old play achilles tatius with his faithful varangian close by his shoulder melted from the dispersing assembly silently and almost invisibly as snow is dissolved from its alpine abodes as the days become more genial no lordly step nor clash of armour betokened the retreat of the military persons the very idea of the necessity of guards was not ostentatiously brought forward because so near the presence of the emperor the emanation supposed to flit around that divinity of earthly sovereigns had credit for rendering it impassive and unassailable thus the oldest and most skilful courtiers among whom our friend agelastes was not to be forgotten were of opinion that although the emperor employed the ministry of the varangians and other guards it was rather for forms sake than from any danger of the commission of a crime of a kind so heinous that it was the fashion to account it almost impossible and this doctrine of the rare occurrence of such a crime was repeated from month to month in those very chambers where it had oftener than once been perpetrated and sometimes by the very persons who monthly laid schemes for carrying some dark conspiracy against the reigning emperor into positive execution at length the captain of the lifeguardsmen and his faithful attendant found themselves on the outside of the blacquernal palace the passage which achilles found for their exit was closed by a postern which a single varangian shut behind them drawing at the same time bolt and bar with an illomened and jarring sound looking back at the mass of turrets battlements and spires out of which they had at length emerged hereward could not but feel his heart lighten to find himself once more under the deep blue of a grecian heaven where the planets were burning with unusual lustre he sighed and rubbed his hands with pleasure like a man newly restored to liberty he even spoke to his leader contrary to his custom unless addressed methinks the air of yonder halls valorous captain carries with it a perfume which though it may be well termed sweet is so suffocating as to be more suitable to sepulchrous chambers than to the dwellings of men happy i am that i am free as i trust from its influences be happy then said achilles tatius since thy vile cloddish spirit feels suffocation rather than refreshment in gales which instead of causing death might recall the dead themselves to life yet this i will say for thee hereward that born a barbarian within the narrow circle of a savages desires and pleasures and having no idea of life save what thou derivest from such vile and base connexions thou art nevertheless designed by nature for better things and hast this day sustained a trial in which i fear me not even one of mine own noble corps frozen as they are into lumps of unfashioned barbarity could have equalled thy bearing and speak now in true faith hast not thou been rewarded that will i never deny said the varangian the pleasure of knowing twentyfour hours perhaps before my comrades that the normans are coming hither to afford us a full revenge of the bloody day of hastings is a lordly recompense for the task of spending some hours in hearing the lengthened chat of a lady who has written about she knows not what and the flattering commentaries of the bystanders who pretended to give her an account of what they did not themselves stop to witness hereward my good youth said achilles tatius thou ravest and i think i should do well to place thee under the custody of some person of skill too much hardihood my valiant soldier is in soberness allied to overdaring it was only natural that thou shouldst feel a becoming pride in thy late position yet let it but taint thee with vanity and the effect will be little short of madness why thou hast looked boldly in the face of a princess born in the purple before whom my own eyes though well used to such spectacles are never raised beyond the foldings of her veil so be it in the name of heaven replied hereward nevertheless handsome faces were made to look upon and the eyes of young men to see withal if such be their final end said achilles never did thine i will freely suppose find a richer apology for the somewhat overbold license which thou tookest in thy gaze upon the princess this evening good leader or follower whichever is your favourite title said the anglobriton drive not to extremity a plain man who desires to hold his duty in all honour to the imperial family the princess wife of the caesar and born you tell me of a purple colour has now inherited notwithstanding the features of a most lovely woman she hath composed a history of which i presume not to form a judgment since i cannot understand it she sings like an angel and to conclude after the fashion of the knights of this day though i deal not ordinarily with their language i would say cheerfully that i am ready to place myself in lists against any one whomsoever who dares detract from the beauty of the imperial anna comnenas person or from the virtues of her mind having said this my noble captain we have said all that it is competent for you to inquire into or for me to answer that there are hansomer women than the princess is unquestionable and i question it the less that i have myself seen a person whom i think far her superior and with that let us close the dialogue thy beauty thou unparalleled fool said achilles must i ween be the daughter of the largebodied northern boor living next door to him upon whose farm was brought up the person of an ass curst with such intolerable want of judgment you may say your pleasure captain replied hereward because it is the safer for us both that thou canst not on such a topic either offend me who hold thy judgment as light as thou canst esteem mine or speak any derogation of a person whom you never saw but whom if you had seen perchance i might not so patiently have brooked any reflections upon even at the hands of a military superior achilles tatius had a good deal of the penetration necessary for one in his situation he never provoked to extremity the daring spirits whom he commanded and never used any freedom with them beyond the extent that he knew their patience could bear hereward was a favourite soldier and had in that respect at least a sincere liking and regard for his commander when therefore the follower instead of resenting his petulance goodhumouredly apologized for having hurt his feelings the momentary displeasure between them was at an end the officer at once reassumed his superiority and the soldier sunk back with a deep sigh given to some period which was long past into his wonted silence and reserve indeed the follower had another and further design upon hereward of which he was as yet unwilling to do more than give a distant hint after a long pause during which they approached the barracks a gloomy fortified building constructed for the residence of their corps the captain motioned his soldier to draw close up to his side and proceeded to ask him in a confidential tone hereward my friend although it is scarce to be supposed that in the presence of the imperial family thou shouldst mark any one who did not partake of their blood or rather as homer has it who did not participate of the divine ichor which in their sacred persons supplies the place of that vulgar fluid yet during so long an audience thou mightst possibly from his uncourtly person and attire have distinguished agelastes whom we courtiers call the elephant from his strict observation of the rule which forbids any one to sit down or rest in the imperial presence i think replied the soldier i marked the man you mean his age was some seventy and upwards a big burly person and the baldness which reached to the top of his head was well atoned for by a white beard of prodigious size which descended in waving curls over his breast and reached to the towel with which his loins were girded instead of the silken sash used by other persons of rank most accurately marked my varangian said the officer what else didst thou note about this person his cloak was in its texture as coarse as that of the meanest of the people but it was strictly clean as if it had been the intention of the wearer to exhibit poverty or carelessness and contempt of dress avoiding at the same time every particular which implied anything negligent sordid or disgusting by st sophia said the officer thou astonishest me the prophet baalam was not more surprised when his ass turned round her head and spoke to him and what else didst thou note concerning this man i see those who meet thee must beware of thy observation as well as of thy battleaxe if it please your valour answered the soldier we english have eyes as well as hands but it is only when discharging our duty that we permit our tongues to dwell on what we have observed i noted but little of this mans conversation but from what i heard it seemed he was not unwilling to play what we call the jester or jackpudding in the conversation a character which considering the mans age and physiognomy is not i should be tempted to say natural but assumed for some purpose of deeper import hereward answered his officer thou hast spoken like an angel sent down to examine mens bosoms that man agelastes is a contradiction such as earth has seldom witnessed possessing all that wisdom which in former times united the sages of this nation with the gods themselves agelastes has the same cunning as the elder brutus who disguised his talents under the semblance of an idle jester he appears to seek no office he desires no consideration he pays suit at court only when positively required to do so yet what shall i say my soldier concerning the cause of an influence gained without apparent effort and extending almost into the very thoughts of men who appear to act as he would desire without his soliciting them to that purpose men say strange things concerning the extent of his communications with other beings whom our fathers worshipped with prayer and sacrifice i am determined however to know the road by which he climbs so high and so easily towards the point to which all men aspire at court and it will go hard but he shall either share his ladder with me or i will strike its support from under him thee hereward i have chosen to assist me in this matter as the knights among these frankish infidels select when going upon an adventure a sturdy squire or inferior attendant to share the dangers and the recompense and this i am moved to as much by the shrewdness thou hast this night manifested as by the courage which thou mayst boast in common with or rather beyond thy companions i am obliged and i thank your valour replied the varangian more coldly perhaps than his officer expected i am ready as is my duty to serve you in anything consistent with god and the emperors claims upon my service i would only say that as a sworn inferior soldier i will do nothing contrary to the laws of the empire and as a sincere though ignorant christian i will have nothing to do with the gods of the heathens save to defy them in the name and strength of the holy saints idiot said achilles tatius dost thou think that i already possessed of one of the first dignities of the empire could meditate anything contrary to the interests of alexius comnenus or what would be scarce more atrocious that i the chosen friend and ally of the reverend patriarch zosimus should meddle with anything bearing a relation however remote to heresy or idolatry truly answered the varangian no one would be more surprised or grieved than i should but when we walk in a labyrinth we must assume and announce that we have a steady and forward purpose which is one mode at least of keeping a straight path the people of this country have so many ways of saying the same thing that one can hardly know at last what is their real meaning we english on the other hand can only express ourselves in one set of words but it is one out of which all the ingenuity of the world could not extract a double meaning tis well said his officer tomorrow we will talk more of this for which purpose thou wilt come to my quarters a little after sunset and hark thee tomorrow while the sun is in heaven shall be thine own either to sport thyself or to repose employ thy time in the latter by my advice since tomorrow night like the present may find us both watchers so saying they entered the barracks where they parted company the commander of the lifeguards taking his way to a splendid set of apartments which belonged to him in that capacity and the anglosaxon seeking his humble accommodations as a subaltern officer of the same corps chapter the seventh such forces met not nor so vast a camp when agrican with all his northern powers besieged albraeca as romances tell the city of gallaphron from thence to win the fairest of her sex angelica his daughter sought by many prowessd knights both paynim and the peers of charlemagne paradise regained early on the morning of the day following that which we have commemorated the imperial council was assembled where the number of general officers with sounding titles disguised under a thin veil the real weakness of the grecian empire the commanders were numerous and the distinctions of their rank minute but the soldiers were very few in comparison the offices formerly filled by prefects praetors and questors were now held by persons who had gradually risen into the authority of those officers and who though designated from their domestic duties about the emperor yet from that very circumstance possessed what in that despotic court was the most effectual source of power a long train of officers entered the great hall of the castle of blacquernal and proceeded so far together as their different grades admitted while in each chamber through which they passed in succession a certain number of the train whose rank permitted them to advance no farther remained behind the others thus when the interior cabinet of audience was gained which was not until their passage through ten anterooms five persons only found themselves in the presence of the emperor in this innermost and most sacred recess of royalty decorated by all the splendour of the period the emperor alexius sat upon a stately throne rich with barbaric gems and gold and flanked on either hand in imitation probably of solomons magnificence with the form of a couchant lion in the same precious metal not to dwell upon other marks of splendour a tree whose trunk seemed also of gold shot up behind the throne which it overcanopied with its branches amid the boughs were birds of various kinds curiously wrought and enamelled and fruit composed of precious stones seemed to glisten among the leaves five officers alone the highest in the state had the privilege of entering this sacred recess when the emperor held council these were the grand domestic who might be termed of rank with a modern prime minister the logothete or chancellor the protospathaire or commander of the guards already mentioned the acolyte or follower and leader of the varangians and the patriarch the doors of this secret apartment and the adjacent antechamber were guarded by six deformed nubian slaves whose writhen and withered countenances formed a hideous contrast with their snowwhite dresses and splendid equipment they were mutes a species of wretches borrowed from the despotism of the east that they might be unable to proclaim the deeds of tyranny of which they were the unscrupulous agents they were generally held in a kind of horror rather than compassion for men considered that slaves of this sort had a malignant pleasure in avenging upon others the irreparable wrongs which had severed themselves from humanity it was a general custom though like many other usages of the greeks it would be held childish in modern times that by means of machinery easily conceived the lions at the entrance of a stranger were made as it were to rouse themselves and roar after which a wind seemed to rustle the foliage of the tree the birds hopped from branch to branch pecked the fruit and appeared to fill the chamber with their carolling this display had alarmed many an ignorant foreign ambassador and even the grecian counsellors themselves were expected to display the same sensations of fear succeeded by surprise when they heard the roar of the lions followed by the concert of the birds although perhaps it was for the fiftieth time on this occasion as a proof of the urgency of the present meeting of the council these ceremonies were entirely omitted the speech of the emperor himself seemed to supply by its commencement the bellowing of the lions while it ended in a strain more resembling the warbling of the birds in his first sentences he treated of the audacity and unheardof boldness of the millions of franks who under the pretence of wresting palestine from the infidels had ventured to invade the sacred territories of the empire he threatened them with such chastisement as his innumerable forces and officers would he affirmed find it easy to inflict to all this the audience and especially the military officers gave symptoms of ready assent alexius however did not long persist in the warlike intentions which he at first avowed the franks he at length seemed to reflect were in profession christians they might possibly be serious in their pretext of the crusade in which case their motives claimed a degree of indulgence and although erring a certain portion of respect their numbers also were great and their valour could not be despised by those who had seen them fight at durazzo footnote for the battle of durazzo oct in which alexius was defeated with great slaughter by robert guiscard and escaped only by the swiftness of his horse see gibbon ch and elsewhere they might also by the permission of supreme providence be in the long run the instruments of advantage to the most sacred empire though they approached it with so little ceremony he had therefore mingling the virtues of prudence humanity and generosity with that valour which must always burn in the heart of an emperor formed a plan which he was about to submit to their consideration for present execution and in the first place he requested of the grand domestic to let him know what forces he might count upon on the western side of the bosphorus innumerable are the forces of the empire as the stars in heaven or the sand on the seashore answered the grand domestic that is a goodly answer said the emperor provided there were strangers present at this conference but since we hold consultation in private it is necessary that i know precisely to what number that army amounts which i have to rely upon reserve your eloquence till some fitter time and let me know what you at this present moment mean by the word innumerable the grand domestic paused and hesitated for a short space but as he became aware that the moment was one in which the emperor could not be trifled with for alexius comnenus was at times dangerous he answered thus but not without hesitation imperial master and lord none better knows that such an answer cannot be hastily made if it is at the same time to be correct in its results the number of the imperial host betwixt this city and the western frontier of the empire deducting those absent on furlough cannot be counted upon as amounting to more than twentyfive thousand men or thirty thousand at most alexius struck his forehead with his hand and the counsellors seeing him give way to such violent expressions of grief and surprise began to enter into discussions which they would otherwise have reserved for a fitter place and time by the trust your highness reposes in me said the logothete there has been drawn from your highnesss coffers during the last year gold enough to pay double the number of the armed warriors whom the grand domestic now mentions your imperial highness retorted the impeached minister with no small animation will at once remember the stationary garrisons in addition to the movable troops for which this figurecaster makes no allowance peace both of you said alexius composing himself hastily our actual numbers are in truth less than we counted on but let us not by wrangling augment the difficulties of the time let those troops be dispersed in valleys in passes behind ridges of hills and in difficult ground where a little art being used in the position can make few men supply the appearance of numbers between this city and the western frontier of the empire while this disposal is made we will continue to adjust with these crusaders as they call themselves the terms on which we will consent to let them pass through our dominions nor are we without hope of negotiating with them so as to gain great advantage to our kingdom we will insist that they pass through our country only by armies of perhaps fifty thousand at once whom we will successively transport into asia so that no greater number shall by assembling beneath our walls ever endanger the safety of the metropolis of the world on their way towards the banks of the bosphorus we will supply them with provisions if they march peaceably and in order and if any straggle from their standards or insult the country by marauding we suppose our valiant peasants will not hesitate to repress their excesses and that without our giving positive orders since we would not willingly be charged with any thing like a breach of engagement we suppose also that the scythians arabs syrians and other mercenaries in our service will not suffer our subjects to be overpowered in their own just defence as besides that there is no justice in stripping our own country of provisions in order to feed strangers we will not be surprised nor unpardonably displeased to learn that of the ostensible quantity of flour some sacks should be found filled with chalk or lime or some such substance it is indeed truly wonderful what the stomach of a frank will digest comfortably their guides also whom you shall choose with reference to such duty will take care to conduct the crusaders by difficult and circuitous routes which will be doing them a real service by inuring them to the hardships of the country and climate which they would otherwise have to face without seasoning in the meantime in your intercourse with their chiefs whom they call counts each of whom thinks himself as great as an emperor you will take care to give no offence to their natural presumption and omit no opportunity of informing them of the wealth and bounty of our government sums of money may be even given to persons of note and largesses of less avail to those under them you our logothete will take good order for this and you our grand domestic will take care that such soldiers as may cut off detached parties of the franks shall be presented if possible in savage dress and under the show of infidels in commending these injunctions to your care i purpose that the crusaders having found the value of our friendship and also in some sort the danger of our enmity those whom we shall safely transport to asia shall be however unwieldy still a smaller and more compact body whom we may deal with in all christian prudence thus by using fair words to one threats to another gold to the avaricious power to the ambitious and reasons to those that are capable of listening to them we doubt not but to prevail upon those franks met as they are from a thousand points and enemies of each other to acknowledge us as their common superior rather than choose a leader among themselves when they are made aware of the great fact that every village in palestine from dan to beersheba is the original property of the sacred roman empire and that whatever christian goes to war for their recovery must go as our subject and hold any conquest which he may make as our vassal vice and virtue sense and folly ambition and disinterested devotion will alike recommend to the survivors of these singularminded men to become the feudatories of the empire not its foe and the shield not the enemy of your paternal emperor there was a general inclination of the head among the courtiers with the eastern acclamation of long live the emperor when the murmur of this applausive exclamation had subsided alexius proceeded once more i say that my faithful grand domestic and those who act under him will take care to commit the execution of such part of these orders as may seem aggressive to troops of foreign appearance and language which i grieve to say are more numerous in our imperial army than our naturalborn and orthodox subjects the patriarch here interposed his opinion there is a consolation he saidin the thought that the genuine romans in the imperial army are but few since a trade so bloody as war is most fitly prosecuted by those whose doctrines as well as their doings on earth merit eternal condemnation in the next world reverend patriarch said the emperor we would not willingly hold with the wild infidels that paradise is to be gained by the sabre nevertheless we would hope that a roman dying in battle for his religion and his emperor may find as good hope of acceptation after the mortal pang is over as a man who dies in peace and with unblooded hand it is enough for me to say resumed the patriarch that the churchs doctrine is not so indulgent she is herself peaceful and her promises of favour are for those who have been men of peace yet think not i bar the gates of heaven against a soldier as such if believing all the doctrines of our church and complying with all our observances far less would i condemn your imperial majestys wise precautions both for diminishing the power and thinning the ranks of those latin heretics who come hither to despoil us and plunder perhaps both church and temple under the vain pretext that heaven would permit them stained with so many heresies to reconquer that holy land which true orthodox christians your majestys sacred predecessors have not been enabled to retain from the infidel and well i trust that no settlement made under the latins will be permitted by your majesty to establish itself in which the cross shall not be elevated with limbs of the same length instead of that irregular and most damnable error which prolongs in western churches the nether limb of that most holy emblem reverend patriarch answered the emperor do not deem that we think lightly of your weighty scruples but the question is now not in what manner we may convert these latin heretics to the true faith but how we may avoid being overrun by their myriads which resemble those of the locusts by which their approach was preceded and intimated your majesty said the patriarch will act with your usual wisdom for my part i have only stated my doubts that i may save my own soul alive our construction said the emperor does your sentiments no wrong most reverend patriarch and you addressing himself to the other counsellors will attend to these separate charges given out for directing the execution of the commands which have been generally intimated to you they are written out in the sacred ink and our sacred subscription is duly marked with the fitting tinge of green and purple let them therefore be strictly obeyed ourselves will assume the command of such of the immortal bands as remain in the city and join to them the cohorts of our faithful varangians at the head of these troops we will await the arrival of these strangers under the walls of the city and avoiding combat while our policy can postpone it we will be ready in case of the worst to take whatsoever chance it shall please the almighty to send us here the council broke up and the different chiefs began to exert themselves in the execution of their various instructions civil and military secret or public favourable or hostile to the crusaders the peculiar genius of the grecian people was seen upon this occasion their loud and boastful talking corresponded with the ideas which the emperor wished to enforce upon the crusaders concerning the extent of his power and resources nor is it to be disguised that the wily selfishness of most of those in the service of alexius endeavoured to find some indirect way of applying the imperial instruction so as might best suit their own private ends meantime the news had gone abroad in constantinople of the arrival of the huge miscellaneous army of the west upon the limits of the grecian empire arid of their purpose to pass to palestine a thousand reports magnified if that was possible an event so wonderful some said that their ultimate view was the conquest of arabia the destruction of the prophets tomb and the conversion of his green banner into a horse cloth for the king of frances brother others supposed that the ruin and sack of constantinople was the real object of the war a third class thought it was in order to compel the patriarch to submit himself to the pope adopt the latin form of the cross and put an end to the schism the varangians enjoyed an addition to this wonderful news seasoned as it everywhere was with something peculiarly suited to the prejudices of the hearers it was gathered originally from what our friend hereward who was one of their inferior officers called sergeants or constables had suffered to transpire of what he had heard the preceding evening considering that the fact must be soon matter of notoriety he had no hesitation to give his comrades to understand that a norman army was coming hither under duke robert the son of the farfamed william the conqueror and with hostile intentions he concluded against them in particular like all other men in peculiar circumstances the varangians adopted an explanation applicable to their own condition these normans who hated the saxon nation and had done so much to dishonour and oppress them were now following them they supposed to the foreign capital where they had found refuge with the purpose of making war on the bountiful prince who protected their sad remnant under this belief many a deep oath was sworn in norse and anglosaxon that their keen battleaxes should avenge the slaughter of hastings and many a pledge both in wine and ale was quaffed who should most deeply resent and most effectually revenge the wrongs which the anglosaxons of england had received at the hand of their oppressors hereward the author of this intelligence began soon to be sorry that he had ever suffered it to escape him so closely was he crossexamined concerning its precise import by the enquiries of his comrades from whom he thought himself obliged to keep concealed the adventures of the preceding evening and the place in which he had gained his information about noon when he was effectually tired with returning the same answer to the same questions and evading similar others which were repeatedly put to him the sound of trumpets announced the presence of the acolyte achilles tatius who came immediately it was industriously whispered from the sacred interior with news of the immediate approach of war the varangians and the roman bands called immortal it was said were to form a camp under the city in order to be prompt to defend it at the shortest notice this put the whole barracks into commotion each man making the necessary provision for the approaching campaign the noise was chiefly that of joyful bustle and acclamation and it was so general that hereward whose rank permitted him to commit to a page or esquire the task of preparing his equipments took the opportunity to leave the barracks in order to seek some distant place apart from his comrades and enjoy his solitary reflections upon the singular connexion into which he had been drawn and his direct communication with the imperial family passing through the narrow streets then deserted on account of the heat of the sun he reached at length one of those broad terraces which descending as it were by steps upon the margin of the bosphorus formed one of the most splendid walks in the universe and still it is believed preserved as a public promenade for the pleasure of the turks as formerly for that of the christians these graduated terraces were planted with many trees among which the cypress as usual was most generally cultivated here bands of the inhabitants were to be seen some passing to and fro with business and anxiety in their faces some standing still in groups as if discussing the strange and weighty tidings of the day and some with the indolent carelessness of an eastern climate eating their noontide refreshment in the shade and spending their time as if their sole object was to make much of the day as it passed and let the cares of tomorrow answer for themselves while the varangian afraid of meeting some acquaintance in this concourse which would have been inconsistent with the desire of seclusion which had brought him thither descended or passed from one terrace to another all marked him with looks of curiosity and enquiry considering him to be one who from his arms and connexion with the court must necessarily know more than others concerning the singular invasion by numerous enemies and from various quarters which was the news of the day none however had the hardihood to address the soldier of the guard though all looked at him with uncommon interest he walked from the lighter to the darker alleys from the more closed to the more open terraces without interruption from any one yet not without a feeling that he must not consider himself as alone the desire that he felt to be solitary rendered him at last somewhat watchful so that he became sensible that he was dogged by a black slave a personage not so unfrequent in the streets of constantinople as to excite any particular notice his attention however being at length fixed on this individual he began to be desirous to escape his observation and the change of place which he had at first adopted to avoid society in general he had now recourse to in order to rid himself of this distant though apparently watchful attendant still however though he by change of place had lost sight of the negro for a few minutes it was not long ere he again discovered him at a distance too far for a companion but near enough to serve all the purposes of a spy displeased at this the varangian turned short in his walk and choosing a spot where none was in sight but the object of his resentment walked suddenly up to him and demanded wherefore and by whose orders he presumed to dog his footsteps the negro answered in a jargon as bad as that in which he was addressed though of a different kind that he had orders to remark whither he went orders from whom said the varangian from my master and yours answered the negro boldly thou infidel villain exclaimed the angry soldier when was it that we became fellowservants and who is it that thou darest to call my master one who is master of the world said the slave since he commands his own passions i shall scarce command mine said the varangian if thou repliest to my earnest questions with thine affected quirks of philosophy once more what dost thou want with me and why hast thou the boldness to watch me i have told thee already said the slave that i do my masters commands but i must know who thy master is said hereward he must tell thee that himself replied the negro he trusts not a poor slave like me with the purpose of the errands on which he sends me he has left thee a tongue however said the varangian which some of thy countrymen would i think be glad to possess do not provoke me to abridge it by refusing me the information which i have a right to demand the black meditated as it seemed from the grin on his face further evasions when hereward cut them short by raising the staff of his battleaxe put me not he said to dishonour myself by striking thee with this weapon calculated for a use so much more noble i may not do so valiant sir said the negro laying aside an impudent halfgibing tone which he had hitherto made use of and betraying personal fear in his manner if you beat the poor slave to death you cannot learn what his master hath forbid him to tell a short walk will save your honour the stain and yourself the trouble of beating what cannot resist and me the pain of enduring what i can neither retaliate nor avoid lead on then said the varangian be assured thou shalt not fool me by thy fair words and i will know the person who is impudent enough to assume the right of watching my motions the black walked on with a species of leer peculiar to his physiognomy which might be construed as expressive either of malice or of mere humour the varangian followed him with some suspicion for it happened that he had had little intercourse with the unhappy race of africa and had not totally overcome the feeling of surprise with which he had at first regarded them when he arrived a stranger from the north so often did this man look back upon him during their walk and with so penetrating and observing a cast of countenance that hereward felt irresistibly renewed in his mind the english prejudices which assigned to the demons the sable colour and distorted cast of visage of his conductor the scene into which he was guided strengthened an association which was not of itself unlikely to occur to the ignorant and martial islander the negro led the way from the splendid terraced walks which we have described to a path descending to the seashore when a place appeared which far from being trimmed like other parts of the coast into walks of embankments seemed on the contrary abandoned to neglect and was covered with the mouldering ruins of antiquity where these had not been overgrown by the luxuriant vegetation of the climate these fragments of building occupying a sort of recess of the bay were hidden by steep banks on each side and although in fact they formed part of the city yet they were not seen from any part of it and embosomed in the manner we have described did not in turn command any view of the churches palaces towers and fortifications amongst which they lay the sight of this solitary and apparently deserted spot encumbered with ruins and overgrown with cypress and other trees situated as it was in the midst of a populous city had something in it impressive and awful to the imagination the ruins were of an ancient date and in the style of a foreign people the gigantic remains of a portico the mutilated fragments of statues of great size but executed in a taste and attitude so narrow and barbaric as to seem perfectly the reverse of the grecian and the halfdefaced hieroglyphics which could be traced on some part of the decayed sculpture corroborated the popular account of their origin which we shall briefly detail according to tradition this had been a temple dedicated to the egyptian goddess cybele built while the roman empire was yet heathen and while constantinople was still called by the name of byzantium it is well known that the superstition of the egyptians vulgarly gross in its literal meaning as well as in its mystical interpretation and peculiarly the foundation of many wild doctrines was disowned by the principles of general toleration and the system of polytheism received by rome and was excluded by repeated laws from the respect paid by the empire to almost every other religion however extravagant or absurd nevertheless these egyptian rites had charms for the curious and the superstitious and had after long opposition obtained a footing in the empire still although tolerated the egyptian priests were rather considered as sorcerers than as pontiffs and their whole ritual had a nearer relation to magic in popular estimation than to any regular system of devotion stained with these accusations even among the heathen themselves the worship of egypt was held in more mortal abhorrence by the christians than the other and more rational kinds of heathen devotion that is if any at all had a right to be termed so the brutal worship of apis and cybele was regarded not only as a pretext for obscene and profligate pleasures but as having a direct tendency to open and encourage a dangerous commerce with evil spirits who were supposed to take upon themselves at these unhallowed altars the names and characters of these foul deities not only therefore the temple of cybele with its gigantic portico its huge and inelegant statues and its fantastic hieroglyphics was thrown down and defaced when the empire was converted to the christian faith but the very ground on which it stood was considered as polluted and unhallowed and no emperor having yet occupied the site with a christian church the place still remained neglected and deserted as we have described it the varangian hereward was perfectly acquainted with the evil reputation of the place and when the negro seemed disposed to advance into the interior of the ruins he hesitated and addressed his guide thus hark thee my black friend these huge fantastic images some having dogs heads some cows heads and some no heads at all are not held reverently in popular estimation your own colour also my comrade is greatly too like that of satan himself to render you an unsuspicious companion amid ruins in which the false spirit it is said daily walks his rounds midnight and noon are the times it is rumoured of his appearance i will go no farther with you unless you assign me a fit reason for so doing in making so childish a proposal said the negro you take from me in effect all desire to guide you to my master i thought i spoke to a man of invincible courage and of that good sense upon which courage is best founded but your valour only emboldens you to beat a black slave who has neither strength nor title to resist you and your courage is not enough to enable you to look without trembling on the dark side of a wall even when the sun is in the heavens thou art insolent said hereward raising his axe and thou art foolish said the negro to attempt to prove thy manhood and thy wisdom by the very mode which gives reason for calling them both in question i have already said there can be little valour in beating a wretch like me and no man surely who wishes to discover his way would begin by chasing away his guide i follow thee said hereward stung with the insinuation of cowardice but if thou leadest me into a snare thy free talk shall not save thy bones if a thousand of thy complexion from earth or hell were standing ready to back thee thou objectest sorely to my complexion said the negro how knowest thou that it is in fact a thing to be counted and acted upon as matter of reality thine own eyes daily apprize thee that the colour of the sky nightly changes from bright to black yet thou knowest that this is by no means owing to any habitual colour of the heavens themselves the same change that takes place in the hue of the heavens has existence in the tinge of the deep sea how canst thou tell but what the difference of my colour from thine own may be owing to some deceptions change of a similar nature not real in itself but only creating an apparent reality thou mayst have painted thyself no doubt answered the varangian upon reflection and thy blackness therefore may be only apparent but i think thy old friend himself could hardly have presented these grinning lips with the white teeth and flattened nose so much to the life unless that peculiarity of nubian physiognomy as they call it had accurately and really an existence and to save thee some trouble my dark friend i will tell thee that though thou speakest to an uneducated varangian i am not entirely unskilled in the grecian art of making subtle words pass upon the hearers instead of reason ay said the negro doubtfully and somewhat surprised and may the slave diogenes for so my master has christened me enquire into the means by which you reached knowledge so unusual it is soon told replied hereward my countryman witikind being a constable of our bands retired from active service and spent the end of a long life in this city of constantinople being past all toils of battle either those of reality as you word it or the pomp and fatigue of the exercising ground the poor old man in despair of something to pass his time attended the lectures of the philosophers and what did he learn there said the negro for a barbarian grown grey under the helmet was not as i think a very hopeful student in our schools as much though i should think as a menial slave which i understand to be thy condition replied the soldier but i have understood from him that the masters of this idle science make it their business to substitute in their argumentations mere words instead of ideas and as they never agree upon the precise meaning of the former their disputes can never arrive at a fair or settled conclusion since they do not agree in the language in which they express them their theories as they call them are built on the sand and the wind and tide shall prevail against them say so to my master answered the black in a serious tone i will said the varangian and he shall know me as an ignorant soldier having but few ideas and those only concerning my religion and my military duty but out of these opinions i will neither be beaten by a battery of sophisms nor cheated by the arts or the terrors of the friends of heathenism either in this world or the next you may speak your mind to him then yourself said diogenes he stepped aside as if to make way for the varangian to whom he motioned to go forward hereward advanced accordingly by a halfworn and almost imperceptible path leading through the long rough grass and turning round a half demolished shrine which exhibited the remains of apis the bovine deity he came immediately in front of the philosopher agelastes who sitting among the ruins reposed his limbs on the grass chapter the eighth through the vain webs which puzzle sophists skill plain sense and honest meaning work their way so sink the varying clouds upon the hill when the clear dawning brightens into day dr watts the old man rose from the ground with alacrity as hereward approached my bold varangian he said thou who valuest men and things not according to the false estimate ascribed to them in this world but to their real importance and actual value thou art welcome whatever has brought thee hither thou art welcome to a place where it is held the best business of philosophy to strip man of his borrowed ornaments and reduce him to the just value of his own attributes of body and mind singly considered you are a courtier sir said the saxon and as a permitted companion of the emperors highness you must be aware that there are twenty times more ceremonies than such a man as i can be acquainted with for regulating the different ranks in society while a plain man like myself may be well excused from pushing himself into the company of those above him where he does not exactly know how he should comport himself true said the philosopher but a man like yourself noble hereward merits more consideration in the eyes of a real philosopher than a thousand of those mere insects whom the smiles of a court call into life and whom its frowns reduce to annihilation you are yourself grave sir a follower of the court said hereward and a most punctilious one said agelastes there is not i trust a subject in the empire who knows better the ten thousand punctilios exigible from those of different ranks and clue to different authorities the man is yet to be born who has seen me take advantage of any more commodious posture than that of standing in presence of the royal family but though i use those false scales in society and so far conform to its errors my real judgment is of a more grave character and more worthy of man as said to be formed in the image of his creator there can be small occasion said the varangian to exercise your judgment in any respect upon me nor am i desirous that any one should think of me otherwise than i am a poor exile namely who endeavours to fix his faith upon heaven and to perform his duty to the world he lives in and to the prince in whose service he is engaged and now grave sir permit me to ask whether this meeting is by your desire and for what is its purpose an african slave whom i met in the public walks and who calls himself diogenes tells me that you desired to speak with me he hath somewhat the humour of the old scoffer and so he may have lied if so i will even forgive him the beating which i owe his assurance and make my excuse at the same time for having broken in upon your retirement which i am totally unfit to share diogenes has not played you false answered agelastes he has his humours as you remarked even now and with these some qualities also that put him upon a level with those of fairer complexion and better features and for what said the varangian have you so employed him can your wisdom possibly entertain a wish to converse with me i am an observer of nature and of humanity answered the philosopher is it not natural that i should tire of those beings who are formed entirely upon artifice and long to see something more fresh from the hand of nature you see not that in me said the varangian the rigour of military discipline the camp the centurion the armour frame a mans sentiments and limbs to them as the seacrab is framed to its shell see one of us and you see us all permit me to doubt that said agelastes and to suppose that in hereward the son of waltheoff i see an extraordinary man although he himself may be ignorant owing to his modesty of the rarity of his own good qualities the son of waltheoff answered the varangian somewhat startled do you know my fathers name be not surprised answered the philosopher at my possessing so simple a piece of information it has cost me but little trouble to attain it yet i would gladly hope that the labour i have taken in that matter may convince you of my real desire to call you friend it was indeed an unusual compliment said hereward that a man of your knowledge and station should be at the trouble to enquire among the varangian cohorts concerning the descent of one of their constables i scarcely think that my commander the acolyte himself would think such knowledge worthy of being collected or preserved greater men than he said agelastes certainly would notyou know one in high office who thinks the names of his most faithful soldiers of less moment than those of his hunting dogs or his hawks and would willingly save himself the trouble of calling them otherwise than by a whistle i may not hear this answered the varangian i would not offend you said the philosopher i would not even shake your good opinion of the person i allude to yet it surprises me that such should be entertained by one of your great qualities a truce with this grave sir which is in fact trifling in a person of your character and appearance answered the anglosaxon i am like the rocks of my country the fierce winds cannot shake me the soft rains cannot melt me flattery and loud words are alike lost upon me and it is even for that inflexibility of mind replied agelastes that steady contempt of every thing that approaches thee save in the light of a duty that i demand almost like a beggar that personal acquaintance which thou refusest like a churl pardon me said hereward if i doubt this whatever stories you may have picked up concerning me not unexaggerated probably since the greeks do not keep the privilege of boasting so entirely to themselves but the varangians have learned a little of it you can have heard nothing of me which can authorise your using your present language excepting in jest you mistake my son said agelastes believe me not a person to mix in the idle talk respecting you with your comrades at the alecup such as i am i can strike on this broken image of anubis here he touched a gigantic fragment of a statue by his side and bid the spirit who long prompted the oracle descend and once more reanimate the trembling mass we that are initiated enjoy high privileges we stamp upon those ruined vaults and the echo which dwells there answers to our demand do not think that although i crave thy friendship i heed therefore supplicate thee for information either respecting thyself or others your words are wonderful said the anglosaxon but by such promising words i have heard that many souls have been seduced from the path of heaven my grandsire kenelm was wont to say that the fair words of the heathen philosophy were more hurtful to the christian faith than the menaces of the heathen tyrants i know him said agelastes what avails it whether it was in the body or in the spirit he was converted from the faith of woden by a noble monk and died a priest at the shrine of saint augustin footnote at canterbury true said hereward all this is certain and i am the rather bound to remember his words now that he is dead and gone when i hardly knew his meaning he bid me beware of the doctrine which causeth to err which is taught by false prophets who attest their doctrine by unreal miracles this said agelastes is mere superstition thy grandsire was a good and excellent man but narrowminded like other priests and deceived by their example he wished but to open a small wicket in the gate of truth and admit the world only on that limited scale seest thou hereward thy grandsire and most men of religion would fain narrow our intellect to the consideration of such parts of the immaterial world as are essential to our moral guidance here and our final salvation hereafter but it is not the less true that man has liberty provided he has wisdom and courage to form intimacies with beings more powerful than himself who can defy the bounds of space by which he is circumscribed and overcome by their metaphysical powers difficulties which to the timid and unlearned may appear wild and impossible you talk of a folly answered hereward at which childhood gapes and manhood smiles on the contrary said the sage i talk of a longing wish which every man feels at the bottom of his heart to hold communication with beings more powerful than himself and who are not naturally accessible to our organs believe me hereward so ardent and universal an aspiration had not existed in our bosoms had there not also been means if steadily and wisely sought of attaining its accomplishment i will appeal to thine own heart and prove to thee even by a single word that what i say is truth thy thoughts are even now upon a being long absent or dead and with the name of bertha a thousand emotions rush to thy heart which in thy ignorance thou hadst esteemed furled up for ever like spoils of the dead hung above a tombstone thou startest and changest thy colour i joy to see by these signs that the firmness and indomitable courage which men ascribe to thee have left the avenues of the heart as free as ever to kindly and to generous affections while they have barred them against those of fear uncertainty and all the caitiff tribe of meatier sensations i have proffered to esteem thee and i have no hesitation in proving it i will tell thee if thou desirest to know it the fate of that very bertha whose memory thou hast cherished in thy breast in spite of thee amidst the toil of the day and the repose of the night in the battle and in the truce when sporting with thy companions in fields of exercise or attempting to prosecute the study of greek learning in which if thou wouldst advance i can teach it by a short road while agelastes thus spoke the varangian in some degree recovered his composure and made answer though his voice was somewhat tremulous who thou art i know not what thou wouldst with me i cannot tell by what means thou hast gathered intelligence of such consequence to me and of so little to another i have no conception but this i know that by intention or accident thou hast pronounced a name which agitates my heart to its deepest recesses yet am i a christian and varangian and neither to my god nor to my adopted prince will i willingly stagger in my faith what is to be wrought by idols or by false deities must be a treason to the real divinity nor is it less certain that thou hast let glance some arrows though the rules of thy allegiance strictly forbid it at the emperor himself henceforward therefore i refuse to communicate with thee be it for weal or woe i am the emperors waged soldier and although i affect not the nice precisions of respect and obedience which are exacted in so many various cases and by so many various rules yet i am his defence and my battleaxe is his bodyguard no one doubts it said the philosopher but art not thou also bound to a nearer dependence upon the great acolyte achilles tatius no he is my general according to the rules of our service answered the varangian to me he has always shown himself a kind and good natured man and his dues of rank apart i may say has deported himself as a friend rather than a commander he is however my masters servant as well as i am nor do i hold the difference of great amount which the word of a man can give or take away at pleasure it is nobly spoken said agelastes and you yourself are surely entitled to stand erect before one whom you supersede in courage and in the art of war pardon me returned the briton if i decline the attributed compliment as what in no respect belongs to me the emperor chooses his own officers in respect of their power of serving him as he desires to be served in this it is likely i might fail i have said already i owe my emperor my obedience my duty and my service nor does it seem to me necessary to carry our explanation farther singular man said agelastes is there nothing than can move thee but things that are foreign to thyself the name of thy emperor and thy commander are no spell upon thee and even that of the object thou has loved here the varangian interrupted him i have thought he said upon the words thou hast spoken thou hast found the means to shake my heartstrings but not to unsettle my principles i will hold no converse with thee on a matter in which thou canst not have interest necromancers it is said perform their spells by means of the epithets of the holiest no marvel then should they use the names of the purest of his creation to serve their unhallowed purposes i will none of such truckling disgraceful to the dead perhaps as to the living whatever has been thy purpose old man for think not thy strange words have passed unnoticed be thou assured i bear that in my heart which defies alike the seduction of men and of fiends with this the soldier turned and left the ruined temple after a slight inclination of his head to the philosopher agelastes after the departure of the soldier remained alone apparently absorbed in meditation until he was suddenly disturbed by the entrance into the ruins of achilles tatius the leader of the varangians spoke not until he had time to form some result from the philosophers features he then said thou remainest sage agelastes confident in the purpose of which we have lately spoke together i do said agelastes with gravity and firmness but replied achilles tatius thou hast not gained to our side that proselyte whose coolness and courage would serve us better in our hour of need than the service of a thousand coldhearted slaves i have not succeeded answered the philosopher and thou dost not blush to own it said the imperial officer in reply thou the wisest of those who yet pretend to grecian wisdom the most powerful of those who still assert the skill by words signs names periapts and spells to exceed the sphere to which thy faculties belong hast been foiled in thy trade of persuasion like an infant worsted in debate with its domestic tutor out upon thee that thou canst not sustain in argument the character which thou wouldst so fain assume to thyself peace said the grecian i have as yet gained nothing it is true over this obstinate and inflexible man but achilles tatius neither have i lost we both stand where yesterday we did with this advantage on my side that i have suggested to him such an object of interest as he shall never be able to expel from his mind until he hath had recourse to me to obtain farther knowledge concerning it and now let this singular person remain for a time unmentioned yet trust me though flattery avarice and ambition may fail to gain him a bait nevertheless remains that shall make him as completely our own as any that is bound within our mystic and inviolable contract tell me then how go on the affairs of the empire does this tide of xiatin warriors so strangely set aflowing still rush on to the banks of the bosphorus and does alexius still entertain hopes to diminish and divide the strength of numbers which he could in vain hope to defy something further of intelligence has been gained even within a very few hours answered achilles tatius bohemond came to the city with some six or eight light horse and in a species of disguise considering how often he had been the emperors enemy his project was a perilous one but when is it that these franks draw back on account of danger the emperor perceived at once that the count was come to see what he might obtain by presenting himself as the very first object of his liberality and by offering his assistance as mediator with godfrey of bouillon and the other princes of the crusade it is a species of policy answered the sage for which he would receive full credit from the emperor achilles tatius proceeded count bohemond was discovered to the imperial court as if it were by mere accident and he was welcomed with marks of favour and splendour which had never been even mentioned as being fit for any one of the frankish race there was no word of ancient enmity or of former wars no mention of bohemond as the ancient usurper of antioch and the encroacher upon the empire but thanks to heaven were returned on all sides which had sent a faithful ally to the imperial assistance at a moment of such imminent peril and what said bohemond enquired the philosopher little or nothing said the captain of the varangians until as i learned from the domestic slave narses a large sum of gold had been abandoned to him considerable districts were afterwards agreed to be ceded to him and other advantages granted on condition he should stand on this occasion the steady friend of the empire and its master such was the emperors munificence towards the greedy barbarian that a chamber in the palace was by chance as it were left exposed to his view containing large quantities of manufactured silks of jewellers work of gold and silver and other articles of great value when the rapacious frank could not forbear some expressions of admiration he was assured that the contents of the treasurechamber were his own provided he valued them as showing forth the warmth and sincerity of his imperial ally towards his friends and these precious articles were accordingly conveyed to the tent of the norman leader by such measures the emperor must make himself master of bohemond both body and soul for the franks themselves say it is strange to see a man of undaunted bravery and towering ambition so infected nevertheless with avarice which they term a mean and unnatural vice bohemond said agelastes is then the emperors for life and death always that is till the recollection of the royal munificence be effaced by a greater gratuity alexius proud as he naturally is of his management with this important chieftain will no doubt expect to prevail by his counsels on most of the other crusaders and even on godfrey of bouillon himself to take an oath of submission and fidelity to the emperor which were it not for the sacred nature of their warfare the meanest gentleman among them would not submit to were it to be lord of a province there then we rest a few days must determine what we have to do an earlier discovery would be destruction we meet not then tonight said the acolyte no replied the sage unless we are summoned to that foolish stage play or recitation and then we meet as playthings in the hand of a silly woman the spoiled child of a weakminded parent tatius then took his leave of the philosopher and as if fearful of being seen in each others company they left their solitary place of meeting by different routes the varangian hereward received shortly after a summons from his superior who acquainted him that he should not as formerly intimated require his attendance that evening achilles then paused and added thou hast something on thy lips thou wouldst say to me which nevertheless hesitates to break forth it is only this answered the soldier i have had an interview with the man called agelastes and he seems something so different from what he appeared when we last spoke of him that i cannot forbear mentioning to you what i have seen he is not an insignificant trifler whose object it is to raise a laugh at his own expense or that of any other he is a deepthinking and farreaching man who for some reason or other is desirous of forming friends and drawing a party to himself your own wisdom will teach you to beware of him thou art an honest fellow my poor hereward said achilles tatius with an affectation of goodnatured contempt such men as agelastes do often frame their severest jests in the shape of formal gravity they will pretend to possess the most unbounded power over elements and elemental spirits they will make themselves masters of the names and anecdotes best known to those whom they make their sport and any one who shall listen to them shall in the words of the divine homer only expose himself to a flood of inextinguishable laughter i have often known him select one of the rawest and most ignorant persons in presence and to him for the amusement of the rest he has pretended to cause the absent to appear the distant to draw near and the dead themselves to burst the cerements of the grave take care hereward that his arts make not a stain on the credit of one of my bravest varangians there is no danger answered hereward i shall not be fond of being often with this man if he jests upon one subject which he hath mentioned to me i shall be but too likely to teach him seriousness after a rough manner and if he is serious in his pretensions in such mystical matters we should according to the faith of my grandfather kenelm do insult to the deceased whose name is taken in the mouth of a soothsayer or impious enchanter i will not therefore again go near this agelastes be he wizard or be he impostor you apprehend me not said the acolyte hastily you mistake my meaning he is a man from whom if he pleases to converse with such as you you may derive much knowledge keeping out of the reach of those pretended secret arts which he will only use to turn thee into ridicule with these words which he himself would perhaps have felt it difficult to reconcile the leader and his follower parted chapter the ninth between the foaming jaws of the white torrent the skilful artist draws a sudden mound by level long he subdivides their strength stealing the waters from their rocky bed first to diminish what he means to conquer then for the residue he forms a road easy to keep and painful to desert and guiding to the end the planner aimd at the engineer it would have been easy for alexius by a course of avowed suspicion or any false step in the manner of receiving this tumultuary invasion of the european nations to have blown into a flame the numerous but smothered grievances under which they laboured and a similar catastrophe would not have been less certain had he at once abandoned all thoughts of resistance and placed his hope of safety in surrendering to the multitudes of the west whatsoever they accounted worth taking the emperor chose a middle course and unquestionably in the weakness of the greek empire it was the only one which would have given him at once safety and a great degree of consequence in the eyes of the frank invaders and those of his own subjects the means with which he acted were of various kinds and rather from policy than inclination were often stained with falsehood or meanness therefore it follows that the measures of the emperor resembled those of the snake who twines himself through the grass with the purpose of stinging insidiously those whom he fears to approach with the step of the bold and generous lion we are not however writing the history of the crusades and what we have already said of the emperors precautions on the first appearance of godfrey of bouillon and his associates may suffice for the elucidation of our story about four weeks had now passed over marked by quarrels and reconcilements between the crusaders and the grecians of the empire the former were as alexiuss policy dictated occasionally and individually received with extreme honour and their leaders loaded with respect and favour while from time to time such bodies of them as sought distant or circuitous routes to the capital were intercepted and cut to pieces by lightarmed troops who easily passed upon their ignorant opponents for turks scythians or other infidels and sometimes were actually such but in the service of the grecian monarch often too it happened that while the more powerful chiefs of the crusade were feasted by the emperor and his ministers with the richest delicacies and their thirst slaked with iced wines their followers were left at a distance where intentionally supplied with adulterated flour tainted provisions and bad water they contracted diseases and died in great numbers without having once seen a foot of the holy land for the recovery of which they had abandoned their peace their competence and their native country these aggressions did not pass without complaint many of the crusading chiefs impugned the fidelity of their allies exposed the losses sustained by their armies as evils voluntarily inflicted on them by the greeks and on more than one occasion the two nations stood opposed to each other on such terms that a general war seemed to be inevitable alexius however though obliged to have recourse to every finesse still kept his ground and made peace with the most powerful chiefs under one pretence or other the actual losses of the crusaders by the sword he imputed to their own aggressions their misguidance to accident and to wilfulness the effects produced on them by the adulterated provisions to the vehemence of their own appetite for raw fruits and unripened wines in short there was no disaster of any kind whatsoever which could possibly befall the unhappy pilgrims but the emperor stood prepared to prove that it was the natural consequence of their own violence wilfulness of conduct or hostile precipitancy the chiefs who were not ignorant of their strength would not it was likely have tamely suffered injuries from a power so inferior to their own were it not that they had formed extravagant ideas of the wealth of the eastern empire which alexius seemed willing to share with them with an excess of bounty as new to the leaders as the rich productions of the east were tempting to their followers the french nobles would perhaps have been the most difficult to be brought into order when differences arose but an accident which the emperor might have termed providential reduced the highspirited count of vermandois to the situation of a suppliant when he expected to hold that of a dictator a fierce tempest surprised his fleet after he set sail from italy and he was finally driven on the coast of greece many ships were destroyed and those troops who got ashore were so much distressed that they were obliged to surrender themselves to the lieutenants of alexius so that the count of vermandois so haughty in his bearing when he first embarked was sent to the court of constantinople not as a prince but as a prisoner in this case the emperor instantly set the soldiers at liberty and loaded them with presents footnote see mills history of the crusades vol i p grateful therefore for attentions in which alexius was unremitting count hugh was by gratitude as well as interest inclined to join the opinion of those who for other reasons desired the subsistence of peace betwixt the crusaders and the empire of greece a better principle determined the celebrated godfrey raymond of thoulouse and some others in whom devotion was something more than a mere burst of fanaticism these princes considered with what scandal their whole journey must be stained if the first of their exploits should be a war upon the grecian empire which might justly be called the barrier of christendom if it was weak and at the same time rich if at the same time it invited rapine and was unable to protect itself against it it was the more their interest and duty as christian soldiers to protect a christian state whose existence was of so much consequence to the common cause even when it could not defend itself it was the wish of these frankhearted men to receive the emperors professions of friendship with such sincere returns of amity to return his kindness with so much usury as to convince him that their purpose towards him was in every respect fair and honourable and that it would be his interest to abstain from every injurious treatment which might induce or compel them to alter their measures towards him it was with this accommodating spirit towards alexius which for many different and complicated reasons had now animated most of the crusaders that the chiefs consented to a measure which in other circumstances they would probably have refused as undue to the greeks and dishonourable to themselves this was the famous resolution that before crossing the bosphorus to go in quest of that palestine which they had vowed to regain each chief of crusaders would acknowledge individually the grecian emperor originally lord paramount of all these regions as their liege lord and suzerain the emperor alexius with trembling joy beheld the crusaders approach a conclusion to which he had hoped to bribe them rather by interested means than by reasoning although much might be said why provinces reconquered from the turks or saracens should if recovered from the infidel become again a part of the grecian empire from which they had been rent without any pretence save that of violence though fearful and almost despairing of being able to manage the rude and discordant army of haughty chiefs who were wholly independent of each other alexius failed not with eagerness and dexterity to seize upon the admission of godfrey and his compeers that the emperor was entitled to the allegiance of all who should war on palestine and natural lord paramount of all the conquests which should be made in the course of the expedition he was resolved to make this ceremony so public and to interest mens minds in it by such a display of the imperial pomp and munificence that it should not either pass unknown or be readily forgotten an extensive terrace one of the numerous spaces which extend along the coast of the propontis was chosen for the site of the magnificent ceremony here was placed an elevated and august throne calculated for the use of the emperor alone on this occasion by suffering no other seats within view of the pageant the greeks endeavoured to secure a point of ceremony peculiarly dear to their vanity namely that none of that presence save the emperor himself should be seated around the throne of alexius comnenus were placed in order but standing the various dignitaries of his splendid court in their different ranks from the protosebastos and the caesar to the patriarch splendid in his ecclesiastical robes and to agelastes who in his simple habit gave also the necessary attendance behind and around the splendid display of the emperors court were drawn many dark circles of the exiled anglosaxons these by their own desire were not on that memorable day accoutred in the silver corslets which were the fashion of an idle court but sheathed in mail and plate they desired they said to be known as warriors to warriors this was the more readily granted as there was no knowing what trifle might infringe a truce between parties so inflammable as were now assembled beyond the varangians in much greater numbers were drawn up the bands of grecians or romans then known by the title of immortals which had been borrowed by the romans originally from the empire of persia the stately forms lofty crests and splendid apparel of these guards would have given the foreign princes present a higher idea of their military prowess had there not occurred in their ranks a frequent indication of loquacity and of motion forming a strong contrast to the steady composure and deathlike silence with which the welltrained varangians stood in the parade like statues made of iron the reader must then conceive this throne in all the pomp of oriental greatness surrounded by the foreign and roman troops of the empire and closed on the rear by clouds of lighthorse who shifted their places repeatedly so as to convey an idea of their multitude without affording the exact means of estimating it through the dust which they raised by these evolutions might be seen banners and standards among which could be discovered by glances the celebrated labarum footnote ducange fills half a column of his huge page with the mere names of the authors who have written at length on the labarum or principal standard of the empire for the time of constantine it consisted of a spear of silver or plated with that metal having suspended from a cross beam below the spoke a small square silken banner adorned with portraits of the reigning family and over these the famous monogram which expresses at once the figure of the cross and the initial letters of the name of christ the bearer of the labarum was an officer of high rank down to the last days of the byzantine government see gibbon chap ducange seems to have proved from the evidence of coins and triumphial monuments that a standard of the form of the labarum was used by various barbarous nations long before it was adopted by their roman conquerors and he is of opinion that its name also was borrowed from either teutonic germany or celtic gaul or sclavonic illyria it is certain that either the german language or the welsh may afford at this day a perfectly satisfactory etymon lapheer in the former and labhair in the latter having precisely the same meaning the cloth of the host the form of the labarum may still be recognised in the banners carried in ecclesiastical processions in all roman catholic countries the pledge of conquest to the imperial banners but whose sacred efficacy had somewhat failed of late days the rude soldiers of the west who viewed the grecian army maintained that the standards which were exhibited in front of their line were at least sufficient for the array of ten times the number of soldiers far on the right the appearance of a very large body of european cavalry drawn up on the seashore intimated the presence of the crusaders so great was the desire to follow the example of the chief princes dukes and counts in making the proposed fealty that the number of independent knights and nobles who were to perform this service seemed very great when collected together for that purpose for every crusader who possessed a tower and led six lances would have thought himself abridged of his dignity if he had not been called to acknowledge the grecian emperor and hold the lands he should conquer of his throne as well as godfrey of bouillon or hugh the great count of vermandois and yet with strange inconsistency though they pressed to fulfil the homage as that which was paid by greater persons than themselves they seemed at the very same time desirous to find some mode of intimating that the homage which they rendered they felt as an idle degradation and in fact held the whole show as a mere piece of mockery the order of the procession had been thus settled the crusaders or as the grecians called them the counts that being the most common title among them were to advance from the left of their body and passing the emperor one by one were apprized that in passing each was to render to him in as few words as possible the homage which had been previously agreed on godfrey of bouillon his brother baldwin bohemond of antioch and several other crusaders of eminence were the first to perform the ceremony alighting when their own part was performed and remaining in attendance by the emperors chair to prevent by the awe of their presence any of their numerous associates from being guilty of petulance or presumption during the solemnity other crusaders of less degree retained their station near the emperor when they had once gained it out of mere curiosity or to show that they were as much at liberty to do so as the greater commanders who assumed that privilege thus two great bodies of troops grecian and european paused at some distance from each other on the banks of the bosphorus canal differing in language arms and appearance the small troops of horse which from time to time issued forth from these bodies resembled the flashes of lightning passing from one thundercloud to another which communicate to each other by such emissaries their overcharged contents after some halt on the margin of the bosphorus the franks who had performed homage straggled irregularly forward to a quay on the shore where innumerable galleys and smaller vessels provided for the purpose lay with sails and oars prepared to waft the warlike pilgrims across the passage and place them on that asia which they longed so passionately to visit and from which but few of them were likely to return the gay appearance of the vessels which were to receive them the readiness with which they were supplied with refreshments the narrowness of the strait they had to cross the near approach of that active service which they had vowed and longed to discharge put the warriors into gay spirits and songs and music bore chorus to the departing oars while such was the temper of the crusaders the grecian emperor did his best through the whole ceremonial to impress on the armed multitude the highest ideas of his own grandeur and the importance of the occasion which had brought them together this was readily admitted by the higher chiefs some because their vanity had been propitiated some because their avarice had been gratified some because their ambition had been inflamed and a few a very few because to remain friends with alexius was the most probable means of advancing the purposes of their expedition accordingly the great lords from these various motives practised a humility which perhaps they were far from feeling and carefully abstained from all which might seem like irreverence at the solemn festival of the grecians but there were very many of a different temper of the great number of counts lords and knights under whose variety of banners the crusaders were led to the walls of constantinople many were too insignificant to be bribed to this distasteful measure of homage and these though they felt it dangerous to oppose resistance yet mixed their submission with taunts ridicule and such contraventions of decorum as plainly intimated that they entertained resentment and scorn at the step they were about to take and esteemed it as proclaiming themselves vassals to a prince heretic in his faith limited in the exercise of his boasted power their enemy when he dared to show himself such and the friend of those only among their number who were able to compel him to be so and who though to them an obsequious ally was to the others when occasion offered an insidious and murderous enemy the nobles of frankish origin and descent were chiefly remarkable for their presumptuous contempt of every other nation engaged in the crusade as well as for their dauntless bravery and for the scorn with which they regarded the power and authority of the greek empire it was a common saying among them that if the skies should fall the french crusaders alone were able to hold them up with their lances the same bold and arrogant disposition showed itself in occasional quarrels with their unwilling hosts in which the greeks notwithstanding all their art were often worsted so that alexius was determined at all events to get rid of these intractable and fiery allies by ferrying them over the bosphorus with all manner of diligence to do this with safety he availed himself of the presence of the count of vermandois godfrey of bouillon and other chiefs of great influence to keep in order the lesser frankish knights who were so numerous and unruly footnote see mills vol i chap struggling with his feelings of offended pride tempered by a prudent degree of apprehension the emperor endeavoured to receive with complacence a homage tendered in mockery an incident shortly took place of a character highly descriptive of the nations brought together in so extraordinary a manner and with such different feelings and sentiments several bands of french had passed in a sort of procession the throne of the emperor and rendered with some appearance of gravity the usual homage on this occasion they bent their knees to alexius placed their hands within his and in that posture paid the ceremonies of feudal fealty but when it came to the turn of bohemond of antioch already mentioned to render this fealty the emperor desirous to show every species of honour to this wily person his former enemy and now apparently his ally advanced two or three paces towards the seaside where the boats lay as if in readiness for his use the distance to which the emperor moved was very small and it was assumed as a piece of deference to bohemond but it became the means of exposing alexius himself to a cutting affront which his guards and subjects felt deeply as an intentional humiliation a half score of horsemen attendants of the frankish count who was next to perform the homage with their lord at their head set off at full gallop from the right flank of the french squadrons and arriving before the throne which was yet empty they at once halted the rider at the head of the band was a strong herculean figure with a decided and stern countenance though extremely handsome looking out from thick black curls his head was surmounted with a barret cap while his hands limbs and feet were covered with garments of chamois leather over which he in general wore the ponderous and complete armour of his country this however he had laid aside for personal convenience though in doing so he evinced a total neglect of the ceremonial which marked so important a meeting he waited not a moment for the emperors return nor regarded the impropriety of obliging alexius to hurry his steps back to his throne but sprung from his gigantic horse and threw the reins loose which were instantly seized by one of the attendant pages without a moments hesitation the frank seated himself in the vacant throne of the emperor and extending his halfarmed and robust figure on the golden cushions which were destined for alexius he indolently began to caress a large wolfhound which had followed him and which feeling itself as much at ease as its master reposed its grim form on the carpets of silk and gold damask which tapestried the imperial footstool the very hound stretched itself with a bold ferocious insolence and seemed to regard no one with respect save the stern knight whom it called master the emperor turning back from the short space which as a special mark of favour he had accompanied bohemond beheld with astonishment his seat occupied by this insolent frank the bands of the halfsavage varangians who were stationed around would not have hesitated an instant in avenging the insult by prostrating the violator of their masters throne even in this act of his contempt had they not been restrained by achilles tatius and other officers who were uncertain what the emperor would do and somewhat timorous of taking a resolution for themselves meanwhile the unceremonious knight spoke aloud in a speech which though provincial might be understood by all to whom the french language was known while even those who understood it not gathered its interpretation from his tone and manner what churl is this he said who has remained sitting stationary like a block of wood or the fragment of a rock when so many noble knights the flower of chivalry and muster of gallantry stand uncovered around among the thrice conquered varangians a deep clear accent replied as if from the bottom of the earth so like it was to the accents of some being from the other world if the normans desire battle of the varangians they will meet them in the lists man to man without the poor boast of insulting the emperor of greece who is well known to fight only by the battleaxes of his guard the astonishment was so great when this answer was heard as to affect even the knight whose insult upon the emperor had occasioned it and amid the efforts of achilles to retain his soldiers within the bounds of subordination and silence a loud murmur seemed to intimate that they would not long remain so bohemond returned through the press with a celerity which did not so well suit the dignity of alexius and catching the crusader by the arm he something between fair means and a gentle degree of force obliged him to leave the chair of the emperor in which he had placed himself so boldly how is it said bohemond noble count of paris is there one of this great assembly who can see with patience that your name so widely renowned for valour is now to be quoted in an idle brawl with hirelings whose utmost boast it is to bear a mercenary battleaxe in the ranks of the emperors guards for shame for shame do not for the discredit of norman chivalry let it be so i know not said the crusader rising reluctantly i am not nice in choosing the degree of my adversary when he bears himself like one who is willing and forward in battle i am goodnatured i tell thee count bohemond and turk or tartar or wandering anglosaxon who only escapes from the chain of the normans to become the slave of the greek is equally welcome to whet his blade clean against my armour if he desires to achieve such an honourable office the emperor had heard what passed had heard it with indignation mixed with fear for he imagined the whole scheme of his policy was about to be overturned at once by a premeditated plan of personal affront and probably an assault upon his person he was about to call to arms when casting his eyes on the right flank of the crusaders he saw that all remained quiet after the frank baron had transferred himself from thence he therefore instantly resolved to let the insult pass as one of the rough pleasantries of the franks since the advance of more troops did not give any symptom of an actual onset resolving on his line of conduct with the quickness of thought he glided back to his canopy and stood beside his throne of which however he chose not instantly to take possession lest he should give the insolent stranger some ground for renewing and persisting in a competition for it what bold vavasour is this said he to count baldwin whom as is apparent from his dignity i ought to have received seated upon my throne and who thinks proper thus to vindicate his rank he is reckoned one of the bravest men in our host answered baldwin though the brave are as numerous there as the sands of the sea he will himself tell you his name and rank alexius looked at the vavasour he saw nothing in his large well formed features lighted by a wild touch of enthusiasm which spoke in his quick eye that intimated premeditated insult and was induced to suppose that what had occurred so contrary to the form and ceremonial of the grecian court was neither an intentional affront nor designed as the means of introducing a quarrel he therefore spoke with comparative ease when he addressed the stranger thus we know not by what dignified name to salute you but we are aware from count baldwins information that we are honoured in having in our presence one of the bravest knights whom a sense of the wrongs done to the holy land has brought thus far on his way to palestine to free it from its bondage if you mean to ask my name answered the european knight any one of these pilgrims can readily satisfy you and more gracefully than i can myself since we use to say in our country that many a fierce quarrel is prevented from being fought out by an untimely disclosure of names when men who might have fought with the fear of god before their eyes must when their names are manifested recognise each other as spiritual allies by baptism gossipred or some such irresistible bond of friendship whereas had they fought first and told their names afterwards they could have had some assurance of each others valour and have been able to view their relationship as an honour to both still said the emperor methinks i would know if you who in this extraordinary press of knights seem to assert a precedence to yourself claim the dignity due to a king or prince how speak you that said the frank with a brow somewhat over clouded do you feel that i have not left you unjostled by my advance to these squadrons of yours alexius hastened to answer that he felt no particular desire to connect the count with an affront or offence observing that in the extreme necessity of the empire it was no time for him who was at the helm to engage in idle or unnecessary quarrels the frankish knight heard him and answered drily since such are your sentiments i wonder that you have ever resided long enough within the hearing of the french language to learn to speak it as you do i would have thought some of the sentiments of the chivalry of the nation since you are neither a monk nor a woman would at the same time with the words of the dialect have found their way into your heart hush sir count said bohemond who remained by the emperor to avert the threatening quarrel it is surely requisite to answer the emperor with civility and those who are impatient for warfare will have infidels enough to wage it with he only demanded your name and lineage which you of all men can have the least objection to disclose i know not if it will interest this prince or emperor as you term him answered the frank count but all the account i can give of myself is this in the midst of one of the vast forests which occupy the centre of france my native country there stands a chapel sunk so low into the ground that it seems as if it were become decrepid by its own great age the image of the holy virgin who presides over its altar is called by all men our lady of the broken lances and is accounted through the whole kingdom the most celebrated for military adventures four beaten roads each leading from an opposite point in the compass meet before the principal door of the chapel and ever and anon as a good knight arrives at this place he passes in to the performance of his devotions in the chapel having first sounded his horn three times till ash and oaktree quiver and ring having then kneeled down to his devotions he seldom arises from the mass of her of the broken lances but there is attending on his leisure some adventurous knight ready to satisfy the new comers desire of battle this station have i held for a month and more against all comers and all gave me fair thanks for the knightly manner of quitting myself towards them except one who had the evil hap to fall from his horse and did break his neck and another who was struck through the body so that the lance came out behind his back about a clothyard all dripping with blood allowing for such accidents which cannot easily be avoided my opponents parted with me with fair acknowledgment of the grace i had done them i conceive sir knight said the emperor that a form like yours animated by the courage you display is likely to find few equals even among your adventurous countrymen far less among men who are taught that to cast away their lives in a senseless quarrel among themselves is to throw away like a boy the gift of providence you are welcome to your opinion said the frank somewhat contemptuously yet i assure you if you doubt that our gallant strife was unmixed with sullenness and anger and that we hunt not the hart or the boar with merrier hearts in the evening than we discharge our task of chivalry by the morn had arisen before the portal of the old chapel you do us foul injustice with the turks you will not enjoy this amiable exchange of courtesies answered alexius wherefore i would advise you neither to stray far into the van nor into the rear but to abide by the standard where the best infidels make their efforts and the best knights are required to repel them by our lady of the broken lances said the crusader i would not that the turks were more courteous than they are christian and am well pleased that unbeliever and heathen hound are a proper description for the best of them as being traitor alike to their god and to the laws of chivalry and devoutly do i trust that i shall meet with them in the front rank of our army beside our standard or elsewhere and have an open field to my devoir against them both as the enemies of our lady and the holy saints and as by their evil customs more expressly my own meanwhile you have time to seat yourself and receive my homage and i will be bound to you for despatching this foolish ceremony with as little waste and delay of time as the occasion will permit the emperor hastily seated himself and received into his the sinewy hands of the crusader who made the acknowledgment of his homage and was then guided off by count baldwin who walked with the stranger to the ships and then apparently well pleased at seeing him in the course of going on board returned back to the side of the emperor what is the name said the emperor of that singular and assuming man it is robert count of paris answered baldwin accounted one of the bravest peers who stand around the throne of france after a moments recollection alexius comnenus issued orders that the ceremonial of the day should be discontinued afraid perhaps lest the rough and careless humour of the strangers should produce some new quarrel the crusaders were led nothing loth back to palaces in which they had been hospitably received and readily resumed the interrupted feast from which they had been called to pay their homage the trumpets of the various leaders blew the recall of the few troops of an ordinary character who were attendant together with the host of knights and leaders who pleased with the indulgences provided for them and obscurely foreseeing that the passage of the bosphorus would be the commencement of their actual suffering rejoiced in being called to the hither side it was not probably intended but the hero as he might be styled of the tumultuous day count robert of paris who was already on his road to embarkation on the strait was disturbed in his purpose by the sound of recall which was echoed around nor could bohemond godfrey or any one who took upon him to explain the signal alter his resolution of returning to constantinople he laughed to scorn the threatened displeasure of the emperor and seemed to think there would be a peculiar pleasure in braving alexius at his own board or at least that nothing could be more indifferent than whether he gave offence or not to godfrey of bouillon to whom he showed some respect he was still far from paying deference and that sagacious prince having used every argument which might shake his purpose of returning to the imperial city to the very point of making it a quarrel with him in person at length abandoned him to his own discretion and pointed him out to the count of thoulouse as he passed as a wild knighterrant incapable of being influenced by any thing save his own wayward fancy he brings not five hundred men to the crusade said godfrey and i dare be sworn that even in this the very outset of the undertaking he knows not where these five hundred men are and how their wants are provided for there is an eternal trumpet in his ear sounding to assault nor has he room or time to hear a milder or more rational signal see how he strolls along yonder the very emblem of an idle schoolboy broke out of the schoolbounds upon a holyday half animated by curiosity and half by love of mischief and said raymond count of thoulouse with resolution sufficient to support the desperate purpose of the whole army of devoted crusaders and yet so passionate a rodomont is count robert that he would rather risk the success of the whole expedition that omit an opportunity of meeting a worthy antagonist en champclos or lose as he terms it a chance of worshipping our lady of the broken lances who are yon with whom he has now met and who are apparently walking or rather strolling in the same way with him back to constantinople an armed knight brilliantly equipped yet of something less than knightly stature answered godfrey it is i suppose the celebrated lady who won roberts heart in the lists of battle by bravery and valour equal to his own and the pilgrim form in the long vestments may be their daughter or niece a singular spectacle worthy knight said the count of thoulouse do our days present to us to which we have had nothing similar since gaita footnote this amazon makes a conspicuous figure in anna comnenas account of her fathers campaigns against robert guiscard on one occasion alexiad lib

keep domestic peace by an appeal to the stronger hand well replied raymond if it be rather a mortifying reflection that the lady of our love is far past the bloom of youth it is a consolation that she is too oldfashioned to beat us when we return back with no more of youth or manhood than a long crusade has left but come follow on the road to constantinople and in the rear of this most doughty knight chapter the tenth those were wild times the antipodes of ours ladies were there who oftener saw themselves in the broad lustre of a foemans shield than in a mirror and who rather sought to match themselves in battle than in dalliance to meet a lovers onset but though nature was outraged thus she was not overcome feudal times brenhilda countess of paris was one of those stalwart dames who willingly hazarded themselves in the front of battle which during the first crusade was as common as it was possible for a very unnatural custom to be and in fact gave the real instances of the marphisas and bradamantes whom the writers of romance delighted to paint assigning them sometimes the advantage of invulnerable armour or a spear whose thrust did not admit of being resisted in order to soften the improbability of the weaker sex being frequently victorious over the male part of the creation but the spell of brenhilda was of a more simple nature and rested chiefly in her great beauty from a girl she despised the pursuits of her sex and they who ventured to become suitors for the hand of the young lady of aspramonte to which warlike fief she had succeeded and which perhaps encouraged her in her fancy received for answer that they must first merit it by their good behaviour in the lists the father of brenhilda was dead her mother was of a gentle temper and easily kept under management by the young lady herself brenhildas numerous suitors readily agreed to terms which were too much according to the manners of the age to be disputed a tournament was held at the castle of aspramonte in which one half of the gallant assembly rolled headlong before their successful rivals and withdrew from the lists mortified and disappointed the successful party among the suitors were expected to be summoned to joust among themselves but they were surprised at being made acquainted with the ladys further will she aspired to wear armour herself to wield a lance and back a steed and prayed the knights that they would permit a lady whom they professed to honour so highly to mingle in their games of chivalry the young knights courteously received their young mistress in the lists and smiled at the idea of her holding them triumphantly against so many gallant champions of the other sex but the vassals and old servants of the count her father smiled to each other and intimated a different result than the gallants anticipated the knights who encountered the fair brenhilda were one by one stretched on the sand nor was it to be denied that the situation of tilting with one of the handsomest women of the time was an extremely embarrassing one each youth was bent to withhold his charge in full volley to cause his steed to swerve at the full shock or in some other way to flinch from doing the utmost which was necessary to gain the victory lest in so gaining it he might cause irreparable injury to the beautiful opponent he tilted with but the lady of aspramonte was not one who could be conquered by less than the exertion of the whole strength and talents of the victor the defeated suitors departed from the lists the more mortified at their discomfiture because robert of paris arrived at sunset and understanding what was going forward sent his name to the barriers as that of a knight who would willingly forego the reward of the tournament in case he had the fortune to gain it declaring that neither lauds nor ladies charms were what he came thither to seek brenhilda piqued and mortified chose a new lance mounted her best steed and advanced into the lists as one determined to avenge upon the new assailants brow the slight of her charms which he seemed to express but whether her displeasure had somewhat interfered with her usual skill or whether she had like others of her sex felt a partiality towards one whose heart was not particularly set upon gaining hers or whether as is often said on such occasions her fated hour was come so it was that count robert tilted with his usual address and good fortune brenhilda of aspramonte was unhorsed and unhelmed and stretched on the earth and the beautiful face which faded from very red to deadly pale before the eyes of the victor produced its natural effect in raising the value of his conquest he would in conformity with his resolution have left the castle after having mortified the vanity of the lady but her mother opportunely interposed and when she had satisfied herself that no serious injury had been sustained by the young heiress she returned her thanks to the stranger knight who had taught her daughter a lesson which she trusted she would not easily forget thus tempted to do what he secretly wished count robert gave ear to those sentiments which naturally whispered to him to be in no hurry to withdraw he was of the blood of charlemagne and what was still of more consequence in the young ladys eyes one of the most renowned of norman knights in that jousting day after a residence of ten days in the castle of aspramonte the bride and bridegroom set out for such was count roberts will with a competent train to our lady of the broken lances where it pleased him to be wedded two knights who were waiting to do battle as was the custom of the place were rather disappointed at the nature of the cavalcade which seemed to interrupt their purpose but greatly were they surprised when they received a cartel from the betrothed couple offering to substitute their own persons in the room of other antagonists and congratulating themselves in commencing their married life in a manner so consistent with that which they had hitherto led they were victorious as usual and the only persons having occasion to rue the complaisance of the count and his bride were the two strangers one of whom broke an arm in the rencontre and the other dislocated a collarbone count roberts course of knighterrantry did not seem to be in the least intermitted by his marriage on the contrary when he was called upon to support his renown his wife was often known also in military exploits nor was she inferior to him in thirst after fame they both assumed the cross at the same time that being then the predominating folly in europe the countess brenhilda was now above sixandtwenty years old with as much beauty as can well fall to the share of an amazon a figure of the largest feminine size was surmounted by a noble countenance to which even repeated warlike toils had not given more than a sunny hue relieved by the dazzling whiteness of such parts of her face as were not usually displayed as alexius gave orders that his retinue should return to constantinople he spoke in private to the follower achilles tatius the satrap answered with a submissive bend of the head and separated with a few attendants from the main body of the emperors train the principal road to the city was of course filled with the troops and with the numerous crowds of spectators all of whom were inconvenienced in some degree by the dust and heat of the weather count robert of paris had embarked his horses on board of ship and all his retinue except an old squire or valet of his own and an attendant of his wife he felt himself more incommoded in this crowd than he desired especially as his wife shared it with him and began to look among the scattered trees which fringed the shores down almost to the tidemark to see if he could discern any bypath which might carry them more circuitously but more pleasantly to the city and afford them at the same time what was their principal object in the east strange sights or adventures of chivalry a broad and beaten path seemed to promise them all the enjoyment which shade could give in a warm climate the ground through which it wound its way was beautifully broken by the appearance of temples churches and kiosks and here and there a fountain distributed its silver produce like a benevolent individual who selfdenying to himself is liberal to all others who are in necessity the distant sound of the martial music still regaled their way and at the same time as it detained the populace on the highroad prevented the strangers from becoming incommoded with fellowtravellers rejoicing in the abated heat of the daywondering at the same time at the various kinds of architecture the strange features of the landscape or accidental touches of manners exhibited by those who met or passed them upon their journey they strolled easily onwards one figure particularly caught the attention of the countess brenhilda this was an old man of great stature engaged apparently so deeply with the roll of parchment which he held in his hand that he paid no attention to the objects which were passing around him deep thought appeared to reign on his brow and his eye was of that piercing kind which seems designed to search and winnow the frivolous from the edifying part of human discussion and limit its inquiry to the last raising his eyes slowly from the parchment on which he had been gazing the look of agelastes for it was the sage himself encountered those of count robert and his lady and addressing them with the kindly epithet of my children he asked if they had missed their road or whether there was any thing in which he could do them any pleasure we are strangers father was the answer from a distant country and belonging to the army which has passed hither upon pilgrimage one object brings us here in common we hope with all that host we desire to pay our devotions where the great ransom was paid for us and to free by our good swords enslaved palestine from the usurpation and tyranny of the infidel when we have said this we have announced our highest human motive yet robert of paris and his countess would not willingly set their foot on a land save what should resound its echo they have not been accustomed to move in silence upon the face of the earth and they would purchase an eternal life of fame though it were at the price of mortal existence you seek then to barter safety for fame said agelastes though you may perchance throw death into the scale by which you hope to gain it assuredly said count robert nor is there one wearing such a belt as this to whom such a thought is stranger and as i understand said agelastes your lady shares with your honourable self in these valorous resolutions can this be you may undervalue my female courage father if such is your will said the countess but i speak in presence of a witness who can attest the truth when i say that a man of half your years had not doubted the truth with impunity nay heaven protect me from the lightning of your eyes said agelastes whether in anger or in scorn i bear an aegis about myself against what i should else have feared but age with its incapacities brings also its apologies perhaps indeed it is one like me whom you seek to find and in that case i should be happy to render to you such services as it is my duty to offer to all worthy knights i have already said replied count robert that after the accomplishment of my vow he looked upwards and crossed himself there is nothing on earth to which i am more bound than to celebrate my name in arms as becomes a valiant cavalier when men die obscurely they die for ever had my ancestor charles never left the paltry banks of the saale he had not now been much better known than any vine dresser who wielded his pruninghook in the same territories but he bore him like a brave man and his name is deathless in the memory of the worthy young man said the old grecian although it is but seldom that such as you whom i was made to serve and to value visit this country it is not the less true that i am well qualified to serve you in the matter which you have so much at heart my acquaintance with nature has been so perfect and so long that during its continuance she has disappeared and another world has been spread before me in which she has but little to do thus the curious stores which i have assembled are beyond the researches of other men and not to be laid before those whose deeds of valour are to be bounded by the ordinary probabilities of everyday nature no romancer of your romantic country ever devised such extraordinary adventures out of his own imagination and to feed the idle wonder of those who sat listening around as those which i know not of idle invention but of real positive existence with the means of achieving and accomplishing the conditions of each adventure if such be your real profession said the french count you have met one of those whom you chiefly search for nor will my countess and i stir farther upon our road until you have pointed out to us some one of those adventures which it is the business of errantknights to be industrious in seeking out so saying he sat down by the side of the old man and his lady with a degree of reverence which had something in it almost diverting followed his example we have fallen right brenhilda said count robert our guardian angel has watched his charge carefully here have we come among an ignorant set of pedants chattering their absurd language and holding more important the least look that a cowardly emperor can give than the best blow that a good knight can deal believe me i was wellnigh thinking that we had done ill to take the cross god forgive such an impious doubt yet here when we were even despairing to find the road to fame we have met with one of those excellent men whom the knights of yore were wont to find sitting by springs by crosses and by altars ready to direct the wandering knight where fame was to be found disturb him not my brenhilda said the count but let him recall to himself his stories of the ancient time and thou shalt see he will enrich us with the treasures of his information if replied agelastes after some pause i have waited for a longer term than human life is granted to most men i shall still be overpaid by dedicating what remains of existence to the service of a pair so devoted to chivalry what first occurs to me is a story of our greek country so famous in adventures and which i shall briefly detail to you afar hence in our renowned grecian archipelago amid storms and whirlpools rocks which changing their character appear to precipitate themselves against each other and billows that are never in a pacific state lies the rich island of zulichium inhabited notwithstanding its wealth by a very few natives who live only upon the seacoast the inland part of the island is one immense mountain or pile of mountains amongst which those who dare approach near enough may we are assured discern the mossgrown and antiquated towers and pinnacles of a stately but ruinous castle the habitation of the sovereign of the island in which she has been enchanted for a great many years a bold knight who came upon a pilgrimage to jerusalem made a vow to deliver this unhappy victim of pain and sorcery feeling with justice vehemently offended that the fiends of darkness should exercise any authority near the holy land which might be termed the very fountain of light two of the oldest inhabitants of the island undertook to guide him as near to the main gate as they durst nor did they approach it more closely than the length of a bowshot here then abandoned to himself the brave frank set forth upon his enterprise with a stout heart and heaven alone to friend the fabric which he approached showed by its gigantic size and splendour of outline the power and wealth of the potentate who had erected it the brazen gates unfolded themselves as if with hope and pleasure and aerial voices swept around the spires and turrets congratulating the genius of the place it might be upon the expected approach of its deliverer the knight passed on not unmoved with wonder though untainted by fear and the gothic splendours which he saw were of a kind highly to exalt his idea of the beauty of the mistress for whom a prisonhouse had been so richly decorated guards there were in eastern dress and arms upon bulwark and buttress in readiness it appeared to bend their bows but the warriors were motionless and silent and took no more notice of the armed step of the knight than if a monk or hermit had approached their guarded post they were living and yet as to all power and sense they might be considered among the dead if there was truth in the old tradition the sun had shone and the rain had fallen upon them for more than four hundred changing seasons without their being sensible of the genial warmth of the one or the coldness of the other like the israelites in the desert their shoes had not decayed nor their vestments waxed old as time left them so and without alteration was he again to find them the philosopher began now to recall what he had heard of the cause of their enchantment the sage to whom this potent charm is imputed was one of the magi who followed the tenets of zoroaster he had come to the court of this youthful princess who received him with every attention which gratified vanity could dictate so that in a short time her awe of this grave personage was lost in the sense of ascendency which her beauty gave her over him it was no difficult matter in fact it happens every day for the beautiful woman to lull the wise man into what is not inaptly called a fools paradise the sage was induced to attempt feats of youth which his years rendered ridiculous he could command the elements but the common course of nature was beyond his power when therefore he exerted his magic strength the mountains bent and the seas receded but when the philosopher attempted to lead forth the princess of zulichium in the youthful dance youths and maidens turned their heads aside lest they should make too manifest the ludicrous ideas with which they were impressed unhappily as the aged even the wisest of them will forget themselves so the young naturally enter into an alliance to spy out ridicule and enjoy their foibles many were the glances which the princess sent among her retinue intimating the nature of the amusement which she received from the attentions of her formidable lover in process of time she lost her caution and a glance was detected expressing to the old man the ridicule and contempt in which he had been all along held by the object of his affections earth has no passion so bitter as love converted to hatred and while the sage bitterly regretted what he had done he did not the less resent the lighthearted folly of the princess by whom he had been duped if however he was angry he possessed the art to conceal it not a word not a look expressed the bitter disappointment which he had received a shade of melancholy or rather gloom upon his brow alone intimated the coming storm the princess became somewhat alarmed she was besides extremely goodnatured nor had her intentions of leading the old man into what would render him ridiculous been so accurately planned with malice prepense as they were the effect of accident and chance she saw the pain which he suffered and thought to end it by going up to him when about to retire and kindly wishing him good night you say well daughter said the sage goodnight but who of the numbers who hear me shall say goodmorning the speech drew little attention although two or three persons to whom the character of the sage was known fled from the island that very night and by their report made known the circumstances attending the first infliction of this extraordinary spell on those who remained within the castle a sleep like that of death fell upon them and was not removed most of the inhabitants left the island the few who remained were cautious how they approached the castle and watched until some bold adventurer should bring that happy awakening which the speech of the sorcerer seemed in some degree to intimate never seemed there a fairer opportunity for that awakening to take place than when the proud step of artavan de hautlieu was placed upon those enchanted courts on the left lay the palace and donjonkeep but the right more attractive seemed to invite to the apartment of the women at a side door reclined on a couch two guards of the haram with their naked swords grasped in their hands and features fiendishly contorted between sleep and dissolution seemed to menace death to any who should venture to approach this threat deterred not artavan de hautlieu he approached the entrance when the doors like those of the great entrance to the castle made themselves instantly accessible to him a guardroom of the same effeminate soldiers received him nor could the strictest examination have discovered to him whether it was sleep or death which arrested the eyes that seemed to look upon and prohibit his advance unheeding the presence of these ghastly sentinels artavan pressed forward into an inner apartment where female slaves of the most distinguished beauty were visible in the attitude of those who had already assumed their dress for the night there was much in this scene which might have arrested so young a pilgrim as artavan of hautlieu but his heart was fixed on achieving the freedom of the beautiful princess nor did he suffer himself to be withdrawn from that object by any inferior consideration he passed on therefore to a little ivory door which after a moments pause as if in maidenly hesitation gave way like the rest and yielded access to the sleeping apartment of the princess herself a soft light resembling that of evening penetrated into a chamber where every thing seemed contrived to exalt the luxury of slumber the heaps of cushions which formed a stately bed seemed rather to be touched than impressed by the form of a nymph of fifteen the renowned princess of zulichium without interrupting you good father said the countess brenhilda it seems to me that we can comprehend the picture of a woman asleep without much dilating upon it and that such a subject is little recommended either by our age or by yours pardon me noble lady answered agelastes the most approved part of my story has ever been this passage and while i now suppress it in obedience to your command bear notice i pray you that i sacrifice the most beautiful part of the tale brenhilda added the count i am surprised you think of interrupting a story which has hitherto proceeded with so much fire the telling of a few words more or less will surely have a much greater influence upon the sense of the narrative than such an addition can possibly possess over our sentiments of action as you will said his lady throwing herself carelessly back upon the seat but methinks the worthy father protracts this discourse till it becomes of a nature more trifling than interesting brenhilda said the count this is the first time i have remarked in you a womans weakness i may as well say count robert that it is the first time answered brenhilda that you have shown to me the inconstancy of your sex gods and goddesses said the philosopher was ever known a quarrel more absurdly founded the countess is jealous of one whom her husband probably never will see nor is there any prospect that the princess of zulichium will be hereafter better known to the modern world than if the curtain hung before her tomb proceed said count robert of paris if sir artavan of hautlieu has not accomplished the enfranchisement of the princess of zulichium i make a vow to our lady of the broken lances remember said his lady interfering that you are already under a vow to free the sepulchre of god and to that methinks all lighter engagements might give place well lady well said count robert but half satisfied with this interference i will not engage myself you may be assured on any adventure which may claim precedence of the enterprise of the holy sepulchre to which we are all bound alas said agelastes the distance of zulichium from the speediest route to the sepulchre is so small that worthy father said the countess we will if it pleases you hear your tale to an end and then determine what we will do we norman ladies descendants of the old germans claim a voice with our lords in the council which precedes the battle nor has our assistance in the conflict been deemed altogether useless the tone in which this was spoken conveyed an awkward innuendo to the philosopher who began to foresee that the guidance of the norman knight would be more difficult than he had foreseen while his consort remained by his side he took up therefore his oratory on somewhat a lower key than before and avoided those warm descriptions which had given such offence to the countess brenhilda sir artavan de hautlieu says the story considered in what way he should accost the sleeping damsel when it occurred to him in what manner the charm would be most likely to be reversed i am in your judgment fair lady if he judged wrong in resolving that the method of his address should be a kiss upon the lips the colour of brenhilda was somewhat heightened but she did not deem the observation worthy of notice never had so innocent an action continued the philosopher an effect more horrible the delightful light of a summer evening was instantly changed into a strange lurid hue which infected with sulphur seemed to breathe suffocation through the apartment the rich hangings and splendid furniture of the chamber the very walls themselves were changed into huge stones tossed together at random like the inside of a wild beasts den nor was the den without an inhabitant the beautiful and innocent lips to which artavan de hautlieu had approached his own were now changed into the hideous and bizarre form and bestial aspect of a fiery dragon a moment she hovered upon the wing and it is said had sir artavan found courage to repeat his salute three times he would then have remained master of all the wealth and of the disenchanted princess but the opportunity was lost and the dragon or the creature who seemed such sailed out at a side window upon its broad pennons uttering loud wails of disappointment here ended the story of agelastes the princess he said is still supposed to abide her doom in the island of zulichium and several knights have undertaken the adventure but i know not whether it was the fear of saluting the sleeping maiden or that of approaching the dragon into which she was transformed but so it is the spell remains unachieved i know the way and if you say the word you may be to morrow on the road to the castle of enchantment the countess heard this proposal with the deepest anxiety for she knew that she might by opposition determine her husband irrevocably upon following out the enterprise she stood therefore with a timid and bashful look strange in a person whose bearing was generally so dauntless and prudently left it to the uninfluenced mind of count robert to form the resolution which should best please him brenhilda he said taking her hand fame and honour are dear to thy husband as ever they were to knight who buckled a brand upon his side thou hast done perhaps i may say for me what i might in vain have looked for from ladies of thy condition and therefore thou mayst well expect a casting voice in such points of deliberation why dost thou wander by the side of a foreign and unhealthy shore instead of the banks of the lovely seine why dost thou wear a dress unusual to thy sex why dost thou seek death and think it little in comparison of shame why but that the count of paris may have a bride worthy of him dost thou think that this affection is thrown away no by the saints thy knight repays it as he best ought and sacrifices to thee every thought which thy affection may less than entirely approve poor brenhilda confused as she was by the various emotions with which she was agitated now in vain endeavoured to maintain the heroic deportment which her character as an amazon required from her she attempted to assume the proud and lofty look which was properly her own but failing in the effort she threw herself into the counts arms hung round his neck and wept like a village maiden whose true love is pressed for the wars her husband a little ashamed while he was much moved by this burst of affection in one to whose character it seemed an unusual attribute was at the same time pleased and proud that he could have awakened an affection so genuine and so gentle in a soul so highspirited and so unbending not thus he said my brenhilda i would not have it thus either for thine own sake or for mine do not let this wise old man suppose that thy heart is made of the malleable stuff which forms that of other maidens and apologize to him as may well become thee for having prevented my undertaking the adventure of zulichium which he recommends it was not easy for brenhilda to recover herself after having afforded so notable an instance how nature can vindicate her rights with whatever rigour she may have been disciplined and tyrannized over with a look of ineffable affection she disjoined herself from her husband still keeping hold of his hand and turning to the old man with a countenance in which the halfeffaced tears were succeeded by smiles of pleasure and of modesty she spoke to agelastes as she would to a person whom she respected and towards whom she had some offence to atone father she said respectfully be not angry with me that i should have been an obstacle to one of the best knights that ever spurred steed undertaking the enterprise of thine enchanted princess but the truth is that in our land where knighthood and religion agree in permitting only one lady love and one lady wife we do not quite so willingly see our husbands run into danger especially of that kind where lonely ladies are the parties relieved and and kisses are the ransom paid i have as much confidence in my roberts fidelity as a lady can have in a loving knight but still lovely lady said agelastes who notwithstanding his highly artificial character could not help being moved by the simple and sincere affection of the handsome young pair you have done no evil the state of the princess is no worse than it was and there cannot be a doubt that the knight fated to relieve her will appear at the destined period the countess smiled sadly and shook her head you do not know she said how powerful is the aid of which i have unhappily deprived this unfortunate lady by a jealousy which i now feel to have been alike paltry and unworthy and such is my regret that i could find in my heart to retract my opposition to count roberts undertaking this adventure she looked at her husband with some anxiety as one that had made an offer she would not willingly see accepted and did not recover her courage until he said decidedly brenhilda that may not be and why then may not brenhilda herself take the adventure continued the countess since she can neither fear the charms of the princess nor the terrors of the dragon lady said agelastes the princess must be awakened by the kiss of love and not by that of friendship a sufficient reason said the countess smiling why a lady may not wish her lord to go forth upon an adventure of which the conditions are so regulated noble minstrel or herald or by whatever name this country calls you said count robert accept a small remuneration for an hour pleasantly spent though spent unhappily in vain i should make some apology for the meanness of my offering but french knights you may have occasion to know are more full of fame than of wealth not for that noble sir replied agelastes would i refuse your munificence a besant from your worthy hand or that of your noble minded lady were centupled in its value by the eminence of the persons from whom it came i would hang it round my neck by a string of pearls and when i came into the presence of knights and of ladies i would proclaim that this addition to my achievement of armorial distinction was bestowed by the renowned count robert of paris and his unequalled lady the knight and the countess looked on each other and the lady taking from her finger a ring of pure gold prayed the old man to accept of it as a mark of her esteem and her husbands with one other condition said the philosopher which i trust you will not find altogether unsatisfactory i have on the way to the city by the most pleasant road a small kiosk or hermitage where i sometimes receive my friends who i venture to say are among the most respectable personages of this empire two or three of these will probably honour my residence today and partake of the provision it affords could i add to these the company of the noble count and countess of paris i should deem my poor habitation honoured for ever how say you my noble wife said the count the company of a minstrel befits the highest birth honours the highest rank and adds to the greatest achievements and the invitation does us too much credit to be rejected it grows somewhat late said the countess but we came not here to shun a sinking sun or a darkening sky and i feel it my duty as well as my satisfaction to place at the command of the good father every pleasure which it is in my power to offer to him for having been the means of your neglecting his advice the path is so short said agelastes that we had better keep our present mode of travelling if the lady should not want the assistance of horses no horses on my account said the lady brenhilda my waitingwoman agatha has what necessaries i may require and for the rest no knight ever travelled so little embarrassed with baggage as my husband agelastes therefore led the way through the deepening wood which was freshened by the cooler breath of evening and his guests accompanied him chapter the eleventh without a ruin broken tangled cumbrous within it was a little paradise where taste had made her dwelling statuary firstborn of human art moulded her images and bade men mark and worship anonymous the count of paris and his lady attended the old man whose advanced age his excellence in the use of the french language which he spoke to admiration above all his skill in applying it to poetical and romantic subjects which was essential to what was then termed history and belles lettres drew from the noble hearers a degree of applause which as agelastes had seldom been vain enough to consider as his due so on the part of the knight of paris and his lady had it been but rarely conferred they had walked for some time by a path which sometimes seemed to hide itself among the woods that came down to the shore of the propontis sometimes emerged from concealment and skirted the open margin of the strait while at every turn it seemed guided by the desire to select a choice and contrast of beauty variety of scenes and manners enlivened from their novelty the landscape to the pilgrims by the seashore nymphs were seen dancing and shepherds piping or beating the tambourine to their steps as represented in some groups of ancient statuary the very faces had a singular resemblance to the antique if old their long robes their attitudes and magnificent heads presented the ideas which distinguish prophets and saints while on the other hand the features of the young recalled the expressive countenances of the heroes of antiquity and the charms of those lovely females by whom their deeds were inspired but the race of the greeks was no longer to be seen even in its native country unmixed or in absolute purity on the contrary they saw groups of persons with features which argued a different descent in a retiring bosom of the shore which was traversed by the path the rocks receding from the beach rounded off a spacious portion of level sand and in some degree enclosed it a party of heathen scythians whom they beheld presented the deformed features of the demons they were said to worship flat noses with expanded nostrils which seemed to admit the sight to their very brain faces which extended rather in breadth than length with strange unintellectual eyes placed in the extremity figures short and dwarfish yet garnished with legs and arms of astonishing sinewy strength disproportioned to their bodies as the travellers passed the savages held a species of tournament as the count termed it in this they exercised themselves by darting at each other long reeds or canes balanced for the purpose which in this rude sport they threw with such force as not unfrequently to strike each other from their steeds and otherwise to cause serious damage some of the combatants being for the time out of the play devoured with greedy looks the beauty of the countess and eyed her in such a manner that she said to count robert i have never known fear my husband nor is it for me to acknowledge it now but if disgust be an ingredient of it these misformed brutes are qualified to inspire it what ho sir knight exclaimed one of the infidels your wife or your lady love has committed a fault against the privileges of the imperial scythians and not small will be the penalty she has incurred you may go your way as fast as you will out of this place which is for the present our hippodrome or atmeidan call it which you will as you prize the roman or the saracen language but for your wife if the sacrament has united you believe my word that she parts not so soon or so easy scoundrel heathen said the christian knight dost thou hold that language to a peer of france agelastes here interposed and using the sounding language of a grecian courtier reminded the scythians mercenary soldiers as they seemed of the empire that all violence against the european pilgrims was by the imperial orders strictly prohibited under pain of death i know better said the exulting savage shaking one or two javelins with broad steel heads and wings of the eagles feather which last were dabbled in blood ask the wings of my javelin he said in whose hearts blood these feathers have been dyed they shall reply to you that if alexius comnenus be the friend of the european pilgrims it is only while he looks upon them and we are too exemplary soldiers to serve our emperor otherwise than he wishes to be served peace toxartis said the philosopher thou beliest thine emperor peace thou said toxartis or i will do a deed that misbecomes a soldier and rid the world of a prating old man so saying he put forth his hand to take hold of the countesss veil with the readiness which frequent use had given to the warlike lady she withdrew herself from the heathens grasp and with her trenchant sword dealt him so sufficient a blow that toxartis lay lifeless on the plain the count leapt on the fallen leaders steed and crying his warcry son of charlemagne to the rescue he rode amid the rout of heathen cavaliers with a battleaxe which he found at the saddlebow of the deceased chieftain and wielding it with remorseless dexterity he soon slew or wounded or compelled to flight the objects of his resentment nor was there any of them who abode an instant to support the boast which they had made the despicable churls said the countess to agelastes it irks me that a drop of such coward blood should stain the hands of a noble knight they call their exercise a tournament although in their whole exertions every blow is aimed behind the back and not one has the courage to throw his windlestraw while he perceives that of another pointed against himself such is their custom said agelastes not perhaps so much from cowardice as from habit in exercising before his imperial majesty i have seen that toxartis literally turn his back upon the mark when he bent his bow in full career and when in the act of galloping the farthest from his object he pierced it through the very centre with a broad arrow a force of such soldiers said count robert who had now rejoined his friends could not methinks be very formidable where there was but an ounce of genuine courage in the assailants mean time let us pass on to my kiosk said agelastes lest the fugitives find friends to encourage them in thoughts of revenge such friends said count robert methinks the insolent heathens ought not to find in any land which calls itself christian and if i survive the conquest of the holy sepulchre i shall make it my first business to enquire by what right your emperor retains in his service a band of paynim and unmannerly cutthroats who dare offer injury upon the highway which ought to be sacred to the peace of god and the king and to noble ladies and inoffensive pilgrims it is one of a list of many questions which my vow accomplished i will not fail to put to him ay and expecting an answer as they say prompt and categorical you shall gain no answer from me though said agelastes to himself your demands sir knight are overperemptory and imposed under too rigid conditions to be replied to by those who can evade them he changed the conversation accordingly with easy dexterity and they had not proceeded much farther before they reached a spot the natural beauties of which called forth the admiration of his foreign companions a copious brook gushing out of the woodland descended to the sea with no small noise and tumult and as if disdaining a quieter course which it might have gained by a little circuit to the right it took the readiest road to the ocean plunging over the face of a lofty and barren precipice which overhung the seashore and from thence led its little tribute with as much noise as if it had the stream of a full river to boast of to the waters of the hellespont the rock we have said was bare unless in so far as it was clothed with the foaming waters of the cataract but the banks on each side were covered with planetrees walnuttrees cypresses and other kinds of large timber proper to the east the fall of water always agreeable in a warm climate and generally produced by artificial means was here natural and had been chosen something like the sibyls temple at tivoli for the seat of a goddess to whom the invention of polytheism had assigned a sovereignty over the department around the shrine was small and circular like many of the lesser temples of the rustic deities and enclosed by the wall of an outer court after its desecration it had probably been converted into a luxurious summer retreat by agelastes or some epicurean philosopher as the building itself of a light airy and fantastic character was dimly seen through the branches and foliage on the edge of the rock so the mode by which it was accessible was not at first apparent amongst the mist of the cascade a pathway a good deal hidden by vegetation ascended by a gentle acclivity and prolonged by the architect by means of a few broad and easy marble steps making part of the original approach conducted the passenger to a small but exquisitely lovely velvet lawn in front of the turret or temple we have described the back part of which building overhung the cataract chapter the twelfth the parties met the wily wordy greek weighing each word and canvassing each syllable evading arguing equivocating and the stern frank came with his twohand sword watching to see which way the balance sways that he may throw it in and turn the scales palestine at a signal made by agelastes the door of this romantic retreat was opened by diogenes the negro slave to whom our readers have been already introduced nor did it escape the wily old man that the count and his lady testified some wonder at his form and lineaments being the first african perhaps whom they had ever seen so closely the philosopher lost not the opportunity of making an impression on their minds by a display of the superiority of his knowledge this poor being he observed is of the race of ham the undutiful son of noah for his transgressions against his parent he was banished to the sands of africa and was condemned to be the father of a race doomed to be the slaves of the issue of his more dutiful brethren the knight and his lady gazed on the wonderful appearance before them and did not it may be believed think of doubting the information which was so much of a piece with their prejudices while their opinion of their host was greatly augmented by the supposed extent of his knowledge it gives pleasure to a man of humanity continued agelastes when in old age or sickness we must employ the services of others which is at other times scarce lawful to choose his assistants out of a race of beings hewers of wood and drawers of water from their birth upwards destined to slavery and to whom therefore by employing them as slaves we render no injury but carry into effect in a slight degree the intentions of the great being who made us all are there many of a race said the countess so singularly unhappy in their destination i have hitherto thought the stories of black men as idle as those which minstrels tell of fairies and ghosts do not believe so said the philosopher the race is numerous as the sands of the sea neither are they altogether unhappy in discharging the duties which their fate has allotted them those who are of worse character suffer even in this life the penance due to their guilt they become the slaves of the cruel and tyrannical are beaten starved and mutilated to those whose moral characters are better better masters are provided who share with their slaves as with their children food and raiment and the other good things which they themselves enjoy to some heaven allots the favour of kings and of conquerors and to a few but those the chief favourites of the species hath been assigned a place in the mansions of philosophy where by availing themselves of the lights which their masters can afford they gain a prospect into that world which is the residence of true happiness methinks i understand you replied the countess and if so i ought rather to envy our sable friend here than to pity him for having been allotted in the partition of his kind to the possession of his present master from whom doubtless he has acquired the desirable knowledge which you mention he learns at least said agelastes modestly what i can teach and above all to be contented with his situation diogenes my good child said he changing his address to the slave thou seest i have company what does the poor hermits larder afford with which he may regale his honoured guests hitherto they had advanced no farther than a sort of outer room or hall of entrance fitted up with no more expense than might have suited one who desired at some outlay and more taste to avail himself of the ancient building for a sequestered and private retirement the chairs and couches were covered with eastern wove mats and were of the simplest and most primitive form but on touching a spring an interior apartment was displayed which had considerable pretension to splendour and magnificence the furniture and hangings of this apartment were of strawcoloured silk wrought on the looms of persia and crossed with embroidery which produced a rich yet simple effect the ceiling was carved in arabesque and the four corners of the apartment were formed into recesses for statuary which had been produced in a better age of the art than that which existed at the period of our story in one nook a shepherd seemed to withdraw himself as if ashamed to produce his scantilycovered person while he was willing to afford the audience the music of the reed which he held in his hand three damsels resembling the graces in the beautiful proportions of their limbs and the slender clothing which they wore lurked in different attitudes each in her own niche and seemed but to await the first sound of the music to bound forth from thence and join in the frolic dance the subject was beautiful yet somewhat light to ornament the study of such a sage as agelastes represented himself to be he seemed to be sensible that this might attract observation these figures he said executed at the period of the highest excellence of grecian art were considered of old as the choral nymphs assembled to adore the goddess of the place waiting but the music to join in the worship of the temple and in truth the wisest may be interested in seeing how near to animation the genius of these wonderful men could bring the inflexible marble allow but for the absence of the divine afflatus or breath of animation and an unenlightened heathen might suppose the miracle of prometheus was about to be realized but we said he looking upwards are taught to form a better judgment between what man can do and the productions of the deity some subjects of natural history were painted on the walls and the philosopher fixed the attention of his guests upon the halfreasoning elephant of which he mentioned several anecdotes which they listened to with great eagerness a distant strain was here heard as if of music in the woods penetrating by fits through the hoarse roar of the cascade which as it sunk immediately below the windows filled the apartment with its deep voice apparently said agelastes the friends whom i expected are approaching and bring with them the means of enchanting another sense it is well they do so since wisdom tells us that we best honour the deity by enjoying the gifts he has provided us these words called the attention of the philosophers frankish guests to the preparations exhibited in this tasteful saloon these were made for an entertainment in the manner of the ancient romans and couches which were laid beside a table ready decked announced that the male guests at least were to assist at the banquet in the usual recumbent posture of the ancients while seats placed among the couches seemed to say that females were expected who would observe the grecian customs in eating seated the preparations for good cheer were such as though limited in extent could scarce be excelled in quality either by the splendid dishes which decked trimalchios banquet of former days or the lighter delicacies of grecian cookery or the succulent and highlyspiced messes indulged in by the nations of the east to whichever they happened to give the preference and it was with an air of some vanity that agelastes asked his guests to share a poor pilgrims meal we care little for dainties said the count nor does our present course of life as pilgrims bound by a vow allow us much choice on such subjects whatever is food for soldiers suffices the countess and myself for with our will we would at every hour be ready for battle and the less time we use in preparing for the field it is even so much the better sit then brenhilda since the good man will have it so and let us lose no time in refreshment lest we waste that which should be otherwise employed a moments forgiveness said agelastes until the arrival of my other friends whose music you may now hear is close at hand and who will not long i may safely promise divide you from your meal for that said the count there is no haste and since you seem to account it a part of civil manners brenhilda and i can with ease postpone our repast unless you will permit us what i own would be more pleasing to take a morsel of bread and a cup of water presently and thus refreshed to leave the space clear for your more curious and more familiar guests the saints above forbid said agelastes guests so honoured never before pressed these cushions nor could do so if the sacred family of the imperial alexius himself even now stood at the gate he had hardly uttered these words when the fullblown peal of a trumpet louder in a tenfold degree than the strains of music they had before heard was now sounded in the front of the temple piercing through the murmur of the waterfall as a damascus blade penetrates the armour and assailing the ears of the hearers as the sword pierces the flesh of him who wears the harness you seem surprised or alarmed father said count robert is there danger near and do you distrust our protection no said agelastes that would give me confidence in any extremity but these sounds excite awe not fear they tell me that some of the imperial family are about to be my guests yet fear nothing my noble friends they whose look is life are ready to shower their favours with profusion upon strangers so worthy of honour as they will see here meantime my brow must touch my threshold in order duly to welcome them so saying he hurried to the outer door of the building each land has its customs said the count as he followed his host with his wife hanging on his arm but brenhilda as they are so various it is little wonder that they appear unseemly to each other here however in deference to my entertainer i stoop my crest in the manner which seems to be required so saying he followed agelastes into the anteroom where a new scene awaited them chapter the thirteenth agelastes gained his threshold before count robert of paris and his lady he had therefore time to make his prostrations before a huge animal then unknown to the western world but now universally distinguished as the elephant on its back was a pavilion or palanquin within which were enclosed the august persons of the empress irene and her daughter anna comnena nicephorus briennius attended the princesses in the command of a gallant body of light horse whose splendid armour would have given more pleasure to the crusader if it had possessed less an air of useless wealth and effeminate magnificence but the effect which it produced in its appearance was as brilliant as could well be conceived the officers alone of this corps de garde followed nicephorus to the platform prostrated themselves while the ladies of the imperial house descended and rose up again under a cloud of waving plumes and flashing lances when they stood secure upon the platform in front of the building here the somewhat aged but commanding form of the empress and the still juvenile beauties of the fair historian were seen to great advantage in the front of a deep background of spears and waving crests stood the sounder of the sacred trumpet conspicuous by his size and the richness of his apparel he kept his post on a rock above the stone staircase and by an occasional note of his instrument intimated to the squadrons beneath that they should stay their progress and attend the motions of the empress and the wife of the caesar the fair form of the countess brenhilda and the fantastic appearance of her half masculine garb attracted the attention of the ladies of alexius family but was too extraordinary to command their admiration agelastes became sensible there was a necessity that he should introduce his guests to each other if he desired they should meet on satisfactory terms may i speak he said and live the armed strangers whom you find now with me are worthy companions of those myriads whom zeal for the suffering inhabitants of palestine has brought from the western extremity of europe at once to enjoy the countenance of alexius comnenus and to aid him since it pleases him to accept their assistance in expelling the paynims from the bounds of the sacred empire and garrison those regions in their stead as vassals of his imperial majesty we are pleased said the empress worthy agelastes that you should be kind to those who are disposed to be so reverent to the emperor and we are rather disposed to talk with them ourselves that our daughter whom apollo hath gifted with the choice talent of recording what she sees may become acquainted with one of those female warriors of the west of whom we have heard so much by common fame and yet know so little with certainty madam said the count i can but rudely express to you what i have to find fault with in the explanation which this old man hath given of our purpose in coming hither certain it is we neither owe alexius fealty nor had we the purpose of paying him any when we took the vow upon ourselves which brought us against asia we came because we understood that the holy land had been torn from the greek emperor by the pagans saracens turks and other infidels from whom we are come to win it back the wisest and most prudent among us have judged it necessary to acknowledge the emperors authority since there was no such safe way of passing to the discharge of our vow as that of acknowledging fealty to him as the best mode of preventing quarrels among christian states we though independent of any earthly king do not pretend to be greater men than they and therefore have condescended to pay the same homage the empress coloured several times with indignation in the course of this speech which in more passages than one was at variance with those imperial maxims of the grecian court which held its dignity so high and plainly intimated a tone of opinion which was depreciating to the emperors power but the empress irene had received instructions from her imperial spouse to beware how she gave or even took any ground of quarrel with the crusaders who though coming in the appearance of subjects were nevertheless too punctilious and ready to take fire to render them safe discussers of delicate differences she made a graceful reverence accordingly as if she had scarce understood what the count of paris had explained so bluntly at this moment the appearance of the principal persons on either hand attracted in a wonderful degree the attention of the other party and there seemed to exist among them a general desire of further acquaintance and at the same time a manifest difficulty in expressing such a wish agelastes to begin with the master of the house had risen from the ground indeed but without venturing to assume an upright posture he remained before the imperial ladies with his body and head still bent his hand interposed between his eyes and their faces like a man that would shade his eyesight from the level sun and awaited in silence the commands of those to whom he seemed to think it disrespectful to propose the slightest action save by testifying in general that his house and his slaves were at their unlimited command the countess of paris on the other hand and her warlike husband were the peculiar objects of curiosity to irene and her accomplished daughter anna comnena and it occurred to both these imperial ladies that they had never seen finer specimens of human strength and beauty but by a natural instinct they preferred the manly bearing of the husband to that of the wife which seemed to her own sex rather too haughty and too masculine to be altogether pleasing count robert and his lady had also their own object of attention in the newly arrived group and to speak truth it was nothing else than the peculiarities of the monstrous animal which they now saw for the first time employed as a beast of burden in the service of the fair irene and her daughter the dignity and splendour of the elder princess the grace and vivacity of the younger were alike lost in brenhildas earnest inquiries into the history of the elephant and the use which it made of its trunk tusks and huge ears upon different occasions another person who took a less direct opportunity to gaze on brenhilda with a deep degree of interest was the caesar nicephorus this prince kept his eye as steadily upon the frankish countess as he could well do without attracting the attention and exciting perhaps the suspicions of his wife and motherinlaw he therefore endeavoured to restore speech to an interview which would have been awkward without it it is possible he said beautiful countess that this being your first visit to the queen of the world you have never hitherto seen the singularly curious animal called the elephant pardon me said the countess i have been treated by this learned gentleman to a sight and some account of that wonderful creature by all who heard this observation the lady brenhilda was supposed to have made a satirical thrust at the philosopher himself who in the imperial court usually went by the name of the elephant no one could describe the beast more accurately than agelastes said the princess with a smile of intelligence which went round her attendants he knows its docility its sensibility and its fidelity said the philosopher in a subdued tone true good agelastes said the princess we should not criticise the animal which kneels to take us up come lady of a foreign land she continued turning to the frank count and especially his countess and you her gallant lord when you return to your native country you shall say you have seen the imperial family partake of their food and in so far acknowledge themselves to be of the same clay with other mortals sharing their poorest wants and relieving them in the same manner that gentle lady i can well believe said count robert my curiosity would be more indulged by seeing this strange animal at his food you will see the elephant more conveniently at his mess within doors answered the princess looking at agelastes lady said brenhilda i would not willingly refuse an invitation given in courtesy but the sun has waxed low unnoticed and we must return to the city be not afraid said the fair historian you shall have the advantage of our imperial escort to protect you in your return fear afraid escort protect these are words i know not know lady that my husband the noble count of paris is my sufficient escort and even were he not with me brenhilda de aspramonte fears nothing and can defend herself fair daughter said agelastes if i may be permitted to speak you mistake the gracious intentions of the princess who expresses herself as to a lady of her own land what she desires is to learn from you some of the most marked habits and manners of the franks of which you are so beautiful an example and in return for such information the illustrious princess would be glad to procure your entrance to those spacious collections where animals from all corners of the habitable world have been assembled at the command of our emperor alexius as if to satisfy the wisdom of those sages to whom all creation is known from the deer so small in size that it is exceeded by an ordinary rat to that huge and singular inhabitant of africa that can browse on the tops of trees that are forty feet high while the length of its hind legs does not exceed the half of that wondrous height it is enough said the countess with some eagerness but agelastes had got a point of discussion after his own mind there is also he said that huge lizard which resembling in shape the harmless inhabitant of the moors of other countries is in egypt a monster thirty feet in length clothed in impenetrable scales and moaning over his prey when he catches it with the hope and purpose of drawing others within his danger by mimicking the lamentations of humanity say no more father exclaimed the lady my robert we will go will we not where such objects are to be seen there is also said agelastes who saw that he would gain his point by addressing himself to the curiosity of the strangers the huge animal wearing on its back an invulnerable vestment having on its nose a horn and sometimes two the folds of whose hide are of the most immense thickness and which never knight was able to wound we will go robert will we not reiterated the countess ay replied the count and teach these easterns how to judge of a knights sword by a single blow of my trusty tranchefer and who knows said brenhilda since this is a land of enchantment but what some person who is languishing in a foreign shape may have their enchantment unexpectedly dissolved by a stroke of the good weapon say no more father exclaimed the count we will attend this princess since such she is were her whole escort bent to oppose our passage instead of being by her command to be our guard for know all who hear me thus much of the nature of the franks that when you tell us of danger and difficulties you give us the same desire to travel the road where they lie as other men have in seeking either pleasure or profit in the paths in which such are to be found as the count pronounced these words he struck his hand upon his tranchefer as an illustration of the manner in which he purposed upon occasion to make good his way the courtly circle startled somewhat at the clash of steel and the fiery look of the chivalrous count robert the empress indulged her alarm by retreating into the inner apartment of the pavilion with a grace which was rarely deigned to any but those in close alliance with the imperial family anna comnena took the arm of the noble count i see she said that the imperial mother has honoured the house of the learned agelastes by leading the way therefore to teach you grecian breeding must fall to my share saying this she conducted him to the inner apartment fear not for your wife she said as she noticed the frank look round our husband like ourselves has pleasure in showing attention to the stranger and will lead the countess to our board it is not the custom of the imperial family to eat in company with strangers but we thank heaven for having instructed us in that civility which can know no degradation in dispensing with ordinary rules to do honour to strangers of such merit as yours i know it will be my mothers request that you will take your places without ceremony and also although the grace be somewhat particular i am sure that it will have my imperial fathers approbation be it as your ladyship lists said count robert there are few men to whom i would yield place at the board if they had not gone before me in the battlefield to a lady especially so fair a one i willingly yield my place and bend my knee whenever i have the good hap to meet her the princess anna instead of feeling herself awkward in the discharge of the extraordinary and as she might have thought it degrading office of ushering a barbarian chief to the banquet felt on the contrary flattered at having bent to her purpose a heart so obstinate as that of count robert and elated perhaps with a certain degree of satisfied pride while under his momentary protection the empress irene had already seated herself at the head of the table she looked with some astonishment when her daughter and soninlaw taking their seats at her right and left hand invited the count and countess of paris the former to recline the latter to sit at the board in the places next to themselves but she had received the strictest orders from her husband to be deferential in every respect to the strangers and did not think it right therefore to interpose any ceremonious scruples the countess took her seat as indicated beside the caesar and the count instead of reclining in the mode of the grecian men also seated himself in the european fashion by the princess i will not lie prostrate said he laughing except in consideration of a blow weighty enough to compel me to do so nor then either if i am able to start up and return it the service of the table then began and to say truth it appeared to be an important part of the business of the day the officers who attended to perform their several duties of deckers of the table sewers of the banquet removers and tasters to the imperial family thronged into the banqueting room and seemed to vie with each other in calling upon agelastes for spices condiments sauces and wines of various kinds the variety and multiplicity of their demands being apparently devised ex preposito for stirring the patience of the philosopher but agelastes who had anticipated most of their requests however unusual supplied them completely or in the greatest part by the ready agency of his active slave diogenes to whom at the same time he contrived to transfer all blame for the absence of such articles as he was unable to provide be homer my witness the accomplished virgil and the curious felicity of horace that trifling and unworthy as this banquet was my note of directions to this thrice unhappy slave gave the instructions to procure every ingredient necessary to convey to each dish its proper gusto illomened carrion that thou art wherefore placedst thou the pickled cucumber so far apart from the boars head and why are these superb congers unprovided with a requisite quantity of fennel the divorce betwixt the shellfish and the chian wine in a presence like this is worthy of the divorce of thine own soul from thy body or to say the least of a lifelong residence in the pistrinum while thus the philosopher proceeded with threats curses and menaces against his slave the stranger might have an opportunity of comparing the little torrent of his domestic eloquence which the manners of the times did not consider as illbred with the louder and deeper share of adulation towards his guests they mingled like the oil with the vinegar and pickles which diogenes mixed for the sauce thus the count and countess had an opportunity to estimate the happiness and the felicity reserved for those slaves whom the omnipotent jupiter in the plenitude of compassion for their state and in guerdon of their good morals had dedicated to the service of a philosopher the share they themselves took in the banquet was finished with a degree of speed which gave surprise not only to their host but also to the imperial guests the count helped himself carelessly out of a dish which stood near him and partaking of a draught of wine without enquiring whether it was of the vintage which the greeks held it matter of conscience to mingle with that species of food he declared himself satisfied nor could the obliging entreaties of his neighbour anna comnena induce him to partake of other messes represented as being either delicacies or curiosities his spouse ate still more moderately of the food which seemed most simply cooked and stood nearest her at the board and partook of a cup of crystal water which she slightly tinged with wine at the persevering entreaty of the caesar they then relinquished the farther business of the banquet and leaning back upon their seats occupied themselves in watching the liberal credit done to the feast by the rest of the guests present a modern synod of gourmands would hardly have equalled the imperial family of greece seated at a philosophical banquet whether in the critical knowledge displayed of the science of eating in all its branches or in the practical cost and patience with which they exercised it the ladies indeed did not eat much of any one dish but they tasted of almost all that were presented to them and their name was legion yet after a short time in homeric phrase the rage of thirst and hunger was assuaged or more probably the princess anna comnena was tired of being an object of some inattention to the guest who sat next her and who joining his high military character to his very handsome presence was a person by whom few ladies would willingly be neglected there is no new guise says our father chaucer but what resembles an old one and the address of anna comnena to the frankish count might resemble that of a modern lady of fashion in her attempts to engage in conversation the exquisite who sits by her side in an apparently absent fit we have piped unto you said the princess and you have not danced we have sung to you the jovial chorus of evoe evoe and you will neither worship comus nor bacchus are we then to judge you a follower of the muses in whose service as well as in that of phoebus we ourselves pretend to be enlisted fair lady replied the frank be not offended at my stating once for all in plain terms that i am a christian man spitting at and bidding defiance to apollo bacchus comus and all other heathen deities whatsoever o cruel interpretation of my unwary words said the princess i did but mention the gods of music poetry and eloquence worshipped by our divine philosophers and whose names are still used to distinguish the arts and sciences over which they presided and the count interprets it seriously into a breach of the second commandment our lady preserve me we must take care how we speak when our words are so sharply interpreted the count laughed as the princess spoke i had no offensive meaning madam he said nor would i wish to interpret your words otherwise than as being most innocent and praiseworthy i shall suppose that your speech contained all that was fair and blameless you are i have understood one of those who like our worthy host express in composition the history and feats of the warlike time in which you live and give to the posterity which shall succeed us the knowledge of the brave deeds which have been achieved in our day i respect the task to which you have dedicated yourself and know not how a lady could lay after ages under an obligation to her in the same degree unless like my wife brenhilda she were herself to be the actress of deeds which she recorded and by the way she now looks towards her neighbour at the table as if she were about to rise and leave him her inclinations are towards constantinople and with your ladyships permission i cannot allow her to go thither alone that you shall neither of you do said anna comnena since we all go to the capital directly and for the purpose of seeing those wonders of nature of which numerous examples have been collected by the splendour of my imperial father if my husband seems to have given offence to the countess do not suppose that it was intentionally dealt to her on the contrary you will find the good man when you are better acquainted with him to be one of those simple persons who manage so unhappily what they mean for civilties that those to whom they are addressed receive them frequently in another sense the countess of paris however refused again to sit down to the table from which she had risen so that agelastes and his imperial guests saw themselves under the necessity either to permit the strangers to depart which they seemed unwilling to do or to detain them by force to attempt which might not perhaps have been either safe or pleasant or lastly to have waived the etiquette of rank and set out along with them at the same time managing their dignity so as to take the initiatory step though the departure took place upon the motion of their wilful guests much tumult there was bustling disputing and shouting among the troops and officers who were thus moved from their repast two hours at least sooner than had been experienced upon similar occasions in the memory of the oldest among them a different arrangement of the imperial party likewise seemed to take place by mutual consent nicephorus briennius ascended the seat upon the elephant and remained there placed beside his august motherinlaw agelastes on a sober minded palfrey which permitted him to prolong his philosophical harangues at his own pleasure rode beside the countess brenhilda whom he made the principal object of his oratory the fair historian though she usually travelled in a litter preferred upon this occasion a spirited horse which enabled her to keep pace with count robert of paris on whose imagination if not his feelings she seemed to have it in view to work a marked impression the conversation of the empress with her soninlaw requires no special detail it was a tissue of criticisms upon the manners and behaviour of the franks and a hearty wish that they might be soon transported from the realms of greece never more to return such was at least the tone of the empress nor did the caesar find it convenient to express any more tolerant opinion of the strangers on the other hand agelastes made a long circuit ere he ventured to approach the subject which he wished to introduce he spoke of the menagerie of the emperor as a most superb collection of natural history he extolled different persons at court for having encouraged alexius comnenus in this wise and philosophical amusement but finally the praise of all others was abandoned that the philosopher might dwell upon that of nicephorus briennius to whom the cabinet or collection of constantinople was indebted he said for the principal treasures it contained i am glad it is so said the haughty countess without lowering her voice or affecting any change of manner i am glad that he understands some things better worth understanding than whispering with stranger young women credit me if he gives much license to his tongue among such women of nay country as these stirring times may bring hither some one or other of them will fling him into the cataract which dashes below pardon me fair lady said agelastes no female heart could meditate an action so atrocious against so fine a form as that of the caesar nicephorus briennius put it not on that issue father said the offended countess for by my patroness saint our lady of the broken lances had it not been for regard to these two ladies who seemed to intend some respect to my husband and myself that same nicephorus should have been as perfectly a lord of the broken bones as any caesar who has borne the title since the great julius the philosopher upon this explicit information began to entertain some personal fear for himself and hastened by diverting the conversation which he did with great dexterity to the story of hero and leander to put the affront received out of the head of this unscrupulous amazon meantime count robert of paris was engrossed as it may be termed by the fair anna comnena she spoke on all subjects on some better doubtless others worse but on none did she suspect herself of any deficiency while the good count wished heartily within himself that his companion had been safely in bed with the enchanted princess of zulichium she performed right or wrong the part of a panegyrist of the normans until at length the count tired of hearing her prate of she knew not exactly what broke in as follows lady he said notwithstanding i and my followers are sometimes so named yet we are not normans who come hither as a numerous and separate body of pilgrims under the command of their duke robert a valiant though extravagant thoughtless and weak man i say nothing against the fame of these normans they conquered in our fathers days a kingdom far stronger than their own which men call england i see that you entertain some of the natives of which country in your pay under the name of varangians although defeated as i said by the normans they are nevertheless a brave race nor would we think ourselves much dishonoured by mixing in battle with them still we are the valiant franks who had their dwelling on the eastern banks of the rhine and of the saale who were converted to the christian faith by the celebrated clovis and are sufficient by our numbers and courage to reconquer the holy land should all europe besides stand neutral in the contest there are few things more painful to the vanity of a person like the princess than the being detected in an egregious error at the moment she is taking credit to herself for being peculiarly accurately informed a false slave who knew not what he was saying i suppose said the princess imposed upon me the belief that the varangians were the natural enemies of the normans i see him marching there by the side of achilles tatius the leader of his corps call him hither you officers yonder tall man i mean with the battleaxe upon his shoulder hereward distinguished by his post at the head of the squadron was summoned from thence to the presence of the princess where he made his military obeisance with a cast of sternness in his aspect as his glance lighted upon the proud look of the frenchman who rode beside anna comnena did i not understand thee fellow said anna comnena to have informed me nearly a month ago that the normans and the franks were the same people and enemies to the race from which you spring the normans are our mortal enemies lady answered hereward by whom we were driven from our native land the franks are subjects of the same lordparamount with the normans and therefore they neither love the varangians nor are beloved by them good fellow said the french count you do the franks wrong and ascribe to the varangians although not unnaturally an undue degree of importance when you suppose that a race which has ceased to exist as an independent nation for more than a generation can be either an object of interest or resentment to such as we are i am no stranger said the varangian to the pride of your heart or the precedence which you assume over those who have been less fortunate in war than yourselves it is god who casteth down and who buildeth up nor is there in the world a prospect to which the varangians would look forward with more pleasure than that a hundred of their number should meet in a fair field either with the oppressive normans or their modern compatriots the vain frenchmen and let god be the judge which is most worthy of victory you take an insolent advantage of the chance said the count of paris which gives you an unlookedfor opportunity to brave a nobleman it is my sorrow and shame said the varangian that that opportunity is not complete and that there is a chain around me which forbids me to say slay me or ill kill thee before we part from this spot why thou foolish and hotbrained churl replied the count what right hast thou to the honour of dying by my blade thou art mad or hast drained the alecup so deeply that thou knowest not what thou thinkest or sayest thou liest said the varangian though such a reproach be the utmost scandal of thy race the frenchman motioned his hand quicker than light to his sword but instantly withdrew it and said with dignity thou canst not offend me but thou said the exile hast offended me in a matter which can only be atoned by thy manhood where and how answered the count although it is needless to ask the question which thou canst not answer rationally thou hast this day answered the varangian put a mortal affront upon a great prince whom thy master calls his ally and by whom thou hast been received with every rite of hospitality him thou hast affronted as one peasant at a merrymaking would do shame to another and this dishonour thou hast done to him in the very face of his own chiefs and princes and the nobles from every court of europe it was thy masters part to resent my conduct said the frenchman if in reality he so much felt it as an affront but that said hereward did not consist with the manners of his country to do besides that we trusty varangians esteem ourselves bound by our oath as much to defend our emperor while the service lasts on every inch of his honour as on every foot of his territory i therefore tell thee sir knight sir count or whatever thou callest thyself there is mortal quarrel between thee and the varangian guard ever and until thou hast fought it out in fair and manly battle body to body with one of the said imperial varangians when duty and opportunity shall permit and so god schaw the right as this passed in the french language the meaning escaped the understanding of such imperialists as were within hearing at the time and the princess who waited with some astonishment till the crusader and the varangian had finished their conference when it was over said to him with interest i trust you feel that poor mans situation to be too much at a distance from your own to admit of your meeting him in what is termed knightly battle on such a question said the knight i have but one answer to any lady who does not like my brenhilda cover herself with a shield and bear a sword by her side and the heart of a knight in her bosom and suppose for once said the princess anna comnena that i possessed such titles to your confidence what would your answer be to me there can be little reason for concealing it said the count the varangian is a brave man and a strong one it is contrary to my vow to shun his challenge and perhaps i shall derogate from my rank by accepting it but the world is wide and he is yet to be born who has seen robert of paris shun the face of mortal man by means of some gallant officer among the emperors guards this poor fellow who nourishes so strange an ambition shall learn that he shall have his wish gratified and then said anna comnena why then said the count in the poor mans own language god schaw the right which is to say said the princess that if my father has an officer of his guards honourable enough to forward so pious and reasonable a purpose the emperor must lose an ally in whose faith he puts confidence or a most trusty and faithful soldier of his personal guard who has distinguished himself upon many occasions i am happy to hear said the count that the man bears such a character in truth his ambition ought to have some foundation the more i think of it the rather am i of opinion that there is something generous rather than derogatory in giving to the poor exile whose thoughts are so high and noble those privileges of a man of rank which some who were born in such lofty station are too cowardly to avail themselves of yet despond not noble princess the challenge is not yet accepted of and if it was the issue is in the hand of god as for me whose trade is war the sense that i have something so serious to transact with this resolute man will keep me from other less honourable quarrels in which a lack of occupation might be apt to involve me the princess made no farther observation being resolved by private remonstrance to achilles tatius to engage him to prevent a meeting which might be fatal to the one or the other of two brave men the town now darkened before them sparkling at the same time through its obscurity by the many lights which illuminated the houses of the citizens the royal cavalcade held their way to the golden gate where the trusty centurion put his guard under arms to receive them we must now break off fair ladies said the count as the party having now dismounted were standing together at the private gate of the blacquernal palace and find as we can the lodgings which we occupied last night under your favour no said the empress you must be content to take your supper and repose in quarters more fitting your rank and added irene with no worse quartermaster than one of the imperial family who hag been your travelling companion this the count heard with considerable inclination to accept the hospitality which was so readily offered although as devoted as a man could well be to the charms of his brenhilda the very idea never having entered his head of preferring anothers beauty to hers yet nevertheless he had naturally felt himself flattered by the attentions of a woman of eminent beauty and very high rank and the praises with which the princess had loaded him had not entirely fallen to the ground he was no longer in the humour in which the morning had found him disposed to outrage the feelings of the emperor and to insult his dignity but flattered by the adroit sycophancy which the old philosopher had learned from the schools and the beautiful princess had been gifted with by nature he assented to the empresss proposal the more readily perhaps that the darkness did not permit him to see that there was distinctly a shade of displeasure on the brow of brenhilda whatever the cause she cared not to express it and the married pair had just entered that labyrinth of passages through which hereward had formerly wandered when a chamberlain and a female attendant richly dressed bent the knee before them and offered them the means and place to adjust their attire ere they entered the imperial presence brenhilda looked upon her apparel and arms spotted with the blood of the insolent scythian and amazon as she was felt the shame of being carelessly and improperly dressed the arms of the knight were also bloody and in disarrangement tell my female squire agatha to give her attendance said the countess she alone is in the habit of assisting to unarm and to attire me now god be praised thought the grecian lady of the bedchamber that i am not called to a toilet where smiths hammers and tongs are like to be the instruments most in request tell marcian my armourer said the count to attend with the silver and blue suit of plate and mail which i won in a wager from the count of thoulouse footnote raymond count of thoulouse and st giles duke of carboune and marquis of provence an aged warrior who had won high distinction in the contests against the saracens in spain was the chief leader of the crusaders from the south of france his title of st giles is corrupted by anna comnena into sangles by which name she constantly mentions him in the alexiad might i not have the honour of adjusting your armour said a splendidly drest courtier with some marks of the armourers profession since i have put on that of the emperor himself may his name be sacred and how many rivets hast thou clenched upon the occasion with this hand said the count catching hold of it which looks as if it had never been washed save with milk of roses and with this childish toy pointing to a hammer with ivory haft and silver head which stuck into a milkwhite kidskin apron the official wore as badges of his duty the armourer fell back in some confusion his grasp he said to another domestic is like the seizure of a vice while this little scene passed apart the empress irene her daughter and her soninlaw left the company under pretence of making a necessary change in their apparel immediately after agelastes was required to attend the emperor and the strangers were conducted to two adjacent chambers of retirement splendidly fitted up and placed for the present at their disposal and that of their attendants there we shall for a time leave them assuming with the assistance of their own attendants a dress which their ideas regarded as most fit for a great occasion those of the grecian court willingly keeping apart from a task which they held nearly as formidable as assisting at the lair of a royal tiger or his bride agelastes found the emperor sedulously arranging his most splendid courtdress for as in the court of pekin the change of ceremonial attire was a great part of the ritual observed at constantinople thou hast done well wise agelastes said alexius to the philosopher as he approached with abundance of prostrations and genuflexions thou hast done well and we are content with thee less than thy wit and address must have failed in separating from their company this tameless bull and unyoked heifer over whom if we obtain influence we shall command by every account no small interest among those who esteem them the bravest in the host my humble understanding said agelastes had been infinitely inferior to the management of so prudent and sagacious a scheme had it not been shaped forth and suggested by the inimitable wisdom of your most sacred imperial highness we are aware said alexius that we had the merit of blocking forth the scheme of detaining these persons either by their choice as allies or by main force as hostages their friends ere yet they have missed them will be engaged in war with the turks and at no liberty if the devil should suggest such an undertaking to take arms against the sacred empire thus agelastes we shall obtain hostages at least as important and as valuable as that count of vermandois whose liberty the tremendous godfrey of bouillon extorted from us by threats of instant war pardon said agelastes if i add another reason to those which of themselves so heavily support your august resolution it is possible that we may by observing the greatest caution and courtesy towards these strangers win them in good earnest to our side i conceive you i conceive you said the emperor and this very night i will exhibit myself to this count and his lady in the royal presence chamber in the richest robes which our wardrobe can furnish the lions of solomon shall roar the golden tree of comnenus shall display its wonders and the feeble eyes of these franks shall be altogether dazzled by the splendour of the empire these spectacles cannot but sink into their minds and dispose them to become the allies and servants of a nation so much more powerful skilful and wealthy than their own thou hast something to say agelastes years and long study have made thee wise though we have given our opinion thou mayst speak thine own and live thrice three times did agelastes press his brow against the hem of the emperors garment and great seemed his anxiety to find such words as might intimate his dissent from his sovereign yet save him from the informality of contradicting him expressly these sacred words in which your sacred highness has uttered your most just and accurate opinions are undeniable and incapable of contradiction were any vain enough to attempt to impugn them nevertheless be it lawful to say that men show the wisest arguments in vain to those who do not understand reason just as you would in vain exhibit a curious piece of limning to the blind or endeavour to bribe as scripture saith a sow by the offer of a precious stone the fault is not in such case in the accuracy of your sacred reasoning but in the obtuseness and perverseness of the barbarians to whom it is applied speak more plainly said the emperor how often must we tell thee that in cases in which we really want counsel we know we must be contented to sacrifice ceremony then in plain words said agelastes these european barbarians are like no others under the cope of the universe either on the things on which they look with desire or on those which they consider as discouraging the treasures of this noble empire so far as they affected their wishes would merely inspire them with the desire to go to war with a nation possessed of so much wealth and who in their selfconceited estimation were less able to defend than they themselves are powerful to assail of such a description for instance is bohemond of tarentum and such a one is many a crusader less able and sagacious than he for i think i need not tell your imperial divinity that he holds his own selfinterest to be the devoted guide of his whole conduct through this extraordinary war and that therefore you can justly calculate his course when once you are aware from which point of the compass the wind of avarice and selfinterest breathes with respect to him but there are spirits among the franks of a very different nature and who must be acted upon by very different motives if we would make ourselves masters of their actions and the principles by which they are governed if it were lawful to do so i would request your majesty to look at the manner by which an artful juggler of your court achieves his imposition upon the eyes of spectators yet needfully disguises the means by which he attains his object this people i mean the more loftyminded of these crusaders who act up to the pretences of the doctrines which they call chivalry despise the thirst of gold and gold itself unless to hilt their swords or to furnish forth some necessary expenses as alike useless and contemptible the man who can be moved by the thirst of gain they contemn scorn and despise and liken him in the meanness of his objects to the most paltry serf that ever followed the plough or wielded the spade on the other hand if it happens that they actually need gold they are sufficiently unceremonious in taking it where they can most easily find it thus they are neither easily to be bribed by giving them sums of gold nor to be starved into compliance by withholding what chance may render necessary for them in the one case they set no value upon the gift of a little paltry yellow dross in the other they are accustomed to take what they want yellow dross interrupted alexius do they call that noble metal equally respected by roman and barbarian by rich and poor by great and mean by churchmen and laymen which all mankind are fighting for plotting for planning for intriguing for and damning themselves for both soul and body by the opprobrious name of yellow dross they are mad agelastes utterly mad perils and dangers penalties and scourges are the arguments to which men who are above the universal influence which moves all others can possibly be accessible nor are they said agelastes more accessible to fear than they are to selfinterest they are indeed from their boyhood brought up to scorn those passions which influence ordinary minds whether by means of avarice to impel or of fear to hold back so much is this the case that what is enticing to other men must to interest them have the piquant sauce of extreme danger i told for instance to this very hero a legend of a princess of zulichium who lay on an enchanted couch beautiful as an angel awaiting the chosen knight who should by dispelling her enchanted slumbers become master of her person of her kingdom of zulichium and of her countless treasures and would your imperial majesty believe me i could scarce get the gallant to attend to my legend or take any interest in the adventure till i assured him he would have to encounter a winged dragon compared to which the largest of those in the frank romances was but like a mere dragonfly and did this move the gallant said the emperor so much so replied the philosopher that had i not unfortunately by the earnestness of my description awakened the jealousy of his penthesilea of a countess he had forgotten the crusade and all belonging to it to go in quest of zulichium and its slumbering sovereign nay then said the emperor we have in our empire make us sensible of the advantage innumerable taletellers who are not possessed in the slightest degree of that noble scorn of gold which is proper to the franks but shall for a brace of besants lie with the devil and beat him to boot if in that manner we can gain as mariners say the weathergage of the franks discretion said agelastes is in the highest degree necessary simply to lie is no very great matter it is merely a departure from the truth which is little different from missing a mark at archery where the whole horizon one point alone excepted will alike serve the shooters purpose but to move the frank as is desired requires a perfect knowledge of his temper and disposition great caution and presence of mind and the most versatile readiness in changing from one subject to another had i not myself been somewhat alert i might have paid the penalty of a false step in your majestys service by being flung into my own cascade by the virago whom i offended a perfect thalestris said the emperor i shall take care what offence i give her if i might speak and live said agelastes the caesar nicephorus briennius had best adopt the same precaution nicephorus said the emperor must settle that with our daughter i have ever told her that she gives him too much of that history of which a page or two is sufficiently refreshing but by our own self we must swear it agelastes that night after night hearing nothing else would subdue the patience of a saint forget good agelastes that them hast heard me say such a thing more especially remember it not when thou art in presence of our imperial wife and daughter nor were the freedoms taken by the caesar beyond the bounds of an innocent gallantry said agelastes but the countess i must needs say is dangerous she killed this day the scythian toxartis by what seemed a mere fillip on the head hah said the emperor i knew that toxartis and he was like enough to deserve his death being a bold unscrupulous marauder take notes however how it happened the names of witnesses c that if necessary we may exhibit the fact as a deed of aggression on the part of the count and countess of paris to the assembly of the crusaders i trust said agelastes your imperial majesty will not easily resign the golden opportunity of gaining to your standard persons whose character stands so very high in chivalry it would cost you but little to bestow upon them a grecian island worth a hundred of their own paltry lordship of paris and if it were given under the condition of their expelling the infidels or the disaffected who may have obtained the temporary possession it would be so much the more likely to be an acceptable offer i need not say that the whole knowledge wisdom and skill of the poor agelastes is at your imperial majestys disposal the emperor paused for a moment and then said as if on full consideration worthy agelastes i dare trust thee in this difficult and somewhat dangerous matter but i will keep my purpose of exhibiting to them the lions of solomon and the golden tree of our imperial house to that there can be no objection returned the philosopher only remember to exhibit few guards for these franks are like a fiery horse when in temper he may be ridden with a silk thread but when he has taken umbrage or suspicion as they would likely do if they saw many armed men a steel bridle would not restrain him i will be cautious said the emperor in that particular as well as others sound the silver bell agelastes that the officers of our wardrobe may attend one single word while your highness is alone said agelastes will your imperial majesty transfer to me the direction of your menagerie or collection of extraordinary creatures you make me wonder said the emperor taking a signet bearing upon it a lion with the legend vicit leo ex tribu judae this he said will give thee the command of our dens and now be candid for once with thy master for deception is thy nature even with me by what charm wilt thou subdue these untamed savages by the power of falsehood replied agelastes with deep reverence i believe thee an adept in it said the emperor and to which of their foibles wilt thou address it to their love of fame said the philosopher and retreated backwards out of the royal apartment as the officers of the wardrobe entered to complete the investment of the emperor in his imperial habiliments chapter the fourteenth i will converse with ironwitted fools and unrespective boys none are for me that look into me with considerate eyes highreaching buckingham grows circumspect richard iii as they parted from each other the emperor and philosopher had each their own anxious thoughts on the interview which had passed between them thoughts which they expressed in broken sentences and ejaculations though for the better understanding of the degree of estimation in which they held each other we will give them a more regular and intelligible form thus then half muttered half said alexius but so low as to hide his meaning from the officers of the wardrobe who entered to do their office thus then this bookworm this remnant of old heathen philosophy who hardly believes so god save me the truth of the christian creed has toppd his part so well that he forces his emperor to dissemble in his presence beginning by being the buffoon of the court he has wormed himself into all its secrets made himself master of all its intrigues conspired with my own soninlaw against me debauched my guards indeed so woven his web of deceit that my life is safe no longer than he believes me the imperial dolt which i have affected to seem in order to deceive him fortunate that even so can i escape his cautionary anticipation of my displeasure by avoiding to precipitate his measures of violence but were this sudden storm of the crusade fairly passed over the ungrateful caesar the boastful coward achilles tatius and the bosom serpent agelastes shall know whether alexius comnenus has been born their dupe when greek meets greek comes the strife of subtlety as well as the tug of war thus saying he resigned himself to the officers of his wardrobe who proceeded to ornament him as the solemnity required i trust him not said agelastes the meaning of whose gestures and exclamations we in like manner render into a connected meaning i cannot and do not trust him he somewhat overacts his part he has borne himself upon other occasions with the shrewd wit of his family the comneni yet he now trusts to the effect of his trumpery lions upon such a shrewd people as the franks and normans and seems to rely upon me for the character of men with whom he has been engaged in peace and war for many years this can be but to gain my confidence for there were imperfect looks and broken sentences which seemed to say agelastes the emperor knows thee and confides not in thee yet the plot is successful and undiscovered as far as can be judged and were i to attempt to recede now i were lost for ever a little time to carry on this intrigue with the frank when possibly by the assistance of this gallant alexius shall exchange the crown for a cloister or a still narrower abode and then agelastes thou deservest to be blotted from the roll of philosophers if thou canst not push out of the throne the conceited and luxurious caesar and reign in his stead a second marcus antoninus when the wisdom of thy rule long unfelt in a world which has been guided by tyrants and voluptuaries shall soon obliterate recollection of the manner in which thy power was acquired to work then be active and be cautious the time requires it and the prize deserves it while these thoughts passed through his mind he arrayed himself by the assistance of diogenes in a clean suit of that simple apparel in which he always frequented the court a garb as unlike that of a candidate for royalty as it was a contrast to the magnificent robes with which alexius was now investing himself in their separate apartments or dressingrooms the count of paris and his lady put on the best apparel which they had prepared to meet such a chance upon their journey even in france robert was seldom seen in the peaceful cap and sweeping mantle whose high plumes and flowing folds were the garb of knights in times of peace he was now arrayed in a splendid suit of armour all except the head which was bare otherwise than as covered by his curled locks the rest of his person was sheathed in the complete mail of the time richly inlaid with silver which contrasted with the azure in which the steel was damasked his spurs were upon his heels his sword was by his side and his triangular shield was suspended round his neck bearing painted upon it a number of fleuresdelis semees as it is called upon the field being the origin of those lily flowers which after times reduced to three only and which were the terror of europe until they suffered so many reverses in our own time the extreme height of count roberts person adapted him for a garb which had a tendency to make persons of a lower stature appear rather dwarfish and thick when arrayed capapie the features with their selfcollected composure and noble contempt of whatever could have astounded or shaken an ordinary mind formed a wellfitted capital to the excellently proportioned and vigorous frame which they terminated the countess was in more peaceful attire but her robes were short and succinct like those of one who might be called to hasty exercise the upper part of her dress consisted of more than one tunic sitting close to the body while a skirt descending from the girdle and reaching to the ankles embroidered elegantly but richly completed an attire which a lady might have worn in much more modern times her tresses were covered with a light steel headpiece though some of them escaping played round her face and gave relief to those handsome features which might otherwise have seemed too formal if closed entirely within the verge of steel over these undergarments was flung a rich velvet cloak of a deep green colour descending from the head where a species of hood was loosely adjusted over the helmet deeply laced upon its verges and seams and so long as to sweep the ground behind a dagger of rich materials ornamented a girdle of curious goldsmiths work and was the only offensive weapon which notwithstanding her military occupation she bore upon this occasion the toilet as modern times would say of the countess was not nearly so soon ended as that of count robert who occupied his time as husbands of every period are apt to do in little subacid complaints between jest and earnest upon the dilatory nature of ladies and the time which they lose in doffing and donning their garments but when the countess brenhilda came forth in the pride of loveliness from the inner chamber where she had attired herself her husband who was still her lover clasped her to his breast and expressed his privilege by the kiss which he took as of right from a creature so beautiful chiding him for his folly yet almost returning the kiss which she received brenhilda began now to wonder how they were to find their way to the presence of the emperor the query was soon solved for a gentle knock at the door announced agelastes to whom as best acquainted with the frankish manners had been committed by the emperor the charge of introducing the noble strangers a distant sound like that of the roaring of a lion or not unsimilar to a large and deep gong of modern times intimated the commencement of the ceremonial the black slaves upon guard who as hath been observed were in small numbers stood ranged in their state dresses of white and gold bearing in one hand a naked sabre and in the other a torch of white wax which served to guide the count and countess through the passages that led to the interior of the palace and to the most secret hall of audience the door of this sanctum sanctorum was lower than usual a simple stratagem devised by some superstitious officer of the imperial household to compel the loftycrested frank to lower his body as he presented himself in the imperial presence robert when the door flew open and he discovered in the background the emperor seated upon his throne amidst a glare of light which was broken and reflected in ten thousand folds by the jewels with which his vestments were covered stopt short and demanded the meaning of introducing him through so low an arch agelastes pointed to the emperor by way of shifting from himself a question which he could not have answered the mute to apologize for his silence yawned and showed the loss of his tongue holy virgin said the countess what can these unhappy africans have done to have deserved a condemnation which involves so cruel a fate the hour of retribution is perhaps come said the count in a displeased tone while agelastes with such hurry as time and place permitted entered making his prostrations and genuflexions little doubting that the frank must follow him and to do so must lower his body to the emperor the count however in the height of displeasure at the trick which he conceived had been intended him turned himself round and entered the presencechamber with his back purposely turned to the sovereign and did not face alexius until he reached the middle of the apartment when he was joined by the countess who had made her approach in a more seemly manner the emperor who had prepared to acknowledge the counts expected homage in the most gracious manner found himself now even more unpleasantly circumstanced than when this uncompromising frank had usurped the royal throne in the course of the day the officers and nobles who stood around though a very select number were more numerous than usual as the meeting was not held for counsel but merely for state these assumed such an appearance of mingled displeasure and confusion as might best suit with the perplexity of alexius while the wily features of the normanitalian bohemond of tarentum who was also present had a singular mixture of fantastical glee and derision it is the misfortune of the weaker on such occasions or at least the more timid to be obliged to take the petty part of winking hard as if not able to see what they cannot avenge alexius made the signal that the ceremonial of the grand reception should immediately commence instantly the lions of solomon which had been newly furbished raised their heads erected their manes brandished their tails until they excited the imagination of count robert who being already on fire at the circumstances of his reception conceived the bellowing of these automata to be the actual annunciation of immediate assault whether the lions whose forms he beheld were actually lords of the forest whether they were mortals who had suffered transformation whether they were productions of the skill of an artful juggler or profound naturalist the count neither knew nor cared all that he thought of the danger was it was worthy of his courage nor did his heart permit him a moments irresolution he strode to the nearest lion which seemed in the act of springing up and said in a tone loud and formidable as its own how now dog at the same time he struck the figure with his clenched fist and steel gauntlet with so much force that its head burst and the steps and carpet of the throne were covered with wheels springs and other machinery which had been the means of producing its mimic terrors on this display of the real nature of the cause of his anger count robert could not but feel a little ashamed of having given way to passion on such an occasion he was still more confused when bohemond descending from his station near the emperor addressed him in the frank language you have done a gallant deed truly count robert in freeing the court of byzantium from an object of fear which has long been used to frighten peevish children and unruly barbarians enthusiasm has no greater enemy than ridicule why then said count robert blushing deeply at the same time did they exhibit its fantastic terrors to me i am neither child nor barbarian address yourself to the emperor then as an intelligent man answered bohemond say something to him in excuse of your conduct and show that our bravery has not entirely run away with our common sense and hark you also while i have a moments speech of you do you and your wife heedfully follow my example at supper these words were spoken with a significant tone and corresponding look the opinion of bohemond from his long intercourse both in peace and war with the grecian emperor gave him great influence with the other crusaders and count robert yielded to his advice he turned towards the emperor with something liker an obeisance than he had hitherto paid i crave your pardon he said for breaking that gilded piece of pageantry but in sooth the wonders of sorcery and the portents of accomplished and skilful jugglers are so numerous in this country that one does not clearly distinguish what is true from what is false or what is real from what is illusory the emperor notwithstanding the presence of mind for which he was remarkable and the courage in which he was not held by his countrymen to be deficient received this apology somewhat awkwardly perhaps the rueful complaisance with which he accepted the counts apology might be best compared to that of a lady of the present day when an awkward guest has broken a valuable piece of china he muttered something about the machines having been long preserved in the imperial family as being made on the model of those which guarded the throne of the wise king of israel to which the blunt plainspoken count expressed his doubt in reply whether the wisest prince in the world ever condescended to frighten his subjects or guests by the mimic roarings of a wooden lion if said he i too hastily took it for a living creature i have had the worst by damaging my excellent gauntlet in dashing to pieces its timber skull the emperor after a little more had been said chiefly on the same subject proposed that they should pass to the banquetroom marshalled accordingly by the grand sewer of the imperial table and attended by all present excepting the emperor and the immediate members of his family the frankish guests were guided through a labyrinth of apartments each of which was filled with wonders of nature and art calculated to enhance their opinion of the wealth and grandeur which had assembled together so much that was wonderful their passage being necessarily slow and interrupted gave the emperor time to change his dress according to the ritual of his court which did not permit his appearing twice in the same vesture before the same spectators he took the opportunity to summon agelastes into his presence and that their conference might be secret he used in assisting his toilet the agency of some of the mutes destined for the service of the interior the temper of alexius comnenus was considerably moved although it was one of the peculiarities of his situation to be ever under the necessity of disguising the emotions of his mind and of affecting in presence of his subjects a superiority to human passion which he was far from feeling it was therefore with gravity and even reprehension that he asked by whose error it was that the wily bohemond half italian and halfnorman was present at this interview surely if there be one in the crusading army likely to conduct that foolish youth and his wife behind the scenes of the exhibition by which we hoped to impose upon them the count of tarentum as he entitles himself is that person it was that old man said agelastes if i may reply and live michael cantacuzene who deemed that his presence was peculiarly desired but he returns to the camp this very night yes said alexius to inform godfrey and the rest of the crusaders that one of the boldest and most highly esteemed of their number is left with his wife a hostage in our imperial city and to bring back perhaps an alternative of instant war unless they are delivered up if it is your imperial highnesss will to think so said agelastes you can suffer count robert and his wife to return to the camp with the italiannorman what answered the emperor and so lose all the fruits of an enterprise the preparations for which have already cost us so much in actual expense and were our heart made of the same stuff with that of ordinary mortals would have cost us so much more in vexation and anxiety no no issue warning to the crusaders who are still on the hither side that farther rendering of homage is dispensed with and that they repair to the quays on the banks of the bosphorus by peep of light tomorrow let our admiral as he values his head pass every man of them over to the farther side before noon let there be largesses a princely banquet on the farther bank all that may increase their anxiety to pass then agelastes we will trust to ourselves to meet this additional danger either by bribing the venality of bohemond or by bidding defiance to the crusaders their forces are scattered and the chief of them with the leaders themselves are all now or by far the greater part on the east side of the bosphorus and now to the banquet seeing that the change of dress has been made sufficient to answer the statutes of the household since our ancestors chose to make rules for exhibiting us to our subjects as priests exhibit their images at their shrines under grant of life said agelastes it was not done inconsiderately but in order that the emperor ruled ever by the same laws from father to son might ever be regarded as something beyond the common laws of humanity the divine image of a saint therefore rather than a human being we know it good agelastes answered the emperor with a smile and we are also aware that many of our subjects like the worshippers of bel in holy writ treat us so far as an image as to assist us in devouring the revenues of our provinces which are gathered in our name and for our use these things we now only touch lightly the time not suiting them alexius left the secret council accordingly after the order for the passage of the crusaders had been written out and subscribed in due form and in the sacred ink of the imperial chancery meantime the rest of the company had arrived in a hall which like the other apartments in the palace was most tastefully as well as gorgeously fitted up except that a table which presented a princely banquet might have been deemed faulty in this respect that the dishes which were most splendid both in the materials of which they were composed and in the viands which they held were elevated by means of feet so as to be upon a level with female guests as they sat and with men as they lay recumbent at the banquet which it offered around stood a number of black slaves richly attired while the grand sewer michael cantazucene arranged the strangers with his golden wand and conveyed orders to them by signs that all should remain standing around the table until a signal should be given the upper end of the board thus furnished and thus surrounded was hidden by a curtain of muslin and silver which fell from the top of the arch under which the upper part seemed to pass on this curtain the sewer kept a wary eye and when he observed it slightly shake he waved his wand of office and all expected the result as if selfmoved the mystic curtain arose and discovered behind it a throne eight steps higher than the end of the table decorated in the most magnificent manner and having placed before it a small table of ivory inlaid with silver behind which was seated alexius comnenus in a dress entirely different from what he had worn in the course of the day and so much more gorgeous than his former vestments that it seemed not unnatural that his subjects should prostrate themselves before a figure so splendid his wife his daughter and his soninlaw the caesar stood behind him with faces bent to the ground and it was with deep humility that descending from the throne at the emperors command they mingled with the guests of the lower table and exalted as they were proceeded to the festive board at the signal of the grand sewer so that they could not be said to partake of the repast with the emperor nor to be placed at the imperial table although they supped in his presence and were encouraged by his repeated request to them to make good cheer no dishes presented at the lower table were offered at the higher but wines and more delicate sorts of food which arose before the emperor as if by magic and seemed designed for his own proper use were repeatedly sent by his special directions to one or other of the guests whom alexius delighted to honour among these the franks being particularly distinguished the behaviour of bohemond was on this occasion particularly remarkable count robert who kept an eye upon him both from his recent words and owing to an expressive look which he once or twice darted towards him observed that in no liquors or food not even those sent from the emperors own table did this astucious prince choose to indulge a piece of bread taken from the canister at random and a glass of pure water was the only refreshment of which he was pleased to partake his alleged excuse was the veneration due to the holy festival of the advent which chanced to occur that very night and which both the greek and latin rule agree to hold sacred i had not expected this of you sir bohemond said the emperor that you should have refused my personal hospitality at my own board on the very day on which you honoured me by entering into my service as vassal for the principality of antioch antioch is not yet conquered said sir bohemond and conscience dread sovereign must always have its exceptions in whatever temporal contracts we may engage come gentle count said the emperor who obviously regarded bohemonds inhospitable humour as something arising more from suspicion than devotion we invite though it is not our custom our children our noble guests and our principal officers here present to a general carouse fill the cups called the nine muses let them be brimful of the wine which is said to be sacred to the imperial lips at the emperors command the cups were filled they were of pure gold and there was richly engraved upon each the effigy of the muse to whom it was dedicated you at least said the emperor my gentle count robert you and your lovely lady will not have any scruple to pledge your imperial host if that scruple is to imply suspicion of the provisions with which we are here served i disdain to nourish such said count robert if it is a sin which i commit by tasting wine tonight it is a venial one nor shall i greatly augment my load by carrying it with the rest of my trespasses to the next confessional will you then prince bohemond not be ruled by the conduct of your friend said the emperor methinks replied the normanitalian my friend might have done better to have been ruled by mine but be it as his wisdom pleases the flavour of such exquisite wine is sufficient for me so saying he emptied the wine into another goblet and seemed alternately to admire the carving of the cup and the flavour of what it had lately contained you are right sir bohemond said the emperor the fabric of that cup is beautiful it was done by one of the ancient gravers of greece the boasted cup of nestor which homer has handed down to us was a good deal larger perhaps but neither equalled these in the value of the material nor the exquisite beauty of the workmanship let each one therefore of my stranger guests accept of the cup which he either has or might have drunk out of as a recollection of me and may the expedition against the infidels be as propitious as their confidence and courage deserve if i accept your gift mighty emperor said bohemond it is only to atone for the apparent discourtesy when my devotion compels me to decline your imperial pledge and to show you that we part on the most intimate terms of friendship so saying he bowed deeply to the emperor who answered him with a smile into which was thrown a considerable portion of sarcastic expression and i said the count of paris having taken upon my conscience the fault of meeting your imperial pledge may stand excused from incurring the blame of aiding to dismantle your table of these curious drinking cups we empty them to your health and we cannot in any other respect profit by them but prince bohemond can said the emperor to whose quarters they shall be carried sanctioned by your generous use and we have still a set for you and for your lovely countess equal to that of the graces though no longer matching in number the nymphs of parnassus the evening bell rings and calls us to remember the hour of rest that we may be ready to meet the labours of tomorrow the party then broke up for the evening bohemond left the palace that night not forgetting the muses of whom he was not in general a devotee the result was as the wily greek had intended that he had established between bohemond and the count not indeed a quarrel but a kind of difference of opinion bohemond feeling that the fiery count of paris must think his conduct sordid and avaricious while count robert was far less inclined than before to rely on him as a counsellor chapter the fifteenth the count of paris and his lady were that night lodged in the imperial palace of the blacquernal their apartments were contiguous but the communication between them was cut off for the night by the mutual door being locked and barred they marvelled somewhat at this precaution the observance however of the festival of the church was pleaded as an admissible and not unnatural excuse for this extraordinary circumstance neither the count nor his lady entertained it may be believed the slightest personal fear for any thing which could happen to them their attendants marcian and agatha having assisted their master and mistress in the performance of their usual offices left them in order to seek the places of repose assigned to them among persons of their degree the preceding day had been one of excitation and of much bustle and interest perhaps also the wine sacred to the imperial lips of which count robert had taken a single indeed but a deep draught was more potent than the delicate and highflavoured juice of the gascogne grape to which he was accustomed at any rate it seemed to him that from the time he felt that he had slept daylight ought to have been broad in his chamber when he awaked and yet it was still darkness almost palpable somewhat surprised he gazed eagerly around but could discern nothing except two balls of red light which shone from among the darkness with a selfemitted brilliancy like the eyes of a wild animal while it glares upon its prey the count started from bed to put on his armour a necessary precaution if what he saw should really be a wild creature and at liberty but the instant he stirred a deep growl was uttered such as the count had never heard but which might be compared to the sound of a thousand monsters at once and as the symphony was heard the clash of iron chains and the springing of a monstrous creature towards the bedside which appeared however to be withheld by some fastening from attaining the end of its bound the roars which it uttered now ran thick on each other they were most tremendous and must have been heard throughout the whole palace the creature seemed to gather itself many yards nearer to the bed than by its glaring eyeballs it appeared at first to be stationed and how much nearer or what degree of motion might place him within the monsters reach the count was totally uncertain its breathing was even heard and count robert thought he felt the heat of its respiration while his defenceless limbs might not be two yards distant from the fangs which he heard grinding against each other and the claws which tore up fragments of wood from the oaken floor the count of paris was one of the bravest men who lived in a time when bravery was the universal property of all who claimed a drop of noble blood and the knight was a descendant of charlemagne he was however a man and therefore cannot be said to have endured unappalled a sense of danger so unexpected and so extraordinary but his was not a sudden alarm or panic it was a calm sense of extreme peril qualified by a resolution to exert his faculties to the uttermost to save his life if it were possible he withdrew himself within the bed no longer a place of rest being thus a few feet further from the two glaring eyeballs which remained so closely fixed upon him that in spite of his courage nature painfully suggested the bitter imagination of his limbs being mangled torn and churned with their lifeblood in the jaws of some monstrous beast of prey one saving thought alone presented itself this might be a trial an experiment of the philosopher agelastes or of the emperor his master for the purpose of proving the courage of which the christians vaunted so highly and punishing the thoughtless insult which the count had been misadvised enough to put upon the emperor the preceding day well is it said he reflected in his agony beard not the lion in his den perhaps even now some base slave deliberates whether i have yet tasted enough of the preliminary agonies of death and whether he shall yet slip the chain which keeps the savage from doing his work but come death when it will it shall never be said that count robert was heard to receive it with prayers for compassion or with cries of pain or terror he turned his face to the wall and waited with a strong mental exertion the death which he conceived to be fast approaching his first feelings had been unavoidably of a selfish nature the danger was too instant and of a description too horrible to admit of any which involved a more comprehensive view of his calamity and other reflections of a more distant kind were at first swallowed up in the allengrossing thought of immediate death but as his ideas became clearer the safety of his countess rushed upon his mind what might she now be suffering and while he was subjected to a trial so extraordinary for what were her weaker frame and female courage reserved was she still within a few yards of him as when he lay down the last night or had the barbarians who had devised for him a scene so cruel availed themselves of his and his ladys incautious confidence to inflict upon her some villany of the same kind or even yet more perfidious did she sleep or wake or could she sleep within the close hearing of that horrible cry which shook all around he resolved to utter her name warning her if possible to be upon her guard and to answer without venturing rashly into the apartment which contained a guest so horribly perilous he uttered therefore his wifes name but in trembling accents as if he had been afraid of the savage beast overhearing him brenhilda brenhilda there is dangerawake and speak to me but do not arise there was no answer what am i become he said to himself that i call upon brenhilda of aspramonte like a child on its sleeping nurse and all because there is a wildcat in the same room with me shame on thee count of paris let thy arms be rent and thy spurs be hacked from thy heels what ho he cried aloud but still with a tremulous voice brenhilda we are beset the foe are upon us answer me but stir not a deep growl from the monster which garrisoned his apartment was the only answer the sound seemed to say thou hast no hope and it ran to the knights bosom as the genuine expression of despair perhaps however i am still too cold in making my misery known what ho my love brenhilda a voice hollow and disconsolate as that which might have served an inhabitant of the grave answered as if from a distance what disconsolate wretch art thou who expectest that the living can answer thee from the habitations of the dead i am a christian man a free noble of the kingdom of france answered the count yesterday the captain of five hundred men the bravest in france the bravest that is who breathe mortal air and i am here without a glimpse of light to direct me how to avoid the corner in which lies a wild tigercat prompt to spring upon and to devour me thou art an example replied the voice and wilt not long be the last of the changes of fortune i who am now suffering in my third year was that mighty ursel who rivalled alexius comnenus for the crown of greece was betrayed by my confederates and being deprived of that eyesight which is the chief blessing of humanity i inhabit these vaults no distant neighbour of the wild animals by whom they are sometimes occupied and whose cries of joy i hear when unfortunate victims like thyself are delivered up to their fury didst thou not then hear said count robert in return a warlike guest and his bride conducted hither last night with sounds as it might seem of bridal music o brenhilda hast thou so young so beautiful been so treacherously done to death by means so unutterably horrible think not answered ursel as the voice had called its owner that the greeks pamper their wild beasts on such lordly fare for their enemies which term includes not only all that are really such but all those whom they fear or hate they have dungeons whose locks never revolve hot instruments of steel to sear the eyeballs in the head lions and tigers when it pleases them to make a speedy end of their captives but these are only for the male prisoners while for the women if they be young and beautiful the princes of the land have places in their bed and bower nor are they employed like the captives of agamemnons host to draw water from an argive spring but are admired and adored by those whom fate has made the lords of their destiny such shall never be the doom of brenhilda exclaimed count robert her husband still lives to assist her and should he die she knows well how to follow him without leaving a blot in the epitaph of either the captive did not immediately reply and a short pause ensued which was broken by ursels voice stranger he said what noise is that i hear nay i hear nothing said count robert but i do said ursel the cruel deprivation of my eyesight renders my other senses more acute disquiet not thyself about the matter fellowprisoner answered the count but wait the event in silence suddenly a light arose in the apartment lurid red and smoky the knight had bethought him of a flint and match which he usually carried about him and with as little noise as possible had lighted the torch by the bedside this he instantly applied to the curtains of the bed which being of thin muslin were in a moment in flames the knight sprung at the same instant from his bed the tiger for such it was terrified at the flame leaped backwards as far as his chain would permit heedless of any thing save this new object of terror count robert upon this seized on a massive wooden stool which was the only offensive weapon on which he could lay his hand and marking at those eyes which now reflected the blaze of fire and which had recently seemed so appalling he discharged against them this fragment of ponderous oak with a force which less resembled human strength than the impetus with which an engine hurls a stone he had employed his instant of time so well and his aim was so true that the missile went right to the mark and with incredible force the skull of the tiger which might be perhaps somewhat exaggerated if described as being of the very largest size was fractured by the blow and with the assistance of his dagger which had fortunately been left with him the french count despatched the monster and had the satisfaction to see him grin his last and roll in the agony of death those eyes which were lately so formidable looking around him he discovered by the light of the fire which he had raised that the apartment in which he now lay was different from that in which he had gone to bed overnight nor could there be a stronger contrast between the furniture of both than the flickering halfburnt remains of the thin muslin curtains and the strong bare dungeonlooking walls of the room itself or the very serviceable wooden stool of which he had made such good use the knight had no leisure to form conclusions upon such a subject he hastily extinguished the fire which had indeed nothing that it could lay hold of and proceeded by the light of the flambeau to examine the apartment and its means of entrance it is scarce necessary to say that he saw no communication with the room of brenhilda which convinced him that they had been separated the evening before under pretence of devotional scruples in order to accomplish some most villanous design upon one or both of them his own part of the nights adventure we have already seen and success so far over so formidable a danger gave him a trembling hope that brenhilda by her own worth and valour would be able to defend herself against all attacks of fraud or force until he could find his way to her rescue i should have paid more regard he said to bohemonds caution last night who i think intimated to me as plainly as if he had spoke it in direct terms that that same cup of wine was a drugged potion but then fie upon him for an avaricious hound how was it possible i should think he suspected any such thing when he spoke not out like a man but for sheer coldness of heart or base selfinterest suffered me to run the risk of being poisoned by the wily despot here he heard a voice from the same quarter as before ho there ho stranger do you live or have you been murdered what means this stifling smell of smoke for gods sake answer him who can receive no information from eyes closed alas for ever i am at liberty said the count and the monster destined to devour me has groaned its last i would my friend ursel since such is thy name thou hadst the advantage of thine eyes to have borne witness to yonder combat it had been worth thy while though thou shouldst have lost them a minute afterwards and it would have greatly advantaged whoever shall have the task of compiling my history while he gave a thought to that vanity which strongly ruled him he lost no time in seeking some mode of escape from the dungeon for by that means only might he hope to recover his countess at last he found an entrance in the wall but it was strongly locked and bolted i have found the passage he called out and its direction is the same in which thy voice is heard but how shall i undo the door ill teach thee that secret said ursel i would i could as easily unlock each bolt that withholds us from the open air but as for thy seclusion within the dungeon heave up the door by main strength and thou shalt lift the locks to a place where pushing then the door from thee the fastenings will find a grooved passage in the wall and the door itself will open would that i could indeed see thee not only because being a gallant man thou must be a goodly sight but also because i should thereby know that i was not caverned in darkness for ever while he spoke thus the count made a bundle of his armour from which he missed nothing except his sword tranchefer and then proceeded to try what efforts he could make according to the blind mans instructions to open the door of his prisonhouse pushing in a direct line was he soon found attended with no effect but when he applied his gigantic strength and raised the door as high as it would go he had the satisfaction to find that the bolts yielded though reluctantly a space had been cut so as to allow them to move out of the socket into which they had been forced and without the turn of a key but by a powerful thrust forwards a small passage was left open the knight entered bearing his armour in his hand i hear thee said ursel o stranger and am aware thou art come into my place of captivity for three years have i been employed in cutting these grooves corresponding to the sockets which hold these iron bolts and preserving the knowledge of the secret from the prisonkeepers twenty such bolts perhaps must be sawn through ere my steps shall approach the upper air what prospect is there that i shall have strength of mind sufficient to continue the task yet credit me noble stranger i rejoice in having been thus far aiding to thy deliverance for if heaven blesses not in any farther degree our aspirations after freedom we may still be a comfort to each other while tyranny permits our mutual life count robert looked around and shuddered that a human being should talk of any thing approaching to comfort connected with his residence in what seemed a living tomb ursels dungeon was not above twelve feet square vaulted in the roof and strongly built in the walls by stones which the chisel had morticed closely together a bed a coarse footstool like that which robert had just launched at the head of the tiger and a table of equally massive materials were its only articles of furniture on a long stone above the bed were these few but terrible words zedekias ursel imprisoned here on the ides of march ad died and interred on the spot a blank was left for filling up the period the figure of the captive could hardly be discerned amid the wildness of his dress and dishabille the hair of his head uncut and uncombed descended in elflocks and mingled with a beard of extravagant length look on me said the captive and rejoice that thou canst yet see the wretched condition to which ironhearted tyranny can reduce a fellowcreature both in mortal existence and in future hope was it thou said count robert whose blood ran cold in his veins that hadst the heart to spend thy time in sawing through the blocks of stone by which these bolts are secured alas said ursel what could a blind man do busy i must be if i would preserve my senses great as the labour was it was to me the task of three years nor can you wonder that i should have devoted to it my whole time when i had no other means of occupying it perhaps and most likely my dungeon does not admit the distinction of day and night but a distant cathedral clock told me how hour after hour fled away and found me expending them in rubbing one stone against another but when the door gave way i found i had only cut an access into a prison more strong than that which held me i rejoice nevertheless since it has brought us together given thee an entrance to my dungeon and me a companion in my misery think better than that said count robert think of liberty think of revenge i cannot believe such unjust treachery will end successfully else needs must i say the heavens are less just than priests tell us of how art thou supplied with food in this dungeon of thine a warder said ursel and who i think understands not the greek language at least he never either answers or addresses me brings a loaf and a pitcher of water enough to supply my miserable life till two days are past i must therefore pray that you will retire for a space into the next prison so that the warder may have no means of knowing that we can hold correspondence together i see not said count robert by what access the barbarian if he is one can enter my dungeon without passing through yours but no matter i will retire into the inner or outer room whichever it happens to be and be thou then well aware that the warder will have some one to grapple with ere he leaves his prisonwork today meanwhile think thyself dumb as thou art blind and be assured that the offer of freedom itself would not induce me to desert the cause of a companion in adversity alas said the old man i listen to thy promises as i should to those of the morning gale which tells me that the sun is about to rise although i know that i at least shall never behold it thou art one of those wild and undespairing knights whom for so many years the west of europe hath sent forth to attempt impossibilities and from thee therefore i can only hope for such a fabric of relief as an idle boy would blow out of soap bubbles think better of us old man said count robert retiring at least let me die with my blood warm and believing it possible for me to be once more united to my beloved brenhilda so saying he retired into his own cell and replaced the door so that the operations of ursel which indeed were only such as three years solitude could have achieved should escape observation when again visited by the warder it is ill luck said he when once more within his own prison for that in which the tiger had been secured he instinctively concluded to be destined for him it is ill luck that i had not found a young and able fellowcaptive instead of one decrepit by imprisonment blind and broken down past exertion but gods will be done i will not leave behind me the poor wretch whom i have found in such a condition though he is perfectly unable to assist me in accomplishing my escape and is rather more likely to retard it meantime before we put out the torch let us see if by close examination we can discover any door in the wall save that to the blind mans dungeon if not i much suspect that my descent has been made through the roof that cup of wine that muse as they called it had a taste more like medicine than merry companions pledge he began accordingly a strict survey of the walls which he resolved to conclude by extinguishing the torch that he might take the person who should enter his dungeon darkling and by surprise for a similar reason he dragged into the darkest corner the carcass of the tiger and covered it with the remains of the bedclothes swearing at the same time that a half tiger should be his crest in future if he had the fortune which his bold heart would not suffer him to doubt of getting through the present danger but he added if these necromantic vassals of hell shall raise the devil upon me what shall i do then and so great is the chance that methinks i would fain dispense with extinguishing the flambeau yet it is childish for one dubbed in the chapel of our lady of the broken lances to make much difference between a light room and a dark one let them come as many fiends as the cell can hold and we shall see if we receive them not as becomes a christian knight and surely our lady to whom i was ever a true votary will hold it an acceptable sacrifice that i tore myself from my brenhilda even for a single moment in honour of her advent and thus led the way for our woful separation fiends i defy ye in the body as in the spirit and i retain the remains of this flambeau until some more convenient opportunity he dashed it against the wall as he spoke and then quietly sat down in a corner to watch what should next happen thought after thought chased each other through his mind his confidence in his wifes fidelity and his trust in her uncommon strength and activity were the greatest comforts which he had nor could her danger present itself to him in any shape so terrible but that he found consolation in these reflections she is pure he said as the dew of heaven and heaven will not abandon its own chapter the sixteenth strange ape of man who loathes thee while he scorns thee half a reproach to us and half a jest what fancies can be ours ere we have pleasure in viewing our own form our pride and passions reflected in a shape grotesque as thine anonymous count robert of paris having ensconced himself behind the ruins of the bed so that he could not well be observed unless a strong light was at once flung upon the place of his retreat waited with anxiety how and in what manner the warder of the dungeon charged with the task of bringing food to the prisoners should make himself visible nor was it long ere symptoms of his approach began to be heard and observed a light was partially seen as from a trapdoor opening in the roof and a voice was heard to utter these words in anglosaxon leap sirrah come no delay leap my good sylvan show your honours activity a strange chuckling hoarse voice in a language totally unintelligible to count robert was heard to respond as if disputing the orders which were received what sir said his companion you must contest the point must you nay if thou art so lazy i must give your honour a ladder and perhaps a kick to hasten your journey something then of very great size in the form of a human being jumped down from the trapdoor though the height might be above fourteen feet this figure was gigantic being upwards of seven feet high in its left hand it held a torch and in its right a skein of fine silk which unwinding itself as it descended remained unbroken though it was easy to conceive it could not have afforded a creature so large any support in his descent from the roof he alighted with perfect safety and activity upon his feet and as if rebounding from the floor he sprung upwards again so as almost to touch the roof in this last gambaud the torch which he bore was extinguished but this extraordinary warder whirled it round his head with infinite velocity so that it again ignited the bearer who appeared to intend the accomplishment of this object endeavoured to satisfy himself that it was really attained by approaching as if cautiously its left hand to the flame of the torch this practical experiment seemed attended with consequences which the creature had not expected for it howled with pain shaking the burnt hand and chattering as if bemoaning itself take heed there sylvanus said the same voice in anglosaxon and in a tone of rebuke ho there mind thy duty sylvan carry food to the blind man and stand not there to play thyself lest i trust thee not again alone on such an errand the creature for it would have been rash to have termed it a man turning its eye upwards to the place from whence the voice came answered with a dreadful grin and shaking of its fist yet presently began to undo a parcel and rummage in the pockets of a sort of jerkin and pantaloons which it wore seeking it appeared a bunch of keys which at length it produced while it took from the pocket a loaf of bread heating the stone of the wall it affixed the torch to it by a piece of wax and then cautiously looked out for the entrance to the old mans dungeon which it opened with a key selected from the bunch within the passage it seemed to look for and discover the handle of a pump at which it filled a pitcher that it bore and bringing back the fragments of the former loaf and remains of the pitcher of water it ate a little as if it were in sport and very soon making a frightful grimace flung the fragments away the count of paris in the meanwhile watched anxiously the proceedings of this unknown animal his first thought was that the creature whose limbs were so much larger than humanity whose grimaces were so frightful and whose activity seemed supernatural could be no other than the devil himself or some of his imps whose situation and office in those gloomy regions seemed by no means hard to conjecture the human voice however which he had heard was less that of a necromancer conjuring a fiend than that of a person giving commands to a wild animal over whom he had by training obtained a great superiority a shame on it said the count if i suffer a common jackanapes for such i take this devilseeming beast to be although twice as large as any of its fellows whom i have ever seen to throw an obstacle in the way of my obtaining daylight and freedom let us but watch and the chance is that we make that furry gentleman our guide to the upper regions meantime the creature which rummaged about everywhere at length discovered the body of the tiger touched it stirred it with many strange motions and seemed to lament and wonder at its death at once it seemed struck with the idea that some one must have slain it and count robert had the mortification to see it once more select the key and spring towards the door of ursels prison with such alacrity that had its intention been to strangle him it would have accomplished its purpose before the interference of count robert could have prevented its revenge taking place apparently however it reflected that for reasons which seemed satisfactory the death of the tiger could not be caused by the unfortunate ursel but had been accomplished by some one concealed within the outer prison slowly grumbling therefore and chattering to itself and peeping anxiously into every corner the tremendous creature so like yet so very unlike to the human form came stealing along the walls moving whatever he thought could seclude a man from his observation its extended legs and arms were protruded forward with great strides and its sharp eyes on the watch to discover the object of its search kept prying with the assistance of the torch into every corner considering the vicinity of alexiuss collection of animals the reader by this time can have little doubt that the creature in question whose appearance seemed to the count of paris so very problematical was a specimen of that gigantic species of ape if it is not indeed some animal more nearly allied to ourselves to which i believe naturalists have given the name of the ourang outang this creature differs from the rest of its fraternity in being comparatively more docile and serviceable and though possessing the power of imitation which is common to the whole race yet making use of it less in mere mockery than in the desire of improvement and instruction perfectly unknown to his brethren the aptitude which it possesses of acquiring information is surprisingly great and probably if placed in a favourable situation it might admit of being domesticated in a considerable degree but such advantages the ardour of scientific curiosity has never afforded this creature the last we have heard of was seen we believe in the island of sumatra it was of great size and strength and upwards of seven feet high it died defending desperately its innocent life against a party of europeans who we cannot help thinking might have better employed the superiority which their knowledge gave them over the poor native of the forest it was probably this creature seldom seen but when once seen never forgotten which occasioned the ancient belief in the god pan with his sylvans and satyrs nay but for the gift of speech which we cannot suppose any of the family to have attained we should have believed the satyr seen by st anthony in the desert to have belonged to this tribe we can therefore the more easily credit the annals which attest that the collection of natural history belonging to alexius comnenus preserved an animal of this kind which had been domesticated and reclaimed to a surprising extent and showed a degree of intelligence never perhaps to be attained in any other case these explanations being premised we return to the thread of our story the animal advanced with long noiseless steps its shadow on the wall when it held the torch so as to make it visible to the frank forming another fiendresembling mimicry of its own large figure and extravagantlooking members count robert remained in his lurking hole in no hurry to begin a strife of which it was impossible to foretell the end in the meantime the man of the woods came nigh and every step by which he approached caused the counts heart to vibrate almost audibly at the idea of meeting danger of a nature so strange and new at length the creature approached the bed his hideous eyes were fixed on those of the count and as much surprised at seeing him as robert was at the meeting he skipped about fifteen paces backwards at one spring with a cry of instinctive terror and then advanced on tiptoe holding his torch as far forward as he could between him and the object of his fears as if to examine him at the safest possible distance count robert caught up a fragment of the bedstead large enough to form a sort of club with which he menaced the native of the wilds apparently this poor creatures education like education of most kinds had not been acquired without blows of which the recollection was as fresh as that of the lessons which they enforced sir robert of paris was a man at once to discover and to avail himself of the advantage obtained by finding that he possessed a degree of ascendancy over his enemy which he had not suspected he erected his warlike figure assumed a step as if triumphant in the lists and advanced threatening his enemy with his club as he would have menaced his antagonist with the redoutable tranchefer the man of the woods on the other hand obviously gave way and converted his cautious advance into a retreat no less cautious yet apparently the creature had not renounced some plan of resistance he chattered in an angry and hostile tone held out his torch in opposition and seemed about to strike the crusader with it count robert however determined to take his opponent at advantage while his fears influenced him and for this purpose resolved if possible to deprive him of his natural superiority in strength and agility which his singular form showed he could not but possess over the human species a master of his weapon therefore the count menaced his savage antagonist with a stroke on the right side of his head but suddenly averting the blow struck him with his whole force on the left temple and in an instant was kneeling above him when drawing his dagger he was about to deprive him of life the ourang outang ignorant of the nature of this new weapon with which he was threatened attempted at one and the same moment to rise from the ground overthrow his antagonist and wrench the dagger from his grasp in the first attempt he would probably have succeeded and as it was he gained his knees and seemed likely to prevail in the struggle when he became sensible that the knight drawing his poniard sharply through his grasp had cut his paw severely and seeing him aim the trenchant weapon at his throat became probably aware that his enemy had his life at command he suffered himself to be borne backwards without further resistance with a deep wailing and melancholy cry having in it something human which excited compassion he covered his eyes with the unwounded hand as if he would have hid from his own sight the death which seemed approaching him count robert notwithstanding his military frenzy was in ordinary matters a calmtempered and mild man and particularly benevolent to the lower classes of creation the thought rushed through his mind why take from this unfortunate monster the breath which is in its nostrils after which it cannot know another existence and then may it not be some prince or knight changed to this grotesque shape that it may help to guard these vaults and the wonderful adventures that attach to them should i not then be guilty of a crime by slaying him when he has rendered himself rescue or no rescue which he has done as completely as his transformed figure permits and if he be actually a bestial creature may he not have some touch of gratitude i have heard the minstrels sing the lay of androcles and the lion i will be on my guard with him so saying he rose from above the man of the woods and permitted him also to arise the creature seemed sensible of the clemency for he muttered in a low and supplicating tone which seemed at once to crave for mercy and to return thanks for what he had already experienced he wept too as he saw the blood dropping from his wound and with an anxious countenance which had more of the human now that it was composed into an expression of pain and melancholy seemed to await in terror the doom of a being more powerful than himself the pocket which the knight wore under his armour capable of containing but few things had however some vulnerary balsam for which its owner had often occasion a little lint and a small roll of linen these the knight took out and motioned to the animal to hold forth his wounded hand the man of the woods obeyed with hesitation and reluctance and count robert applied the balsam and the dressings acquainting his patient at the same time in a severe tone of voice that perhaps he did wrong in putting to his use a balsam compounded for the service of the noblest knights but that if he saw the least sign of his making an ungrateful use of the benefit he had conferred he would bury the dagger of which he had felt the efficacy to the very handle in his body the sylvan looked fixedly upon count robert almost as if he understood the language used to him and making one of its native murmurs it stooped to the earth kissed the feet of the knight and embracing his knees seemed to swear to him eternal gratitude and fidelity accordingly when the count retired to the bed and assumed his armour to await the reopening of the trapdoor the animal sat down by his side directing its eyes in the line with his and seemed quietly to wait till the door should open after waiting about an hour a slight noise was heard in the upper chamber and the wild man plucked the frank by the cloak as if to call his attention to what was about to happen the same voice which had before spoken was after a whistle or two heard to call sylvan sylvan where loiterest thou come instantly or by the rood thou shalt abye thy sloth the poor monster as trinculo might have called him seemed perfectly aware of the meaning of this threat and showed his sense of it by pressing close to the side of count robert making at the same time a kind of whining entreating it would seem the knights protection forgetting the great improbability there was even in his own opinion that the creature could understand him count robert said why my friend thou hast already learned the principal court prayer of this country by which men entreat permission to speak and live fear nothing poor creature i am thy protector sylvan what ho said the voice again whom hast thou got for a companion some of the fiends or ghosts of murdered men who they say are frequent in these dungeons or dost thou converse with the old blind rebel grecian or finally is it true what men say of thee that thou canst talk intelligibly when thou wilt and only gibberest and chatterest for fear thou art sent to work come thou lazy rascal thou shalt have the advantage of the ladder to ascend by though thou needest it no more than a daw to ascend the steeple of the cathedral of st sophia footnote now the chief mosque of the ottoman capital come along then he said putting a ladder down the trapdoor and put me not to the trouble of descending to fetch thee else by st swithin it shall be the worse for thee come along therefore like a good fellow and for once i shall spare the whip the animal apparently was moved by this rhetoric for with a doleful look which count robert saw by means of the nearly extinguished torch he seemed to bid him farewell and to creep away towards the ladder with the same excellent goodwill wherewith a condemned criminal performs the like evolution but no sooner did the count look angry and shake the formidable dagger than the intelligent animal seemed at once to take his resolution and clenching his hands firmly together in the fashion of one who has made up his mind he returned from the ladders foot and drew up behind count robert with the air however of a deserter who feels himself but little at home when called into the field against his ancient commander in a short time the warders patience was exhausted and despairing of the sylvans voluntary return he resolved to descend in quest of him down the ladder he came a bundle of keys in one hand the other assisting his descent and a sort of dark lantern whose bottom was so fashioned that he could wear it upon his head like a hat he had scarce stept on the floor when he was surrounded by the nervous arms of the count of paris at first the warders idea was that he was seized by the recusant sylvan how now villain he said let me go or thou shalt die the death thou diest thyself said the count who between the surprise and his own skill in wrestling felt fully his advantage in the struggle treason treason cried the warder hearing by the voice that a stranger had mingled in the contest help ho above there help hereward varangian anglosaxon or whatever accursed name thou callest thyself while he spoke thus the irresistible grasp of count robert seized his throat and choked his utterance they fell heavily the jailor undermost upon the floor of the dungeon and robert of paris the necessity of whose case excused the action plunged his dagger in the throat of the unfortunate just as he did so a noise of armour was heard and rattling down the ladder our acquaintance hereward stood on the floor of the dungeon the light which had rolled from the head of the warder continued to show him streaming with blood and in the deathgrasp of a stranger hereward hesitated not to fly to his assistance and seizing upon the count of paris at the same advantage which that knight had gained over his own adversary a moment before held him forcibly down with his face to the earth count robert was one of the strongest men of that military age but then so was the varangian and save that the latter had obtained a decided advantage by having his antagonist beneath him it could not certainly have been conjectured which way the combat was to go yield as your own jargon goes rescue or no rescue said the varangian or die on the point of my dagger a french count never yields answered robert who began to conjecture with what sort of person he was engaged above all to a vagabond slave like thee with this he made an effort to rise so sudden so strong so powerful that he had almost freed himself from the varangians grasp had not hereward by a violent exertion of his great strength preserved the advantage he had gained and raised his poniard to end the strife for ever but a loud chuckling laugh of an unearthly sound was at this instant heard the varangians extended arm was seized with vigour while a rough arm embracing his throat turned him over on his back and gave the french count an opportunity of springing up death to thee wretch said the varangian scarce knowing whom he threatened but the man of the woods apparently had an awful recollection of the prowess of human beings he fled therefore swiftly up the ladder and left hereward and his deliverer to fight it out with what success chance might determine between them the circumstances seemed to argue a desperate combat both were tall strong and courageous both had defensive armour and the fatal and desperate poniard was their only offensive weapon they paused facing each other and examined eagerly into their respective means of defence before hazarding a blow which if it missed its attaint would certainly be fatally requited during this deadly pause a gleam shone from the trapdoor above as the wild and alarmed visage of the man of the woods was seen peering down by the light of a newly kindled torch which he held as low into the dungeon as he well could fight bravely comrade said count robert of paris for we no longer battle in private this respectable person having chosen to constitute himself judge of the field hazardous as his situation was the varangian looked up and was so struck with the wild and terrified expression which the creature had assumed and the strife between curiosity and terror which its grotesque features exhibited that he could not help bursting into a fit of laughter sylvan is among those said hereward who would rather hold the candle to a dance so formidable than join in it himself is there then said count robert any absolute necessity that thou and i perform this dance at all none but our own pleasure answered hereward for i suspect there is not between us any legitimate cause of quarrel demanding to be fought out in such a place and before such a spectator thou art if i mistake not the bold frank who was yesternight imprisoned in this place with a tiger chained within no distant spring of his bed i am answered the count and where is the animal who was opposed to thee he lies yonder answered the count never again to be the object of more terror than the deer whom he may have preyed on in his day he pointed to the body of the tiger which hereward examined by the light of the dark lantern already mentioned and this then was thy handiwork said the wondering anglosaxon sooth to say it was answered the count with indifference and thou hast slain my comrade of this strange watch said the varangian mortally wounded him at the least said count robert with your patience i will be beholden to you for a moments truce while i examine his wound said hereward assuredly answered the count blighted be the arm which strikes a foul blow at an open antagonist without demanding further security the varangian quitted his posture of defence and precaution and set himself by the assistance of the dark lantern to examine the wound of the first warder who appeared on the field who seemed by his roman military dress to be a soldier of the bands called immortals pie found him in the deathagony but still able to speak so varangian thou art come at last and is it to thy sloth or treachery that i am to impute my fate nay answer me not the stranger struck me over the collarbone had we lived long together or met often i had done the like by thee to wipe out the memory of certain transactions at the golden gate i know the use of the knife too well to doubt the effect of a blow aimed over the collarbone by so strong a hand i feel it coming the immortal so called becomes now if priests say true an immortal indeed and sebastes of mytilenes bow is broken ere his quiver is half emptied the robber greek sunk back in herewards arms and closed his life with a groan which was the last sound he uttered the varangian laid the body at length on the dungeon floor this is a perplexed matter he said i am certainly not called upon to put to death a brave man although my national enemy because he hath killed a miscreant who was privately meditating my own murder neither is this a place or a light by which to fight as becomes the champions of two nations let that quarrel be still for the present how say you then noble sir if we adjourn the present dispute till we effect your deliverance from the dungeons of the blacquernal and your restoration to your own friends and followers if a poor varangian should be of service to you in this matter would you when it was settled refuse to meet him in fair fight with your national weapons or his own if said count robert whether friend or enemy thou wilt extend thy assistance to my wife who is also imprisoned somewhere in this inhospitable palace be assured that whatever be thy rank whatever be thy country whatever be thy condition robert of paris will at thy choice proffer thee his right hand in friendship or raise it against thee in fair and manly battle a strife not of hatred but of honour and esteem and this i vow by the soul of charlemagne my ancestor and by the shrine of my patroness our lady of the broken lances enough said replied hereward i am as much bound to the assistance of your lady countess being a poor exile as if i were the first in the ranks of chivalry for if any thing can make the cause of worth and bravery yet more obligatory it must be its being united with that of a helpless and suffering female i ought said count robert to be here silent without loading thy generosity with farther requests yet thou art a man whom if fortune has not smiled at thy birth by ordaining thee to be born within the ranks of noblesse and knighthood yet providence hath done thee more justice by giving thee a more gallant heart than is always possessed i fear by those who are inwoven in the gayest wreath of chivalry there lingers here in these dungeons for i cannot say he lives a blind old man to whom for three years every thing beyond his prison has been a universal blot his food is bread and water his intercourse limited to the conversation of a sullen warder and if death can ever come as a deliverer it must be to this dark old man what sayst thou shall he so unutterably miserable not profit by perhaps the only opportunity of freedom that may ever occur to him by st dunstan answered the varangian thou keepest over truly the oath thou hast taken as a redresser of wrongs thine own case is well nigh desperate and thou art willing to make it utterly so by uniting with it that of every unhappy person whom fate throws in thy way the more of human misery we attempt to relieve said robert of paris the more we shall carry with us the blessing of our merciful saints and our lady of the broken lances who views with so much pain every species of human suffering or misfortune save that which occurs within the enclosure of the lists but come valiant anglosaxon resolve me on my request as speedily as thou canst there is something in thy face of candour as well as sense and it is with no small confidence that i desire to see us set forth in quest of my beloved countess who when her deliverance is once achieved will be a powerful aid to us in recovering that of others so be it then said the varangian we will proceed in quest of the countess brenhilda and if on recovering her we find ourselves strong enough to procure the freedom of the dark old man my cowardice or want of compassion shall never stop the attempt chapter the seventeenth tis strange that in the dark sulphureous mine where wild ambition piles its ripening stores of slumbering thunder love will interpose his tiny torch and cause the stern explosion to burst when the devisers least aware anonymous about noon of the same day agelastes met with achilles tatius the commander of the varangian guard in those ruins of the egyptian temple in which we formerly mentioned hereward having had an interview with the philosopher they met as it seemed in a very different humour tatius was gloomy melancholy and downcast while the philosopher maintained the calm indifference which procured for him and in some sort deserved the title of the elephant thou blenchest achilles tatius said the philosopher now that thou hast frankly opposed thyself to all the dangers which stood between thee and greatness thou art like the idle boy who turned the millstream upon the machine and that done instead of making a proper use of it was terrified at seeing it in motion thou dost me wrong agelastes answered the acolyte foul wrong i am but like the mariner who although determined upon his voyage yet cannot forbear a sorrowing glance at the shore before he parts with it it may be for ever it may have been right to think of this but pardon me valiant tatius when i tell you the account should have been made up before and the grandson of alguric the hun ought to have computed chances and consequences ere he stretched his hand to his masters diadem hush for heavens sake said tatius looking round that thou knowest is a secret between our two selves for if nicephorus the caesar should learn it where were we and our conspiracy our bodies on the gibbet probably answered agelastes and our souls divorced from them and in the way of discovering the secrets which thou hast hitherto taken upon trust well said achilles and should not the consciousness of the possibility of this fate render us cautious cautious men if you will answered agelastes but not timid children stone walls can hear said the follower lowering his voice dionysius the tyrant i have read had an ear which conveyed to him the secrets spoken within his stateprison at syracuse and that ear is still stationary at syracuse said the philosopher tell me my most simple friend art thou afraid it has been transported hither in one night as the latins believe of our ladys house of loretto no answered achilles but in an affair so important too much caution cannot be used well thou most cautious of candidates for empire and most cold of military leaders know that the caesar deeming i think that there is no chance of the empire falling to any one but himself hath taken in his head to consider his succession to alexius as a matter of course whenever the election takes place in consequence as matters of course are usually matters of indifference he has left all thoughts of securing his interest upon this material occasion to thee and to me while the foolish voluptuary hath himself run mad for what think you something between man and woman female in her lineaments her limbs and a part at least of her garments but so help me st george most masculine in the rest of her attire in her propensities and in her exercises the amazonian wife thou meanest said achilles of that ironhanded frank who dashed to pieces last night the golden lion of solomon with a blow of his fist by st george the least which can come of such an amour is broken bones that said agelastes is not quite so improbable as that dionysiuss ear should fly hither from syracuse in a single night but he is presumptuous in respect of the influence which his supposed good looks have gained him among the grecian dames he was too presumptuous i suppose said achilles tatius to make a proper allowance for his situation as caesar and the prospect of his being emperor meantime said agelastes i have promised him an interview with his bradamante who may perhaps reward his tender epithets of zoe kai psyche footnote life and soul by divorcing his amorous soul from his unrivalled person meantime said the follower thou obtainest i conclude such orders and warrants as the caesar can give for the furtherance of our plot assuredly said agelastes it is an opportunity not to be lost this love fit or mad fit has blinded him and without exciting too much attention to the progress of the plot we can thus in safety conduct matters our own way without causing malevolent remarks and though i am conscious that in doing so i act somewhat at variance with my age and character yet the end being to convert a worthy follower into an imperial leader i shame me not in procuring that interview with the lady of which the caesar as they term him is so desirous what progress meanwhile hast thou made with the varangians who are in respect of execution the very arm of our design scarce so good as i could wish said achilles tatius yet i have made sure of some two or three score of those whom i found most accessible nor have i any doubt that when the caesar is set aside their cry will be for achilles tatius and what of the gallant who assisted at our prelections said agelastes your edward as alexius termed him i have made no impression upon him said the follower and i am sorry for it for he is one whom his comrades think well of and would gladly follow meantime i have placed him as an additional sentinel upon the ironwitted count of paris whom both having an inveterate love of battle he is very likely to put to death and if it is afterwards challenged by the crusaders as a cause of war it is only delivering up the varangian whose personal hatred will needs be represented as having occasioned the catastrophe all this being prepared beforehand how and when shall we deal with the emperor for that said agelastes we must consult the caesar who although his expected happiness of today is not more certain than the state preferment that he expects tomorrow and although his ideas are much more anxiously fixed upon his success with this said countess than his succession to the empire will nevertheless expect to be treated as the head of the enterprise for accelerating the latter but to speak my opinion valiant tatius tomorrow will be the last day that alexius shall hold the reins of empire let me know for certain said the follower as soon as thou canst that i may warn our brethren who are to have in readiness the insurgent citizens and those of the immortals who are combined with us in the neighbourhood of the court and in readiness to act and above all that i may disperse upon distant guards such varangians as i cannot trust rely upon me said agelastes for the most accurate information and instructions so soon as i have seen nicephorus briennius one word permit me to ask in what manner is the wife of the caesar to be disposed of somewhere said the follower where i can never be compelled to hear more of her history were it not for that nightly pest of her lectures i could be goodnatured enough to take care of her destiny myself and teach her the difference betwixt a real emperor and this briennius who thinks so much of himself so saying they separated the follower elated in look and manner considerably above what he had been when they met agelastes looked after his companion with a scornful laugh there he said goes a fool whose lack of sense prevents his eyes from being dazzled by the torch which cannot fail to consume them a halfbred halfacting halfthinking halfdaring caitiff whose poorest thoughts and those which deserve that name must be poor indeed are not the produce of his own understanding he expects to circumvent the fiery haughty and proud nicephorus briennius if he does so it will not be by his own policy and still less by his valour nor shall anna comnena the soul of wit and genius be chained to such an unimaginative log as yonder halfbarbarian no she shall have a husband of pure grecian extraction and well stored with that learning which was studied when rome was great and greece illustrious nor will it be the least charm of the imperial throne that it is partaken by a partner whose personal studies have taught her to esteem and value those of the emperor he took a step or two with conscious elevation and then as consciencechecked he added in a suppressed voice but then if anna were destined for empress it follows of course that alexius must die no consent could be trusted and what then the death of an ordinary man is indifferent when it plants on the throne a philosopher and a historian and at what time were possessors of the empire curious to enquire when or by whose agency their predecessors died diogenes ho diogenes the slave did not immediately come so that agelastes wrapt in the anticipation of his greatness had time to add a few more words tush i must reckon with heaven say the priests for many things so i will throw this also into the account the death of the emperor may be twenty ways achieved without my having the blame of it the blood which we have shed may spot our hand if closely regarded but it shall scarce stain our forehead diogenes here entered has the frank lady been removed said the philosopher the slave signified his assent how did she bear her removal as authorised by your lordship indifferently well she had resented her separation from her husband and her being detained in the palace and committed some violence upon the slaves of the household several of whom were said to be slain although we perhaps ought only to read sorely frightened she recognised me at once and when i told her that i came to offer her a days retirement in your own lodgings until it should be in your power to achieve the liberation of her husband she at once consented and i deposited her in the secret cytherean garden house admirably done my faithful diogenes said the philosopher thou art like the genii who attended on the eastern talisman i have but to intimate my will to thee and it is accomplished diogenes bowed deeply and withdrew yet remember slave said agelastes speaking to himself there is danger in knowing too much and should my character ever become questioned too many of my secrets are in the power of diogenes at this moment a blow thrice repeated and struck upon one of the images without which had been so framed as to return a tingling sound and in so far deserved the praise of being vocal interrupted his soliloquy there knocks said he one of our allies who can it be that comes so late he touched the figure of iris with his staff and the caesar nicephorus briennius entered in the full grecian habit and that graceful dress anxiously arranged to the best advantage let me hope my lord said agelastes receiving the caesar with an apparently grave and reserved face your highness comes to tell me that your sentiments are changed on reflection and that whatever you had to confer about with this frankish lady may be at least deferred until the principal part of our conspiracy has been successfully executed philosopher answered the caesar no my resolution once taken is not the sport of circumstances believe me that i have not finished so many labours without being ready to undertake others the favour of venus is the reward of the labours of mars nor would i think it worth while to worship the god armipotent with the toil and risk attending his service unless i had previously attained some decided proofs that i was wreathed with the myrtle intimating the favour of his beautiful mistress i beg pardon for my boldness said agelastes but has your imperial highness reflected that you were wagering with the wildest rashness an empire including thine own life mine and all who are joined with us in a hardy scheme and against what were they waged against the very precarious favour of a woman who is altogether divided betwixt fiend and female and in either capacity is most likely to be fatal to our present scheme either by her good will or by the offence which she may take if she prove such as you wish she will desire to keep her lover by her side and to spare him the danger of engaging in a perilous conspiracy and if she remains as the world believe her constant to her husband and to the sentiments she vowed to him at the altar you may guess what cause of offence you are likely to give by urging a suit which she has already received so very ill pshaw old man thou turnest a dotard and in the great knowledge thou possessest of other things hast forgotten the knowledge best worth knowing that of the beautiful part of the creation think of the impression likely to be made by a gallant neither ignoble in situation nor unacceptable in presence upon a lady who must fear the consequences of refusal come agelastes let me have no more of thy croaking auguring bad fortune like the raven from the blasted oak on the left hand but declaim as well thou canst how faint heart never won fair lady and how those best deserve empire who can wreathe the myrtles of venus with the laurels of mars come man undo me the secret entrance which combines these magical ruins with groves that are fashioned rather like those of cytheros or naxos it must be as you will said the philosopher with a deep and somewhat affected sigh here diogenes called aloud the caesar when thou art summoned mischief is not far distant come undo the secret entrance mischief my trusty negro is not so distant but she will answer the first clatter of the stones the negro looked at his master who returned him a glance acquiescing in the caesars proposal diogenes then went to a part of the ruined wall which was covered by some climbing shrubs all of which he carefully removed this showed a little postern door closed irregularly and filled up from the threshold to the top with large square stones all of which the slave took out and piled aside as if for the purpose of replacing them i leave thee said agelastes to the negro to guard this door and let no one enter except he has the sign upon the peril of thy life it were dangerous it should be left open at this period of the day the obsequious diogenes put his hand to his sabre and to his head as if to signify the usual promise of fidelity or death by which those in his condition generally expressed their answer to their masters commands diogenes then lighted a small lantern and pulling out a key opened an inner door of wood and prepared to step forward hold friend diogenes said the caesar thou wantest not my lantern to discern an honest man whom if thou didst seek i must needs say thou hast come to the wrong place to find one nail thou up these creeping shrubs before the entrance of the place and abide thou there as already directed till our return to parry the curiosity of any who may be attracted by the sight of the private passage the black slave drew back as he gave the lamp to the caesar and agelastes followed the light through a long but narrow arched passage well supplied with air from space to space and not neglected in the inside to the degree which its exterior would have implied i will not enter with you into the gardens said agelastes or to the bower of cytherea where i am too old to be a worshipper thou thyself i think imperial caesar art well aware of the road having travelled it divers times and if i mistake not for the fairest reasons the more thanks said the caesar are due to mine excellent friend agelastes who forgets his own age to accommodate the youth of his friends chapter the eighteenth we must now return to the dungeon of the blacquernal where circumstances had formed at least a temporary union between the stout varangian and count robert of paris who had a stronger resemblance to each other in their dispositions than probably either of them would have been willing to admit the virtues of the varangian were all of that natural and unrefined kind which nature herself dictates to a gallant man to whom a total want of fear and the most prompt alacrity to meet danger had been attributes of a lifelong standing the count on the other hand had all that bravery generosity and love of adventure which was possessed by the rude soldier with the virtues partly real partly fantastic which those of his rank and country acquired from the spirit of chivalry the one might be compared to the diamond as it came from the mine before it had yet received the advantages of cutting and setting the other was the ornamented gem which cut into facets and richly set had lost perhaps a little of its original substance yet still at the same time to the eye of an inspector had something more showy and splendid than when it was according to the phrase of lapidaries en brut in the one case the value was more artificial in the other it was the more natural and real of the two chance therefore had made a temporary alliance between two men the foundation of whose characters bore such strong resemblance to each other that they were only separated by a course of education which had left rigid prejudices on both sides and which prejudices were not unlikely to run counter to each other the varangian commenced his conversation with the count in a tone of familiarity approaching nearer to rudeness than the speaker was aware of and much of which though most innocently intended by hereward might be taken amiss by his new brother in arms the most offensive part of his deportment however was a blunt bold disregard to the title of those whom he addressed adhering thereby to the manners of the saxons from whom he drew his descent and which was likely to be at least unpleasing to the franks as well as normans who had already received and become very tenacious of the privileges of the feudal system the mummery of heraldry and the warlike claims assumed by knights as belonging only to their own order hereward was apt it must be owned to think too little of these distinctions while he had at least a sufficient tendency to think enough of the power and wealth of the greek empire which he served of the dignity inherent in alexius comnenus and which he was also disposed to grant to the grecian officers who under the emperor commanded his own corps and particularly to achilles tatius this man hereward knew to be a coward and halfsuspected to be a villain still however the follower was always the direct channel through which the imperial graces were conferred on the varangians in general as well as upon hereward himself and he had always the policy to represent such favours as being more or less indirectly the consequence of his own intercession he was supposed vigorously to espouse the quarrel of the varangians in all the disputes between them and the other corps he was liberal and openhanded gave every soldier his due and bating the trifling circumstance of valour which was not particularly his forte it would have been difficult for these strangers to have demanded a leader more to their wishes besides this our friend hereward was admitted by him into his society attended him as we have seen upon secret expeditions and shared therefore deeply in what may be termed by an expressive though vulgar phrase the sneaking kindness entertained for this new achilles by the greater part of his myrmidons their attachment might be explained perhaps as a liking to their commander as strong as could well exist with a marvellous lack of honour and esteem the scheme therefore formed by hereward to effect the deliverance of the count of paris comprehended as much faith to the emperor and his representative the acolyte or follower as was consistent with rendering justice to the injured frank in furtherance of this plan he conducted count robert from the subterranean vaults of the blacquernal of the intricacies of which he was master having been repeatedly of late stationed sentinel there for the purpose of acquiring that knowledge of which tatius promised himself the advantage in the ensuing conspiracy when they were in the open air and at some distance from the gloomy towers of the palace he bluntly asked the count of paris whether he knew agelastes the philosopher the other answered in the negative look you now sir knight you hurt yourself in attempting to impose upon me said hereward you must know him for i saw you dined with him yesterday o with that learned old man said the count i know nothing of him worth owning or disguising to thee or any one a wily person he is half herald and half minstrel half procurer and whole knave subjoined the varangian with the mask of apparent goodhumour he conceals his pandering to the vices of others with the specious jargon of philosophy he has argued himself out of religious belief and moral principle and with the appearance of the most devoted loyalty he will if he is not checked in time either argue his too confiding master out of life and empire or if he fails in this reason his simple associates into death and misery and do you know all this said count robert and permit this man to go unimpeached o content you sir replied the varangian i cannot yet form any plot which agelastes may not countermine but the time will come nay it is already approaching when the emperors attention shall be irresistibly turned to the conduct of this man and then let the philosopher sit fast or by st dunstan the barbarian overthrows him i would only fain methinks save from his clutches a foolish friend who has listed to his delusions but what have i to do said the count with this man or with his plots much said hereward although you know it not the main supporter of this plot is no other than the caesar who ought to be the most faithful of men but ever since alexius has named a sebastocrator an officer that is higher in rank and nearer to the throne than the caesar himself so long has nicephorus briennius been displeased and dissatisfied though for what length of time he has joined the schemes of the astucious agelastes it is more difficult to say this i know that for many months he has fed liberally as his riches enable him to do the vices and prodigality of the caesar he has encouraged him to show disrespect to his wife although the emperors daughter has put illwill between him and the royal family and if briennius bears no longer the fame of a rational man and the renown of a good leader he is deprived of both by following the advice of this artful sycophant and what is all this to me said the frank agelastes may be a true man or a timeserving slave his master alexius comnenus is not so much allied to me or mine that i should meddle in the intrigues of his court you may be mistaken in that said the blunt varangian if these intrigues involve the happiness and virtue death of a thousand martyrs said the frank doth paltry intrigues and quarrels of slaves involve a single thought of suspicion of the noble countess of paris the oaths of thy whole generation were ineffectual to prove but that one of her hairs had changed its colour to silver well imagined gallant knight said the anglosaxon thou art a husband fitted for the atmosphere of constantinople which calls for little vigilance and a strong belief thou wilt find many followers and fellows in this court of ours hark thee friend replied the frank let us have no more words nor walk farther together than just to the most solitary nook of this bewildered city and let us there set to that work which we left even now unfinished if thou wert a duke sir count replied the varangian thou couldst not invite to a combat one who is more ready for it yet consider the odds on which we fight if i fall my moan is soon made but will my death set thy wife at liberty if she is under restraint or restore her honour if it is tarnished will it do any thing more than remove from the world the only person who is willing to give thee aid at his own risk and danger and who hopes to unite thee to thy wife and replace thee at the head of thy forces i was wrong said the count of paris i was entirely wrong but beware my good friend how thou couplest the name of brenhilda of aspramonte with the word of dishonour and tell me instead of this irritating discourse whither go we now to the cytherean gardens of agelastes from which we are not far distant said the anglosaxon yet he hath a nearer way to it than that by which we now travel else i should be at a loss to account for the short space in which he could exchange the charms of his garden for the gloomy ruins of the temple of isis and the imperial palace of the blacquernal and wherefore and how long said count robert dost thou conclude that my countess is detained in these gardens ever since yesterday replied hereward when both i and several of my companions at my request kept close watch upon the caesar and your lady we did plainly perceive passages of fiery admiration on his part and anger as it seemed on hers which agelastes being nicephoruss friend was likely as usual to bring to an end by a separation of you both from the army of the crusaders that your wife like many a matron before might have the pleasure of taking up her residence in the gardens of that worthy sage while you my lord might take up your own permanently in the castle of blacquernal villain why didst thou not apprize me of this yesterday a likely thing said hereward that i should feel myself at liberty to leave the ranks and make such a communication to a man whom far from a friend i then considered in the light of a personal enemy methinks that instead of such language as this you should be thankful that so many chance circumstances have at length brought me to befriend and assist you count robert felt the truth of what was said though at the same time his fiery temper longed to avenge itself according to its wont upon the party which was nearest at hand but now they arrived at what the citizens of constantinople called the philosophers gardens here hereward hoped to obtain entrance for he had gained a knowledge of some part at least of the private signals of achilles and agelastes since he had been introduced to the last at the ruins of the temple of isis they had not indeed admitted him to their entire secret yet confident in his connexion with the follower they had no hesitation in communicating to him snatches of knowledge such as committed to a man of shrewd natural sense like the anglo saxon could scarce fail in time and by degrees to make him master of the whole count robert and his companion stood before an arched door the only opening in a high wall and the anglosaxon was about to knock when as if the idea had suddenly struck him what if the wretch diogenes opens the gate we must kill him ere he can fly back and betray us well it is a matter of necessity and the villain has deserved his death by a hundred horrid crimes kill him then thyself retorted count robert he is nearer thy degree and assuredly i will not defile the name of charlemagne with the blood of a black slave nay godamercy answered the anglosaxon but you must bestir yourself in the action supposing there come rescue and that i be overborne by odds such odds said the knight will render the action more like a melee or general battle and assure yourself i will not be slack when i may with my honour be active i doubt it not said the varangian but the distinction seems a strange one that before permitting a man to defend himself or annoy his enemy requires him to demand the pedigree of his ancestor fear you not sir said count robert the strict rule of chivalry indeed bears what i tell thee but when the question is fight or not there is great allowance to be made for a decision in the affirmative let me give then the exorcisers rap replied hereward and see what fiend will appear so saying he knocked in a particular manner and the door opened inwards a dwarfish negress stood in the gap her white hair contrasted singularly with her dark complexion and with the broad laughing look peculiar to those slaves she had something in her physiognomy which severely construed might argue malice and a delight in human misery is agelastes said the varangian but he had not completed the sentence when she answered him by pointing down a shadowed walk the anglosaxon and frank turned in that direction when the hag rather muttered than said distinctly you are one of the initiated varangian take heed whom you take with you when you may hardly peradventure be welcomed even going alone hereward made a sign that he understood her and they were instantly out of her sight the path winded beautifully through the shades of an eastern garden where clumps of flowers and labyrinths of flowering shrubs and the tall boughs of the forest trees rendered even the breath of noon cool and acceptable here we must use our utmost caution said hereward speaking in a low tone of voice for here it is most likely the deer that we seek has found its refuge better allow me to pass before since you are too deeply agitated to possess the coolness necessary for a scout keep concealed beneath yon oak and let no vain scruples of honour deter you from creeping beneath the underwood or beneath the earth itself if you should hear a footfall if the lovers have agreed agelastes it is probable walks his round to prevent intrusion death and furies it cannot be exclaimed the fiery frank lady of the broken lances take thy votarys life ere thou torment him with this agony he saw however the necessity of keeping a strong force upon himself and permitted without further remonstrance the varangian to pursue his way looking however earnestly after him by advancing forward a little he could observe hereward draw near to a pavilion which arose at no great distance from the place where they had parted here he observed him apply first his eye and then his ear to one of the casements which were in a great measure grown over and excluded from the light by various flowering shrubs he almost thought he saw a grave interest take place in the countenance of the varangian and he longed to have his share of the information which he had doubtless obtained he crept therefore with noiseless steps through the same labyrinth of foliage which had covered the approaches of hereward and so silent were his movements that he touched the anglosaxon in order to make him aware of his presence before he observed his approach hereward not aware at first by whom he was approached turned on the intruder with a countenance like a burning coal seeing however that it was the frank he shrugged his shoulders as if pitying the impatience which could not be kept under prudent restraint and drawing himself back allowed the count the privilege of a peeping place through plinths of the casement which could not be discerned by the sharpest eye from the inner side the sombre character of the light which penetrated into this abode of pleasure was suited to that species of thought to which a temple of cytherea was supposed to be dedicated portraits and groups of statuary were also to be seen in the taste of those which they had beheld at the kiosk of the waterfall yet something more free in the ideas which they conveyed than were to be found at their first restingplace shortly after the door of the pavilion opened and the countess entered followed by her attendant agatha the lady threw herself on a couch as she came in while her attendant who was a young and very handsome woman kept herself modestly in the background so much so as hardly to be distinguished what dost thou think said the countess of so suspicious a friend as agelastes so gallant an enemy as the caesar as he is called what should i think returned the damsel except that what the old man calls friendship is hatred and what the caesar terms a patriotic love for his country which will not permit him to set its enemies at liberty is in fact too strong an affection for his fair captive for such an affection said the countess he shall have the same requital as if it were indeed the hostility of which he would give it the colour my true and noble lord hadst thou an idea of the calamities to which they have subjected me how soon wouldst thou break through every restraint to hasten to my relief art thou a man said count robert to his companion and canst thou advise me to remain still and hear this i am one man said the anglosaxon you sir are another but all our arithmetic will not make us more than two and in this place it is probable that a whistle from the caesar or a scream from agelastes would bring a thousand to match us if we were as bold as bevis of hampton stand still and keep quiet i counsel this less as respecting my own life which by embarking upon a wildgoose chase with so strange a partner i have shown i put at little value than for thy safety and that of the lady thy countess who shows herself as virtuous as beautiful i was imposed on at first said the lady brenhilda to her attendant affectation of severe morals of deep learning and of rigid rectitude assumed by this wicked old man made me believe in part the character which he pretended but the gloss is rubbed off since he let me see into his alliance with the unworthy caesar and the ugly picture remains in its native loathsomeness nevertheless if i can by address or subtlety deceive this archdeceiver as he has taken from me in a great measure every other kind of assistance i will not refuse that of craft which he may find perhaps equal to his own hear you that said the varangian to the count of paris do not let your impatience mar the web of your ladys prudence i will weigh a womans wit against a mans valour where there is aught to do let us not come in with our assistance until time shall show us that it is necessary for her safety and our success amen said the count of paris but hope not sir saxon that thy prudence shall persuade me to leave this garden without taking full vengeance on that unworthy caesar and the pretended philosopher if indeed he turns out to have assumed a character the count was here beginning to raise his voice when the saxon without ceremony placed his hand on his mouth thou takest a liberty said count robert lowering however his tones ay truly said hereward when the house is on fire i do not stop to ask whether the water which i pour on it be perfumed or no this recalled the frank to a sense of his situation and if not contented with the saxons mode of making an apology he was at least silenced a distant noise was now heard the countess listened and changed colour agatha she said we are like champions in the lists and here comes the adversary let us retreat into this side apartment and so for a while put off an encounter thus alarming so saying the two females withdrew into a sort of anteroom which opened from the principal apartment behind the seat which brenhilda had occupied they had scarcely disappeared when as the stage direction has it enter from the other side the caesar and agelastes they had perhaps heard the last words of brenhilda for the caesar repeated in a low tone militat omnis amans habet et sua castra cupido what has our fair opponent withdrawn her forces no matter it shows she thinks of the warfare though the enemy be not in sight well thou shalt not have to upbraid me this time agelastes with precipitating my amours and depriving myself of the pleasure of pursuit by heavens i will be as regular in my progress as if in reality i bore on my shoulders the whole load of years which make the difference between us for i shrewdly suspect that with thee old man it is that envious churl time that hath plucked the wings of cupid say not so mighty caesar said the old man it is the hand of prudence which depriving cupids wing of some wild feathers leaves him still enough to fly with an equal and steady flight thy flight however was less measured agelastes when thou didst collect that armoury that magazine of cupids panoply out of which thy kindness permitted me but now to arm myself or rather to repair my accoutrements so saying he glanced his eye over his own person blazing with gems and adorned with a chain of gold bracelets rings and other ornaments which with a new and splendid habit assumed since his arrival at these cytherean gardens tended to set off his very handsome figure i am glad said agelastes if you have found among toys which i now never wear and seldom made use of even when life was young with me anything which may set off your natural advantages remember only this slight condition that such of these trifles as have made part of your wearing apparel on this distinguished day cannot return to a meaner owner but must of necessity remain the property of that greatness of which they had once formed the ornament i cannot consent to this my worthy friend said the caesar i know thou valuest these jewels only in so far as a philosopher may value them that is for nothing save the remembrances which attach to them this large sealring for instance was i have heard you say the property of socrates if so you cannot view it save with devout thankfulness that your own philosophy has never been tried with the exercise of a xantippe these clasps released in older times the lovely bosom of phryne and they now belong to one who could do better homage to the beauties they concealed or discovered than could the cynic diogenes these buckles too i will spare thy ingenuity good youth said agelastes somewhat nettled or rather noble caesar keep thy wit thou wilt have ample occasion for it fear not me said the caesar let us proceed since you will to exercise the gifts which we possess such as they are either natural or bequeathed to us by our dear and respected friend hah he said the door opening suddenly and the countess almost meeting him our wishes are here anticipated he bowed accordingly with the deepest deference to the lady brenhilda who having made some alterations to enhance the splendour of her attire now moved forward from the withdrawingroom into which she had retreated hail noble lady said the caesar whom i have visited with the intention of apologizing for detaining you in some degree against your will in those strange regions in which yon unexpectedly find yourself not in some degree answered the lady but entirely contrary to my inclinations which are to be with my husband the count of paris and the followers who have taken the cross under his banner such doubtless were your thoughts when you left the land of the west said agelastes but fair countess have they experienced no change you have left a shore streaming with human blood when the slightest provocation occurred and thou hast come to one whose principal maxim is to increase the sum of human happiness by every mode which can be invented in the west yonder he or she is respected most who can best exercise their tyrannical strength in making others miserable while in these more placid realms we reserve our garlands for the ingenious youth or lovely lady who can best make happy the person whose affection is fixed upon her but reverend philosopher said the countess who labourest so artificially in recommending the yoke of pleasure know that you contradict every notion which i have been taught from my infancy in the land where my nurture lay so far are we from acknowledging your doctrines that we match not except like the lion and the lioness when the male has compelled the female to acknowledge his superior worth and valour such is our rule that a damsel even of mean degree would think herself heinously undermatched if wedded to a gallant whose fame in arms was yet unknown but noble lady said the caesar a dying man may then find room for some faint hope were there but a chance that distinction in arms could gain those affections which have been stolen rather than fairly conferred how many are there who would willingly enter into the competition where the prize is so fair what is the enterprise too bold to be undertaken on such a condition and where is the individual whose heart would not feel that in baring his sword for the prize he made vow never to return it to the scabbard without the proud boast what i have not yet won i have deserved you see lady said agelastes who apprehending that the last speech of the caesar had made some impression hastened to follow it up with a suitable observation you see that the fire of chivalry burns as gallantly in the bosom of the grecians as in that of the western nations yes answered brenhilda and i have heard of the celebrated siege of troy on which occasion a dastardly coward carried off the wife of a brave man shunned every proffer of encounter with the husband whom he had wronged and finally caused the death of his numerous brothers the destruction of his native city with all the wealth which it contained and died himself the death of a pitiful poltroon lamented only by his worthless leman to show how well the rules of chivalry were understood by your predecessors lady you mistake said the caesar the offences of paris were those of a dissolute asiatic the courage which avenged them was that of the greek empire you are learned sir said the lady but think not that i will trust your words until you produce before me a grecian knight gallant enough to look upon the armed crest of my husband without quaking that methinks were not extremely difficult returned the caesar if they have not flattered me i have myself been thought equal in battle to more dangerous men than him who has been strangely mated with the lady brenhilda that is soon tried answered the countess you will hardly i think deny that my husband separated from me by some unworthy trick is still at thy command and could be produced at thy pleasure i will ask no armour for him save what he wears no weapon but his good sword tranchefer then place him in this chamber or any other lists equally narrow and if he flinch or cry craven or remain dead under shield let brenhilda be the prize of the conqueror merciful heaven she concluded as she sunk back upon her seat forgive me for the crime of even imagining such a termination which is equal almost to doubting thine unerring judgment let me however said the caesar catch up these precious words before they fall to the ground let me hope that he to whom the heavens shall give power and strength to conquer this highlyesteemed count of paris shall succeed him in the affections of brenhilda and believe me the sun plunges not through the sky to his restingplace with the same celerity that i shall hasten to the encounter now by heaven said count robert in an anxious whisper to hereward it is too much to expect me to stand by and hear a contemptible greek who durst not stand even the rattling farewell which tranchefer takes of his scabbard brave me in my absence and affect to make love to my lady par amours and she too methinks brenhilda allows more license than she is wont to do to yonder chattering popinjay by the rood i will spring into the apartment front them with my personal appearance and confute yonder braggart in a manner he is like to remember under favour said the varangian who was the only auditor of this violent speech you shall be ruled by calm reason while i am with you when we are separated let the devil of knighterrantry which has such possession of thee take thee upon his shoulders and carry thee full tilt wheresoever he lists thou art a brute said the count looking at him with a contempt corresponding to the expression he made use of not only without humanity but without the sense of natural honour or natural shame the most despicable of animals stands not by tamely and sees another assail his mate the bull offers his horns to a rival the mastiff uses his jaws and even the timid stag becomes furious and gores because they are beasts said the varangian and their mistresses also creatures without shame or reason who are not aware of the sanctity of a choice but thou too count canst thou not see the obvious purpose of this poor lady forsaken by all the world to keep her faith towards thee by eluding the snares with which wicked men have beset her by the souls of my fathers my heart is so much moved by her ingenuity mingled as i see it is with the most perfect candour and faith that i myself in fault of a better champion would willingly raise the axe in her behalf i thank thee my good friend said the count i thank thee as heartily as if it were possible thou shouldst be left to do that good office for brenhilda the beloved of many a noble lord the mistress of many a powerful vassal and what is more much more than thanks i crave thy pardon for the wrong i did thee but now my pardon you cannot need said the varangian for i take no offence that is not seriously meant stay they speak again it is strange it should be so said the caesar as he paced the apartment but methinks nay i am almost certain agelastes that i hear voices in the vicinity of this apartment of thy privacy it is impossible said agelastes but i will go and see perceiving him to leave the pavilion the varangian made the frank sensible that they must crouch down among a little thicket of evergreens where they lay completely obscured the philosopher made his rounds with a heavy step but a watchful eye and the two listeners were obliged to observe the strictest silence without motion of any kind until he had completed an ineffectual search and returned into the pavilion by my faith brave man said the count ere we return to our skulkingplace i must tell thee in thine ear that never in my life was temptation so strong upon me as that which prompted me to beat out that old hypocrites brains provided i could have reconciled it with my honour and heartily do i wish that thou whose honour no way withheld thee had experienced and given way to some impulse of a similar nature such fancies have passed through my head said the varangian but i will not follow them till they are consistent both with our own safety and more particularly with that of the countess i thank thee again for thy goodwill to her said count robert and by heaven if fight we must at length as it seems likely i will neither grudge thee an honourable antagonist nor fair quarter if the combat goes against thee thou hast my thanks was the reply of hereward only for heavens sake be silent in this conjecture and do what thou wilt afterwards before the varangian and the count had again resumed their posture of listeners the parties within the pavilion conceiving themselves unwatched had resumed their conversation speaking low yet with considerable animation it is in vain you would persuade me said the countess that you know not where my husband is or that you have not the most absolute influence over his captivity who else could have an interest in banishing or putting to death the husband but he that affects to admire the wife you do me wrong beautiful lady answered the caesar and forget that i can in no shape be termed the movingspring of this empire that my fatherinlaw alexius is the emperor and that the woman who terms herself my wife is jealous as a fiend can be of my slightest motionwhat possibility was there that i should work the captivity of your husband and your own the open affront which the count of paris put upon the emperor was one which he was likely to avenge either by secret guile or by open force me it no way touched save as the humble vassal of thy charms and it was by the wisdom and the art of the sage agelastes that i was able to extricate thee from the gulf in which thou hadst else certainly perished nay weep not lady for as yet we know not the fate of count robert but credit me it is wisdom to choose a better protector and consider him as no more a better than him said brenhilda i can never have were i to choose out of the knighthood of all the world this hand said the caesar drawing himself into a martial attitude should decide that question were the man of whom thou thinkest so much yet moving on the face of this earth and at liberty thou art said brenhilda looking fixedly at him with the fire of indignation flashing from every feature thou art but it avails not telling thee what is thy real name believe me the world shall one day ring with it and be justly sensible of its value observe what i am about to say robert of paris is gone or captive i know not where he cannot fight the match of which thou seemest so desirous but here stands brenhilda born heiress of aspramonte by marriage the wedded wife of the good count of paris she was never matched in the lists by mortal man except the valiant count and since thou art so grieved that thou canst not meet her husband in battle thou canst not surely object if she is willing to meet thee in his stead how madam said the caesar astonished do you propose yourself to hold the lists against me against you said the countess against all the grecian empire if they shall affirm that robert of paris is justly used and lawfully confined and are the conditions said the caesar the same as if count robert himself held the lists the vanquished must then be at the pleasure of the conqueror for good or evil it would seem so said the countess nor do i refuse the hazard only that if the other champion shall bite the dust the noble count robert shall be set at liberty and permitted to depart with all suitable honours this i refuse not said the caesar provided it is in my power a deep growling sound like that of a modern gong here interrupted the conference chapter the nineteenth the varangian and count robert at every risk of discovery had remained so near as fully to conjecture though they could not expressly overhear the purport of the conversation he has accepted her challenge said the count of paris and with apparent willingness said hereward o doubtless doubtless answered the crusader but he knows not the skill in war which a woman may attain for my part god knows i have enough depending upon the issue of this contest yet such is my confidence that i would to god i had more i vow to our lady of the broken lances that i desire every furrow of land i possess every honour which i can call my own from the countship of paris down to the leather that binds my spur were dependent and at issue upon this fair field between your caesar as men term him and brenhilda of aspramonte it is a noble confidence said the varangian nor durst i say it is a rash one only i cannot but remember that the caesar is a strong man as well as a handsome expert in the use of arms and above all less strictly bound than you esteem yourself by the rules of honour there are many ways in which advantage may be given and taken which will not in the caesars estimation alter the character of the field from an equal one although it might do so in the opinion of the chivalrous count of paris or even in that of the poor varangian but first let me conduct you to some place of safety for your escape must be soon if it is not already detected the sounds which we heard intimate that some of his confederate plotters have visited the garden on other than love affairs i will guide thee to another avenue than that by which we entered but you would hardly i suppose be pleased to adopt the wisest alternative and what may that be said the count to give thy purse though it were thine all to some poor ferryman to waft thee over the hellespont then hasten to carry thy complaint to godfrey of bouillon and what friends thou mayst have among thy brethren crusaders and determine as thou easily canst on a sufficient number of them to come back and menace the city with instant war unless the emperor should deliver up thy lady most unfairly made prisoner and prevent by his authority this absurd and unnatural combat and would you have me then said count robert move the crusaders to break a fairly appointed field of battle do you think that godfrey of bouillon would turn back upon his pilgrimage for such an unworthy purpose or that the countess of paris would accept as a service means of safety which would stain her honour for ever by breaking an appointment solemnly made on her own challenge never my judgment is then at fault said the varangian for i see i can hammer out no expedient which is not in some extravagant manner or another controlled by your foolish notions here is a man who has been trapped into the power of his enemy that he might not interfere to prevent a base stratagem upon his lady involving both her life and honour yet he thinks it a matter of necessity that he keeps faith as precisely with these midnight poisoners as he would had it been pledged to the most honourable men thou sayst a painful truth said count robert but my word is the emblem of my faith and if it pass to a dishonourable or faithless foe it is imprudently done on my part but if i break it being once pledged it is a dishonourable action and the disgrace can never be washed from my shield do you mean then said the varangian to suffer your wifes honour to remain pledged as it at present is on the event of an unequal combat god and the saints pardon thee such a thought said the count of paris i will go to see this combat with a heart as firm if not as light as any time i ever saw spears splintered if by the influence of any accident or treachery for fairly and with such an antagonist brenhilda of aspramonte cannot be overthrown i step into the lists proclaim the caesar as he is a villain show the falsehood of his conduct from beginning to end appeal to every noble heart that hears me and then god show the right hereward paused and shook his head all this he said might be feasible enough provided the combat were to be fought in the presence of your own countrymen or even by the mass if the varangians were to be guards of the lists but treachery of every kind is so familiar to the greeks that i question if they would view the conduct of their caesar as any thing else than a pardonable and natural stratagem of dan cupid to be smiled at rather than subjected to disgrace or punishment a nation said count robert who could smile at such a jest may heaven refuse them sympathy at their utmost need when their sword is broken in their hand and their wives and daughters shrieking in the relentless grasp of a barbarous enemy hereward looked upon his companion whose flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes bore witness to his enthusiasm i see he said you are resolved and i know that your resolution can in justice be called by no other name than an act of heroic folly what then it is long since life has been bitter to the varangian exile morn has raised him from a joyless bed which night has seen him lie down upon wearied with wielding a mercenary weapon in the wars of strangers he has longed to lay down his life in an honourable cause and this is one in which the extremity and very essence of honour is implicated it tallies also with my scheme of saving the emperor which will be greatly facilitated by the downfall of his ungrateful sonin law then addressing himself to the count he continued well sir count as thou art the person principally concerned i am willing to yield to thy reasoning in this affair but i hope you will permit me to mingle with your resolution some advices of a more everyday and less fantastic nature for example thy escape from the dungeons of the blacquernal must soon be generally known in prudence indeed i myself must be the first to communicate it since otherwise the suspicion will fall on me where do you think of concealing yourself for assuredly the search will be close and general for that said the count of paris i must be indebted to thy suggestion with thanks for every lie which thou findest thyself obliged to make to contrive and produce in my behalf entreating thee only to render them as few as possible they being a coin which i myself never fabricate sir knight answered hereward let me begin first by saying that no knight that ever belted sword is more a slave to truth when truth is observed towards him than the poor soldier who talks to thee but when the game depends not upon fair play but upon lulling mens cautiousness asleep by falsehood and drugging their senses by opiate draughts they who would scruple at no means of deceiving me can hardly expect that i who am paid in such base money should pass nothing on my part but what is lawful and genuine for the present thou must remain concealed within my poor apartment in the barracks of the varangians which is the last place where they will think of seeking for thee take this my upper cloak and follow me and now that we are about to leave these gardens thou mayst follow me unsuspected as a sentinel attending his officer for take it along with you noble count that we varangians are a sort of persons upon whom the greeks care not to look very long or fixedly they now reached the gate where they had been admitted by the negress and hereward who was intrusted with the power it seems of letting himself out of the philosophers premises though not of entering without assistance from the portress took out a key which turned the lock on the garden side so that they soon found themselves at liberty they then proceeded by bypaths through the city hereward leading the way and the count following without speech or remonstrance until they stood before the portal of the barracks of the varangians make haste said the sentinel who was on duty dinner is already begun the communication sounded joyfully in the ears of hereward who was much afraid that his companion might have been stopt and examined by a side passage he reached his own quarters and introduced the count into a small room the sleeping chamber of his squire where he apologized for leaving him for some time and going out locked the door for fear as he said of intrusion the demon of suspicion was not very likely to molest a mind so frankly constituted as that of count robert and yet the last action of hereward did not fail to occasion some painful reflections this man he said had needs be true for i have reposed in him a mighty trust which few hirelings in his situation would honourably discharge what is to prevent him to report to the principal officer of his watch that the frank prisoner robert count of paris whose wife stands engaged for so desperate a combat with the caesar has escaped indeed this morning from the prisons of the blacquernal but has suffered himself to be trepanned at noon and is again a captive in the barracks of the varangian guard what means of defence are mine were i discovered to these mercenaries what man could do by the favour of our lady of the broken lances i have not failed to achieve i have slain a tiger in single combat i have killed one warder and conquered the desperate and gigantic creature by whom he was supported i have had terms enough at command to bring over this varangian to my side in appearance at least yet all this does not encourage me to hope that i could long keep at bay ten or a dozen such men as these beeffed knaves appear to be led in upon me by a fellow of thewes and sinews such as those of my late companion yet for shame robert such thoughts are unworthy a descendant of charlemagne when wert thou wont so curiously to count thine enemies and when wert thou wont to be suspicious since he whose bosom may truly boast itself incapable of fraud ought in honesty to be the last to expect it in another the varangians look is open his coolness in danger is striking his speech is more frank and ready than ever was that of a traitor if he is false there is no faith in the hand of nature for truth sincerity and courage are written upon his forehead while count robert was thus reflecting upon his condition and combating the thickcoming doubts and suspicions which its uncertainties gave rise to he began to be sensible that he had not eaten for many hours and amidst many doubts and fears of a more heroic nature he half entertained a lurking suspicion that they meant to let hunger undermine his strength before they adventured into the apartment to deal with him we shall best see how far these doubts were deserved by hereward or how far they were unjust by following his course after he left his barrackroom snatching a morsel of dinner which he ate with an affectation of great hunger but in fact that his attention to his food might be a pretence for dispensing with disagreeable questions or with conversation of any kind he pleaded duty and immediately leaving his comrades directed his course to the lodgings of achilles tatius which were a part of the same building a syrian slave who opened the door after a deep reverence to hereward whom he knew as a favourite attendant of the acolyte said to him that his master was gone forth but had desired him to say that if he wished to see him he would find him at the philosophers gardens so called as belonging to the sage agelastes hereward turned about instantly and availing himself of his knowledge of constantinople to thread its streets in the shortest time possible at length stood alone before the door in the gardenwall at which he and the count of paris had previously been admitted in the earlier part of the day the same negress appeared at the same private signal and when he asked for achilles tatius she replied with some sharpness since you were here this morning i marvel you did not meet him or that having business with him you did not stay till he arrived sure i am that not long after you entered the garden the acolyte was enquiring for you it skills not old woman said the varangian i communicate the reason of my motions to my commander but not to thee he entered the garden accordingly and avoiding the twilight path that led to the bower of love so was the pavilion named in which he had overheard the dialogue between the caesar and the countess of paris he arrived before a simple gardenhouse whose humble and modest front seemed to announce that it was the abode of philosophy and learning here passing before the windows he made some little noise expecting to attract the attention either of achilles tatius or his accomplice agelastes as chance should determine it was the first who heard and who replied the door opened a lofty plume stooped itself that its owner might cross the threshold and the stately form of achilles tatius entered the gardens what now he said our trusty sentinel what hast thou at this time of day come to report to us thou art our good friend and highly esteemed soldier and well we wot thine errand must be of importance since thou hast brought it thyself and at an hour so unusual pray heaven said hereward that the news i have brought deserve a welcome speak them instantly said the acolyte good or bad thou speakest to a man to whom fear is unknown but his eye which quailed as he looked on the soldier his colour which went and came his hands which busied themselves in an uncertain manner in adjusting the belt of his sword all argued a state of mind very different from that which his tone of defiance would fain have implied courage he said my trusty soldier speak the news to me i can bear the worst thou hast to tell in a word then said the varangian your valour directed me this morning to play the office of master of the rounds upon those dungeons of the blacquernal palace where last night the boisterous count robert of paris was incarcerated i remember well said achilles tatius what then as i reposed me said hereward in an apartment above the vaults i heard cries from beneath of a kind which attracted my attention i hastened to examine and my surprise was extreme when looking down into the dungeon though i could see nothing distinctly yet by the wailing and whimpering sounds i conceived that the man of the forest the animal called sylvan whom our soldiers have so far indoctrinated in our saxon tongue as to make him useful in the wards of the prison was bemoaning himself on account of some violent injury descending with a torch i found the bed on which the prisoner had been let down burnt to cinders the tiger which had been chained within a spring of it with its skull broken to pieces the creature called sylvan prostrate and writhing under great pain and terror and no prisoner whatever in the dungeon there were marks that all the fastenings had been withdrawn by a mytilenian soldier companion of my watch when he visited the dungeon at the usual hour and as in my anxious search i at length found his dead body slain apparently by a stab in the throat i was obliged to believe that while i was examining the cell he this count robert with whose daring life the adventure is well consistent had escaped into the upper air by means doubtless of the ladder and trapdoor by which i had descended and wherefore didst thou not instantly call treason and raise the hue and cry demanded the acolyte i dared not venture to do so replied the varangian till i had instructions from your valour the alarming cry of treason and the various rumours likely at this moment to ensue might have involved a search so close as perchance would have discovered matters in which the acolyte himself would have been rendered subject to suspicion thou art right said achilles tatius in a whisper and yet it will be necessary that we do not pretend any longer to conceal the flight of this important prisoner if we would not pass for being his accomplices where thinkest thou this unhappy fugitive can have taken refuge that i was in hopes of learning from your valours greater wisdom said hereward thinkest thou not said achilles that he may have crossed the hellespont in order to rejoin his own countrymen and adherents it is much to be dreaded said hereward undoubtedly if the count listened to the advice of any one who knew the face of the country such would be the very counsel he would receive the danger then of his return at the head of a vengeful body of franks said the acolyte is not so immediate as i apprehended at first for the emperor gave positive orders that the boats and galleys which yesterday transported the crusaders to the shores of asia should recross the strait and bring back no single one of them from the step upon their journey on which he had so far furthered them besides they all their leaders that is to say made their vows before crossing that they would not turn back so much as a foots pace now that they had set actually forth on the road to palestine so therefore said hereward one of the two propositions is unquestionable either count robert is on the eastern side of the strait having no means of returning with his brethren to avenge the usage he has received and may therefore be securely set at defiance or else he lurks somewhere in constantinople without a friend or ally to take his part or encourage him openly to state his supposed wrongs in either case there can i think be no tact in conveying to the palace the news that he has freed himself since it would only alarm the court and afford the emperor ground for many suspicions but it is not for an ignorant barbarian like me to prescribe a course of conduct to your valour and wisdom and methinks the sage agelastes were a fitter counsellor than such as i am no no no said the acolyte in a hurried whisper the philosopher and i are right good friends sworn good friends very especially bound together but should it come to this that one of us must needs throw before the footstool of the emperor the head of the other i think thou wouldst not advise that i whose hairs have not a trace of silver should be the last in making the offering therefore we will say nothing of this mishap but give thee full power and the highest charge to seek for count robert of paris be he dead or alive to secure him within the dungeons set apart for the discipline of our own corps and when thou hast done so to bring me notice i may make him my friend in many ways by extricating his wife from danger by the axes of my varangians what is there in this metropolis that they have to oppose them when raised in a just cause answered hereward nothing hah sayst thou said the acolyte how meanest thou by that but i know thou art scrupulous about having the just and lawful command of thy officer in every action in which thou art engaged and thinking in that dutiful and soldierlike manner it is my duty as thine acolyte to see thy scruples satisfied a warrant shalt thou have with full powers to seek for and imprison this foreign count of whom we have been speaking and hark thee my excellent friend he continued with some hesitation i think thou hadst better begone and begin or rather continue thy search it is unnecessary to inform our friend agelastes of what has happened until his advice be more needful than as yet it is on the occasion home home to the barracks i will account to him for thy appearance here if he be curious on the subject which as a suspicious old man he is likely to be go to the barracks and act as if thou hadst a warrant in every respect full and ample i will provide thee with one when i come back to my quarters the varangian turned hastily homewards now is it not he said a strange thing and enough to make a man a rogue for life to observe how the devil encourages young beginners in falsehood i have told a greater lie at least i have suppressed more truth than on any occasion before in my whole life and what is the consequence why my commander throws almost at my head a warrant sufficient to guarantee and protect me in all i have done or propose to do if the foul fiend were thus regular in protecting his votaries methinks they would have little reason to complain of him or better men to be astonished at their number but a time comes they say when he seldom fails to desert them therefore get thee behind me satan if i have seemed to be thy servant for a short time it is but with an honest and christian purpose as he entertained these thoughts he looked back upon the path and was startled at an apparition of a creature of a much greater size and a stranger shape than human covered all but the face with a reddish dun fur his expression an ugly and yet a sad melancholy a cloth was wrapped round one hand and an air of pain and languor bespoke suffering from a wound so much was hereward preoccupied with his own reflections that at first he thought his imagination had actually raised the devil but after a sudden start of surprise he recognised his acquaintance sylvan hah old friend he said i am happy thou hast made thy escape to a place where them wilt find plenty of fruit to support thee take my advice keep out of the way of discovery keep thy friends counsel the man of the wood uttered a chattering noise in return to this address i understand thee said hereward thou wilt tell no tales thou sayest and faith i will trust thee rather than the better part of my own twolegged race who are eternally circumventing or murdering each other a minute after the creature was out of sight hereward heard the shriek of a female and a voice which cried for help the accents must have been uncommonly interesting to the varangian since forgetting his own dangerous situation he immediately turned and flew to the suppliants assistance chapter the twentieth she comes she comes in all the charms of youth unequalld love and unsuspected truth hereward was not long in tracing the cry through the wooded walks when a female rushed into his arms alarmed as it appeared by sylvan who was pursuing her closely the figure of hereward with his axe uplifted put an instant stop to his career and with a terrified note of his native cries he withdrew into the thickest of the adjoining foliage relieved from his presence hereward had time to look at the female whom he had succoured she was arrayed in a dress which consisted of several colours that which predominated being a pale yellow her tunic was of this colour and like a modern gown was closely fitted to the body which in the present case was that of a tall but very well formed person the mantle or upper garment in which the whole figure was wrapped was of fine cloth and the kind of hood which was attached to it having flown back with the rapidity of her motion gave to view the hair beautifully adorned and twisted into a natural headdress beneath this natural headgear appeared a face pale as death from a sense of the supposed danger but which preserved even amidst its terrors an exquisite degree of beauty hereward was thunderstruck at this apparition the dress was neither grecian italian nor of the costume of the franks it was saxon connected by a thousand tender remembrances with herewards childhood and youth the circumstance was most extraordinary saxon women indeed there were in constantinople who had united their fortunes with those of the varangians and those often chose to wear their national dress in the city because the character and conduct of their husbands secured them a degree of respect which they might not have met with either as grecian or as stranger females of a similar rank but almost all these were personally known to hereward it was no time however for reverie he was himself in danger the situation of the young female might be no safe one in every case it was judicious to quit the more public part of the gardens he therefore lost not a moment in conveying the fainting saxon to a retreat he fortunately was acquainted with a covered path obscured by vegetation led through a species of labyrinth to an artificial cave at the bottom of which halfpaved with shells moss and spar lay the gigantic and half recumbent statue of a river deity with its usual attributes that is its front crowned with waterlilies and sedges and its ample hand halfresting upon an empty urn the attitude of the whole figure corresponded with the motto i sleep awake me not accursed relic of paganism said hereward who was in proportion to his light a zealous christian brutish stock or stone that thou art i will wake thee with a vengeance so saying he struck the head of the slumbering deity with his battleaxe and deranged the play of the fountain so much that the water began to pour into the basin thou art a good block nevertheless said the varangian to send succour so needful to the aid of my poor countrywoman thou shalt give her also with thy leave a portion of thy couch so saying he arranged his fair burden who was as yet insensible upon the pedestal where the figure of the river god reclined in doing this his attention was recalled to her face and again and again he was thrilled with an emotion of hope but so excessively like fear that it could only be compared to the flickering of a torch uncertain whether it is to light up or be instantly extinguished with a sort of mechanical attention he continued to make such efforts as he could to recall the intellect of the beautiful creature before him his feelings were those of the astronomical sage to whom the rise of the moon slowly restores the contemplation of that heaven which is at once as a christian his hope of felicity and as a philosopher the source of his knowledge the blood returned to her cheek and reanimation and even recollection took place in her earlier than in the astonished varangian blessed mary she said have i indeed tasted the last bitter cup and is it here where thou reunitest thy votaries after death speak hereward if thou art aught but an empty creature of the imagination speak and tell me if i have but dreamed of that monstrous ogre collect thyself my beloved bertha said the anglosaxon recalled by the sound of her voice and prepare to endure what thou livest to witness and thy hereward survives to tell that hideous thing exists nay do not start and look for a hidingplace thy own gentle hand with a riding rod is sufficient to tame its courage and am i not here bertha wouldst thou wish another safeguard no no exclaimed she seizing on the arm of her recovered lover do i not know you now and is it but now you know me bertha said hereward i suspected before she said casting down her eyes but i know with certainty that mark of the boars tusk hereward suffered her imagination to clear itself from the shock it had received so suddenly before he ventured to enter upon present events in which there was so much both to doubt and to fear he permitted her therefore to recall to her memory all the circumstances of the rousing the hideous animal assisted by the tribes of both their fathers she mentioned in broken words the flight of arrows discharged against the boar by young and old male and female and how her own well aimed but feeble shaft wounded him sharply she forgot not how incensed at the pain the creature rushed upon her as the cause laid her palfrey dead upon the spot and would soon have slain her had not hereward when every attempt failed to bring his horse up to the monster thrown himself from his seat and interposed personally between the boar and bertha the battle was not decided without a desperate struggle the boar was slain but hereward received the deep gash upon his brow which she whom he had saved how recalled to her memory alas she said what have we been to each other since that period and what are we now in this foreign land answer for thyself my bertha said the varangian if thou canst and if thou canst with truth say that thou art the same bertha who vowed affection to hereward believe me it were sinful to suppose that the saints have brought us together with a view of our being afterwards separated hereward said bertha you have not preserved the bird in your bosom safer than i have at home or abroad in servitude or in freedom amidst sorrow or joy plenty or want my thought was always on the troth i had plighted to hereward at the stone of odin say no more of that said hereward it was an impious rite and good could not come of it was it then so impious she said the unbidden tear rushing into her large blue eyes alas it was a pleasure to reflect that hereward was mine by that solemn engagement listen to me my bertha said hereward taking her hand we were then almost children and though our vow was in itself innocent yet it was so far wrong as being sworn in the presence of a dumb idol representing one who was while alive a bloody and cruel magician but we will the instant an opportunity offers itself renew our vow before a shrine of real sanctity and promise suitable penance for our ignorant acknowledgment of odin to propitiate the real deity who can bear us through those storms of adversity which are like to surround us leaving them for the time to their lovediscourse of a nature pure simple and interesting we shall give in a few words all that the reader needs to know of their separate history between the boars hunt and the time of their meeting in the gardens of agelastes in that doubtful state experienced by outlaws waltheoff the father of hereward and engelred the parent of bertha used to assemble their unsubdued tribes sometimes in the fertile regions of devonshire sometimes in the dark wooded solitudes of hampshire but as much as possible within the call of the bugle of the famous edric the forester so long leader of the insurgent saxons the chiefs we have mentioned were among the last bold men who asserted the independence of the saxon race of england and like their captain edric they were generally known by the name of foresters as men who lived by hunting when their power of making excursions was checked and repelled hence they made a step backwards in civilization and became more like to their remote ancestors of german descent than they were to their more immediate and civilized predecessors who before the battle of hastings had advanced considerably in the arts of civilized life old superstitions had begun to revive among them and hence the practice of youths and maidens plighting their troth at the stone circles dedicated as it was supposed to odin in whom however they had long ceased to nourish any of the sincere belief which was entertained by their heathen ancestors in another respect these outlaws were fast resuming a striking peculiarity of the ancient germans their circumstances naturally brought the youth of both sexes much together and by early marriage or less permanent connexions the population would have increased far beyond the means which the outlaws had to maintain or even to protect themselves the laws of the foresters therefore strictly enjoined that marriages should be prohibited until the bridegroom was twentyone years complete future alliances were indeed often formed by the young people nor was this discountenanced by their parents provided that the lovers waited until the period when the majority of the bridegroom should permit them to marry such youths as infringed this rule incurred the dishonourable epithet of niddering or worthless an epithet of a nature so insulting that men were known to have slain themselves rather than endure life under such opprobrium but the offenders were very few amidst a race trained in moderation and self denial and hence it was that woman worshipped for so many years like something sacred was received when she became the head of a family into the arms and heart of a husband who had so long expected her was treated as something more elevated than the mere idol of the moment and feeling the rate at which she was valued endeavoured by her actions to make her life correspond with it it was by the whole population of these tribes as well as their parents that after the adventure of the boar hunt hereward and bertha were considered as lovers whose alliance was pointed out by heaven and they were encouraged to approximate as much as their mutual inclinations prompted them the youths of the tribe avoided asking marthas hand at the dance and the maidens used no maidenly entreaty or artifice to detain hereward beside them if bertha was present at the feast they clasped each others hands through the perforated stone which they called the altar of odin though later ages have ascribed it to the druids and they implored that if they broke their faith to each other their fault might be avenged by the twelve swords which were now drawn around them during the ceremony by as many youths and that their misfortunes might be so many as twelve maidens who stood around with their hair loosened should be unable to recount either in prose or verse the torch of the saxon cupid shone for some years as brilliant as when it was first lighted the time however came when they were to be tried by adversity though undeserved by the perfidy of either years had gone past and hereward had to count with anxiety how many months and weeks were to separate him from the bride who was beginning already by degrees to shrink less shyly from the expressions and caresses of one who was soon to term her all his own william rufus however had formed a plan of totally extirpating the foresters whose implacable hatred and restless love of freedom had so often disturbed the quiet of his kingdom and despised his forest laws he assembled his norman forces and united to them a body of saxons who had submitted to his rule he thus brought an overpowering force upon the bands of waltheoff and engelred who found no resource but to throw the females of their tribe and such as could not bear arms into a convent dedicated to st augustin of which kenelm their relation was prior and then turning to the battle vindicated their ancient valour by fighting it to the last both the unfortunate chiefs remained dead on the field and hereward and his brother had wellnigh shared their fate but some saxon inhabitants of the neighbourhood who adventured on the field of battle which the victors had left bare of every thing save the booty of the kites and the ravens found the bodies of the youths still retaining life as they were generally well known and much beloved by these people hereward and his brother were taken care of till their wounds began to close and their strength returned hereward then heard the doleful news of the death of his father and engelred his next enquiry was concerning his betrothed bride and her mother the poor inhabitants could give him little information some of the females who had taken refuge in the convent the norman knights and nobles had seized upon as their slaves and the rest with the monks who had harboured them were turned adrift and their place of retreat was completely sacked and burnt to the ground halfdead himself at hearing these tidings hereward sallied out and at every risk of death for the saxon foresters were treated as outlaws commenced enquiries after those so dear to him he asked concerning the particular fate of bertha and her mother among the miserable creatures who yet hovered about the neighbourhood of the convent like a few halfscorched bees about their smothered hive but in the magnitude of their own terrors none had retained eyes for their neighbours and all that they could say was that the wife and daughter of engelred were certainly lost and their imaginations suggested so many heartrending details to this conclusion that hereward gave up all thoughts of further researches likely to terminate so uselessly and so horribly the young saxon had been all his life bred up in a patriotic hatred to the normans who did not it was likely become dearer to his thoughts in consequence of this victory he dreamed at first of crossing the strait to make war against the hated enemy in their own country but an idea so extravagant did not long retain possession of his mind his fate was decided by his encountering an aged palmer who knew or pretended to have known his father and to be a native of england this man was a disguised varangian selected for the purpose possessed of art and dexterity and well provided with money he had little difficulty in persuading hereward in the hopeless desolation of his condition to join the varangian guard at this moment at war with the normans under which name it suited herewards prepossessions to represent the emperors wars with robert guiscard his son bohemond and other adventurers in italy greece or sicily a journey to the east also inferred a pilgrimage and gave the unfortunate hereward the chance of purchasing pardon for his sins by visiting the holy land in gaining hereward the recruiter also secured the services of his elder brother who had vowed not to separate from him the high character of both brothers for courage induced this wily agent to consider them as a great prize and it was from the memoranda respecting the history and character of those whom he recruited in which the elder had been unreservedly communicative that agelastes picked up the information respecting herewards family and circumstances which at their first secret interview he made use of to impress upon the varangian the idea of his supernatural knowledge several of his companions in arms were thus gained over for it will easily be guessed that these memorials were intrusted to the keeping of achilles tatius and he to further their joint purposes imparted them to agelastes who thus obtained a general credit for supernatural knowledge among these ignorant men but herewards blunt faith and honesty enabled him to shun the snare such being the fortunes of hereward those of bertha formed the subject of a broken and passionate communication between the lovers broken like an april day and mingled with many a tender caress such as modesty permits to lovers when they meet again unexpectedly after a separation which threatened to be eternal but the story may be comprehended in few words amid the general sack of the monastery an old norman knight seized upon bertha as his prize struck with her beauty he designed her as an attendant upon his daughter just then come out of the years of childhood and the very apple of her fathers eye being the only child of his beloved countess and sent late in life to bless their marriagebed it was in the order of things that the lady of aspramonte who was considerably younger than the knight should govern her husband and that brenhilda their daughter should govern both her parents the knight of aspramonte however it may be observed entertained some desire to direct his young offspring to more feminine amusements than those which began already to put her life frequently in danger contradiction was not to be thought of as the good old knight knew by experience the influence and example of a companion a little older than herself might be of some avail and it was with this view that in the confusion of the sack aspramonte seized upon the youthful bertha terrified to the utmost degree she clung to her mother and the knight of aspramonte who had a softer heart than was then usually found under a steel cuirass moved by the affliction of the mother and daughter and recollecting that the former might also be a useful attendant upon his lady extended his protection to both and conveying them out of the press paid the soldiers who ventured to dispute the spoil with him partly in some small pieces of money and partly in dry blows with the reverse of his lance the wellnatured knight soon after returned to his own castle and being a man of an orderly life and virtuous habits the charming beauties of the saxon virgin and the more ripened charms of her mother did not prevent their travelling in all honour as well as safety to his family fortress the castle of aspramonte here such masters as could be procured were got together to teach the young bertha every sort of female accomplishment in the hope that her mistress brenhilda might be inspired with a desire to partake in her education but although this so far succeeded that the saxon captive became highly skilled in such music needlework and other female accomplishments as were known to the time yet her young mistress brenhilda retained the taste for those martial amusements which had so sensibly grieved her father but to which her mother who herself had nourished such fancies in her youth readily gave sanction the captives however were kindly treated brenhilda became infinitely attached to the young anglosaxon whom she loved less for her ingenuity in arts than for her activity in field sports to which her early state of independence had trained her the lady of aspramonte was also kind to both the captives but in one particular she exercised a piece of petty tyranny over them she had imbibed an idea strengthened by an old doting fatherconfessor that the saxons were heathens at that time or at least heretics and made a positive point with her husband that the bondswoman and girl who were to attend on her person and that of her daughter should be qualified for the office by being anew admitted into the christian church by baptism though feeling the falsehood and injustice of the accusation the mother had sense enough to submit to necessity and received the name of martha in all form at the altar to which she answered during the rest of her life but bertha showed a character upon this occasion inconsistent with the general docility and gentleness of her temper she boldly refused to be admitted anew into the pale of the church of which her conscience told her she was already a member or to exchange for another the name originally given her at the font it was in vain that the old knight commanded that the lady threatened and that her mother advised and entreated more closely pressed in private by her mother she let her motive be known which had not before been suspected i know she said with a flood of tears that my father would have died ere i was subjected to this insult and then who shall assure me that vows which were made to the saxon bertha will be binding if a french agatha be substituted in her stead they may banish me she said or kill me if they will but if the son of waltheoff should again meet with the daughter of engelred he shall meet that bertha whom he knew in the forests of hampton all argument was in vain the saxon maiden remained obstinate and to try to break her resolution the lady of aspramonte at length spoke of dismissing her from the service of her young mistress and banishing her from the castle to this also she had made up her mind and she answered firmly though respectfully that she would sorrow bitterly at parting with her young lady but as to the rest she would rather beg under her own name than be recreant to the faith of her fathers and condemn it as heresy by assigning one of frank origin the lady brenhilda in the meantime entered the chamber where her mother was just about to pass the threatened doom of banishment do not stop for my entrance madam said the dauntless young lady i am as much concerned in the doom which you are about to pass as is bertha if she crosses the drawbridge of aspramonte as an exile so will i when she has dried her tears of which even my petulance could never wring one from her eyes she shall be my squire and body attendant and launcelot the bard shall follow with my spear and shield and you will return mistress said her mother from so foolish an expedition before the sun sets so heaven further me in my purpose lady answered the young heiress the sun shall neither rise nor set that sees us return till this name of bertha and of her mistress brenhilda are wafted as far as the trumpet of fame can sound them cheer up my sweetest bertha she said taking her attendant by the hand if heaven hath torn thee from thy country and thy plighted troth it hath given thee a sister and a friend with whom thy fame shall be forever blended the lady of aspramonte was confounded she knew that her daughter was perfectly capable of the wild course which she had announced and that she herself even with her husbands assistance would be unable to prevent her following it she passively listened therefore while the saxon matron formerly urica but now martha addressed her daughter my child she said as you value honour virtue safety and gratitude soften your heart towards your master and mistress and follow the advice of a parent who has more years and more judgment than you and you my dearest young lady let not your ladymother think that an attachment to the exercises you excel in has destroyed in your bosom filial affection and a regard to the delicacy of your sex as they seem both obstinate madam continued the matron after watching the influence of this advice upon the young woman perhaps if it may be permitted me i could state an alternative which might in the meanwhile satisfy your ladyships wishes accommodate itself to the wilfulness of my obstinate daughter and answer the kind purpose of her generous mistress the lady of aspramonte signed to the saxon matron to proceed she went on accordingly the saxons dearest lady of the present day are neither pagans nor heretics they are in the time of keeping easter as well as in all other disputable doctrine humbly obedient to the pope of rome and this our good bishop well knows since he upbraided some of the domestics for calling me an old heathen yet our names are uncouth in the ears of the franks and bear perhaps a heathenish sound if it be not exacted that my daughter submit to a new rite of baptism she will lay aside her saxon name of bertha upon all occasions while in your honourable household this will cut short a debate which with forgiveness i think is scarce of importance enough to break the peace of this castle i will engage that in gratitude for this indulgence of a trifling scruple my daughter if possible shall double the zeal and assiduity of her service to her young lady the lady of aspramonte was glad to embrace the means which this offer presented of extricating herself from the dispute with as little compromise of dignity as could well be if the good lord bishop approved of such a compromise she said she would for herself withdraw her opposition the prelate approved accordingly the more readily that he was informed that the young heiress desired earnestly such an agreement the peace of the castle was restored and bertha recognized her new name of agatha as a name of service but not a name of baptism one effect the dispute certainly produced and that was increasing in an enthusiastic degree the love of bertha for her young mistress with that amiable failing of attached domestics and humble friends she endeavoured to serve her as she knew she loved to be served and therefore indulged her mistress in those chivalrous fancies which distinguished her even in her own age and in ours would have rendered her a female quixote bertha indeed never caught the frenzy of her mistress but strong willing and ablebodied she readily qualified herself to act upon occasion as a squire of the body to a lady adventuress and accustomed from her childhood to see blows dealt blood flowing and men dying she could look with an undazzled eye upon the dangers which her mistress encountered and seldom teased her with remonstrances unless when those were unusually great this compliance on most occasions gave bertha a right of advice upon some which always given with the best intentions and at fitting times strengthened her influence with her mistress which a course of conduct savouring of diametrical opposition would certainly have destroyed a few more words serve to announce the death of the knight of aspramonte the romantic marriage of the young lady with the count of paris their engagement in the crusade and the detail of events with which the reader is acquainted hereward did not exactly comprehend some of the later incidents of the story owing to a slight strife which arose between bertha and him during the course of her narrative when she avowed the girlish simplicity with which she obstinately refused to change her name because in her apprehension the trothplight betwixt her and her lover might be thereby prejudiced it was impossible for hereward not to acknowledge her tenderness by snatching her to his bosom and impressing his grateful thanks upon her lips she extricated herself immediately from his grasp however with cheeks more crimsoned in modesty than in anger and gravely addressed her lover thus enough enough hereward this may be pardoned to so unexpected a meeting but we must in future remember that we are probably the last of our race and let it not be said that the manners of their ancestors were forgotten by hereward and by bertha think that though we are alone the shades of our fathers are not far off and watch to see what use we make of the meeting which perhaps their intercession has procured us you wrong me bertha said hereward if you think me capable of forgetting my own duty and yours at a moment when our thanks are due to heaven to be testified very differently than by infringing on its behests or the commands of our parents the question is now how we shall rejoin each other when we separate since separate i fear we must o do not say so exclaimed the unfortunate bertha it must be so said hereward for a time but i swear to thee by the hilt of my sword and the handle of my battleaxe that blade was never so true to shaft as i will be to thee but wherefore then leave me hereward said the maiden and oh wherefore not assist me in the release of my mistress of thy mistress said hereward shame that thou canst give that name to mortal woman but she is my mistress answered bertha and by a thousand kind ties which cannot be separated so long as gratitude is the reward of kindness and what is her danger said hereward what is it she wants this accomplished lady whom thou callest mistress her honour her life are alike in danger said bertha she has agreed to meet the caesar in the field and he will not hesitate like a baseborn miscreant to take every advantage in the encounter which i grieve to say may in all likelihood be fatal to my mistress why dost thou think so answered hereward this lady has won many single combats unless she is belied against adversaries more formidable than the caesar true said the saxon maiden but you speak of things that passed in a far different land where faith and honour are not empty sounds as alas they seem but too surely to be here trust me it is no girlish terror which sends me out in this disguise of my country dress which they say finds respect at constantinople i go to let the chiefs of the crusade know the peril in which the noble lady stands and trust to their humanity to their religion to their love of honour and fear of disgrace for assistance in this hour of need and now that i have had the blessing of meeting with thee all besides will go well all will go well and i will back to my mistress and report whom i have seen tarry yet another moment my recovered treasure said hereward and let me balance this matter carefully this frankish lady holds the saxons like the very dust that thou brushest from the hem of her garment she treats she regards the saxons as pagans and heretics she has dared to impose slavish tasks upon thee born in freedom her fathers sword has been embrued to the hilt with anglosaxon blood perhaps that of waltheoff and engelred has added death to the stain she has been besides a presumptuous fool usurping for herself the trophies and warlike character which belong to the other sex lastly it will be hard to find a champion to fight in her stead since all the crusaders have passed over to asia which is the land they say in which they have come to war and by orders of the emperor no means of return to the hither shore will be permitted to any of them alas alas said bertha how does this world change us the son of waltheoff i once knew brave ready to assist distress bold and generous such was what i pictured him to myself during his absence i have met him again and he is calculating cold and selfish hush damsel said the varangian and know him of whom thou speakest ere thou judgest him the countess of paris is such as i have said yet let her appear boldly in the lists and when the trumpet shall sound thrice another shall reply which shall announce the arrival of her own noble lord to do battle in her stead or should he fail to appear i will requite her kindness to thee bertha and be ready in his place wilt thou wilt thou indeed said the damsel that was spoken like the son of waltheoff like the genuine stock i will home and comfort my mistress for surely if the judgment of god ever directed the issue of a judicial combat its influence will descend upon this but you hint that the count is here that he is at liberty she will enquire about that she must be satisfied replied hereward to know that her husband is under the guidance of a friend who will endeavour to protect him from his own extravagances and follies or at all events of one who if he cannot properly be called a friend has certainly not acted and will not act towards him the part of an enemy and now farewell long lost long loved before he could say more the saxon maiden after two or three vain attempts to express her gratitude threw herself into her lovers arms and despite the coyness which she had recently shown impressed upon his lips the thanks which she could not speak they parted bertha returning to her mistress at the lodge which she had left both with trouble and danger and hereward by the portal kept by the negroportress who complimenting the handsome varangian on his success among the fair intimated that she had been in some sort a witness of his meeting with the saxon damsel a piece of gold part of a late largesse amply served to bribe her tongue and the soldier clear of the gardens of the philosopher sped back as he might to the barrack judging that it was full time to carry some supply to count robert who had been left without food the whole day it is a common popular saying that as the sensation of hunger is not connected with any pleasing or gentle emotion so it is particularly remarkable for irritating those of anger and spleen it is not therefore very surprising that count robert who had been so unusually long without sustenance should receive hereward with a degree of impatience beyond what the occasion merited and injurious certainly to the honest varangian who had repeatedly exposed his life that day for the interest of the countess and the count himself soh sir he said in that accent of affected restraint by which a superior modifies his displeasure against his inferior into a cold and scornful expression you have played a liberal host to us not that it is of consequence but methinks a count of the most christian kingdom dines not every day with a mercenary soldier and might expect if not the ostentatious at least the needful part of hospitality and methinks replied the varangian o most christian count that such of your high rank as by choice or fate become the guests of such as i may think themselves pleased and blame not their hosts niggardliness but the difficulty of his circumstances if dinner should not present itself oftener than once in fourandtwenty hours so saying he clapt his hands together and his domestic edric entered his guest looked astonished at the entrance of this third party into their retirement i will answer for this man said hereward and addressed him in the following words what food hast thou edric to place before the honourable count nothing but the cold pasty replied the attendant marvellously damaged by your honours encounter at breakfast the military domestic as intimated brought forward a large pasty but which had already that morning sustained a furious attack insomuch that count robert of paris who like all noble normans was somewhat nice and delicate in his eating was in some doubt whether his scrupulousness should not prevail over his hunger but on looking more closely sight smell and a fast of twenty hours joined to convince him that the pasty was an excellent one and that the charger on which it was presented possessed corners yet untouched at length having suppressed his scruples and made bold inroad upon the remains of the dish he paused to partake of a flask of strong red wine which stood invitingly beside him and a lusty draught increased the goodhumour which had begun to take place towards hereward in exchange for the displeasure with which he had received him now by heaven he said i myself ought to be ashamed to lack the courtesy which i recommend to others here have i with the manners of a flemish boor been devouring the provisions of my gallant host without even asking him to sit down at his own table and to partake of his own good cheer i will not strain courtesies with you for that said hereward and thrusting his hand into the pasty he proceeded with great speed and dexterity to devour the miscellaneous contents a handful of which was enclosed in his grasp the count now withdrew from the table partly in disgust at the rustic proceedings of hereward who however by now calling edric to join him in his attack upon the pasty showed that he had in fact according to his manners subjected himself previously to some observance of respect towards his guest while the assistance of his attendant enabled him to make a clear cacaabulum of what was left count robert at length summoned up courage sufficient to put a question which had been trembling upon his lips ever since hereward had returned have thine enquiries my gallant friend learned more concerning my unfortunate wife my faithful brenhilda tidings i have said the anglosaxon but whether pleasing or not yourself must be the judge this much i have learned she hath as you know come under an engagement to meet the caesar in arms in the lists but under conditions which you may perhaps think strange these however she hath entertained without scruple let me know these terms said the count of paris they will i think appear less strange in my eyes than in thine but while he affected to speak with the utmost coolness the husbands sparkling eye and crimsoned cheek betrayed the alteration which had taken place in his feelings the lady and the caesar said hereward as you partly heard yourself are to meet in fight if the countess wins of course she remains the wife of the noble count of paris if she loses she becomes the paramour of the caesar nicephorus briennius saints and angels forbid said count robert were they to permit such treason to triumph we might be pardoned for doubting their divinity yet methinks said the anglosaxon it were no disgraceful precaution that both you and i with other friends if we can obtain such should be seen under shield in the lists on the morning of the conflict to triumph or to be defeated is in the hand of fate but what we cannot fail to witness is whether or not the lady receives that fair play which is the due of an honourable combatant and which as you have yourself seen can be sometimes basely transgressed in this grecian empire on that condition said the count and protesting that not even the extreme danger of my lady shall make me break through the rule of a fair fight i will surely attend the lists if thou brave saxon canst find me any means of doing so yet stay he continued after reflecting for a moment thou shalt promise not to let her know that her count is on the field far less to point him out to her eye among the press of warriors o thou dost not know that the sight of the beloved will sometimes steal from us our courage even when it has most to achieve we will endeavour said the varangian to arrange matters according to thy pleasure so that thou findest out no more fantastical difficulties for by my word an affair so complicated in itself requires not to be confused by the finespun whims of thy national gallantry meantime much must be done this night and while i go about it thou sir knight hadst best remain here with such disguise of garments and such food as edric may be able to procure for thee fear nothing from intrusion on the part of thy neighbours we varangians respect each others secrets of whatever nature they may chance to be chapter the twentyfirst but for our trusty brotherinlawand the abbot with all the rest of that consorted crew destruction straight shall dog them at the heels good uncle help to order several powers to oxford or whereer these traitors are they shall not live within this world i swear richard ii as hereward spoke the last words narrated in the foregoing chapter he left the count in his apartment and proceeded to the blacquernal palace we traced his first entrance into the court but since then he had frequently been summoned not only by order of the princess anna comnena who delighted in asking him questions concerning the customs of his native country and marking down the replies in her own inflated language but also by the direct command of the emperor himself who had the humour of many princes that of desiring to obtain direct information from persons in a very inferior station in their court the ring which the princess had given to the varangian served as a pass token more than once and was now so generally known by the slaves of the palace that hereward had only to slip it into the hand of a principal person among them and was introduced into a small chamber not distant from the saloon already mentioned dedicated to the muses in this small apartment the emperor his spouse irene and their accomplished daughter anna comnena were seated together clad in very ordinary apparel as indeed the furniture of the room itself was of the kind used by respectable citizens saving that mattrasses composed of eiderdown hung before each door to prevent the risk of eavesdropping our trusty varangian said the empress my guide and tutor respecting the manners of those steelclad men said the princess anna comnena of whom it is so necessary that i should form an accurate idea your imperial majesty said the empress will not i trust think your consort and your museinspired daughter are too many to share with you the intelligence brought by this brave and loyal man dearest wife and daughter returned the emperor i have hitherto spared you the burden of a painful secret which i have locked in my own bosom at whatever expense of solitary sorrow and unimparted anxiety noble daughter you in particular will feel this calamity learning as you must learn to think odiously of one of whom it has hitherto been your duty to hold a very different opinion holy mary exclaimed the princess rally yourself said the emperor remember you are a child of the purple chamber born not to weep for your fathers wrongs but to avenge them not to regard even him who has lain by your side as half so important as the sacred imperial grandeur of which you are yourself a partaker what can such words preface said anna comnena in great agitation they say answered the emperor that the caesar is an ungrateful man to all my bounties and even to that which annexed him to my own house and made him by adoption my own son he hath consorted himself with a knot of traitors whose very names are enough to raise the foul fiend as if to snatch his assured prey could nicephorus do this said the astonished and forlorn princess nicephorus who has so often called my eyes the lights by which he steered his path could he do this to my father to whose exploits he has listened hour after hour protesting that he knew not whether it was the beauty of the language or the heroism of the action which most enchanted him thinking with the same thought seeing with the same eye loving with the same heart o my father it is impossible that he could be so false think of the neighbouring temple of the muses and if i did murmured alexius in his heart i should think of the only apology which could be proposed for the traitor a little is well enough but the full soul loatheth the honeycomb then speaking aloud my daughter he said be comforted we ourselves were unwilling to believe the shameful truth but our guards have been debauched their commander that ungrateful achilles tatius with the equal traitor agelastes have been seduced to favour our imprisonment or murder and alas for greece in the very moment when she required the fostering care of a parent she was to be deprived of him by a sudden and merciless blow here the emperor wept whether for the loss to be sustained by his subjects or of his own life it is hard to say methinks said irene your imperial highness is slow in taking measures against the danger under your gracious permission mother answered the princess i would rather say he was hasty in giving belief to it methinks the evidence of a varangian granting him to be ever so stout a manatarms is but a frail guarantee against the honour of your soninlaw the approved bravery and fidelity of the captain of your guards the deep sense virtue and profound wisdom of the greatest of your philosophers and the conceit of an overeducated daughter said the emperor who will not allow her parent to judge in what most concerns him i will tell thee anna i know every one of them and the trust which may be reposed in them the honour of your nicephorus the bravery and fidelity of the acolyte and the virtue and wisdom of agelastes have i not had them all in my purse and had my purse continued well filled and my arm strong as it was of late there they would have still remained but the butterflies went off as the weather became cold and i must meet the tempest without their assistance you talk of want of proof i have proof sufficient when i see danger this honest soldier brought me indications which corresponded with my own private remarks made on purpose varangian he shall be of varangians acolyte he shall be named in place of the present traitor and who knows what may come thereafter may it please your highness said the varangian who had been hitherto silent many men in this empire rise to dignity by the fall of their original patrons but it is a road to greatness to which i cannot reconcile my conscience moreover having recovered a friend from whom i was long ago separated i shall require in short space your imperial license for going hence where i shall leave thousands of enemies behind me and spending my life like many of my countrymen under the banner of king william of scotland part with thee most inimitable man cried the emperor with emphasis where shall i get a soldier a champion a friend so faithful noble sir replied the anglosaxon i am every way sensible to your goodness and munificence but let me entreat you to call me by my own name and to promise me nothing but your forgiveness for my having been the agent of such confusion among your imperial servants not only is the threatened fate of achilles tatius my benefactor of the caesar whom i think my wellwisher and even of agelastes himself painful so far as it is of my bringing round but also i have known it somehow happen that those on whom your imperial majesty has lavished the most valuable expressions of your favour one day were the next day food to fatten the chough and crow and this i acknowledge is a purpose for which i would not willingly have it said i had brought my english limbs to these grecian shores call thee by thine own name my edward said the emperor while he muttered aside by heaven i have again forgot the name of the barbarian by thine own name certainly for the present but only until we shall devise one more fitted for the trust we repose in thee meantime look at this scroll which contains i think all the particulars which we have been able to learn of this plot and give it to these unbelieving women who will not credit that an emperor is in danger till the blades of the conspirators poniards are clashing within his ribs hereward did as he was commanded and having looked at the scroll and signified by bending his head his acquiescence in its contents he presented it to irene who had not read long ere with a countenance so embittered that she had difficulty in pointing out the cause of her displeasure to her daughter she bade her with animation read that read that and judge of the gratitude and affection of thy caesar the princess anna comnena awoke from a state of profound and overpowering melancholy and looked at the passage pointed out to her at first with an air of languid curiosity which presently deepened into the most intense interest she clutched the scroll as a falcon does his prey her eye lightened with indignation and it was with the cry of the bird when in fury that she exclaimed bloodyminded doublehearted traitor what wouldst thou have yes father she said rising in fury it is no longer the voice of a deceived princess that shall intercede to avert from the traitor nicephorus the doom he has deserved did he think that one born in the purple chamber could be divorced murdered perhaps with the petty formula of the romans restore the keys be no longer my domestic drudgefootnote the laconic form of the roman divorce was a daughter of the blood of comnenus liable to such insults as the meanest of quirites might bestow on a family housekeeper so saying she dashed the tears from her eyes and her countenance naturally that of beauty and gentleness became animated with the expression of a fury hereward looked at her with a mixture of fear dislike and compassion she again burst forth for nature having given her considerable abilities had lent her at the same time an energy of passion far superior in power to the cold ambition of irene or the wily ambidexter shuffling policy of the emperor he shall abye it said the princess he shall dearly abye it false smiling cozening traitor and for that unfeminine barbarian something of this i guessed even at that old fools banquetinghouse and yet if this unworthy caesar submits his body to the chance of arms he is less prudent than i have some reason to believe think you he will have the madness to brand us with such open neglect my father and will you not invent some mode of ensuring our revenge soh thought the emperor this difficulty is over she will run down hill to her revenge and will need the snaffle and curb more than the lash if every jealous dame in constantinople were to pursue her fury as unrelentingly our laws should be written like dracos not in ink but in blood attend to me now he said aloud my wife my daughter and thou dear edward and you shall learn and you three only my mode of navigating the vessel of the state through these shoals let us see distinctly continued alexius the means by which they propose to act and these shall instruct us how to meet them a certain number of the varangians are unhappily seduced under pretence of wrongs artfully stirred up by their villanous general a part of them are studiously to be arranged nigh our person the traitor ursel some of them suppose is dead but if it were so his name is sufficient to draw together his old factionaries i have a means of satisfying them on that point on which i shall remain silent for the present a considerable body of the immortal guards have also given way to seduction they are to be placed to support the handful of treacherous varangians who are in the plot to attack our person now a slight change in the stations of the soldiery which thou my faithful edward or a a whatever thou art named for which thou i say shalt have full authority will derange the plans of the traitors and place the true men in such position around them as to cut them to pieces with little trouble and the combat my lord said the saxon thou hadst been no true varangian hadst thou not enquired after that said the emperor nodding goodhumouredly towards him as to the combat the caesar has devised it and it shall be my care that he shall not retreat from the dangerous part of it he cannot in honour avoid fighting with this woman strange as the combat is and however it ends the conspiracy will break forth and as assuredly as it comes against persons prepared and in arms shall it be stifled in the blood of the conspirators my revenge does not require this said the princess and your imperial honour is also interested that this countess shall be protected it is little business of mine said the emperor she comes here with her husband altogether uninvited he behaves with insolence in my presence and deserves whatever may be the issue to himself or his lady of their mad adventure in sooth i desired little more than to give him a fright with those animals whom their ignorance judged enchanted and to give his wife a slight alarm about the impetuosity of a grecian lover and there my vengeance should have ended but it may be that his wife may be taken under my protection now that little revenge is over and a paltry revenge it was said the empress that you a man past middle life and with a wife who might command some attention should constitute yourself the object of alarm to such a handsome man as count robert and the amazon his wife by your favour dame irene no said the emperor i left that part of the proposed comedy to my soninlaw the caesar but when the poor emperor had in some measure stopt one floodgate he effectually opened another and one which was more formidable the more shame to your imperial wisdom my father exclaimed the princess anna comnena it is a shame that with wisdom and a beard like yours you should be meddling in such indecent follies as admit disturbance into private families and that family your own daughters who can say that the caesar nicephorus briennius ever looked astray towards another woman than his wife till the emperor taught him to do so and involved him in a web of intrigue and treachery in which he has endangered the life of his fatherinlaw daughter daughter daughter said the empress daughter of a she wolf i think to goad her parent at such an unhappy time when all the leisure he has is too little to defend his life peace i pray you women both with your senseless clamours answered alexius and let me at least swim for my life undisturbed with your folly god knows if i am a man to encourage i will not say the reality of wrong but even its mere appearance these words he uttered crossing himself with a devout groan his wife irene in the meantime stept before him and said with a bitterness in her looks and accent which only longconcealed nuptial hatred breaking forth at once could convey alexius terminate this affair how it will you have lived a hypocrite and thou wilt not fail to die one so saying with an air of noble indignation and carrying her daughter along with her she swept out of the apartment the emperor looked after her in some confusion he soon however recovered his selfpossession and turning to hereward with a look of injured majesty said ah my dear edward for the word had become rooted in his mind instead of the less euphonic name of hereward thou seest how it is even with the greatest and that the emperor in moments of difficulty is a subject of misconstruction as well as the meanest burgess of constantinople nevertheless my trust is so great in thee edward that i would have thee believe that my daughter anna comnena is not of the temper of her mother but rather of my own honouring thou mayst see with religious fidelity the unworthy ties which i hope soon to break and assort her with other fetters of cupid which shall be borne more lightly edward my main trust is in thee accident presents us with an opportunity happy of the happiest so it be rightly improved of having all the traitors before us assembled on one fair field think then on that day as the franks say at their tournaments that fair eyes behold thee thou canst not devise a gift within my power but i will gladly load thee with it it needs not said the varangian somewhat coldly my highest ambition is to merit the epitaph upon my tomb hereward was faithful i am about however to demand a proof of your imperial confidence which perhaps you may think a startling one indeed said the emperor what in one word is thy demand permission replied hereward to go to the duke of bouillons encampment and entreat his presence in the lists to witness this extraordinary combat that he may return with his crusading madmen said the emperor and sack constantinople under pretence of doing justice to his confederates this varangian is at least speaking thy mind openly no by heavens said hereward suddenly the duke of bouillon shall come with no more knights than may be a reasonable guard should treachery be offered to the countess of paris well even in this said the emperor will i be conformable and if thou edward betrayest my trust think that thou forfeitest all that my friendship has promised and dost incur besides the damnation that is due to the traitor who betrays with a kiss for thy reward noble sir answered the varangian i hereby renounce all claim to it when the diadem is once more firmly fixed upon thy brow and the sceptre in thy hand if i am then alive if my poor services should deserve so much i will petition thee for the means of leaving this court and returning to the distant island in which i was born meanwhile think me not unfaithful because i have for a time the means of being so with effect your imperial highness shall learn that hereward is as true as is your right hand to your left so saying he took his leave with a profound obeisance the emperor gazed after him with a countenance in which doubt was mingled with admiration i have trusted him he said with all he asked and with the power of ruining me entirely if such be his purpose he has but to breathe a whisper and the whole mad crew of crusaders kept in humour at the expense of so much current falsehood and so much more gold will return with fire and sword to burn down constantinople and sow with salt the place where it stood i have done what i had resolved never to do i have ventured kingdom and life on the faith of a man born of woman how often have i said nay sworn that i would not hazard myself on such peril and yet step by step i have done so i cannot tell there is in that mans looks and words a good faith which overwhelms me and what is almost incredible my belief in him has increased in proportion to his showing me how slight my power was over him i threw like the wily angler every bait i could devise and some of them such as a king would scarcely have disdained to none of these would he rise but yet he gorges i may say the bare hook and enters upon my service without a shadow of selfinterest can this be double distilled treachery or can it be what men call disinterestedness if i thought him false the moment is not yet past he has not yet crossed the bridge he has not passed the guards of the palace who have no hesitation and know no disobedience but no i were then alone in the land and without a friend or confidant i hear the sound of the outer gate unclose the sense of danger certainly renders my ears more acute than usual it shuts again the die is cast he is at liberty and alexius comnenus must stand or fall according to the uncertain faith of a mercenary varangian he clapt his hands a slave appeared of whom he demanded wine he drank and his heart was cheered within him i am decided he said and will abide with resolution the cast of the throw for good or for evil so saying he retired to his apartment and was not again seen during that night chapter the twentysecond and aye as if for death some lonely trumpet peald campbell the varangian his head agitated with the weighty matters which imposed on him stopt from time to time as he journeyed through the moonlight streets to arrest passing ideas as they shot through his mind and consider them with accuracy in all their bearings his thoughts were such as animated or alarmed him alternately each followed by a confused throng of accompaniments which it suggested and banished again in its turn by reflections of another description it was one of those conjunctures when the minds of ordinary men feel themselves unable to support a burden which is suddenly flung upon them and when on the contrary those of uncommon fortitude and that best of heavens gifts good sense founded on presence of mind feel their talents awakened and regulated for the occasion like a good steed under the management of a rider of courage and experience as he stood in one of those fits of reverie which repeatedly during that night arrested his stern military march hereward thought that his ear caught the note of a distant trumpet this surprised him a trumpet blown at that late hour and in the streets of constantinople argued something extraordinary for as all military movements were the subject of special ordinance the etiquette of the night could hardly have been transgressed without some great cause the question was what that cause could be had the insurrection broken out unexpectedly and in a different manner from what the conspirators proposed to themselves if so his meeting with his plighted bride after so many years absence was but a delusive preface to their separating for ever or had the crusaders a race of men upon whose motions it was difficult to calculate suddenly taken arms and returned from the opposite shore to surprise the city this might very possibly be the case so numerous had been the different causes of complaint afforded to the crusaders that when they were now for the first time assembled into one body and had heard the stories which they could reciprocally tell concerning the perfidy of the greeks nothing was so likely so natural even perhaps so justifiable as that they should study revenge but the sound rather resembled a point of war regularly blown than the tumultuous blare of buglehorns and trumpets the accompaniments at once and the annunciation of a taken town in which the horrid circumstances of storm had not yet given place to such stern peace as the victors weariness of slaughter and rapine allows at length to the wretched inhabitants whatever it was it was necessary that hereward should learn its purport and therefore he made his way into a broad street near the barracks from which the sound seemed to come to which point indeed his way was directed for other reasons the inhabitants of that quarter of the town did not appear violently startled by this military signal the moonlight slept on the street crossed by the gigantic shadowy towers of sancta sophia no human being appeared in the streets and such as for an instant looked from their doors or from their lattices seemed to have their curiosity quickly satisfied for they withdrew their heads and secured the opening through which they had peeped hereward could not help remembering the traditions which were recounted by the fathers of his tribe in the deep woods of hampshire and which spoke of invisible huntsmen who were heard to follow with viewless horses and hounds the unseen chase through the depths of the forests of germany such it seemed were the sounds with which these haunted woods were wont to ring while the wild chase was up and with such apparent terror did the hearers listen to their clamour fie he said as he suppressed within him a tendency to the same superstitious fears do such childish fancies belong to a man trusted with so much and from whom so much is expected he paced down the street therefore with his battleaxe over his shoulder and the first person whom he saw venturing to look out of his door he questioned concerning the cause of this military music at such an unaccustomed hour i cannot tell so please you my lord said the citizen unwilling it appeared to remain in the open air or to enter into conversation and greatly disposed to decline further questioning this was the political citizen of constantinople whom we met with at the beginning of this history and who hastily stepping into his habitation eschewed all further conversation the wrestler stephanos showed himself at the next door which was garlanded with oak and ivy leaves in honour of some recent victory he stood unshrinking partly encouraged by the consciousness of personal strength and partly by a rugged surliness of temper which is often mistaken among persons of this kind for real courage his admirer and flatterer lysimachus kept himself ensconced behind his ample shoulders as hereward passed he put the same question as he did to the former citizen know you the meaning of these trumpets sounding so late you should know best yourself answered stephanos doggedly for to judge by your axe and helmet they are your trumpets and not ours which disturb honest men in their first sleep varlet answered the varangian with an emphasis which made the prizer start but when that trumpet sounds it is no time for a soldier to punish insolence as it deserves the greek started back and bolted into his house nearly overthrowing in the speed of his retreat the artist lysimachus who was listening to what passed hereward passed on to the barracks where the military music had seemed to halt but on the varangian crossing the threshold of the ample courtyard it broke forth again with a tremendous burst whose clangour almost stunned him though well accustomed to the sounds what is the meaning of this engelbrecht he said to the varangian sentinel who paced axe in hand before the entrance the proclamation of a challenge and combat answered engelbrecht strange things towards comrade the frantic crusaders have bit the grecians and infected them with their humour of tilting as they say dogs do each other with madness hereward made no reply to the sentinels speech but pressed forward into a knot of his fellowsoldiers who were assembled in the court halfarmed or more properly in total disarray as just arisen from their beds and huddled around the trumpets of their corps which were drawn out in full pomp he of the gigantic instrument whose duty it was to intimate the express commands of the emperor was not wanting in his place and the musicians were supported by a band of the varangians in arms headed by achilles tatius himself hereward could also notice on approaching nearer as his comrades made way for him that six of the imperial heralds were on duty on this occasion four of these two acting at the same time had already made proclamation which was to be repeated for the third time by the two last as was the usual fashion in constantinople with imperial mandates of great consequence achilles tatius the moment he saw his confidant made him a sign which hereward understood as conveying a desire to speak with him after the proclamation was over the herald after the flourish of trumpets was finished commenced in these words by the authority of the resplendent and divine prince alexius comnenus emperor of the most holy roman empire his imperial majesty desires it to be made known to all and sundry the subjects of his empire whatever their race of blood may be or at whatever shrine of divinity they happen to bend know ye therefore that upon the second day after this is dated our beloved soninlaw the much esteemed caesar hath taken upon him to do battle with our sworn enemy robert count of paris on account of his insolent conduct by presuming publicly to occupy our royal seat and no less by breaking in our imperial presence those curious specimens of art ornamenting our throne called by tradition the lions of solomon and that there may not remain a man in europe who shall dare to say that the grecians are behind other parts of the world in any of the manly exercises which christian nations use the said noble enemies renouncing all assistance from falsehood from spells or from magic shall debate this quarrel in three courses with grinded spears and three passages of arms with sharpened swords the field to be at the judgment of the honourable emperor and to be decided at his most gracious and unerring pleasure and so god show the right another formidable flourish of the trumpets concluded the ceremony achilles then dismissed the attendant troops as well as the heralds and musicians to their respective quarters and having got hereward close to his side enquired of him whether he had learned any thing of the prisoner robert count of paris nothing said the varangian save the tidings your proclamation contains you think then said achilles that the count has been a party to it he ought to have been so answered the varangian i know no one but himself entitled to take burden for his appearance in the lists why look you said the acolyte my most excellent though blunt witted hereward this caesar of ours hath had the extravagance to venture his tender wit in comparison to that of achilles tatius he stands upon his honour too this ineffable fool and is displeased with the idea of being supposed either to challenge a woman or to receive a challenge at her hand he has substituted therefore the name of the lord instead of the lady if the count fail to appear the caesar walks forward challenger and successful combatant at a cheap rate since no one has encountered him and claims that the lady should be delivered up to him as a captive of his dreaded bow and spear this will be the signal for a general tumult in which if the emperor be not slain on the spot he will be conveyed to the dungeon of his own blacquernal there to endure the doom which his cruelty has inflicted upon so many others but said the varangian but but but said his officer but thou art a fool canst thou not see that this gallant caesar is willing to avoid the risk of encountering with this lady while he earnestly desires to be supposed willing to meet her husband it is our business to fix the combat in such a shape as to bring all who are prepared for insurrection together in arms to play their parts do thou only see that our trusty friends are placed near to the emperors person and in such a manner as to keep from him the officious and meddling portion of guards who may be disposed to assist him and whether the caesar fights a combat with lord or lady or whether there be any combat at all or not the revolution shall be accomplished and the tatii shall replace the comneni upon the imperial throne of constantinople go my trusty hereward thou wilt not forget that the signal word of the insurrection is ursel who lives in the affections of the people although his body it is said has long lain a corpse in the dungeons of the blacquernal what was this ursel said hereward of whom i hear men talk so variously a competitor for the crown with alexius comnenus good brave and honest but overpowered by the cunning rather than the skill or bravery of his foe he died as i believe in the blacquernal though when or how there are few that can say but up and be doing my hereward speak encouragement to the varangians interest whomsoever thou canst to join us of the immortals as they are called and of the discontented citizens enough are prepared to fill up the cry and follow in the wake of those on whom we must rely as the beginners of the enterprise no longer shall alexiuss cunning in avoiding popular assemblies avail to protect him he cannot with regard to his honour avoid being present at a combat to be fought beneath his own eye and mercury be praised for the eloquence which inspired him after some hesitation to determine for the proclamation you have seen him then this evening said the varangian seen him unquestionably answered the acolyte had i ordered these trumpets to be sounded without his knowledge the blast had blown the head from my shoulders i had wellnigh met you at the palace said hereward while his heart throbbed almost as high as if he had actually had such a dangerous encounter i heard something of it said achilles that you came to take the parting orders of him who now acts the sovereign surely had i seen you there with that steadfast open seemingly honest countenance cheating the wily greek by very dint of bluntness i had not forborne laughing at the contrast between that and the thoughts of thy heart god alone said hereward knows the thoughts of our hearts but i take him to witness that i am faithful to my promise and will discharge the task intrusted to me bravo mine honest anglosaxon said achilles i pray thee to call my slaves to unarm me and when thou thyself doffest those weapons of an ordinary lifeguardsman tell them they never shall above twice more enclose the limbs of one for whom fate has much more fitting garments in store hereward dared not intrust his voice with an answer to so critical a speech he bowed profoundly and retired to his own quarters in the building upon entering the apartment he was immediately saluted by the voice of count robert in joyful accents not suppressed by the fear of making himself heard though prudence should have made that uppermost in his mind hast thou heard it my dear hereward he said hast thou heard the proclamation by which this greek antelope hath defied me to tilting with grinded spears and fighting three passages of arms with sharpened swords yet there is something strange too that he should not think it safer to hold my lady to the encounter he may think perhaps that the crusaders would not permit such a battle to be fought but by our lady of the broken lances he little knows that the men of the west hold their ladies character for courage as jealously as they do their own this whole night have i been considering in what armour i shall clothe me what shift i shall make for a steed and whether i shall not honour him sufficiently by using tranchefer as my only weapon against his whole armour offensive and defensive i shall take care however said hereward that thou art better provided in case of need thou knowest not the greeks chapter the twentythird the varangian did not leave the count of paris until the latter had in his hands his signetring semee as the heralds express it with lances splintered and bearing the proud motto mine yet unscathed provided with this symbol of confidence it was now his business to take order for communicating the approaching solemnity to the leader of the crusading army and demanding from him in the name of robert of paris and the lady brenhilda such a detachment of western cavaliers as might ensure strict observance of honour and honesty in the arrangement of the lists and during the progress of the combat the duties imposed on hereward were such as to render it impossible for him to proceed personally to the camp of godfrey and though there were many of the varangians in whose fidelity he could have trusted he knew of none among those under his immediate command whose intelligence on so novel an occasion might be entirely depended on in this perplexity he strolled perhaps without well knowing why to the gardens of agelastes where fortune once more produced him an interview with bertha no sooner had hereward made her aware of his difficulty than the faithful bowermaidens resolution was taken i see said she that the peril of this part of the adventure must rest with me and wherefore should it not my mistress in the bosom of prosperity offered herself to go forth into the wide world for my sake i will for hers go to the camp of this frankish lord he is an honourable man and a pious christian and his followers are faithful pilgrims a woman can have nothing to fear who goes to such men upon such an errand the varangian however was too well acquainted with the manners of camps to permit the fair bertha to go alone he provided therefore for her safeguard a trusty old soldier bound to his person by long kindness and confidence and having thoroughly possessed her of the particulars of the message she was to deliver and desired her to be in readiness without the enclosure at peep of dawn returned once more to his barracks with the earliest light hereward was again at the spot where he had parted overnight with bertha accompanied by the honest soldier to whose care he meant to confide her in a short time he had seen them safely on board of a ferryboat lying in the harbour the master of which readily admitted them after some examination of their license to pass to scutari which was forged in the name of the acolyte as authorised by that foul conspirator and which agreed with the appearance of old osmund and his young charge the morning was lovely and erelong the town of scutari opened on the view of the travellers glittering as now with a variety of architecture which though it might be termed fantastical could not be denied the praise of beauty these buildings rose boldly out of a thick grove of cypresses and other huge trees the larger probably as they were respected for filling the cemeteries and being the guardians of the dead at the period we mention another circumstance no less striking than beautiful rendered doubly interesting a scene which must have been at all times greatly so a large portion of that miscellaneous army which came to regain the holy places of palestine and the blessed sepulchre itself from the infidels had established themselves in a camp within a mile or thereabouts of scutari although therefore the crusaders were destitute in a great measure of the use of tents the army excepting the pavilions of some leaders of high rank had constructed for themselves temporary huts not unpleasing to the eye being decorated with leaves and flowers while the tall pennons and banners that floated over them with various devices showed that the flower of europe were assembled at that place a loud and varied murmur resembling that of a thronged hive floated from the camp of the crusaders to the neighbouring town of scutari and every now and then the deep tone was broken by some shriller sound the note of some musical instrument or the treble scream of some child or female in fear or in gaiety the party at length landed in safety and as they approached one of the gates of the camp there sallied forth a brisk array of gallant cavaliers pages and squires exercising their masters horses or their own from the noise they made conversing at the very top of their voices galloping curvetting and prancing their palfreys it seemed as if their early discipline had called them to exercise ere the fumes of last nights revel were thoroughly dissipated by repose so soon as they saw bertha and her party they approached them with cries which marked their country was italy alerta alerta roba de guadagno cameradi footnote that is take heed take heed there is booty comrades they gathered round the anglosaxon maiden and her companions repeating their cries in a manner which made bertha tremble their general demand was what was her business in their camp i would to the generalinchief cavaliers answered bertha having a secret message to his ear for whose ear said a leader of the party a handsome youth of about eighteen years of age who seemed either to have a sounder brain than his fellows or to have overflowed it with less wine which of our leaders do you come hither to see he demanded godfrey of bouillon indeed said the page who had spoken first can nothing of less consequence serve thy turn take a look amongst us young are we all and reasonably wealthy my lord of bouillon is old and if he has any sequins he is not like to lavish them in this way still i have a token to godfrey of bouillon answered bertha an assured one and he will little thank any who obstructs my free passage to him and therewithal showing a little case in which the signet of the count of paris was enclosed i will trust it in your hands she said if you promise not to open it but to give me free access to the noble leader of the crusaders i will said the youth and if such be the dukes pleasure thou shalt be admitted to him ernest the apulian thy dainty italian wit is caught in a trap said one of his companions thou art an ultramontane fool polydore returned ernest there may be more in this than either thy wit or mine is able to fathom this maiden and one of her attendants wear a dress belonging to the varangian imperial guard they have perhaps been intrusted with a message from the emperor and it is not irreconcilable with alexiuss politics to send it through such messengers as these let us therefore convey them in all honour to the generals tent with all my heart said polydore a blueeyed wench is a pretty thing but i like not the sauce of the campmarshal nor his taste in attiring men who gave way to temptation footnote persons among the crusaders found guilty of certain offences did penance in a dress of tar and feathers though it is supposed a punishment of modern invention yet ere i prove a fool like my companion i would ask who or what this pretty maiden is who comes to put noble princes and holy pilgrims in mind that they have in their time had the follies of men bertha advanced and whispered in the ear of ernest meantime joke followed jest among polydore and the rest of the gay youths in riotous and ribald succession which however characteristic of the rude speakers may as well be omitted here their effect was to shake in some degree the fortitude of the saxon maiden who had some difficulty in mustering courage to address them as you have mothers gentlemen she said as you have fair sisters whom you would protect from dishonour with your best blood as you love and honour those holy places which you are sworn to free from the infidel enemy have compassion on me that you may merit success in your undertaking fear nothing maiden said ernest i will be your protector and you my comrades be ruled by me i have during your brawling taken a view though somewhat against my promise of the pledge which she bears and if she who presents it is affronted or maltreated be assured godfrey of bouillon will severely avenge the wrong done her nay comrade if thou canst warrant us so much said polydore i will myself be most anxious to conduct the young woman in honour and safety to sir godfreys tent the princes said ernest must be nigh meeting there in council what i have said i will warrant and uphold with hand and life more i might guess but i conclude this sensible young maiden can speak for herself now heaven bless thee gallant squire said bertha and make thee alike brave and fortunate embarrass yourself no farther about me than to deliver me safe to your leader godfrey we spend time said ernest springing from his horse you are no soft eastern fair maid and i presume you will find yourself under no difficulty in managing a quiet horse not the least said bertha as wrapping herself in her cassock she sprung from the ground and alighted upon the spirited palfrey as a linnet stoops upon a rosebush and now sir as my business really brooks no delay i will be indebted to you to show me instantly to the tent of duke godfrey of bouillon by availing herself of this courtesy of the young apulian bertha imprudently separated herself from the old varangian but the intentions of the youth were honourable and he conducted her through the tents and huts to the pavilion of the celebrated generalinchief of the crusade here he said you must tarry for a space under the guardianship of my companions for two or three of the pages had accompanied them out of curiosity to see the issue and i will take the commands of the duke of bouillon upon the subject to this nothing could be objected and bertha had nothing better to do than to admire the outside of the tent which in one of alexiuss fits of generosity and munificence had been presented by the greek emperor to the chief of the franks it was raised upon tall spearshaped poles which had the semblance of gold its curtains were of thick stuff manufactured of silk cotton and gold thread the warders who stood round were at least during the time that the council was held old grave men the personal squires of the body most of them of the sovereigns who had taken the cross and who could therefore be trusted as a guard over the assembly without danger of their blabbing what they might overhear their appearance was serious and considerate and they looked like men who had taken upon them the cross not as an idle adventure of arms but as a purpose of the most solemn and serious nature one of these stopt the italian and demanded what business authorized him to press forward into the council of the crusaders who were already taking their seats the page answered by giving his name ernest of otranto page of prince tancred and stated that he announced a young woman who bore a token to the duke of bouillon adding that it was accompanied by a message for his own ear bertha meantime laid aside her mantle or upper garment and disposed the rest of her dress according to the anglosaxon costume she had hardly completed this task before the page of prince tancred returned to conduct her into the presence of the council of the crusade she followed his signal while the other young men who had accompanied her wondering at the apparent ease with which she gained admittance drew back to a respectful distance from the tent and there canvassed the singularity of their mornings adventure in the meanwhile the ambassadress herself entered the council chamber exhibiting an agreeable mixture of shamefacedness and reserve together with a bold determination to do her duty at all events there were about fifteen of the principal crusaders assembled in council with their chieftain godfrey he himself was a tall strong man arrived at that period of life in which men are supposed to have lost none of their resolution while they have acquired a wisdom and circumspection unknown to their earlier years the countenance of godfrey bespoke both prudence and boldness and resembled his hair where a few threads of silver were already mingled with his raven locks tancred the noblest knight of the christian chivalry sat at no great distance from him with hugh earl of vermandois generally called the great count the selfish and wily bohemond the powerful raymond of provence and others of the principal crusaders all more or less completely sheathed in armour bertha did not allow her courage to be broken down but advancing with a timid grace towards godfrey she placed in his hands the signet which had been restored to her by the young page and after a deep obeisance spoke these words godfrey count of bouillon duke of lorraine the lower chief of the holy enterprise called the crusade and you his gallant comrades peers and companions by whatever titles you may be honoured i an humble maiden of england daughter of engelred originally a franklin of hampshire and since chieftain of the foresters or free anglosaxons under the command of the celebrated edric do claim what credence is due to the bearer of the true pledge which i put into your hand on the part of one not the least considerable of your own body count robert of paris our most honourable confederate said godfrey looking at the ring most of you my lords must i think know this signet a field sown with the fragments of many splintered lances the signet was handed from one of the assembly to another and generally recognised when godfrey had signified so much the maiden resumed her message to all true crusaders therefore comrades of godfrey of bouillon and especially to the duke himself to all i say excepting bohemond of tarentum whom he counts unworthy of his notice hah me unworthy of his notice said bohemond what mean you by that damsel but the count of paris shall answer it to me under your favour sir bohemond said godfrey no our articles renounce the sending of challenges among ourselves and the matter if not dropt betwixt the parties must be referred to the voice of this honourable council i think i guess the business now my lord said bohemond the count of paris is disposed to turn and tear me because i offered him good counsel on the evening before we left constantinople when he neglected to accept or be guided by it it will be the more easily explained when we have heard his message said godfrey speak forth lord robert of pariss charge damsel that we may take some order with that which now seems a perplexed business bertha resumed her message and having briefly narrated the recent events thus concluded the battle is to be done tomorrow about two hours after daybreak and the count entreats of the noble duke of lorraine that he will permit some fifty of the lances of france to attend the deed of arms and secure that fair and honourable conduct which he has otherwise some doubts of receiving at the hands of his adversary or if any young and gallant knight should of his own free will wish to view the said combat the count will feel his presence as an honour always he desires that the name of such knight be numbered carefully with the armed crusaders who shall attend in the lists and that the whole shall be limited by duke godfreys own inspection to fifty lances only which are enough to obtain the protection required while more would be considered as a preparation for aggression upon the grecians and occasion the revival of disputes which are now happily at rest bertha had no sooner finished delivering her manifesto and made with great grace her obeisance to the council than a sort of whisper took place in the assembly which soon assumed a more lively tone their solemn vow not to turn their back upon palestine now that they had set their hands to the plough was strongly urged by some of the elder knights of the council and two or three high prelates who had by this time entered to take share in the deliberations the young knights on the other hand were fired with indignation on hearing the manner in which their comrade had been trepanned and few of them could think of missing a combat in the lists in a country in which such sights were so rare and where one was to be fought so near them godfrey rested his brow on his hand and seemed in great perplexity to break with the greeks after having suffered so many injuries in order to maintain the advantage of keeping the peace with them seemed very impolitic and a sacrifice of all he had obtained by a long course of painful forbearance towards alexius comnenus on the other hand he was bound as a man of honour to resent the injury offered to count robert of paris whose reckless spirit of chivalry made him the darling of the army it was the cause too of a beautiful lady and a brave one every knight in the host would think himself bound by his vow to hasten to her defence when godfrey spoke it was to complain of the difficulty of the determination and the short time there was to consider the case with submission to my lord duke of lorraine said tancred i was a knight ere i was a crusader and took on me the vows of chivalry ere i placed this blessed sign upon my shoulder the vow first made must be first discharged i will therefore do penance for neglecting for a space the obligations of the second vow while i observe that which recalls me to the first duty of knighthood the relief of a distressed lady in the hands of men whose conduct towards her and towards this host in every respect entitles me to call them treacherous faitours if my kinsman tancred said bohemond will check his impetuosity and you my lords will listen as you have sometimes deigned to do to my advice i think i can direct you how to keep clear of any breach of your oath and yet fully to relieve our distressed fellowpilgrims i see some suspicious looks are cast towards me which are caused perhaps by the churlish manner in which this violent and in this case almost insane young warrior has protested against receiving my assistance my great offence is the having given him warning by precept and example of the treachery which was about to be practised against him and instructed him to use forbearance and temperance my warning he altogether contemned my example he neglected to follow and fell into the snare which was spread as it were before his very eyes yet the count of paris in rashly contemning me has acted only from a temper which misfortune and disappointment have rendered irrational and frantic i am so far from bearing him illwill that with your lordships permission and that of the present council i will haste to the place of rendezvous with fifty lances making up the retinue which attends upon each to at least ten men which will make the stipulated auxiliary force equal to five hundred and with these i can have little doubt of rescuing the count and his lady nobly proposed said the duke of bouillon and with a charitable forgiveness of injuries which becomes our christian expedition but thou hast forgot the main difficulty brother bohemond that we are sworn never to turn back upon the sacred journey if we can elude that oath upon the present occasion said bohemond it becomes our duty to do so are we such bad horsemen or are our steeds so awkward that we cannot rein them back from this to the landingplace at scutari we can get them on shipboard in the same retrograde manner and when we arrive in europe where our vow binds us no longer the count and countess of paris are rescued and our vow remains entire in the chancery of heaven a general shout arose long life to the gallant bohemond shame to us if we do not fly to the assistance of so valiant a knight and a lady so lovely since we can do so without breach of our vow the question said godfrey appears to me to be eluded rather than solved yet such evasions have been admitted by the most learned and scrupulous clerks nor do i hesitate to admit of bohemonds expedient any more than if the enemy had attacked our rear which might have occasioned our countermarching to be a case of absolute necessity some there were in the assembly particularly the churchmen inclined to think that the oath by which the crusaders had solemnly bound themselves ought to be as literally obeyed but peter the hermit who had a place in the council and possessed great weight declared it as his opinion that since the precise observance of their vow would tend to diminish the forces of the crusade it was in fact unlawful and should not be kept according to the literal meaning if by a fair construction it could be eluded he offered himself to back the animal which he bestrode that is his ass and though he was diverted from showing this example by the remonstrances of godfrey of bouillon who was afraid of his becoming a scandal in the eyes of the heathen yet he so prevailed by his arguments that the knights far from scrupling to countermarch eagerly contended which should have the honour of making one of the party which should retrograde to constantinople see the combat and bring back to the host in safety the valorous count of paris of whose victory no one doubted and his amazonian countess this emulation was also put an end to by the authority of godfrey who himself selected the fifty knights who were to compose the party they were chosen from different nations and the command of the whole was given to young tancred of otranto notwithstanding the claim of bohemond godfrey detained the latter under the pretext that his knowledge of the country and people was absolutely necessary to enable the council to form the plan of the campaign in syria but in reality he dreaded the selfishness of a man of great ingenuity as well as military skill who finding himself in a separate command might be tempted should opportunities arise to enlarge his own power and dominion at the expense of the pious purposes of the crusade in general the younger men of the expedition were chiefly anxious to procure such horses as had been thoroughly trained and could go through with ease and temper the manoeuvre of equitation by which it was designed to render legitimate the movement which they had recourse to the selection was at length made and the detachment ordered to draw up in the rear or upon the eastward line of the christian encampment in the meanwhile godfrey charged bertha with a message for the count of paris in which slightly censuring him for not observing more caution in his intercourse with the greeks he informed him that he had sent a detachment of fifty lances with the corresponding squires pages menatarms and crossbows five hundred in number commanded by the valiant tancred to his assistance the duke also informed him that he had added a suit of armour of the best temper milan could afford together with a trusty warhorse which he entreated him to use upon the field of battle for bertha had not omitted to intimate count roberts want of the means of knightly equipment the horse was brought before the pavilion accordingly completely barbed or armed in steel and laden with armour for the knights body godfrey himself put the bridle into berthas hand thou needst not fear to trust thyself with this steed he is as gentle and docile as he is fleet and brave place thyself on his back and take heed thou stir not from the side of the noble prince tancred of otranto who will be the faithful defender of a maiden that has this day shown dexterity courage and fidelity bertha bowed low as her cheeks glowed at praise from one whose talents and worth were in such general esteem as to have raised him to the distinguished situation of leader of a host which numbered in it the bravest and most distinguished captains of christendom who are yon two persons continued godfrey speaking of the companions of bertha whom he saw in the distance before the tent the one answered the damsel is the master of the ferryboat which brought me over and the other an old varangian who came hither as my protector as they may come to employ their eyes here and their tongues on the opposite side returned the general of the crusaders i do not think it prudent to let them accompany you they shall remain here for some short time the citizens of scutari will not comprehend for some space what our intention is and i could wish prince tancred and his attendants to be the first to announce their own arrival bertha accordingly intimated the pleasure of the french general to the parties without naming his motives when the ferryman began to exclaim on the hardship of intercepting him in his trade and osmund to complain of being detained from his duties but bertha by the orders of godfrey left them with the assurance that they would be soon at liberty finding themselves thus abandoned each applied himself to his favourite amusement the ferryman occupied himself in staring about at all that was new and osmund having in the meantime accepted an offer of breakfast from some of the domestics was presently engaged with a flask of such red wine as would have reconciled him to a worse lot than that which he at present experienced the detachment of tancred fifty spears and their armed retinue which amounted fully to five hundred men after having taken a short and hasty refreshment were in arms and mounted before the sultry hour of noon after some manoeuvres of which the greeks of scutari whose curiosity was awakened by the preparations of the detachment were at a loss to comprehend the purpose they formed into a single column having four men in front when the horses were in this position the whole riders at once began to rein back the action was one to which both the cavaliers and their horses were well accustomed nor did it at first afford much surprise to the spectators but when the same retrograde evolution was continued and the body of crusaders seemed about to enter the town of scutari in so extraordinary a fashion some idea of the truth began to occupy the citizens the cry at length was general when tancred and a few others whose horses were unusually welltrained arrived at the port and possessed themselves of a galley into which they led their horses and disregarding all opposition from the imperial officers of the haven pushed the vessel off from the shore other cavaliers did not accomplish their purpose so easily the riders or the horses were less accustomed to continue in the constrained pace for such a considerable length of time so that many of the knights having retrograded for one or two hundred yards thought their vow was sufficiently observed by having so far deferred to it and riding in the ordinary manner into the town seized without farther ceremony on some vessels which notwithstanding the orders of the greek emperor had been allowed to remain on the asiatic side of the strait some less able horsemen met with various accidents for though it was a proverb of the time that nothing was so bold as a blind horse yet from this mode of equitation where neither horse nor rider saw the way he was going some steeds were overthrown others backed upon dangerous obstacles and the bones of the cavaliers themselves suffered much more than would have been the case in an ordinary march those horsemen also who met with falls incurred the danger of being slain by the greeks had not godfrey surmounting his religious scruples despatched a squadron to extricate them a task which they performed with great ease the greater part of tancreds followers succeeded in embarking as was intended nor was there more than a score or two finally amissing to accomplish their voyage however even the prince of otranto himself and most of his followers were obliged to betake themselves to the unknightly labours of the oar this they found extremely difficult as well from the state both of the tide and the wind as from the want of practice at the exercise godfrey in person viewed their progress anxiously from a neighbouring height and perceived with regret the difficulty which they found in making their way which was still more increased by the necessity for their keeping in a body and waiting for the slowest and worst manned vessels which considerably detained those that were more expeditious they made some progress however nor had the commanderinchief the least doubt that before sunset they would safely reach the opposite side of the strait he retired at length from his post of observation having placed a careful sentinel in his stead with directions to bring him word the instant that the detachment reached the opposite shore this the soldier could easily discern by the eye if it was daylight at the time if on the contrary it was night before they could arrive the prince of otranto had orders to show certain lights which in case of their meeting resistance from the greeks should be arranged in a peculiar manner so as to indicate danger godfrey then explained to the greek authorities of scutari whom he summoned before him the necessity there was that he should keep in readiness such vessels as could be procured with which in case of need he was determined to transport a strong division from his army to support those who had gone before he then rode back to his camp the confused murmurs of which rendered more noisy by the various discussions concerning the events of the day rolled off from the numerous host of the crusaders and mingled with the hoarse sound of the manybillowed hellespont chapter the twenthfourth all is prepared the chambers of the mine are crammd with the combustible which harmless while yet unkindled as the sable sand needs but a spark to change its nature so that he who wakes it from its slumbrous mood dreads scarce the explosion less than he who knows that tis his towers which meet its fury anonymous when the sky is darkened suddenly and the atmosphere grows thick and stifling the lower ranks of creation entertain the ominous sense of a coming tempest the birds fly to the thickets the wild creatures retreat to the closest covers which their instinct gives them the habit of frequenting and domestic animals show their apprehension of the approaching thunderstorm by singular actions and movements inferring fear and disturbance it seems that human nature when its original habits are cultivated and attended to possesses on similar occasions something of that prescient foreboding which announces the approaching tempest to the inferior ranks of creation the cultivation of our intellectual powers goes perhaps too far when it teaches us entirely to suppress and disregard those natural feelings which were originally designed as sentinels by which nature warned us of impending danger something of the kind however still remains and that species of feeling which announces to us sorrowful or alarming tidings may be said like the prophecies of the weird sisters to come over us like a sudden cloud during the fatal day which was to precede the combat of the caesar with the count of paris there were current through the city of constantinople the most contradictory and at the same time the most terrific reports privy conspiracy it was alleged was on the very eve of breaking out open war it was reported by others was about to shake her banners over the devoted city the precise cause was not agreed upon any more than the nature of the enemy some said that the barbarians from the borders of thracia the hungarians as they were termed and the comani were on their march from the frontiers to surprise the city another report stated that the turks who during this period were established in asia had resolved to prevent the threatened attack of the crusaders upon palestine by surprising not only the western pilgrims but the christians of the east by one of their innumerable invasions executed with their characteristic rapidity another report approaching more near to the truth declared that the crusaders themselves having discovered their various causes of complaint against alexius comnenus had resolved to march back their united forces to the capital with a view of dethroning or chastising him and the citizens were dreadfully alarmed for the consequences of the resentment of men so fierce in their habits and so strange in their manners in short although they did not all agree on the precise cause of danger it was yet generally allowed that something of a dreadful kind was impending which appeared to be in a certain degree confirmed by the motions that were taking place among the troops the varangians as well as the immortals were gradually assembled and placed in occupation of the strongest parts of the city until at length the fleet of galleys rowboats and transports occupied by tancred and his party were observed to put themselves in motion from scutari and attempt to gain such a height in the narrow sea as upon the turn of the tide should transport them to the port of the capital alexius comnenus was himself struck at this unexpected movement on the part of the crusaders yet after some conversation with hereward on whom he had determined to repose his confidence and had now gone too far to retreat he became reassured the more especially by the limited size of the detachment which seemed to meditate so bold a measure as an attack upon his capital to those around him he said with carelessness that it was hardly to be supposed that a trumpet could blow to the charge within hearing of the crusaders camp without some out of so many knights coming forth to see the cause and the issue of the conflict the conspirators also had their secret fears when the little armament of tancred had been seen on the straits agelastes mounted a mule and went to the shore of the sea at the place now called galata he met berthas old ferryman whom godfrey had set at liberty partly in contempt and partly that the report he was likely to make might serve to amuse the conspirators in the city closely examined by agelastes he confessed that the present detachment so far as he understood was despatched at the instance of bohemond and was under the command of his kinsman tancred whose wellknown banner was floating from the headmost vessel this gave courage to agelastes who in the course of his intrigues had opened a private communication with the wily and ever mercenary prince of antioch the object of the philosopher had been to obtain from bohemond a body of his followers to cooperate in the intended conspiracy and fortify the party of insurgents it is true that bohemond had returned no answer but the account now given by the ferryman and the sight of tancred the kinsman of bohemonds banner displayed on the straits satisfied the philosopher that his offers his presents and his promises had gained to his side the avaricious italian and that this band had been selected by bohemond and were coming to act in his favour as agelastes turned to go off he almost jostled a person as much muffled up and apparently as unwilling to be known as the philosopher himself alexius comnenus however for it was the emperor himself knew agelastes though rather from his stature and gestures than his countenance and could not forbear whispering in his ear as he passed the wellknown lines to which the pretended sages various acquisitions gave some degree of point grammaticus rhetor geometres pictor aliptes augur schoenobates medicus magus omnia novit graeculus esuriens in caelum jusseris ibit footnote the lines of juvenal imitated by johnson in his london all sciences a fasting monsieur knows and bid him go to hell to hell he goes agelastes first started at the unexpected sound of the emperors voice yet immediately recovered presence of mind the want of which had made him suspect himself betrayed and without taking notice of the rank of the person to whom he spoke he answered by a quotation which should return the alarm he had received the speech that suggested itself was said to be that which the phantom of cleonice dinned into the ears of the tyrant who murdered her tu cole justitiam toque atque alios manet ultor footnote do thou cultivate justice for thee and for others there remains an avenger ovid met the sentence and the recollections which accompanied it thrilled through the heart of the emperor who walked on however without any notice or reply the vile conspirator he said had his associates around him otherwise he had not hazarded that threat or it may have been worse agelastes himself on the very brink of this world may have obtained that singular glance into futurity proper to that situation and perhaps speaks less from his own reflection than from a strange spirit of prescience which dictates his words have i then in earnest sinned so far in my imperial duty as to make it just to apply to me the warning used by the injured cleonice to her ravisher and murderer methinks i have not methinks that at less expense than that of a just severity i could ill have kept my seat in the high place where heaven has been pleased to seat me and where as a ruler i am bound to maintain my station methinks the sum of those who have experienced my clemency may be well numbered with that of such as have sustained the deserved punishments of their guilt but has that vengeance however deserved in itself been always taken in a legal or justifiable manner my conscience i doubt will hardly answer so home a question and where is the man had he the virtues of antoninus himself that can hold so high and responsible a place yet sustain such an interrogation as is implied in that sort of warning which i have received from this traitor tu cole justitiam we all need to use justice to others teque atque alios manet ultor we are all amenable to an avenging being i will see the patriarch instantly will i see him and by confessing my transgressions to the church i will by her plenary indulgence acquire the right of spending the last day of my reign in a consciousness of innocence or at least of pardon a state of mind rarely the lot of those whose lines have fallen in lofty places so saying he passed to the palace of zosimus the patriarch to whom he could unbosom himself with more safety because he had long considered agelastes as a private enemy to the church and a man attached to the ancient doctrines of heathenism in the councils of the state they were also opposed to each other nor did the emperor doubt that in communicating the secret of the conspiracy to the patriarch he was sure to attain a loyal and firm supporter in the defence which he proposed to himself he therefore gave a signal by a low whistle and a confidential officer well mounted approached him who attended him in his ride though unostentatiously and at some distance in this manner therefore alexius comnenus proceeded to the palace of the patriarch with as much speed as was consistent with his purpose of avoiding to attract any particular notice as he passed through the street during the whole ride the warning of agelastes repeatedly occurred to him and his conscience reminded him of too many actions of his reign which could only be justified by necessity emphatically said to be the tyrants plea and which were of themselves deserving the dire vengeance so long delayed when he came in sight of the splendid towers which adorned the front of the patriarchal palace he turned aside from the lofty gates repaired to a narrow court and again giving his mule to his attendant he stopt before a postern whose low arch and humble architrave seemed to exclude the possibility of its leading to any place of importance on knocking however a priest of an inferior order opened the door who with a deep reverence received the emperor so soon as he had made himself known and conducted him into the interior of the palace demanding a secret interview with the patriarch alexius was then ushered into his private library where he was received by the aged priest with the deepest respect which the nature of his communication soon changed into horror and astonishment although alexius was supposed by many of his own court and particularly by some members of his own family to be little better than a hypocrite in his religious professions yet such severe observers were unjust in branding him with a name so odious he was indeed aware of the great support which he received from the good opinion of the clergy and to them he was willing to make sacrifices for the advantage of the church or of individual prelates who manifested fidelity to the crown but though on the one hand such sacrifices were rarely made by alexius without a view to temporal policy yet on the other he regarded them as recommended by his devotional feelings and took credit to himself for various grants and actions as dictated by sincere piety which in another aspect were the fruits of temporal policy his mode of looking on these measures was that of a person with oblique vision who sees an object in a different manner according to the point from which he chances to contemplate it the emperor placed his own errors of government before the patriarch in his confession giving due weight to every branch of morality as it occurred and stripping from them the lineaments and palliative circumstances which had in his own imagination lessened their guilt the patriarch heard to his astonishment the real thread of many a court intrigue which had borne a very different appearance till the emperors narrative either justified his conduct upon the occasion or left it totally unjustifiable upon the whole the balance was certainly more in favour of alexius than the patriarch had supposed likely in that more distant view he had taken of the intrigues of the court when as usual the ministers and the courtiers endeavoured to make up for the applause which they had given in council in the most blameable actions of the absolute monarch by elsewhere imputing to his motives greater guilt than really belonged to them many men who had fallen sacrifices it was supposed to the personal spleen or jealousy of the emperor appeared to have been in fact removed from life or from liberty because their enjoying either was inconsistent with the quiet of the state and the safety of the monarch zosimus also learned what he perhaps already suspected that amidst the profound silence of despotism which seemed to pervade the grecian empire it heaved frequently with convulsive throes which ever and anon made obvious the existence of a volcano under the surface thus while smaller delinquencies or avowed discontent with the imperial government seldom occurred and were severely punished when they did the deepest and most mortal conspiracies against the life and the authority of the emperor were cherished by those nearest to his person and he was often himself aware of them though it was not until they approached an explosion that he dared act upon his knowledge and punish the conspirators the whole treason of the caesar with his associates agelastes and achilles tatius was heard by the patriarch with wonder and astonishment and he was particularly surprised at the dexterity with which the emperor knowing the existence of so dangerous a conspiracy at home had been able to parry the danger from the crusaders occurring at the same moment in that respect said the emperor to whom indeed the churchman hinted his surprise i have been singularly unfortunate had i been secure of the forces of my own empire i might have taken one out of two manly and open courses with these frantic warriors of the west i might my reverend father have devoted the sums paid to bohemond and other of the more selfish among the crusaders to the honest and open support of the army of western christians and safely transported them to palestine without exposing them to the great loss which they are likely to sustain by the opposition of the infidels their success would have been in fact my own and a latin kingdom in palestine defended by its steelclad warriors would have been a safe and unexpugnable barrier of the empire against the saracens or if it was thought more expedient for the protection of the empire and the holy church over which you are ruler we might at once and by open force have defended the frontiers of our states against a host commanded by so many different and discording chiefs and advancing upon us with such equivocal intentions if the first swarm of these locusts under him whom they called walter the penniless was thinned by the hungarians and totally destroyed by the turks as the pyramids of bones on the frontiers of the country still keep in memory surely the united forces of the grecian empire would have had little difficulty in scattering this second flight though commanded by these godfreys bohemonds and tancreds the patriarch was silent for though he disliked or rather detested the crusaders as members of the latin church he yet thought it highly doubtful that in feats of battle they could have been met and overcome by the grecian forces at any rate said alexius rightly interpreting his silence if vanquished i had fallen under my shield as a greek emperor should nor had i been forced into these mean measures of attacking men by stealth and with forces disguised as infidels while the lives of the faithful soldiers of the empire who have fallen in obscure skirmishes had better both for them and me been lost bravely in their ranks avowedly fighting for their native emperor and their native country now and as the matter stands i shall be handed down to posterity as a wily tyrant who engaged his subjects in fatal feuds for the safety of his own obscure life patriarch these crimes rest not with me but with the rebels whose intrigues compelled me into such courses what reverend father will be my fate hereafter and in what light shall i descend to posterity the author of so many disasters for futurity said the patriarch your grace hath referred yourself to the holy church which hath power to bind and loose your means of propitiating her are ample and i have already indicated such as she may reasonably expect in consequence of your repentance and forgiveness they shall be granted replied the emperor in their fullest extent nor will i injure you in doubting their effect in the next world in this present state of existence however the favourable opinion of the church may do much for me during this important crisis if we understand each other good zosimus her doctors and bishops are to thunder in my behalf nor is my benefit from her pardon to be deferred till the funeral monument closes upon me certainly not said zosimus the conditions which i have already stipulated being strictly attended to and my memory in history said alexius in what manner is that to be preserved for that answered the patriarch your imperial majesty must trust to the filial piety and literary talents of your accomplished daughter anna comnena the emperor shook his head this unhappy caesar he said is like to make a quarrel between us for i shall scarce pardon so ungrateful a rebel as he is because my daughter clings to him with a womans fondness besides good zosimus it is not i believe the page of a historian such as my daughter that is most likely to be received without challenge by posterity some procopius some philosophical slave starving in a garret aspires to write the life of an emperor whom he durst not approach and although the principal merit of his production be that it contains particulars upon the subject which no man durst have promulgated while the prince was living yet no man hesitates to admit such as true when he has passed from the scene on that subject said zosimus i can neither afford your imperial majesty relief or protection if however your memory is unjustly slandered upon earth it will be a matter of indifference to your highness who will be then i trust enjoying a state of beatitude which idle slander cannot assail the only way indeed to avoid it while on this side of time would be to write your majestys own memoirs while you are yet in the body so convinced am i that it is in your power to assign legitimate excuses for those actions of your life which without your doing so would seem most worthy of censure change we the subject said the emperor and since the danger is imminent let us take care for the present and leave future ages to judge for themselves what circumstance is it reverend father in your opinion which encourages these conspirators to make so audacious an appeal to the populace and the grecian soldiers certainly answered the patriarch the most irritating incident of your highnesss reign was the fate of ursel who submitting it is said upon capitulation for life limb and liberty was starved to death by your orders in the dungeons of the blacquernal and whose courage liberality and other popular virtues are still fondly remembered by the citizens of this metropolis and by the soldiers of the guard called immortal and this said the emperor fixing his eye upon his confessor your reverence esteems actually the most dangerous point of the popular tumult i cannot doubt said the patriarch that his very name boldly pronounced and artfully repeated will be the watchword as has been plotted of a horrible tumult i thank heaven said the emperor on that particular i will be on my guard goodnight to your reverence and believe me that all in this scroll to which i have set my hand shall be with the utmost fidelity accomplished be not however overimpatient in this business such a shower of benefits falling at once upon the church would make men suspicious that the prelates and ministers proceeded rather as acting upon a bargain between the emperor and patriarch than as paying or receiving an atonement offered by a sinner in excuse of his crimes this would be injurious father both to yourself and me all regular delay said the patriarch shall be interposed at your highnesss pleasure and we shall trust to you for recollection that the bargain if it could be termed one was of your own seeking and that the benefit to the church was contingent upon the pardon and the support which she has afforded to your majesty true said the emperor most true nor shall i forget it once more adieu and forget not what i have told thee this is a night zosimus in which the emperor must toil like a slave if he means not to return to the humble alexius comnenus and even then there were no resting place so saying he took leave of the patriarch who was highly gratified with the advantages he had obtained for the church which many of his predecessors had struggled for in vain he resolved therefore to support the staggering alexius chapter the twentyfifth heaven knows its time the bullet has its billet arrow and javelin each its destined purpose the fated beasts of natures lower strain have each their separate task old play agelastes after crossing the emperor in the manner we have already described and after having taken such measures as occurred to him to ensure the success of the conspiracy returned to the lodge of his garden where the lady of the count of paris still remained her only companion being an old woman named vexhelia the wife of the soldier who accompanied bertha to the camp of the crusaders the kindhearted maiden having stipulated that during her absence her mistress was not to be left without an attendant and that attendant connected with the varangian guard he had been all day playing the part of the ambitious politician the selfish timeserver the dark and subtle conspirator and now it seemed as if to exhaust the catalogue of his various parts in the human drama he chose to exhibit himself in the character of the wily sophist and justify or seem to justify the arts by which he had risen to wealth and eminence and hoped even now to arise to royalty itself fair countess he said what occasion is there for your wearing this veil of sadness over a countenance so lovely do you suppose me said brenhilda a stock or stone or a creature without the feelings of a sensitive being that i should endure mortification imprisonment danger and distress without expressing the natural feelings of humanity do you imagine that to a lady like me as free as the unreclaimed falcon you can offer the insult of captivity without my being sensible to the disgrace or incensed against the authors of it and dost thou think that i will receive consolation at thy hands at thine one of the most active artificers in this web of treachery in which i am so basely entangled not entangled certainly by my means answered agelastes clap your hands call for what you wish and the slave who refuses instant obedience had better been unborn had i not with reference to your safety and your honour agreed for a short time to be your keeper that office would have been usurped by the caesar whose object you know and may partly guess the modes by which it would be pursued why then dost thou childishly weep at being held for a short space in an honourable restraint which the renowned arms of your husband will probably put an end to long ere tomorrow at noon canst thou not comprehend said the countess thou man of many words but of few honourable thoughts that a heart like mine which has been trained in the feelings of reliance upon my own worth and valour must be necessarily affected with shame at being obliged to accept even from the sword of a husband that safety which i would gladly have owed only to my own thou art misled countess answered the philosopher by thy pride a failing predominant in woman thinkest thou there has been no offensive assumption in laving aside the character of a mother and a wife and adopting that of one of those brainsick female fools who like the bravoes of the other sex sacrifice every thing that is honourable or useful to a frantic and insane affectation of courage believe me fair lady that the true system of virtue consists in filling thine own place gracefully in society breeding up thy children and delighting those of the other sex and any thing beyond this may well render thee hateful or terrible but can add nothing to thy amiable qualities thou pretendest said the countess to be a philosopher methinks thou shouldst know that the fame which hangs its chaplet on the tomb of a brave hero or heroine is worth all the petty engagements in which ordinary persons spend the current of their time one hour of life crowded to the full with glorious action and filled with noble risks is worth whole years of those mean observances of paltry decorum in which men steal through existence like sluggish waters through a marsh without either honour or observation daughter said agelastes approaching near to the lady it is with pain i see you bewildered in errors which a little calm reflection might remove we may flatter ourselves and human vanity usually does so that beings infinitely more powerful than those belonging to mere humanity are employed daily in measuring out the good and evil of this world the termination of combats or the fate of empires according to their own ideas of what is right or wrong or more properly according to what we ourselves conceive to be such the greek heathens renowned for their wisdom and glorious for their actions explained to men of ordinary minds the supposed existence of jupiter and his pantheon where various deities presided over various virtues and vices and regulated the temporal fortune and future happiness of such as practised them the more learned and wise of the ancients rejected such the vulgar interpretation and wisely although affecting a deference to the public faith denied before their disciples in private the gross fallacies of tartarus and olympus the vain doctrines concerning the gods themselves and the extravagant expectations which the vulgar entertained of an immortality supposed to be possessed by creatures who were in every respect mortal both in the conformation of their bodies and in the internal belief of their souls of these wrise and good men some granted the existence of the supposed deities but denied that they cared about the actions of mankind any more than those of the inferior animals a merry jovial careless life such as the followers of epicurus would choose for themselves was what they assigned for those gods whose being they admitted others more bold or more consistent entirely denied the existence of deities who apparently had no proper object or purpose and believed that such of them whose being and attributes were proved to us by no supernatural appearances had in reality no existence whatever stop wretch said the countess and know that thou speakest not to one of those blinded heathens of whose abominable doctrines you are detailing the result know that if an erring i am nevertheless a sincere daughter of the church and this cross displayed on my shoulder is a sufficient emblem of the vows i have undertaken in its cause bo therefore wary as thou art wily for believe me if thou scoffest or utterest reproach against my holy religion what i am unable to answer in language i will reply to without hesitation with the point of my dagger to that argument said agelastes drawing back from the neighbourhood of brenhilda believe me fair lady i am very willing to urge your gentleness but although i shall not venture to say any thing of those superior and benevolent powers to whom you ascribe the management of the world you will surely not take offence at my noticing those base superstitions which have been adopted in explanation of what is called by the magi the evil principle was there ever received into a human creed a being so mean almost so ridiculous as the christian satan a goatish figure and limbs with grotesque features formed to express the most execrable passions a degree of power scarce inferior to that of the deity and a talent at the same time scarce equal to that of the stupidest of the lowest order what is he this being who is at least the second arbiter of the human race save an immortal spirit with the petty spleen and spite of a vindictive old man or old woman agelastes made a singular pause in this part of his discourse a mirror of considerable size hung in the apartment so that the philosopher could see in its reflection the figure of brenhilda and remark the change of her countenance though she had averted her face from him in hatred of the doctrines which he promulgated on this glass the philosopher had his eyes naturally fixed and he was confounded at perceiving a figure glide from behind the shadow of a curtain and glare at him with the supposed mien and expression of the satan of monkish mythology or a satyr of the heathen age man said brenhilda whose attention was attracted by this extraordinary apparition as it seemed of the fiend have thy wicked words and still more wicked thoughts brought the devil amongst us if so dismiss him instantly else by our lady of the broken lances thou shalt know better than at present what is the temper of a frankish maiden when in presence of the fiend himself and those who pretend skill to raise him i wish not to enter into a contest unless compelled but if i am obliged to join battle with an enemy so horrible believe me no one shall say that brenildha feared him agelastes after looking with surprise and horror at the figure as reflected in the glass turned back his head to examine the substance of which the reflection was so strange the object however had disappeared behind the curtain under which it probably lay hid and it was after a minute or two that the halfgibing halfscowling countenance showed itself again in the same position in the mirror by the gods said agelastes in whom but now said the countess you professed unbelief by the gods repeated agelastes in part recovering himself it is sylvan that singular mockery of humanity who was said to have been brought from taprobana i warrant he also believes in his jolly god pan or the veteran sylvanus he is to the uninitiated a creature whose appearance is full of terrors but he shrinks before the philosopher like ignorance before knowledge so saying he with one hand pulled down the curtain under which the animal had nestled itself when it entered from the gardenwindow of the pavilion and with the other in which he had a staff uplifted threatened to chastise the creature with the words how now sylvanus what insolence is this to your place as in uttering these words he struck the animal the blow unluckily lighted upon his wounded hand and recalled its bitter smart the wild temper of the creature returned unsubdued for the moment by any awe of man uttering a fierce and at the same time stifled cry it flew on the philosopher and clasped its strong and sinewy arms about his throat with the utmost fury the old man twisted and struggled to deliver himself from the creatures grasp but in vain sylvan kept hold of his prize compressed his sinewy arms and abode by his purpose of not quitting his hold of the philosophers throat till he had breathed his last two more bitter yells accompanied each with a desperate contortion of the countenance and squeeze of the hands concluded in less than five minutes the dreadful strife agelastes lay dead upon the ground and his assassin sylvan springing from the body as if terrified and alarmed at what he had done made his escape by the window the countess stood in astonishment not knowing exactly whether she had witnessed a supernatural display of the judgment of heaven or an instance of its vengeance by mere mortal means her new attendant vexhelia was no less astonished though her acquaintance with the animal was considerably more intimate lady she said that gigantic creature is an animal of great strength resembling mankind in form but huge in its size and encouraged by its immense power sometimes malevolent in its intercourse with mortals i have heard the varangians often talk of it as belonging to the imperial museum it is fitting we remove the body of this unhappy man and hide it in a plot of shrubbery in the garden it is not likely that he will be missed tonight and tomorrow there will be other matter astir which will probably prevent much enquiry about him the countess brenhilda assented for she was not one of those timorous females to whom the countenances of the dead are objects of terror trusting to the parole which she had given agelastes had permitted the countess and her attendant the freedom of his gardens of that part at least adjacent to the pavilion they therefore were in little risk of interruption as they bore forth the dead body between them and without much trouble disposed of it in the thickest part of one of the bosquets with which the garden was studded as they returned to their place of abode or confinement the countess half speaking to herself half addressing vexhelia said i am sorry for this not that the infamous wretch did not deserve the full punishment of heaven coming upon him in the very moment of blasphemy and infidelity but because the courage and truth of the unfortunate brenhilda may be brought into suspicion as his slaughter took place when he was alone with her and her attendant and as no one was witness of the singular manner in which the old blasphemer met his end thou knowest she added addressing herself to heaven thou blessed lady of the broken lances the protectress both of brenhilda and her husband well knowest that whatever faults may be mine i am free from the slightest suspicion of treachery and into thy hands i put my cause with a perfect reliance upon thy wisdom and bounty to bear evidence in my favour so saying they returned to the lodge unseen and with pious and submissive prayers the countess closed that eventful evening chapter the twentysixth will you hear of a spanish lady how she wooed an englishman garments gay as rich as may be deckd with jewels she had on of a comely countenance and grace was she and by birth and parentage of high degree old ballad we left alexius comnenus after he had unloaded his conscience in the ears of the patriarch and received from him a faithful assurance of the pardon and patronage of the national church he took leave of the dignitary with some exulting exclamations so unexplicitly expressed however that it was by no means easy to conceive the meaning of what he said his first enquiry when he reached the blacquernal being for his daughter he was directed to the room encrusted with beautifully carved marble from which she herself and many of her race derived the proud appellation of porphyrogenita or born in the purple her countenance was clouded with anxiety which at the sight of her father broke out into open and uncontrollable grief daughter said the emperor with a harshness little common to his manner and a seriousness which he sternly maintained instead of sympathizing with his daughters affliction as you would prevent the silly fool with whom you are connected from displaying himself to the public both as an ungrateful monster and a traitor you will not fail to exhort him by due submission to make his petition for pardon accompanied with a full confession of his crimes or by my sceptre and my crown he shall die the death nor will i pardon any who rushes upon his doom in an open tone of defiance under such a standard of rebellion as my ungrateful soninlaw has hoisted what can you require of me father said the princess can you expect that i am to dip my own hands in the blood of this unfortunate man or wilt thou seek a revenge yet more bloody than that which was exacted by the deities of antiquity upon those criminals who offended against their divine power think not so my daughter said the emperor but rather believe that thou hast the last opportunity afforded by my filial affection of rescuing perhaps from death that silly fool thy husband who has so richly deserved it my father said the princess god knows it is not at your risk that i would wish to purchase the life of nicephorus but he has been the father of my children though they are now no more and women cannot forget that such a tie has existed even though it has been broken by fate permit me only to hope that the unfortunate culprit shall have an opportunity of retrieving his errors nor shall it believe me be my fault if he resumes those practices treasonable at once and unnatural by which his life is at present endangered follow me then daughter said the emperor and know that to thee alone i am about to intrust a secret upon which the safety of my life and crown as well as the pardon of my soninlaws life will be found eventually to depend he then assumed in haste the garment of a slave of the seraglio and commanded his daughter to arrange her dress in a more succinct form and to take in her hand a lighted lamp whither are we going my father said anna comnena it matters not replied her father since my destiny calls me and since thine ordains thee to be my torchbearer believe it and record it if thou darest in thy book that alexius comnenus does not without alarm descend into those awful dungeons which his predecessors built for men even when his intentions are innocent and free from harm be silent and should we meet any inhabitant of those inferior regions speak not a word nor make any observation upon his appearance passing through the intricate apartments of the palace they now came to that large hall through which hereward had passed on the first night of his introduction to the place of annas recitation called the temple of the muses it was constructed as we have said of black marble dimly illuminated at the upper end of the apartment was a small altar on which was laid some incense while over the smoke was suspended as if projecting from the wall two imitations of human hands and arms which were but imperfectly seen at the bottom of this hall a small iron door led to a narrow and winding staircase resembling a drawwell in shape and size the steps of which were excessively steep and which the emperor after a solemn gesture to his daughter commanding her attendance began to descend with the imperfect light and by the narrow and difficult steps by which those who visited the under regions of the blacquernal seemed to bid adieu to the light of day door after door they passed in their descent leading it was probable to different ranges of dungeons from which was obscurely heard the stifled voice of groans and sighs such as attracted herewards attention on a former occasion the emperor took no notice of these signs of human misery and three stories or ranges of dungeons had been already passed ere the father and daughter arrived at the lowest story of the building the base of which was the solid rock roughly carved upon which were erected the sidewalls and arches of solid but unpolished marble here said alexius comnenus all hope all expectation takes farewell at the turn of a hinge or the grating of a lock yet shall not this be always the case the dead shall revive and resume their right and the disinherited of these regions shall again prefer their claim to inhabit the upper world if i cannot entreat heaven to my assistance be assured my daughter that rather than be the poor animal which i have stooped to be thought and even to be painted in thy history i would sooner brave every danger of the multitude which now erect themselves betwixt me and safety nothing is resolved save that i will live and die an emperor and thou anna be assured that if there is power in the beauty or in the talents of which so much has been boasted that power shall be this evening exercised to the advantage of thy parent from whom it is derived what is it that you mean imperial father holy virgin is this the promise you made me to save the life of the unfortunate nicephorus and so i will said the emperor and i am now about that action of benevolence but think not i will once more warm in my bosom the household snake which had so nearly stung me to death no daughter i have provided for thee a fitting husband in one who is able to maintain and defend the rights of the emperor thy father and beware how thou opposest an obstacle to what is my pleasure for behold these walls of marble though unpolished and recollect it is as possible to die within the marble as to be born there the princess anna comnena was frightened at seeing her father in a state of mind entirely different from any which she had before witnessed o heaven that my mother were here she ejaculated in the terror of something she hardly knew what anna said the emperor your fears and your screams are alike in vain i am one of those who on ordinary occasions hardly nourish a wish of my own and account myself obliged to those who like my wife and daughter take care to save me all the trouble of free judgment but when the vessel is among the breakers and the master is called to the helm believe that no meaner hand shall be permitted to interfere with him nor will the wife and daughter whom he indulged in prosperity be allowed to thwart his will while he can yet call it his own thou couldst scarcely fail to understand that i was almost prepared to have given thee as a mark of my sincerity to yonder obscure varangian without asking question of either birth or blood thou mayst hear when i next promise thee to a three years inhabitant of these vaults who shall be caesar in brienniuss stead if i can move him to accept a princess for his bride and an imperial crown for his inheritance in place of a starving dungeon i tremble at your words father said anna comnena how canst thou trust a man who has felt thy cruelty how canst thou dream that aught can ever in sincerity reconcile thee to one whom thou hast deprived of his eyesight care not for that said alexius he becomes mine or he shall never know what it is to be again his own and thou girl mayst rest assured that if i will it thou art next day the bride of my present captive or thou retirest to the most severe nunnery never again to mix with society be silent therefore and await thy doom as it shall come and hope not that thy utmost endeavours can avert the current of thy destiny as he concluded this singular dialogue in which he had assumed a tone to which his daughter was a stranger and before which she trembled he passed on through more than one strictly fastened door while his daughter with a faltering step illuminated him on the obscure road at length he found admittance by another passage into the cell in which ursel was confined and found him reclining in hopeless misery all those expectations having faded from his heart which the count of paris had by his indomitable gallantry for a time excited he turned his sightless eyes towards the place where he heard the moving of bolts and the approach of steps a new feature he said in my imprisonment a man comes with a heavy and determined step and a woman or a child with one that scarcely presses the floor is it my death that you bring believe me that i have lived long enough in these dungeons to bid my doom welcome it is not thy death noble ursel said the emperor in a voice somewhat disguised life liberty whatever the world has to give is placed by the emperor alexius at the feet of his noble enemy and he trusts that many years of happiness and power together with the command of a large share of the empire will soon obliterate the recollection of the dungeons of the blacquernal it cannot be said ursel with a sigh he upon whose eyes the sun has set even at middle day can have nothing left to hope from the most advantageous change of circumstances you are not entirely assured of that said the emperor allow us to convince you that what is intended towards you is truly favourable and liberal and i hope you will be rewarded by finding that there is more possibility of amendment in your case than your first apprehensions are willing to receive make an effort and try whether your eyes are not sensible of the light of the lamp do with me said ursel according to your pleasure i have neither strength to remonstrate nor the force of mind equal to make me set your cruelty at defiance of something like light i am sensible but whether it is reality or illusion i cannot determine if you are come to deliver me from this living sepulchre i pray god to requite you and if under such deceitful pretence you mean to take my life i can only commend my soul to heaven and the vengeance due to my death to him who can behold the darkest places in which injustice can shroud itself so saying and the revulsion of his spirits rendering him unable to give almost any other signs of existence ursel sunk back upon his seat of captivity and spoke not another word during the time that alexius disembarrassed him of those chains which had so long hung about him that they almost seemed to make a part of his person this is an affair in which thy aid can scarce be sufficient anna said the emperor it would have been well if you and i could have borne him into the open air by our joint strength for there is little wisdom in showing the secrets of this prisonhouse to those to whom they are not yet known nevertheless go my child and at a short distance from the head of the staircase which we descended thou wilt find edward the bold and trusty varangian who on your communicating to him my orders will come hither and render his assistance and see that you send also the experienced leech douban terrified half stifled and half struck with horror the lady yet felt a degree of relief from the somewhat milder tone in which her father addressed her with tottering steps yet in some measure encouraged by the tenor of her instructions she ascended the staircase which yawned upon these infernal dungeons as she approached the top a large and strong figure threw its broad shadow between the lamp and the opening of the hall frightened nearly to death at the thoughts of becoming the wife of a squalid wretch like ursel a moment of weakness seized upon the princesss mind and when she considered the melancholy option which her father had placed before her she could not but think that the handsome and gallant varangian who had already rescued the royal family from such imminent danger was a fitter person with whom to unite herself if she must needs make a second choice than the singular and disgusting being whom her fathers policy had raked from the bottom of the blacquernal dungeons i will not say of poor anna comnena who was a timid but not an unfeeling woman that she would have embraced such a proposal had not the life of her present husband nicephorus briennius been in extreme danger and it was obviously the determination of the emperor that if he spared him it should be on the sole condition of unloosing his daughters hand and binding her to some one of better faith and possessed of a greater desire to prove an affectionate soninlaw neither did the plan of adopting the varangian as a second husband enter decidedly into the mind of the princess the present was a moment of danger in which her rescue to be successful must be sudden and perhaps if once achieved the lady might have had an opportunity of freeing herself both from ursel and the varangian without disjoining either of them from her fathers assistance or of herself losing it at any rate the surest means of safety were to secure if possible the young soldier whose features and appearance were of a kind which rendered the task no way disagreeable to a beautiful woman the schemes of conquest are so natural to the fair sex and the whole idea passed so quickly through anna comnenas mind that having first entered while the soldiers shadow was interposed between her and the lamp it had fully occupied her quick imagination when with deep reverence and great surprise at her sudden appearance on the ladder of acheron the varangian advancing knelt down and lent his arm to the assistance of the fair lady in order to help her out of the dreary staircase dearest hereward said the lady with a degree of intimacy which seemed unusual how much do i rejoice in this dreadful night to have fallen under your protection i have been in places which the spirit of hell appears to have contrived for the human race the alarm of the princess the familiarity of a beautiful woman who while in mortal fear seeks refuge like a frightened dove in the bosom of the strong and the brave must be the excuse of anna comnena for the tender epithet with which she greeted hereward nor if he had chosen to answer in the same tone which faithful as he was might have proved the case if the meeting had chanced before he saw bertha would the daughter of alexius have been to say the truth irreconcilably offended exhausted as she was she suffered herself to repose upon the broad breast and shoulder of the anglosaxon nor did she make an attempt to recover herself although the decorum of her sex and station seemed to recommend such an exertion hereward was obliged himself to ask her with the unimpassioned and reverential demeanour of a private soldier to a princess whether he ought to summon her female attendants to which she faintly uttered a negative no no said she i have a duty to execute for my father and i must not summon eye witnesses he knows me to be in safety hereward since he knows i am with thee and if i am a burden to you in my present state of weakness i shall soon recover if you will set me down upon the marble steps heaven forbid lady said hereward that i were thus neglectful of your highnesss gracious health i see your two young ladies astarte and violante are in quest of you permit me to summon them hither and i will keep watch upon you if you are unable to retire to your chamber where methinks the present disorder of your nerves will be most properly treated do as thou wilt barbarian said the princess rallying herself with a certain degree of pique arising perhaps from her not thinking more dramatis personae were appropriate to the scene than the two who were already upon the stage then as if for the first time appearing to recollect the message with which she had been commissioned she exhorted the varangian to repair instantly to her father on such occasions the slightest circumstances have their effect on the actors the anglosaxon was sensible that the princess was somewhat offended though whether she was so on account of her being actually in herewards arms or whether the cause of her anger was the being nearly discovered there by the two young maidens the sentinel did not presume to guess but departed for the gloomy vaults to join alexius with the neverfailing doubleedged axe the bane of many a turk glittering upon his shoulder astarte and her companion had been despatched by the empress irene in search of anna comnena through those apartments of the palace which she was wont to inhabit the daughter of alexius could nowhere be found although the business on which they were seeking her was described by the empress as of the most pressing nature nothing however in a palace passes altogether unespied so that the empresss messengers at length received information that their mistress and the emperor had been seen to descend that gloomy access to the dungeons which by allusion to the classical infernal regions was termed the pit of acheron they came thither accordingly and we have related the consequences hereward thought it necessary to say that her imperial highness had swooned upon being suddenly brought into the upper air the princess on the other part briskly shook off her juvenile attendants and declared herself ready to proceed to the chamber of her mother the obeisance which she made hereward at parting had something in it of haughtiness yet evidently qualified by a look of friendship and regard as she passed an apartment in which some of the royal slaves were in waiting she addressed to one of them an old respectable man of medical skill a private and hurried order desiring him to go to the assistance of her father whom he would find at the bottom of the staircase called the pit of acheron and to take his scimitar along with him to hear as usual was to obey and douban for that was his name only replied by that significant sign which indicates immediate acquiescence in the meantime anna comnena herself hastened onward to her mothers apartments in which she found the empress alone go hence maidens said irene and do not let any one have access to these apartments even if the emperor himself should command it shut the door she said anna comnena and if the jealousy of the stronger sex do not allow us the masculine privileges of bolts and bars to secure the insides of our apartments let us avail ourselves as quickly as may be of such opportunities as are permitted us and remember princess that however implicit your duty to your father it is yet more so to me who am of the same sex with thyself and may truly call thee even according to the letter blood of my blood and bone of my bone be assured thy father knows not at this moment the feelings of a woman neither he nor any man alive can justly conceive the pangs of the heart which beats under a womans robe these men anna would tear asunder without scruple the tenderest ties of affection the whole structure of domestic felicity in which lie a womans cares her joy her pain her love and her despair trust therefore to me my daughter and believe me i will at once save thy fathers crown and thy happiness the conduct of thy husband has been wrong most cruelly wrong but anna he is a man and in calling him such i lay to his charge as natural frailties thoughtless treachery wanton infidelity every species of folly and inconsistency to which his race is subject you ought not therefore to think of his faults unless it be to forgive them madam said anna comnena forgive me if i remind you that you recommend to a princess born in the purple itself a line of conduct which would hardly become the female who carries the pitcher for the needful supply of water to the village well all who are around me have been taught to pay me the obeisance due to my birth and while this nicephorus briennius crept on his knees to your daughters hand which you extended towards him he was rather receiving the yoke of a mistress than accepting a household alliance with a wife he has incurred his doom without a touch even of that temptation which may be pled by lesser culprits in his condition and if it is the will of my father that he should die or suffer banishment or imprisonment for the crime he has committed it is not the business of anna comnena to interfere she being the most injured among the imperial family who have in so many and such gross respects the right to complain of his falsehood daughter replied the empress so far i agree with you that the treason of nicephorus towards your father and myself has been in a great degree unpardonable nor do i easily see on what footing save that of generosity his life could be saved but still you are yourself in different circumstances from me and may as an affectionate and fond wife compare the intimacies of your former habits with the bloody change which is so soon to be the consequence and the conclusion of his crimes he is possessed of that person and of those features which women most readily recall to their memory whether alive or dead think what it will cost you to recollect that the rugged executioner received his last salute that the shapely neck had no better repose than the rough block that the tongue the sound of which you used to prefer to the choicest instruments of music is silent in the dust anna who was not insensible to the personal graces of her husband was much affected by this forcible appeal why distress me thus mother she replied in a weeping accent did i not feel as acutely as you would have me to do this moment however awful would be easily borne i had but to think of him as he is to contrast his personal qualities with those of the mind by which they are more than overbalanced and resign myself to his deserved fate with unresisting submission to my fathers will and that said the empress would be to bind thee by his sole fiat to some obscure wretch whose habits of plotting and intriguing had by some miserable chance given him the opportunity of becoming of importance to the emperor and who is therefore to be rewarded by the hand of anna comnena do not think so meanly of me madam said the princess i know as well as ever grecian maiden did how i should free myself from dishonour and you may trust me you shall never blush for your daughter tell me not that said the empress since i shall blush alike for the relentless cruelty which gives up a once beloved husband to an ignominious death and for the passion for which i want a name which would replace him by an obscure barbarian from the extremity of thule or some wretch escaped from the blacquernal dungeons the princess was astonished to perceive that her mother was acquainted with the purposes even the most private which her father had formed for his governance during this emergency she was ignorant that alexius and his royal consort in other respects living together with a decency ever exemplary in people of their rank had sometimes on interesting occasions family debates in which the husband provoked by the seeming unbelief of his partner was tempted to let her guess more of his real purposes than he would have coolly imparted of his own calm choice the princess was affected at the anticipation of the death of her husband nor could this have been reasonably supposed to be otherwise but she was still more hurt and affronted by her mother taking it for granted that she designed upon the instant to replace the caesar by an uncertain and at all events an unworthy successor whatever considerations had operated to make hereward her choice their effect was lost when the match was placed in this odious and degrading point of view besides which is to be remembered that women almost instinctively deny their first thoughts in favour of a suitor and seldom willingly reveal them unless time and circumstance concur to favour them she called heaven therefore passionately to witness while she repelled the charge bear witness she said our lady queen of heaven bear witness saints and martyrs all ye blessed ones who are more than ourselves the guardians of our mental purity that i know no passion which i dare not avow and that if nicephoruss life depended on my entreaty to god and men all his injurious acts towards me disregarded and despised it should be as long as heaven gave to those servants whom it snatched from the earth without suffering the pangs of mortality you have sworn boldly said the empress see anna comnena that you keep your word for believe me it will be tried what will be tried mother said the princess or what have i to do to pronounce the doom of the caesar who is not subject to my power i will show you said the empress gravely and leading her towards a sort of wardrobe which formed a closet in the wall she withdrew a curtain which hung before it and placed before her her unfortunate husband nicephorus briennius halfattired with his sword drawn in his hand looking upon him as an enemy and conscious of some schemes with respect to him which had passed through her mind in the course of these troubles the princess screamed faintly upon perceiving him so near her with a weapon in his hand be more composed said the empress or this wretched man if discovered falls no less a victim to thy idle fears than to thy baneful revenge nicephorus at this speech seemed to have adopted his cue for dropping the point of his sword and falling on his knees before the princess he clasped his hands to entreat for mercy what hast thou to ask from me said his wife naturally assured by her husbands prostration that the stronger force was upon her own side what hast thou to ask from me that outraged gratitude betrayed affection the most solemn vows violated and the fondest ties of nature torn asunder like the spiders broken web will permit thee to put in words for very shame do not suppose anna replied the suppliant that i am at this eventful period of my life to play the hypocrite for the purpose of saving the wretched remnant of a dishonoured existence i am but desirous to part in charity with thee to make my peace with heaven and to nourish the last hope of making my way though burdened with many crimes to those regions in which alone i can find thy beauty thy talents equalled at least if not excelled you hear him daughter said irene his boon is for forgiveness alone thy condition is the more godlike since thou mayst unite the safety of his life with the pardon of his offences thou art deceived mother answered anna it is not mine to pardon his guilt far less to remit his punishment you have taught me to think of myself as future ages shall know me what will they say of me those future ages when i am described as the unfeeling daughter who pardoned the intended assassin of her father because she saw in him her own unfaithful husband see there said the caesar is not that most serene empress the very point of despair and have i not in vain offered my lifeblood to wipe out the stain of parricide and ingratitude have i not also vindicated myself from the most unpardonable part of the accusation which charged me with attempting the murder of the godlike emperor have i not sworn by all that is sacred to man that my purpose went no farther than to sequestrate alexius for a little time from the fatigues of empire and place him where he should quietly enjoy ease and tranquillity while at the same time his empire should be as implicitly regulated by himself his sacred pleasure being transmitted through me as in any respect or at any period it had ever been erring man said the princess hast thou approached so near to the footstool of alexius comnenus and durst thou form so false an estimate of him as to conceive it possible that he would consent to be a mere puppet by whose intervention you might have brought his empire into submission know that the blood of comnenus is not so poor my father would have resisted the treason in arms and by the death of thy benefactor only couldst thou have gratified the suggestions of thy criminal ambition be such your belief said the caesar i have said enough for a life which is not and ought not to be dear to me call your guards and let them take the life of the unfortunate briennius since it has become hateful to his once beloved anna comnena be not afraid that any resistance of mine shall render the scene of my apprehension dubious or fatal nicephorus briennius is caesar no longer and he thus throws at the feet of his princess and spouse the only poor means which he has of resisting the just doom which is therefore at her pleasure to pass he cast his sword before the feet of the princess while irene exclaimed weeping or seeming to weep bitterly i have indeed read of such scenes but could i ever have thought that my own daughter would have been the principal actress in one of them could i ever have thought that her mind admired by every one as a palace for the occupation of apollo and the muses should not have had room enough for the humbler but more amiable virtue of feminine charity and compassion which builds itself a nest in the bosom of the lowest village girl do thy gifts accomplishments and talents spread hardness as well as polish over thy heart if so a hundred times better renounce them all and retain in their stead those gentle and domestic virtues which are the first honours of the female heart a woman who is pitiless is a worse monster than one who is unsexed by any other passion what would you have me do said anna you mother ought to know better than i that the life of my father is hardly consistent with the existence of this bold and cruel man o i am sure he still meditates his purpose of conspiracy he that could deceive a woman in the manner he has done me will not relinquish a plan which is founded upon the death of his benefactor you do me injustice anna said briennius starting up and imprinting a kiss upon her lips ere she was aware by this caress the last that will pass between us i swear that if in my life i have yielded to folly i have notwithstanding never been guilty of a treason of the heart towards a woman as superior to the rest of the female world in talents and accomplishments as in personal beauty the princess much softened shook her head as she replied ah nicephorus such were once your words such perhaps were then your thoughts but who or what shall now warrant to me the veracity of either those very accomplishments and that very beauty itself replied nicephorus and if more is wanting said irene thy mother will enter her security for him deem her not an insufficient pledge in this affair she is thy mother and the wife of alexius comnenus interested beyond all human beings in the growth and increase of the power and dignity of her husband and her child and one who sees on this occasion an opportunity for exercising generosity for soldering up the breaches of the imperial house and reconstructing the frame of government upon a basis which if there be faith and gratitude in man shall never be again exposed to hazard to the reality of that faith and gratitude then said the princess we must trust implicitly as it is your will mother although even my own knowledge of the subject both through study and experience of the world has called me to observe the rashness of such confidence but although we two may forgive nicephoruss errors the emperor is still the person to whom the final reference must be had both as to pardon and favour fear not alexius answered her mother he will speak determinedly and decidedly but if he acts not in the very moment of forming the resolution it is no more to be relied on than an icicle in time of thaw do thou apprize me if thou canst what the emperor is at present doing and take my word i will find means to bring him round to our opinion must i then betray secrets which my father has intrusted to me said the princess and to one who has so lately held the character of his avowed enemy call it not betray said irene since it is written thou shalt betray no one least of all thy father and the father of the empire yet again it is written by the holy luke that men shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolk and friends and therefore surely also by daughters by which i only mean thou shalt discover to us thy fathers secrets so far as may enable us to save the life of thy husband the necessity of the case excuses whatever may be otherwise considered as irregular be it so then mother having yielded my consent perhaps too easily to snatch this malefactor from my fathers justice i am sensible i must secure his safety by such means as are in my power i left my father at the bottom of those stairs called the pit of acheron in the cell of a blind man to whom he gave the name of ursel holy mary exclaimed the empress thou hast named a name which has been long unspoken in the open air has the emperors sense of his danger from the living said the caesar induced him to invoke the dead for ursel has been no living man for the space of three years it matters not said anna comnena i tell you true my father even now held conference with a miserablelooking prisoner whom he so named it is a danger the more said the caesar he cannot have forgotten the zeal with which i embraced the cause of the present emperor against his own and so soon as he is at liberty he will study to avenge it for this we must endeavour to make some provision though it increases our difficulties sit down then my gentle my beneficent mother and thou my wife who hast preferred thy love for an unworthy husband to the suggestions of jealous passion and of headlong revenge sit down and let us see in what manner it may be in our power consistently with your duty to the emperor to bring our broken vessel securely into port he employed much natural grace of manner in handing the mother and daughter to their seats and taking his place confidentially between them all were soon engaged in concerting what measures should be taken for the morrow not forgetting such as should at once have the effect of preserving the caesars life and at the same time of securing the grecian empire against the conspiracy of which he had been the chief instigator briennius ventured to hint that perhaps the best way would be to suffer the conspiracy to proceed as originally intended pledging his own faith that the rights of alexius should be held inviolate during the struggle but his influence over the empress and her daughter did not extend to obtaining so great a trust they plainly protested against permitting him to leave the palace or taking the least share in the confusion which tomorrow was certain to witness you forget noble ladies said the caesar that my honour is concerned in meeting the count of paris pshaw tell me not of your honour briennius said anna comnena do i not well know that although the honour of the western knights be a species of moloch a fleshdevouring bloodquaffing demon yet that which is the god of idolatry to the eastern warriors though equally loud and noisy in the hall is far less implacable in the field believe not that i have forgiven great injuries and insults in order to take such false coin as honour in payment your ingenuity is but poor if you cannot devise some excuse which will satisfy the greeks and in good sooth briennius to this battle you go not whether for your good or for your ill believe not that i will consent to your meeting either count or countess whether in warlike combat or amorous parley so you may at a word count upon remaining prisoner here until the hour appointed for such gross folly be past and over the caesar perhaps was not in his heart angry that his wifes pleasure was so bluntly and resolutely expressed against the intended combat if said he you are determined to take my honour into your own keeping i am here for the present your prisoner nor have i the means of interfering with your pleasure when once at liberty the free exercise of my valour and my lance is once more my own be it so sir paladin said the princess very composedly i have good hope that neither of them will involve you with any of yon dare devils of paris whether male or female and that we will regulate the pitch to which your courage soars by the estimation of greek philosophy and the judgment of our blessed lady of mercy not her of the broken lances at this moment an authoritative knock at the door alarmed the consultation of the caesar and the ladies chapter the twentyseventh physician be comforted good madam the great rage you see is cured in him and yet it is danger to make him even oer the time he has lost desire him to go in trouble him no more till further settling king lear we left the emperor alexius comnenus at the bottom of a subterranean vault with a lamp expiring and having charge of a prisoner who seemed himself nearly reduced to the same extremity for the first two or three moments he listened after his daughters retiring footsteps he grew impatient and began to long for her return before it was possible she could have traversed the path betwixt him and the summit of these gloomy stairs a minute or two he endured with patience the absence of the assistance which he had sent her to summon but strange suspicions began to cross his imagination could it be possible had she changed her purpose on account of the hard words which he had used towards her had she resolved to leave her father to his fate in his hour of utmost need and was he to rely no longer upon the assistance which he had implored her to send the short time which the princess trifled away in a sort of gallantry with the varangian hereward was magnified tenfold by the impatience of the emperor who began to think that she was gone to fetch the accomplices of the caesar to assault their prince in his defenceless condition and carry into effect their halfdisconcerted conspiracy after a considerable time filled up with this feeling of agonizing uncertainty he began at length more composedly to recollect the little chance there was that the princess would even for her own sake resentful as she was in the highest degree of her husbands ill behaviour join her resources to his to the destruction of one who had so generally showed himself an indulgent and affectionate father when he had adopted this better mood a step was heard upon the staircase and after a long and unequal descent hereward in his heavy armour at length coolly arrived at the bottom of the steps behind him panting and trembling partly with cold and partly with terror came douban the slave well skilled in medicine welcome good edward welcome douban he said whose medical skill is sufficiently able to counterbalance the weight of years which hang upon him your highness is gracious said douban but what he would have farther said was cut off by a violent fit of coughing the consequence of his age of his feeble habit of the damps of the dungeon and the rugged exercise of descending the long and difficult staircase thou art unaccustomed to visit thy patients in so rough an abode said alexius and nevertheless to the damps of these dreary regions state necessity obliges us to confine many who are no less our beloved subjects in reality than they are in title the medical man continued his cough perhaps as an apology for not giving that answer of assent with which his conscience did not easily permit him to reply to an observation which though stated by one who should know the fact seemed not to be in itself altogether likely yes my douban said the emperor in this strong case of steel and adamant have we found it necessary to enclose the redoubted ursel whose fame is spread through the whole world both for military skill political wisdom personal bravery and other noble gifts which we have been obliged to obscure for a time in order that we might at the fittest conjuncture which is now arrived restore them to the world in their full lustre feel his pulse therefore douban consider him as one who hath suffered severe confinement with all its privations and is about to be suddenly restored to the full enjoyment of life and whatever renders life valuable i will do my best said douban but your majesty must consider that we work upon a frail and exhausted subject whose health seems already wellnigh gone and may perhaps vanish in an instant like this pale and trembling light whose precarious condition the lifebreath of this unfortunate patient seems closely to resemble desire therefore good douban one or two of the mutes who serve in the interior and who have repeatedly been thy assistants in such cases or stay edward thy motions will be more speedy do thou go for the mutes make them bring some kind of litter to transport the patient and douban do thou superintend the whole transport him instantly to a suitable apartment only taking care that it be secret and let him enjoy the comforts of the bath and whatever else may tend to restore his feeble animation keeping in mind that he must if possible appear tomorrow in the field that will be hard said douban after having been it would appear subjected to such fare and such usage as his fluctuating pulse intimates but too plainly twas a mistake of the dungeonkeeper the inhuman villain who should not go without his reward continued the emperor had not heaven already bestowed it by the strange means of a sylvan man or native of the woods who yesterday put to death the jailor who meditated the death of his prisoner yes my dear douban a private sentinel of our guards called the immortal had wellnigh annihilated this flower of our trust whom for a time we were compelled to immure in secret then indeed a rude hammer had dashed to pieces an unparalleled brilliant but the fates have arrested such a misfortune the assistance having arrived the physician who seemed more accustomed to act than to speak directed a bath to be prepared with medicated herbs and gave it as his opinion that the patient should not be disturbed till tomorrows sun was high in the heavens ursel accordingly was assisted to the bath which was employed according to the directions of the physician but without affording any material symptoms of recovery from thence he was transferred to a cheerful bedchamber opening by an ample window to one of the terraces of the palace which commanded an extensive prospect these operations were performed upon a frame so extremely stupified by previous suffering so dead to the usual sensations of existence that it was not till the sensibility should be gradually restored by friction of the stiffened limbs and other means that the leech hoped the mists of the intellect should at length begin to clear away douban readily undertook to obey the commands of the emperor and remained by the bed of the patient until the dawn of morning ready to support nature as far as the skill of leechcraft admitted from the mutes much more accustomed to be the executioners of the emperors displeasure than of his humanity douban selected one man of milder mood and by alexiuss order made him understand that the ask in which he was engaged was to be kept most strictly secret while the hardened slave was astonished to find that the attentions paid to the sick were to be rendered with yet more mystery than the bloody offices of death and torture the passive patient received the various acts of attention which were rendered to him in silence and if not totally without consciousness at least without a distinct comprehension of their object after the soothing operation of the bath and the voluptuous exchange of the rude and musty pile of straw on which he had stretched himself for years for a couch of the softest down ursel was presented with a sedative draught slightly tinctured with an opiate the balmy restorer of nature came thus invoked and the captive sunk into a delicious slumber long unknown to him and which seemed to occupy equally his mental faculties and his bodily frame while the features were released from their rigid tenor and the posture of the limbs no longer disturbed by fits of cramp and sudden and agonizing twists and throes seemed changed for a placid state of the most perfect ease and tranquillity the morn was already colouring the horizon and the freshness of the breeze of dawn had insinuated itself into the lofty halls of the palace of the blacquernal when a gentle tap at the door of the chamber awakened douban who undisturbed from the calm state of his patient had indulged himself in a brief repose the door opened and a figure appeared disguised in the robes worn by an officer of the palace and concealed beneath an artificial beard of great size and of a white colour the features of the emperor himself douban said alexius how fares it with thy patient whose safety is this day of such consequence to the grecian state well my lord replied the physician excellently well and if he is not now disturbed i will wager whatever skill i possess that nature assisted by the art of the physician will triumph over the damps and the unwholesome air of the impure dungeon only be prudent my lord and let not an untimely haste bring this ursel forward into the contest ere he has arranged the disturbed current of his ideas and recovered in some degree the spring of his mind and the powers of his body i will rule my impatience said the emperor or rather douban i will be ruled by thee thinkest thou he is awake i am inclined to think so said the leech but he opens not his eyes and seems to me as if he absolutely resisted the natural impulse to rouse himself and look around him speak to him said the emperor and let us know what is passing in his mind it is at some risk replied the physician but you shall be obeyed ursel he said approaching the bed of his blind patient and then in a louder tone he repeated again ursel ursel peace hush muttered the patient disturb not the blest in their ecstacy nor again recall the most miserable of mortals to finish the draught of bitterness which his fate had compelled him to commence again again said the emperor aside to douban try him yet again it is of importance for me to know in what degree he possesses his senses or in what measure they have disappeared from him i would not however said the physician be the rash and guilty person who by an illtimed urgency should produce a total alienation of mind and plunge him back either into absolute lunacy or produce a stupor in which he might remain for a long period surely not replied the emperor my commands are those of one christian to another nor do i wish them farther obeyed than as they are consistent with the laws of god and man he paused for a moment after this declaration and yet but few minutes had elapsed ere he again urged the leech to pursue the interrogation of his patient if you hold me not competent said douban somewhat vain of the trust necessarily reposed in him to judge of the treatment of my patient your imperial highness must take the risk and the trouble upon yourself marry i shall said the emperor for the scruples of leeches are not to be indulged when the fate of kingdoms and the lives of monarchs are placed against them in the scales rouse thee my noble ursel hear a voice with which thy ears were once well acquainted welcome thee back to glory and command look around thee and see how the world smiles to welcome thee back from imprisonment to empire cunning fiend said ursel who usest the most wily baits in order to augment the misery of the wretched know tempter that i am conscious of the whole trick of the soothing images of last night thy baths thy beds and thy bowers of bliss but sooner shalt thou be able to bring a smile upon the cheek of st anthony the eremite than induce me to curl mine after the fashion of earthly voluptuaries try it foolish man insisted the emperor and trust to the evidence of thy senses for the reality of the pleasures by which thou art now surrounded or if thou art obstinate in thy lack of faith tarry as thou art for a single moment and i will bring with me a being so unparalleled in her loveliness that a single glance of her were worth the restoration of thine eyes were it only to look upon her for a moment so saying he left the apartment traitor said ursel and deceiver of old bring no one hither and strive not by shadowy and ideal forms of beauty to increase the delusion that gilds my prisonhouse for a moment in order doubtless to destroy totally the spark of reason and then exchange this earthly hell for a dungeon in the infernal regions themselves his mind is somewhat shattered mused the physician which is often the consequence of a long solitary confinement i marvel much was his farther thought if the emperor can shape out any rational service which this man can render him after being so long immured in so horrible a dungeon thou thinkest then continued he addressing the patient that the seeming release of last night with its baths and refreshments was only a delusive dream without any reality ay what else answered ursel and that the arousing thyself as we desire thee to do would be but a resigning to a vain temptation in order to wake to more unhappiness than formerly even so returned the patient what then are thy thoughts of the emperor by whose command thou sufferest so severe a restraint perhaps douban wished he had forborne this question for in the very moment when he put it the door of the chamber opened and the emperor entered with his daughter hanging upon his arm dressed with simplicity yet with becoming splendour she had found time it seems to change her dress for a white robe which resembled a kind of mourning the chief ornament of which was a diamond chaplet of inestimable value which surrounded and bound the long sable tresses that reached from her head to her waist terrified almost to death she had been surprised by her father in the company of her husband the caesar and her mother and the same thundering mandate had at once ordered briennius in the character of a more than suspected traitor under the custody of a strong guard of varangians and commanded her to attend her father to the bedchamber of ursel in which she now stood resolved however that she would stick by the sinking fortunes of her husband even in the last extremity yet no less determined that she would not rely upon her own entreaties or remonstrances until she should see whether her fathers interference was likely to reassume a resolved and positive character hastily as the plans of alexius had been formed and hastily as they had been disconcerted by accident there remained no slight chance that he might be forced to come round to the purpose on which his wife and daughter had fixed their heart the forgiveness namely of the guilty nicephorus briennius to his astonishment and not perhaps greatly to his satisfaction he heard the patient deeply engaged with the physician in canvassing his own character think not said ursel in reply to him that though i am immured in this dungeon and treated as something worse than an outcast of humanity and although i am moreover deprived of my eyesight the dearest gift of heaven think not i say though i suffer all this by the cruel will of alexius comnenus that therefore i hold him to be mine enemy on the contrary it is by his means that the blinded and miserable prisoner has been taught to seek a liberty far more unconstrained than this poor earth can afford and a vision far more clear than any mount pisgah on this wretched side of the grave can give us shall i therefore account the emperor among mine enemies he who has taught me the vanity of earthly things the nothingness of earthly enjoyments and the pure hope of a better world as a certain exchange for the misery of the present no the emperor had stood somewhat disconcerted at the beginning of this speech but hearing it so very unexpectedly terminate as he was willing to suppose much in his own favour he threw himself into an attitude which was partly that of a modest person listening to his own praises and partly that of a man highly struck with the commendations heaped upon him by a generous adversary my friend he said aloud how truly do you read my purpose when you suppose that the knowledge which men of your disposition can extract from evil was all the experience which i wished you to derive from a captivity protracted by adverse circumstances far very far beyond my wishes let me embrace the generous man who knows so well how to construe the purpose of a perplexed but still faithful friend the patient raised himself in his bed hold there he said methinks my faculties begin to collect themselves yes he muttered that is the treacherous voice which first bid me welcome as a friend and then commanded fiercely that i should be deprived of the sight of my eyes increase thy rigour if thou wilt comnenus add if thou canst to the torture of my confinement but since i cannot see thy hypocritical and inhuman features spare me in mercy the sound of a voice more distressing to mine ear than toads than serpents than whatever nature has most offensive and disgusting this speech was delivered with so much energy that it was in vain that the emperor strove to interrupt its tenor although he himself as well as douban and his daughter heard a great deal more of the language of unadorned and natural passion than he had counted upon raise thy head rash man he said and charm thy tongue ere it proceed in a strain which may cost thee dear look at me and see if i have not reserved a reward capable of atoning for all the evil which thy folly may charge to my account hitherto the prisoner had remained with his eyes obstinately shut regarding the imperfect recollection he had of sights which had been before his eyes the foregoing evening as the mere suggestion of a deluded imagination if not actually presented by some seducing spirit but now when his eyes fairly encountered the stately figure of the emperor and the graceful form of his lovely daughter painted in the tender rays of the morning dawn he ejaculated faintly i see i see and with that ejaculation fell back on the pillow in a swoon which instantly found employment for douban and his restoratives a most wonderful cure indeed exclaimed the physician and the height of my wishes would be to possess such another miraculous restorative fool said the emperor canst thou not conceive that what has never been taken away is restored with little difficulty he was made he said lowering his voice to undergo a painful operation which led him to believe that the organs of sight were destroyed and as light scarcely ever visited him and when it did only in doubtful and invisible glimmerings the prevailing darkness both physical and mental that surrounded him prevented him from being sensible of the existence of that precious faculty of which he imagined himself bereft perhaps thou wilt ask my reason for inflicting upon him so strange a deception simply it was that being by it conceived incapable of reigning his memory might pass out of the minds of the public while at the same time i reserved his eyesight that in case occasion should call it might be in my power once more to liberate him from his dungeon and employ as i now propose to do his courage and talents in the service of the empire to counterbalance those of other conspirators and can your imperial highness said douban hope that you have acquired this mans duty and affection by the conduct you have observed to him i cannot tell answered the emperor that must be as futurity shall determine all i know is that it is no fault of mine if ursel does not reckon freedom and a long course of empire perhaps sanctioned by an alliance with our own blood and the continued enjoyment of the precious organs of eyesight of which a less scrupulous man would have deprived him against a maimed and darkened existence since such is your highnesss opinion and resolution said douban it is for me to aid and not to counteract it permit me therefore to pray your highness and the princess to withdraw that i may use such remedies as may confirm a mind which has been so strangely shaken and restore to him fully the use of those eyes of which he has been so long deprived i am content douban said the emperor but take notice ursel is not totally at liberty until he has expressed the resolution to become actually mine it may behove both him and thee to know that although there is no purpose of remitting him to the dungeons of the blacquernal palace yet if he or any on his part should aspire to head a party in these feverish times by the honour of a gentleman to swear a frankish oath he shall find that he is not out of the reach of the battleaxes of my varangians i trust to thee to communicate this fact which concerns alike him and all who have interest in his fortunes come daughter we will withdraw and leave the leech with his patient take notice douban it is of importance that you acquaint me the very first moment when the patient can hold rational communication with me alexius and his accomplished daughter departed accordingly chapter the twentyeighth sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous bears yet a precious jewel in its head as you like it from a terraced roof of the blacquernal palace accessible by a sash door which opened from the bedchamber of ursel there was commanded one of the most lovely and striking views which the romantic neighbourhood of constantinople afforded after suffering him to repose and rest his agitated faculties it was to this place that the physician led his patient for when somewhat composed he had of himself requested to be permitted to verify the truth of his restored eyesight by looking out once more upon the majestic face of nature on the one hand the scene which he beheld was a masterpiece of human art the proud city ornamented with stately buildings as became the capital of the world showed a succession of glittering spires and orders of architecture some of them chaste and simple like those the capitals of which were borrowed from basketsfull of acanthus some deriving the fluting of their shafts from the props made originally to support the lances of the earlier greeks forms simple yet more graceful in their simplicity than any which human ingenuity has been able since to invent with the most splendid specimens which ancient art could afford of those strictly classical models were associated those of a later age where more modern taste had endeavoured at improvement and by mixing the various orders had produced such as were either composite or totally out of rule the size of the buildings in which they were displayed however procured them respect nor could even the most perfect judge of architecture avoid being struck by the grandeur of their extent and effect although hurt by the incorrectness of the taste in which they were executed arches of triumph towers obelisks and spires designed for various purposes rose up into the air in confused magnificence while the lower view was filled by the streets of the city the domestic habitations forming long narrow alleys on either side of which the houses arose to various and unequal heights but being generally finished with terraced coverings thick set with plants and flowers and fountains had when seen from an eminence a more noble and interesting aspect than is ever afforded by the sloping and uniform roofs of streets in the capitals of the north of europe it has taken us some time to give in words the idea which was at a single glance conveyed to ursel and affected him at first with great pain his eyeballs had been long strangers to that daily exercise which teaches us the habit of correcting the scenes as they appear to our sight by the knowledge which we derive from the use of our other senses his idea of distance was so confused that it seemed as if all the spires turrets and minarets which he beheld were crowded forward upon his eyeballs and almost touching them with a shriek of horror ursel turned himself to the further side and cast his eyes upon a different scene here also he saw towers steeples and turrets but they were those of the churches and public buildings beneath his feet reflected from the dazzling piece of water which formed the harbour of constantinople and which from the abundance of wealth which it transported to the city was well termed the golden horn in one place this superb basin was lined with quays where stately dromonds and argosies unloaded their wealth while by the shore of the haven galleys feluccas and other small craft idly flapped the singularly shaped and snowwhite pinions which served them for sails in other places the golden horn lay shrouded in a verdant mantle of trees where the private gardens of wealthy or distinguished individuals or places of public recreation shot down upon and were bounded by the glassy waters on the bosphorus which might be seen in the distance the little fleet of tancred was lying in the same station they had gained during the night which was fitted to command the opposite landing this their general had preferred to a midnight descent upon constantinople not knowing whether so coming they might be received as friends or enemies this delay however had given the greeks an opportunity either by the orders of alexius or the equally powerful mandates of some of the conspirators to tow six ships of war full of armed men and provided with the maritime offensive weapons peculiar to the greeks at that period which they had moored so as exactly to cover the place where the troops of tancred must necessarily land this preparation gave some surprise to the valiant tancred who did not know that such vessels had arrived in the harbour from lemnos on the preceding night the undaunted courage of that prince was however in no respect to be shaken by the degree of unexpected danger with which his adventure now appeared to be attended this splendid view from the description of which we have in some degree digressed was seen by the physician and ursel from a terrace the loftiest almost on the palace of the blacquernal to the cityward it was bounded by a solid wall of considerable height giving a restingplace for the roof of a lower building which sloping outward broke to the view the vast height unobscured otherwise save by a high and massy balustrade composed of bronze which to the havenward sunk sheer down upon an uninterrupted precipice no sooner therefore had ursel turned his eyes that way than though placed far from the brink of the terrace he exclaimed with a shriek save me save me if you are not indeed the destined executors of the emperors will we are indeed such said douban to save and if possible to bring you to complete recovery but by no means to do you injury or to suffer it to be offered by others guard me then from myself said ursel and save me from the reeling and insane desire which i feel to plunge myself into the abyss to the edge of which you have guided me such a giddy and dangerous temptation is said the physician common to those who have not for a long time looked down from precipitous heights and are suddenly brought to them nature however bounteous hath not provided for the cessation of our faculties for years and for their sudden resumption in full strength and vigour an interval longer or shorter must needs intervene can you not believe this terrace a safe station while you have my support and that of this faithful slave certainly said ursel but permit me to turn my face towards this stone wall for i cannot bear to look at the flimsy piece of wire which is the only battlement of defence that interposes betwixt me and the precipice he spoke of the bronze balustrade six feet high and massive in proportion thus saying and holding fast by the physicians arm ursel though himself a younger and more able man trembled and moved his feet as slowly as if made of lead until he reached the sasheddoor where stood a kind of balconyseat in which he placed himself here he said will i remain and here said douban will i make the communication of the emperor which it is necessary you should be prepared to reply to it places you you will observe at your own disposal for liberty or captivity but it conditions for your resigning that sweet but sinful morsel termed revenge which i must not conceal from you chance appears willing to put into your hand you know the degree of rivalry in which you have been held by the emperor and you know the measure of evil you have sustained at his hand the question is can you forgive what has taken place let me wrap my head round with my mantle said ursel to dispel this dizziness which still oppresses my poor brain and as soon as the power of recollection is granted me you shall know my sentiments he sunk upon the seat muffled in the way which he described and after a few minutes reflection with a trepidation which argued the patient still to be under the nervous feeling of extreme horror mixed with terror he addressed douban thus the operation of wrong and cruelty in the moment when they are first inflicted excites of course the utmost resentment of the sufferer nor is there perhaps a passion which lives so long in his bosom as the natural desire of revenge if then during the first month when i lay stretched upon my bed of want and misery you had offered me an opportunity of revenge upon my cruel oppressor the remnant of miserable life which remained to me should have been willingly bestowed to purchase it but a suffering of weeks or even months must not be compared in effect with that of years for a short space of endurance the body as well as the mind retains that vigorous habit which holds the prisoner still connected with life and teaches him to thrill at the longforgotten chain of hopes of wishes of disappointments and mortifications which affected his former existence but the wounds become callous as they harden and other and better feelings occupy their place while they gradually die away in forgetfulness the enjoyments the amusements of this world occupy no part of his time upon whom the gates of despair have once closed i tell thee my kind physician that for a season in an insane attempt to effect my liberty i cut through a large portion of the living rock but heaven cured me of so foolish an idea and if i did not actually come to love alexius comnenus for how could that have been a possible effect in any rational state of my intellects yet as i became convinced of my own crimes sins and follies the more and more i was also persuaded that alexius was but the agent through whom heaven exercised a dearlypurchased right of punishing me for my manifold offences and transgressions and that it was not therefore upon the emperor that my resentment ought to visit itself and i can now say to thee that so far as a man who has undergone so dreadful a change can be supposed to know his own mind i feel no desire either to rival alexius in a race for empire or to avail myself of any of the various proffers which he proposes to me as the price of withdrawing my claim let him keep unpurchased the crown for which he has paid in my opinion a price which it is not worth this is extraordinary stoicism noble ursel answered the physician douban am i then to understand that you reject the fair offers of alexius and desire instead of all which he is willing nay anxious to bestow to be committed safely back to thy old blinded dungeon in the blacquernal that you may continue at ease those pietistic meditations which have already conducted thee to so extravagant a conclusion physician said ursel while a shuddering fit that affected his whole body testified his alarm at the alternative proposed one would imagine thine own profession might have taught thee that no mere mortal man unless predestined to be a glorified saint could ever prefer darkness to the light of day blindness itself to the enjoyment of the power of sight the pangs of starving to competent sustenance or the damps of a dungeon to the free air of gods creation no it may be virtue to do so but to such a pitch mine does not soar all i require of the emperor for standing by him with all the power my name can give him at this crisis is that he will provide for my reception as a monk in some of those pleasant and well endowed seminaries of piety to which his devotion or his fears have given rise let me not be again the object of his suspicion the operation of which is more dreadful than that of being the object of his hate forgotten by power as i have myself lost the remembrance of those that wielded it let me find my way to the grave unnoticed unconstrained at liberty in possession of my dim and disused organs of sight and above all at peace if such be thy serious and earnest wish noble ursel said the physician i myself have no hesitation to warrant to thee the full accomplishment of thy religious and moderate desires but bethink thee thou art once more an inhabitant of the court in which thou mayst obtain what thou wilt today while tomorrow shouldst thou regret thy indifference it may be thy utmost entreaty will not suffice to gain for thee the slightest extension of thy present conditions be it so said ursel i will then stipulate for another condition which indeed has only reference to this day i will solicit his imperial majesty with all humility to spare me the pain of a personal treaty between himself and me and that he will be satisfied with the solemn assurance that i am most willing to do in his favour all that he is desirous of dictating while on the other hand i desire only the execution of those moderate conditions of my future aliment which i have already told thee at length but wherefore said douban shouldst thou be afraid of announcing to the emperor thy disposition to an agreement which cannot be esteemed otherwise than extremely moderate on thy part indeed i fear the emperor will insist on a brief personal conference i am not ashamed said ursel to confess the truth it is true that i have or think i have renounced what the scripture calls the pride of life but the old adam still lives within us and maintains against the better part of our nature an inextinguishable quarrel easy to be aroused from its slumber but as difficult to be again couched in peace while last night i but half understood that mine enemy was in my presence and while my faculties performed but half their duty in recalling his deceitful and hated accents did not my heart throb in my bosom with all the agitation of a taken bird and shall i again have to enter into a personal treaty with the man who be his general conduct what it may has been the constant and unprovoked cause of my unequalled misery douban no to listen to his voice again were to hear an alarm sounded to every violent and vindictive passion of my heart and though may heaven so help me as my intentions towards him are upright yet it is impossible for me to listen to his professions with a chance of safety either to him or to myself if you be so minded replied douban i shall only repeat to him your stipulation and you must swear to him that you will strictly observe it without this being done it must be difficult or perhaps impossible to settle the league of which both are desirous amen said ursel and as i am pure in my purpose and resolved to keep it to the uttermost so may heaven guard me from the influence of precipitate revenge ancient grudge or new quarrel an authoritative knock at the door of the sleeping chamber was now heard and ursel relieved by more powerful feelings from the giddiness of which he had complained walked firmly into the bedroom and seating himself waited with averted eyes the entrance of the person who demanded admittance and who proved to be no other than alexius comnenus the emperor appeared at the door in a warlike dress suited for the decoration of a prince who was to witness a combat in the lists fought out before him sage douban he said has our esteemed prisoner ursel made his choice between our peace and enmity he hath my lord replied the physician embraced the lot of that happy portion of mankind whose hearts and lives are devoted to the service of your majestys government he will then this day continued the emperor render me the office of putting down all those who may pretend to abet insurrection in his name and under pretext of his wrongs he will my lord replied the physician act to the fullest the part which you require and in what way said the emperor adopting his most gracious tone of voice would our faithful ursel desire that services like these rendered in the hour of extreme need should be acknowledged by the emperor simply answered douban by saying nothing upon the subject he desires only that all jealousies between you and him may be henceforth forgotten and that he may be admitted into one of your highnesss monastic institutions with leave to dedicate the rest of his life to the worship of heaven and its saints hath he persuaded thee of this douban said the emperor in a low and altered voice by heaven when i consider from what prison he was brought and in what guise he inhabited it i cannot believe in this gallless disposition he must at least speak to me himself ere i can believe in some degree the transformation of the fiery ursel into a being so little capable of feeling the ordinary impulses of mankind hear me alexius comnenus said the prisoner and so may thine own prayers to heaven find access and acceptation as thou believest the words which i speak to thee in simplicity of heart if thine empire of greece were made of coined gold it would hold out no bait for my acceptance nor i thank heaven have even the injuries i have experienced at thy hand cruel and extensive as they have been impressed upon me the slightest desire of requiting treachery with treachery think of me as thou wilt so thou seekst not again to exchange words with me and believe me that when thou hast put me under the most rigid of thy ecclesiastical foundations the discipline the fare and the vigils will be far superior to the existence falling to the share of those whom the king delights to honour and who therefore must afford the king their society whenever they are summoned to do so it is hardly for me said the physician to interpose in so high a matter yet as trusted both by the noble ursel and by his highness the emperor i have made a brief abstract of these short conditions to be kept by the high parties towards each other sub crimine falsi the emperor protracted the intercourse with ursel until he more fully explained to him the occasion which he should have that very day for his services when they parted alexius with a great show of affection embraced his late prisoner while it required all the selfcommand and stoicism of ursel to avoid expressing in plain terms the extent to which he abhorred the person who thus caressed him chapter the twentyninth o conspiracy shamst thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention julius caesar the important morning at last arrived on which by the imperial proclamation the combat between the caesar and count robert of paris was appointed to take place this was a circumstance in a great measure foreign to the grecian manners and to which therefore the people annexed different ideas from those which were associated with the same solemn decision of god as the latins called it by the western nations the consequence was a vague but excessive agitation among the people who connected the extraordinary strife which they were to witness with the various causes which had been whispered abroad as likely to give occasion to some general insurrection of a great and terrible nature by the imperial order regular lists had been prepared for the combat with opposite gates or entrances as was usual for the admittance of the two champions and it was understood that the appeal was to be made to the divinity by each according to the forms prescribed by the church of which the combatants were respectively members the situation of these lists was on the side of the shore adjoining on the west to the continent at no great distance the walls of the city were seen of various architecture composed of lime and of stone and furnished with no less than fourandtwenty gates or posterns five of which regarded the land and nineteen the water all this formed a beautiful prospect much of which is still visible the town itself is about nineteen miles in circumference and as it is on all sides surrounded with lofty cypresses its general appearance is that of a city arising out of a stately wood of these magnificent trees partly shrouding the pinnacles obelisks and minarets which then marked the site of many noble christian temples but now generally speaking intimate the position of as many mahomedan mosques these lists for the convenience of spectators were surrounded on all sides by long rows of seats sloping downwards in the middle of these seats and exactly opposite the centre of the lists was a high throne erected for the emperor himself and which was separated from the more vulgar galleries by a circuit of wooden barricades which an experienced eye could perceive might in case of need be made serviceable for purposes of defence the lists were sixty yards in length by perhaps about forty in breadth and these afforded ample space for the exercise of the combat both on horseback and on foot numerous bands of the greek citizens began with the very break of day to issue from the gates and posterns of the city to examine and wonder at the construction of the lists pass their criticisms upon the purposes of the peculiar parts of the fabric and occupy places to secure them for the spectacle shortly after arrived a large band of those soldiers who were called the roman immortals these entered without ceremony and placed themselves on either hand of the wooden barricade which fenced the emperors seat some of them took even a greater liberty for affecting to be pressed against the boundary there were individuals who approached the partition itself and seemed to meditate climbing over it and placing themselves on the same side with the emperor some old domestic slaves of the household now showed themselves as if for the purpose of preserving this sacred circle for alexius and his court and in proportion as the immortals began to show themselves encroaching and turbulent the strength of the defenders of the prohibited precincts seemed gradually to increase there was though scarcely to be observed besides the grand access to the imperial seat from without another opening also from the outside secured by a very strong door by which different persons received admission beneath the seats destined for the imperial party these persons by their length of limb breadth of shoulders by the fur of their cloaks and especially by the redoubted battleaxes which all of them bore appeared to be varangians but although neither dressed in their usual habit of pomp nor in their more effectual garb of war still when narrowly examined they might be seen to possess their usual offensive weapons these men entering in separate and straggling parties might be observed to join the slaves of the interior of the palace in opposing the intrusion of the immortals upon the seat of the emperor and the benches around two or three immortals who had actually made good their frolic and climbed over the division were flung back again very unceremoniously by the barbaric strength and sinewy arms of the varangians the people around and in the adjacent galleries most of whom had the air of citizens in their holyday dresses commented a good deal on these proceedings and were inclined strongly to make part with the immortals it was a shame to the emperor they said to encourage these british barbarians to interpose themselves by violence between his person and the immortal cohorts of the city who were in some sort his own children stephanos the gymnastic whose bulky strength and stature rendered him conspicuous amid this party said without hesitation if there are two people here who will join in saying that the immortals are unjustly deprived of their right of guarding the emperors person here is the hand that shall place them beside the imperial chair not so quoth a centurion of the immortals whom we have already introduced to our readers by the name of harpax not so stephanos that happy time may arrive but it is not yet come my gem of the circus thou knowest that on this occasion it is one of these counts or western franks who undertakes the combat and the varangians who call these people their enemies have some reason to claim a precedency in guarding the lists which it might not at this moment be convenient to dispute with them why man if thou wert half so witty as thou art long thou wouldst be sensible that it were bad woodmanship to raise the hollo upon the game ere it had been driven within compass of the nets while the athlete rolled his huge grey eyes as if to conjure out the sense of this intimation his little friend lysimachus the artist putting himself to pain to stand upon his tiptoe and look intelligent said approaching as near as he could to harpaxs ear thou mayst trust me gallant centurion that this man of mould and muscle shall neither start like a babbling hound on a false scent nor become mute and inert when the general signal is given but tell me said he speaking very low and for that purpose mounting a bench which brought him on a level with the centurions ear would it not have been better that a strong guard of the valiant immortals had been placed in this wooden citadel to ensure the object of the day without question said the centurion it was so meant but these strolling varangians have altered their station of their own authority were it not well said lysimachus that you who are greatly more numerous than the barbarians should begin a fray before more of these strangers arrive content ye friend said the centurion coldly we know our time an attack commenced too early would be worse than thrown away nor would an opportunity occur of executing our project in the fitting time if an alarm were prematurely given at this moment so saying he shuffled off among his fellowsoldiers so as to avoid suspicious intercourse with such persons as were only concerned with the civic portion of the conspirators as the morning advanced and the sun took a higher station in the horizon the various persons whom curiosity or some more decided motive brought to see the proposed combat were seen streaming from different parts of the town and rushing to occupy such accommodation as the circuit round the lists afforded them in their road to the place where preparation for combat was made they had to ascend a sort of cape which in the form of a small hill projected into the hellespont and the butt of which connecting it with the shore afforded a considerable ascent and of course a more commanding view of the strait between europe and asia than either the immediate vicinity of the city or the still lower ground upon which the lists were erected in passing this height the earlier visitants of the lists made little or no halt but after a time when it became obvious that those who had hurried forward to the place of combat were lingering there without any object or occupation they that followed them in the same route with natural curiosity paid a tribute to the landscape bestowing some attention on its beauty and paused to see what auguries could be collected from the water which were likely to have any concern in indicating the fate of the events that were to take place some straggling seamen were the first who remarked that a squadron of the greek small craft being that of tancred were in the act of making their way from asia and threatening a descent upon constantinople it is strange said a person by rank the captain of a galley that these small vessels which were ordered to return to constantinople as soon as they disembarked the latins should have remained so long at scutari and should not be rowing back to the imperial city until this time on the second day after their departure from thence i pray to heaven said another of the same profession that these seamen may come alone it seems to me as if their ensignstaffs bowsprits and topmasts were decorated with the same ensigns or nearly the same with those which the latins displayed upon them when by the emperors order they were transported towards palestine so methinks the voyage back again resembles that of a fleet of merchant vessels who have been prevented from discharging their cargo at the place of their destination there is little good said one of the politicians whom we formerly noticed in dealing with such commodities whether they are imported or exported yon ample banner which streams over the foremost galley intimates the presence of a chieftain of no small rank among the counts whether it be for valour or for nobility the seafaring leader added with the voice of one who hints alarming tidings they seem to have got to a point in the straits as high as will enable them to run down with the tide and clear the cape which we stand on although with what purpose they aim to land so close beneath the walls of the city he is a wiser man than i who pretends to determine assuredly returned his comrade the intention is not a kind one the wealth of the city has temptations to a poor people who only value the iron which they possess as affording them the means of procuring the gold which they covet ay brother answered demetrius the politician but see you not lying at anchor within this bay which is formed by the cape and at the very point where these heretics are likely to be carried by the tide six strong vessels having the power of sending forth not merely showers of darts and arrows but of grecian fire as it is called from their hollow decks if these frank gentry continue directing their course upon the imperial city being as they are propago contemptrix superum sane saevaeque avidissima caedis et violenta footnote ovid met we shall speedily see a combat better worth witnessing than that announced by the great trumpet of the varangians if you love me let us sit down here for a moment and see how this matter is to end an excellent motion my ingenious friend said lascaris which was the name of the other citizen but bethink you shall we not be in danger from the missiles with which the audacious latins will not fail to return the greek fire if according to your conjecture it shall be poured upon them by the imperial squadron that is not ill argued my friend said demetrius but know that you have to do with a man who has been in such extremities before now and if such a discharge should open from the sea i would propose to you to step back some fifty yards inland and thus to interpose the very crest of the cape between us and the discharge of missiles a mere child might thus learn to face them without any alarm you are a wise man neighbour said lascaris and possess such a mixture of valour and knowledge as becomes a man whom a friend might be supposed safely to risk his life with there be those for instance who cannot show you the slightest glimpse of what is going on without bringing you within peril of your life whereas you my worthy friend demetrius between your accurate knowledge of military affairs and your regard for your friend are sure to show him all that is to be seen without the least risk to a person who is naturally unwilling to think of exposing himself to injury but holy virgin what is the meaning of that red flag which the greek admiral has this instant hoisted why you see neighbour answered demetrius yonder western heretic continues to advance without minding the various signs which our admiral has made to him to desist and now he hoists the bloody colours as if a man should clench his fist and say if you persevere in your uncivil intention i will do so and so by st sophia said lascaris and that is giving him fair warning but what is it the imperial admiral is about to do run run friend lascaris said demetrius or you will see more of that than perchance you have any curiosity for accordingly to add the strength of example to precept demetrius himself girt up his loins and retreated with the most edifying speed to the opposite side of the ridge accompanied by the greater part of the crowd who had tarried there to witness the contest which the newsmonger promised and were determined to take his word for their own safety the sound and sight which had alarmed demetrius was the discharge of a large portion of greek fire which perhaps may be best compared to one of those immense congreve rockets of the present day which takes on its shoulders a small grapnel or anchor and proceeds groaning through the air like a fiend overburdened by the mandate of some inexorable magician and of which the operation was so terrifying that the crews of the vessels attacked by this strange weapon frequently forsook every means of defence and ran themselves ashore one of the principal ingredients of this dreadful fire was supposed to be naphtha or the bitumen which is collected on the banks of the dead sea and which when in a state of ignition could only be extinguished by a very singular mixture and which it was not likely to come in contact with it produced a thick smoke and loud explosion and was capable says gibbon of communicating its flames with equal vehemence in descent or lateral progress footnote for a full account of the greek five see gibbon chapter in sieges it was poured from the ramparts or launched like our bombs in redhot balls of stone or iron or it was darted in flax twisted round arrows and in javelins it was considered as a state secret of the greatest importance and for wellnigh four centuries it was unknown to the mahomedans but at length the composition was discovered by the saracens and used by them for repelling the crusaders and overpowering the greeks upon whose side it had at one time been the most formidable implement of defence some exaggeration we must allow for a barbarous period but there seems no doubt that the general description of the crusader joinville should be admitted as correct it came flying through the air says that good knight like a winged dragon about the thickness of a hogshead with the report of thunder and the speed of lightning and the darkness of the night was dispelled by this horrible illumination not only the bold demetrius and his pupil lascaris but all the crowd whom they influenced fled manfully when the commodore of the greeks fired the first discharge and as the other vessels in the squadron followed his example the heavens were filled with the unusual and outrageous noise while the smoke was so thick as to darken the very air as the fugitives passed the crest of the hill they saw the seaman whom we formerly mentioned as a spectator snugly reclining under cover of a dry ditch where he managed so as to secure himself as far as possible from any accident he could not however omit breaking his jest on the politicians what ho he cried my good friends without raising himself above the counterscarp of his ditch will you not remain upon your station long enough to finish that hopeful lecture upon battle by sea and land which you had so happy an opportunity of commencing believe me the noise is more alarming than hurtful the fire is all pointed in a direction opposite to yours and if one of those dragons which you see does happen to fly landward instead of seaward it is but the mistake of some cabinboy who has used his linstock with more willingness than ability demetrius and lascaris just heard enough of the naval heros harangue to acquaint them with the new danger with which they might be assailed by the possible misdirection of the weapons and rushing clown towards the lists at the head of a crowd halfdesperate with fear they hastily propagated the appalling news that the latins were coming back from asia with the purpose of landing in arms pillaging and burning the city the uproar in the meantime of this unexpected occurrence was such as altogether to vindicate in public opinion the reported cause however exaggerated the thunder of the greek fire came successively one hard upon the other and each in its turn spread a blot of black smoke upon the face of the landscape which thickened by so many successive clouds seemed at last like that raised by a sustained fire of modern artillery to overshadow the whole horizon the small squadron of tancred were completely hid from view in the surging volumes of darkness which the breath of the weapons of the enemy had spread around him and it seemed by a red light which began to show itself among the thickest of the veil of darkness that one of the flotilla at least had caught fire yet the latins resisted with an obstinacy worthy of their own courage and the fame of their celebrated leader some advantage they had on account of their small size and their lowness in the water as well as the clouded state of the atmosphere which rendered them difficult marks for the fire of the greeks to increase these advantages tancred as well by boats as by the kind of rude signals made use of at the period dispersed orders to his fleet that each bark disregarding the fate of the others should press forward individually and that the men from each should be put on shore wheresoever and howsoever they could effect that manoeuvre tancred himself set a noble example he was on board a stout vessel fenced in some degree against the effect of the greek fire by being in a great measure covered with raw hides which hides had also been recently steeped in water this vessel contained upwards of a hundred valiant warriors several of them of knightly order who had all night toiled at the humble labours of the oar and now in the morning applied their chivalrous hands to the arblast and to the bow which were in general accounted the weapons of persons of a lower rank thus armed and thus manned prince tancred bestowed upon his bark the full velocity which wind and tide and oar could enable her to obtain and placing her in the situation to profit by them as much as his maritime skill could direct he drove with the speed of lightning among the vessels of lemnos plying on either side bows crossbows javelins and military missiles of every kind with the greater advantage that the greeks trusting to their artificial fire had omitted arming themselves with other weapons so that when the valiant crusader bore down on them with so much fury repaying the terrors of their fire with a storm of bolts and arrows no less formidable they began to feel that their own advantage was much less than they had supposed and that like most other dangers the maritime fire of the greeks when undauntedly confronted lost at least onehalf of its terrors the grecian sailors too when they observed the vessels approach so near filled with the steelclad latins began to shrink from a contest to be maintained hand to hand with so terrible an enemy by degrees smoke began to issue from the sides of the great grecian argosy and the voice of tancred announced to his soldiers that the grecian admirals vessel had taken fire owing to negligence in the management of the means of destruction she possessed and that all they had now to do was to maintain such a distance as to avoid sharing her fate sparkles and flashes of flame were next seen leaping from place to place on board of the great hulk as if the element had had the sense and purpose of spreading wider the consternation and disabling the few who still paid attention to the commands of their admiral and endeavoured to extinguish the fire the consciousness of the combustible nature of the freight began to add despair to terror from the boltsprit the rigging the yards the sides and every part of the vessel the unfortunate crew were seen dropping themselves to exchange for the most part a watery death for one by the more dreadful agency of fire the crew of tancreds bark ceasing by that generous princes commands to offer any additional annoyance to an enemy who was at once threatened by the perils of the ocean and of conflagration ran their vessel ashore in a smooth part of the bay and jumping into the shallow sea made the land without difficulty many of their steeds being by the exertions of the owners and the docility of the animals brought ashore at the same time with their masters their commander lost no time in forming their serried ranks into a phalanx of lancers few indeed at first but perpetually increasing as ship after ship of the little flotilla ran ashore or having more deliberately moored their barks landed their men and joined their companions the cloud which had been raised by the conflict was now driven to leeward before the wind and the strait exhibited only the relics of the combat here tossed upon the billows the scattered and broken remains of one or two of the latin vessels which had been burnt at the commencement of the combat though their crews by the exertions of their comrades had in general been saved lower down were seen the remaining five vessels of the lemnos squadron holding a disorderly and difficult retreat with the purpose of gaining the harbour of constantinople in the place so late the scene of combat lay moored the hulk of the grecian admiral burnt to the waters edge and still sending forth a black smoke from its scathed beams and planks the flotilla of tancred busied in discharging its troops lay irregularly scattered along the bay the men making ashore as they could and taking their course to join the standard of their leader various black substances floated on the surface of the water nearer or more distant to the shore some proved to be the wreck of the vessels which had been destroyed and others more ominous still the lifeless bodies of mariners who had fallen in the conflict the standard had been borne ashore by the princes favourite page ernest of apulia so soon as the keel of tancreds galley had grazed upon the sand it was then pitched on the top of that elevated cape between constantinople and the lists where lascaris demetrius and other gossips had held their station at the commencement of the engagement but from which all had fled between the mingled dread of the greek fire and the missiles of the latin crusaders chapter the thirtieth sheathed in complete armour and supporting with his right hand the standard of his fathers tancred remained with his handful of warriors like so many statues of steel expecting some sort of attack from the grecian party which had occupied the lists or from the numbers whom the city gates began now to pour forth soldiers some of them and others citizens many of whom were arrayed as if for conflict these persons alarmed by the various accounts which were given of the combatants and the progress of the fight rushed towards the standard of prince tancred with the intention of beating it to the earth and dispersing the guards who owed it homage and defence but if the reader shall have happened to have ridden at any time through a pastoral country with a clog of a noble race following him he must have remarked in the deference ultimately paid to the highbred animal by the shepherds cur as he crosses the lonely glen of which the latter conceives himself the lord and guardian something very similar to the demeanour of the incensed greeks when they approached near to the little band of franks at the first symptom of the intrusion of a stranger the dog of the shepherd starts from his slumbers and rushes towards the noble intruder with a clamorous declaration of war but when the diminution of distance between them shows to the aggressor the size and strength of his opponent he becomes like a cruiser who in a chase has to his surprise and alarm found two tier of guns opposed to him instead of one he halts suspends his clamorous yelping and in fine ingloriously retreats to his master with all the dishonourable marks of positively declining the combat it was in this manner that the troops of the noisy greeks with much hallooing and many a boastful shout hastened both from the town and from the lists with the apparent intention of sweeping from the field the few companions of tancred as they advanced however within the power of remarking the calm and regular order of those men who had landed and arranged themselves under this noble chieftains banner their minds were altogether changed as to the resolution of instant combat their advance became an uncertain and staggering gait their heads were more frequently turned back to the point from which they came than towards the enemy and their desire to provoke an instant scuffle vanished totally when there did not appear the least symptom that their opponents cared about the matter it added to the extreme confidence with which the latins kept their ground that they were receiving frequent though small reinforcements from their comrades who were landing by detachments all along the beach and that in the course of a short hour their amount had been raised on horseback and foot to a number allowing for a few casualties not much less than that which set sail from scutari another reason why the latins remained unassailed was certainly the indisposition of the two principal armed parties on shore to enter into a quarrel with them the guards of every kind who were faithful to the emperor more especially the varangians had their orders to remain firm at their posts some in the lists and others at various places of rendezvous in constantinople where their presence was necessary to prevent the effects of the sudden insurrection which alexius knew to be meditated against him these therefore made no hostile demonstration towards the band of latins nor was it the purpose of the emperor they should do so on the other hand the greater part of the immortal guards and those citizens who were prepared to play a part in the conspiracy had been impressed by the agents of the deceased agelastes with the opinion that this band of latins commanded by tancred the relative of bohemond had been despatched by the latter to their assistance these men therefore stood still and made no attempt to guide or direct the popular efforts of such as inclined to attack these unexpected visitors in which purpose therefore no very great party were united while the majority were willing enough to find an apology for remaining quiet in the meantime the emperor from his palace of blacquernal observed what passed upon the straits and beheld his navy from lemnos totally foiled in their attempt by means of the greek fire to check the intended passage of tancred and his men he had no sooner seen the leading ship of the squadron begin to beacon the darkness with its own fire than the emperor formed a secret resolution to disown the unfortunate admiral and make peace with the latins if that should be absolutely necessary by sending them his head he had hardly therefore seen the flames burst forth and the rest of the vessels retreat from their moorings than in his own mind the doom of the unfortunate phraortes for such was the name of the admiral was signed and sealed achilles tatius at the same instant determining to keep a close eye upon the emperor at this important crisis came precipitately into the palace with an appearance of great alarm my lord my imperial lord i am unhappy to be the messenger of such unlucky news but the latins have in great numbers succeeded in crossing the strait from scutari the lemnos squadron endeavoured to stop them as was last night determined upon in the imperial council of war by a heavy discharge of the greek fire one or two of the crusaders vessels were consumed but by far the greater number of them pushed on their course burnt the leading ship of the unfortunate phraortes and it is strongly reported he has himself perished with almost all his men the rest have cut their cables and abandoned the defence of the passage of the hellespont and you achilles tatius said the emperor with what purpose is it that you now bring me this melancholy news at a period so late when i cannot amend the consequences under favour most gracious emperor replied the conspirator not without colouring and stammering such was not my intention i had hoped to submit a plan by which i might easily have prepared the way for correcting this little error well your plan sir said the emperor dryly with your sacred majestys leave said the acolyte i would myself have undertaken instantly to lead against this tancred and his italians the battleaxes of the faithful varangian guard who will make no more account of the small number of franks who have come ashore than the farmer holds of the hordes of rats and mice and such like mischievous vermin who have harboured in his granaries and what mean you said the emperor that i am to do while my anglosaxons fight for my sake your majesty replied achilles not exactly satisfied with the dry and caustic manner in which the emperor addressed him may put yourself at the head of the immortal cohorts of constantinople and i am your security that you may either perfect the victory over the latins or at least redeem the most distant chance of a defeat by advancing at the head of this choice body of domestic troops should the day appear doubtful you yourself achilles tatius returned the emperor have repeatedly assured us that these immortals retain a perverse attachment to our rebel ursel how is it then you would have us intrust our defence to these bands when we have engaged our valiant varangians in the proposed conflict with the flower of the western army did you think of this risk sir follower achilles tatius much alarmed at an intimation indicative of his purpose being known answered that in his haste he had been more anxious to recommend the plan which should expose his own person to the greater danger than that perhaps which was most attended with personal safety to his imperial master i thank you for so doing said the emperor you have anticipated my wishes though it is not in my power at present to follow the advice you have given me i would have been well contented undoubtedly had these latins measured their way over the strait again as suggested by last nights council but since they have arrived and stand embattled on our shores it is better that we pay them with money and with spoil than with the lives of our gallant subjects we cannot after all believe that they come with any serious intention of doing us injury it is but the insane desire of witnessing feats of battle and single combat which is to them the breath of their nostrils that can have impelled them to this partial countermarch i impose upon you achilles tatius combining the protospathaire in the same commission with you the duty of riding up to yonder standard and learning of their chief called the prince tancred if he is there in person the purpose of his return and the cause of his entering into debate with phraortes and the lemnos squadron if they send us any reasonable excuse we shall not be averse to receive it at their hands for we have not made so many sacrifices for the preservation of peace to break forth into war if after all so great an evil can be avoided thou wilt receive therefore with a candid and complacent mind such apologies as they may incline to bring forward and be assured that the sight of this puppetshow of a single combat will be enough of itself to banish every other consideration from the reflection of these giddy crusaders a knock was at this moment heard at the door of the emperors apartment and upon the word being given to enter the protospathaire made his appearance he was arrayed in a splendid suit of ancient roman fashioned armour the want of a visor left his countenance entirely visible which pale and anxious as it was did not well become the martial crest and dancing plume with which it was decorated he received the commission already mentioned with the less alacrity because the acolyte was added to him as his colleague for as the reader may have observed these two officers were of separate factions in the army and on indifferent terms with each other neither did the acolyte consider his being united in commission with the protospathaire as a mark either of the emperors confidence or of his own safety he was however in the meantime in the blacquernal where the slaves of the interior made not the least hesitation when ordered to execute any officer of the court the two generals had therefore no other alternative than that which is allowed to two greyhounds who are reluctantly coupled together the hope of achilles tatius was that he might get safely through his mission to tancred after which he thought the successful explosion of the conspiracy might take place and have its course either as a matter desired and countenanced by those latins or passed over as a thing in which they took no interest on either side by the parting order of the emperor they were to mount on horseback at the sounding of the great varangian trumpet put themselves at the head of those anglosaxon guards in the courtyard of their barrack and await the emperors further orders there was something in this arrangement which pressed hard on the conscience of achilles tatius yet he was at a loss to justify his apprehensions to himself unless from a conscious feeling of his own guilt he felt however that in being detained under pretence of an honourable mission at the head of the varangians he was deprived of the liberty of disposing of himself by which he had hoped to communicate with the caesar and hereward whom he reckoned upon as his active accomplices not knowing that the first was at this moment a prisoner in the blacquernal where alexius had arrested him in the apartments of the empress and that the second was the most important support of comnenus during the whole of that eventful day when the gigantic trumpet of the varangian guards sent forth its deep signal through the city the protospathaire hurried achilles along with him to the rendezvous of the varangians and on the way said to him in an easy and indifferent tone as the emperor is in the field in person you his representative or follower will of course transmit no orders to the body guard except such as shall receive their origin from himself so that you will consider your authority as this day suspended i regret said achilles that there should have seemed any cause for such precautions i had hoped my own truth and fidelity but i am obsequious to his imperial pleasure in all things such are his orders said the other officer and you know under what penalty obedience is enforced if i did not said achilles the composition of this body of guards would remind me since it comprehends not only great part of those varangians who are the immediate defenders of the emperors throne but those slaves of the interior who are the executioners of his pleasure to this the protospathaire returned no answer while the more closely the acolyte looked upon the guard which attended to the unusual number of nearly three thousand men the more had he reason to believe that he might esteem himself fortunate if by the intervention of either the caesar agelastes or hereward he could pass to the conspirators a signal to suspend the intended explosion which seemed to be provided against by the emperor with unusual caution he would have given the full dream of empire with which he had been for a short time lulled to sleep to have seen but a glimpse of the azure plume of nicephorus the white mantle of the philosopher or even a glimmer of herewards battleaxe no such objects could be seen anywhere and not a little was the faithless follower displeased to see that whichever way he turned his eyes those of the protospathaire but especially of the trusty domestic officers of the empire seemed to follow and watch their occupation amidst the numerous soldiers whom he saw on all sides his eye did not recognise a single man with whom he could exchange a friendly or confidential glance and he stood in all that agony of terror which is rendered the more discomfiting because the traitor is conscious that beset by various foes his own fears are the most likely of all to betray him internally as the danger seemed to increase and as his alarmed imagination attempted to discern new reasons for it he could only conclude that either one of the three principal conspirators or at least some of the inferiors had turned informers and his doubt was whether he should not screen his own share of what had been premeditated by flinging himself at the feet of the emperor and making a full confession but still the fear of being premature in having recourse to such base means of saving himself joined to the absence of the emperor united to keep within his lips a secret which concerned not only all his future fortunes but life itself he was in the meantime therefore plunged as it were in a sea of trouble and uncertainty while the specks of land which seemed to promise him refuge were distant dimly seen and extremely difficult of attainment chapter the thirtyfirst tomorrow oh thats sudden spare him spare him hes not prepared to die shakspeare at the moment when achilles tatius with a feeling of much insecurity awaited the unwinding of the perilous skein of state politics a private council of the imperial family was held in the hall termed the temple of the muses repeatedly distinguished as the apartment in which the princess anna comnena was wont to make her evening recitations to those who were permitted the honour of hearing prelections of her history the council consisted of the empress irene the princess herself and the emperor with the patriarch of the greek church as a sort of mediator between a course of severity and a dangerous degree of lenity tell not me irene said the emperor of the fine things attached to the praise of mercy here have i sacrificed my just revenge over my rival ursel and what good do i obtain by it why the old obstinate man instead of being tractable and sensible of the generosity which has spared his life and eyes can be with difficulty brought to exert himself in favour of the prince to whom he owes them i used to think that eyesight and the breath of life were things which one would preserve at any sacrifice but on the contrary i now believe men value them like mere toys talk not to me therefore of the gratitude to be excited by saving this ungrateful cub and believe me girl turning to anna that not only will all my subjects should i follow your advice laugh at me for sparing a man so predetermined to work my ruin but even thou thyself wilt be the first to upbraid me with the foolish kindness thou art now so anxious to extort from me your imperial pleasure then said the patriarch is fixed that your unfortunate soninlaw shall suffer death for his accession to this conspiracy deluded by that heathen villain agelastes and the traitorous achilles tatius such is my purpose said the emperor and in evidence that i mean not again to pass over a sentence of this kind with a seeming execution only as in the case of ursel this ungrateful traitor of ours shall be led from the top of the staircase or ladder of acheron as it is called through the large chamber named the hall of judgment at the upper end of which are arranged the apparatus for execution by which i swear swear not at all said the patriarch i forbid thee in the name of that heaven whose voice though unworthy speaks in my person to quench the smoking flax or destroy the slight hope which there may remain that you may finally be persuaded to alter your purpose respecting your misguided soninlaw within the space allotted to him to sue for your mercy remember i pray you the remorse of constantine what means your reverence said irene a trifle replied the emperor not worthy being quoted from such a mouth as the patriarchs being as it probably is a relic of paganism what is it exclaimed the females anxiously in the hope of hearing something which might strengthen their side of the argument and something moved perhaps by curiosity a motive which seldom slumbers in a female bosom even when the stronger passions are in arms the patriarch will tell you answered alexius since you must needs know though i promise you you will not receive any assistance in your argument from a silly legendary tale hear it however said the patriarch for though it is a tale of the olden time and sometimes supposed to refer to the period when heathenism predominated it is no less true that it was a vow made and registered in the chancery of the rightful deity by an emperor of greece what i am now to relate to you continued he is in truth a tale not only of a christian emperor but of him who made the whole empire christian and of that very constantine who was also the first who declared constantinople to be the metropolis of the empire this hero remarkable alike for his zeal for religion and for his warlike achievements was crowned by heaven with repeated victory and with all manner of blessings save that unity in his family which wise men are most ambitious to possess not only was the blessing of concord among brethren denied to the family of this triumphant emperor but a deserving son of mature age who had been supposed to aspire to share the throne with his father was suddenly and at midnight called upon to enter his defence against a capital charge of treason you will readily excuse my referring to the arts by which the son was rendered guilty in the eyes of the father be it enough to say that the unfortunate young man fell a victim to the guilt of his stepmother fausta and that he disdained to exculpate himself from a charge so gross and so erroneous it is said that the anger of the emperor was kept up against his son by the sycophants who called upon constantine to observe that the culprit disdained even to supplicate for mercy or vindicate his innocence from so foul a charge but the deathblow had no sooner struck the innocent youth than his father obtained proof of the rashness with which he had acted he had at this period been engaged in constructing the subterranean parts of the blacquernal palace which his remorse appointed to contain a record of his paternal grief and contrition at the upper part of the staircase called the pit of acheron he caused to be constructed a large chamber still called the hall of judgment for the purpose of execution a passage through an archway in the upper wall leads from the hall to the place of misery where the axe or other engine is disposed for the execution of state prisoners of consequence over this archway was placed a species of marble altar surmounted by an image of the unfortunate crispus the materials were gold and it bore the memorable inscription to my son whom i rashly condemned and too hastily executed when constructing this passage constantine made a vow that he himself and his posterity being reigning emperors would stand beside the statue of crispus at the time when any individual of their family should be led to execution and before they suffered him to pass from the hall of judgment to the chamber of death that they should themselves be personally convinced of the truth of the charge under which he suffered time rolled on the memory of constantine was remembered almost like that of a saint and the respect paid to it threw into shadow the anecdote of his sons death the exigencies of the state rendered it difficult to keep so large a sum in specie invested in a statue which called to mind the unpleasant failings of so great a man your imperial highnesss predecessors applied the metal which formed the statue to support the turkish wars and the remorse and penance of constantine died away in an obscure tradition of the church or of the palace still however unless your imperial majesty has strong reasons to the contrary i shall give it as my opinion that you will hardly achieve what is due to the memory of the greatest of your predecessors unless you give this unfortunate criminal being so near a relation of your own an opportunity of pleading his cause before passing by the altar of refuge being the name which is commonly given to the monument of the unfortunate crispus son of constantine although now deprived both of the golden letters which composed the inscription and the golden image which represented the royal sufferer a mournful strain of music was now heard to ascend the stair so often mentioned if i must hear the caesar nicephorus briennius ere he pass the altar of refuge there must be no loss of time said the emperor for these melancholy sounds announce that he has already approached the hall of judgment both the imperial ladies began instantly with the utmost earnestness to deprecate the execution of the caesars doom and to conjure alexius as he hoped for quiet in his household and the everlasting gratitude of his wife and daughter that he would listen to their entreaties in behalf of an unfortunate man who had been seduced into guilt but not from his heart i will at least see him said the emperor and the holy vow of constantine shall be in the present instance strictly observed but remember you foolish women that the state of crispus and the present caesar is as different as guilt from innocence and that their fates therefore may be justly decided upon opposite principles and with opposite results but i will confront this criminal and you patriarch may be present to render what help is in your power to a dying man for you the wife and mother of the traitor you will methinks do well to retire to the church and pray god for the soul of the deceased rather than disturb his last moments with unavailing lamentations alexius said the empress irene i beseech you to be contented be assured that we will not leave you in this dogged humour of blood shedding lest you make such materials for history as are fitter for the time of nero than of constantine the emperor without reply led the way into the hall of judgment where a much stronger light than usual was already shining up the stair of acheron from which were heard to sound by sullen and intermitted fits the penitential psalms which the greek church has appointed to be sung at executions twenty mute slaves the pale colour of whose turbans gave a ghastly look to the withered cast of their features and the glaring whiteness of their eyeballs ascended two by two as it were from the bowels of the earth each of them bearing in one hand a naked sabre and in the other a lighted torch after these came the unfortunate nicephorus his looks were those of a man halfdead from the terror of immediate dissolution and what he possessed of remaining attention was turned successively to two blackstoled monks who were anxiously repeating religious passages to him alternately from the greek scripture and the form of devotion adopted by the court of constantinople the caesars dress also corresponded to his mournful fortunes his legs and arms were bare and a simple white tunic the neck of which was already open showed that ho had assumed the garments which were to serve his last turn a tall muscular nubian slave who considered himself obviously as the principal person in the procession bore on his shoulder a large heavy headsmans axe and like a demon waiting on a sorcerer stalked step for step after his victim the rear of the procession was closed by a band of four priests each of whom chanted from time to time the devotional psalm which was thundered forth on the occasion and another of slaves armed with bows and quivers and with lances to resist any attempt at rescue if such should be offered it would have required a harder heart than that of the unlucky princess to have resisted this gloomy apparatus of fear and sorrow surrounding at the same time directed against a beloved object the lover of her youth and the husband of her bosom within a few minutes of the termination of his mortal career as the mournful train approached towards the altar of refuge half encircled as it now was by the two great and expanded arms which projected from the wall the emperor who stood directly in the passage threw upon the flame of the altar some chips of aromatic wood steeped in spirit of wine which leaping at once into a blaze illuminated the doleful procession the figure of the principal culprit and the slaves who had most of them extinguished their flambeaux so soon as they had served the purpose of lighting them up the staircase the sudden light spread from the altar failed not to make the emperor and the princess visible to the mournful group which approached through the hall all halted all were silent it was a meeting as the princess has expressed herself in her historical work such as took place betwixt ulysses and the inhabitants of the other world who when they tasted of the blood of his sacrifices recognised him indeed but with empty lamentations and gestures feeble and shadowy the hymn of contrition sunk also into silence and of the whole group the only figure rendered more distinct was the gigantic executioner whose high and furrowed forehead as well as the broad steel of his axe caught and reflected back the bright gleam from the altar alexius saw the necessity of breaking the silence which ensued lest it should give the intercessors for the prisoner an opportunity of renewing their entreaties nicephorus briennius he said with a voice which although generally interrupted by a slight hesitation which procured him among his enemies the nickname of the stutterer yet upon important occasions like the present was so judiciously tuned and balanced in its sentences that no such defect was at all visible nicephorus briennius he said late caesar the lawful doom hath been spoken that having conspired against the life of thy rightful sovereign and affectionate father alexius comnenus thou shalt suffer the appropriate sentence by having thy head struck from thy body here therefore at the last altar of refuge i meet thee according to the vow of the immortal constantine for the purpose of demanding whether thou hast any thing to allege why this doom should not be executed even at this eleventh hour thy tongue is unloosed to speak with freedom what may concern thy life all is prepared in this world and in the next look forward beyond yon archway the block is fixed look behind thee thou seest the axe already sharpened thy place for good or evil in the next world is already determined time flies eternity approaches if thou hast aught to say speak it freely if nought confess the justice of thy sentence and pass on to death the emperor commenced this oration with those looks described by his daughter as so piercing that they dazzled like lightning and his periods if not precisely flowing like burning lava were yet the accents of a man having the power of absolute command and as such produced an effect not only on the criminal but also upon the prince himself whose watery eyes and faltering voice acknowledged his sense and feeling of the fatal import of the present moment rousing himself to the conclusion of what he had commenced the emperor again demanded whether the prisoner had any thing to say in his own defence nicephorus was not one of those hardened criminals who may be termed the very prodigies of history from the coolness with which they contemplated the consummation of their crimes whether in their own punishment or the misfortunes of others i have been tempted he said dropping on his knees and i have fallen i have nothing to allege in excuse of my folly and ingratitude but i stand prepared to die to expiate my guilt a deep sigh almost amounting to a scream was here heard close behind the emperor and its cause assigned by the sudden exclamation of irene my lord my lord your daughter is gone and in fact anna comnena had sunk into her mothers arms without either sense or motion the fathers attention was instantly called to support his swooning child while the unhappy husband strove with the guards to be permitted to go to the assistance of his wife give me but five minutes of that time which the law has abridged let my efforts but assist in recalling her to a life which should be as long as her virtues and her talents deserve and then let me die at her feet for i care not to go an inch beyond the emperor who in fact had been more astonished at the boldness and rashness of nicephorus than alarmed by his power considered him as a man rather misled than misleading others and felt therefore the full effect of this last interview he was besides not naturally cruel where severities were to be enforced under his own eye the divine and immortal constantine he said did not i am persuaded subject his descendants to this severe trial in order further to search out the innocence of the criminals but rather to give to those who came after him an opportunity of generously forgiving a crime which could not without pardon the express pardon of the prince escape unpunished i rejoice that i am born of the willow rather than of the oak and i acknowledge my weakness that not even the safety of my own life or resentment of this unhappy mans treasonable machinations have the same effect with me as the tears of my wife and the swooning of my daughter rise up nicephorus briennius freely pardoned and restored even to the rank of caesar we will direct thy pardon to be made out by the great logothete and sealed with the golden bull for fourandtwenty hours thou art a prisoner until an arrangement is made for preserving the public peace meanwhile thou wilt remain under the charge of the patriarch who will be answerable for thy forthcoming daughter and wife you must now go hence to your own apartment a future time will come during which you may have enough of weeping and embracing mourning and rejoicing pray heaven that i who having been trained on till i have sacrificed justice and true policy to uxorious compassion and paternal tenderness of heart may not have cause at last for grieving in good earnest for all the events of this miscellaneous drama the pardoned caesar who endeavoured to regulate his ideas according to this unexpected change found it as difficult to reconcile himself to the reality of his situation as ursel to the face of nature after having been long deprived of enjoying it so much do the dizziness and confusion of ideas occasioned by moral and physical causes of surprise and terror resemble each other in their effects on the understanding at length he stammered forth a request that he might be permitted to go to the field with the emperor and divert by the interposition of his own body the traitorous blows which some desperate man might aim against that of his prince in a day which was too likely to be one of danger and bloodshed hold there said alexius comnenus we will not begin thy newly redeemed life by renewed doubts of thine allegiance yet it is but fitting to remind thee that thou art still the nominal and ostensible head of those who expect to take a part in this days insurrection and it will be the safest course to trust its pacification to others than to thee go sir compare notes with the patriarch and merit your pardon by confessing to him any traitorous intentions concerning this foul conspiracy with which we may be as yet unacquainted daughter and wife farewell i must now depart for the lists where i have to speak with the traitor achilles tatius and the heathenish infidel agelastes if he still lives but of whose providential death i hear a confirmed rumour yet do not go my dearest father said the princess but let me rather go to encourage the loyal subjects in your behalf the extreme kindness which you have extended towards my guilty husband convinces me of the extent of your affection towards your unworthy daughter and the greatness of the sacrifice which you have made to her almost childish affection for an ungrateful man who put your life in danger that is to say daughter said the emperor smiling that the pardon of your husband is a boon which has lost its merit when it is granted take my advice anna and think otherwise wives and their husbands ought in prudence to forget their offences towards each other as soon as human nature will permit them life is too short and conjugal tranquillity too uncertain to admit of dwelling long upon such irritating subjects to your apartments princesses and prepare the scarletbuskins and the embroidery which is displayed on the cuffs and collars of the caesars robe indicative of his high rank he must not be seen without them on the morrow reverend father i remind you once more that the caesar is in your personal custody from this moment until tomorrow at the same hour they parted the emperor repairing to put himself at the head of his varangian guards the caesar under the superintendence of the patriarch withdrawing into the interior of the blacquernal palace where nicephorus briennius was under the necessity of unthreading the rude eye of rebellion and throwing such lights as were in his power upon the progress of the conspiracy agelastes he said achilles tatius and hereward the varangian were the persons principally entrusted in its progress but whether they had been all true to their engagements he did not pretend to be assured in the female apartments there was a violent discussion betwixt anna comnena and her mother the princess had undergone during the day many changes of sentiment and feeling and though they had finally united themselves into one strong interest in her husbands favour yet no sooner was the fear of his punishment removed than the sense of his ungrateful behaviour began to revive she became sensible also that a woman of her extraordinary attainments who had been by a universal course of flattery disposed to entertain a very high opinion of her own consequence made rather a poor figure when she had been the passive subject of a long series of intrigues by which she was destined to be disposed of in one way or the other according to the humour of a set of subordinate conspirators who never so much as dreamed of regarding her as a being capable of forming a wish in her own behalf or even yielding or refusing a consent her fathers authority over her and right to dispose of her was less questionable but even then it was something derogatory to the dignity of a princess born in the purple an authoress besides and giver of immortality to be without her own consent thrown as it were at the head now of one suitor now of another however mean or disgusting whose alliance could for the time benefit the emperor the consequence of these moody reflections was that anna comnena deeply toiled in spirit for the discovery of some means by which she might assert her sullied dignity and various were the expedients which she revolved chapter the thirtysecond but now the hand of fate is on the curtain and brings the scene to light don sebastian the gigantic trumpet of the varangians sounded its loudest note of march and the squadrons of the faithful guards sheathed in complete mail and enclosing in their centre the person of their imperial master set forth upon their procession through the streets of constantinople the form of alexius glittering in his splendid armour seemed no unmeet central point for the force of an empire and while the citizens crowded in the train of him and his escort there might be seen a visible difference between those who came with the premeditated intention of tumult and the greater part who like the multitude of every great city thrust each other and shout for rapture on account of any cause for which a crowd may be collected together the hope of the conspirators was lodged chiefly in the immortal guards who were levied principally for the defence of constantinople partook of the general prejudices of the citizens and had been particularly influenced by those in favour of ursel by whom previous to his imprisonment they had themselves been commanded the conspirators had determined that those of this body who were considered as most discontented should early in the morning take possession of the posts in the lists most favourable for their purpose of assaulting the emperors person but in spite of all efforts short of actual violence for which the time did not seem to be come they found themselves disappointed in this purpose by parties of the varangian guards planted with apparent carelessness but in fact with perfect skill for the prevention of their enterprise somewhat confounded at perceiving that a design which they could not suppose to be suspected was nevertheless on every part controlled and counterchecked the conspirators began to look for the principal persons of their own party on whom they depended for orders in this emergency but neither the caesar nor agelastes was to be seen whether in the lists or on the military march from constantinople and though achilles tatius rode in the latter assembly yet it might be clearly observed that he was rather attending upon the protospathaire than assuming that independence as an officer which he loved to affect in this manner as the emperor with his glittering bands approached the phalanx of tancred and his followers who were drawn up it will be remembered upon a rising cape between the city and the lists the main body of the imperial procession deflected in some degree from the straight road in order to march past them without interruption while the protospathaire and the acolyte passed under the escort of a band of varangians to bear the emperors inquiries to prince tancred concerning the purpose of his being there with his band the short march was soon performed the large trumpet which attended the two officers sounded a parley and tancred himself remarkable for that personal beauty which tasso has preferred to any of the crusaders except rinaldo deste the creatures of his own poetical imagination advanced to parley with them the emperor of greece said the protospathaire to tancred requires the prince of otranto to show by the two high officers who shall deliver him this message with what purpose he has returned contrary to his oath to the right side of these straits assuring prince tancred at the same time that nothing will so much please the emperor as to receive an answer not at variance with his treaty with the duke of bouillon and the oath which was taken by the crusading nobles and their soldiers since that would enable the emperor in conformity to his own wishes by his kind reception of prince tancred and his troop to show how high is his estimation of the dignity of the one and the bravery of both we wait an answer the tone of the message had nothing in it very alarming and its substance cost prince tancred very little trouble to answer the cause he said of the prince of otranto appearing here with fifty lances is this cartel in which a combat is appointed betwixt nicephorus briennius called the caesar a high member of this empire and a worthy knight of great fame the partner of the pilgrims who have taken the cross in their high vow to rescue palestine from the infidels the name of the said knight is the redoubted robert of paris it becomes therefore an obligation indispensable upon the holy pilgrims of the crusade to send one chief of their number with a body of menatarms sufficient to see as is usual fair play between the combatants that such is their intention may be seen from their sending no more than fifty lances with their furniture and following whereas it would have cost them no trouble to have detached ten times the number had they nourished any purpose of interfering by force or disturbing the fair combat which is about to take place the prince of otranto therefore and his followers will place themselves at the disposal of the imperial court and witness the proceedings of the combat with the most perfect confidence that the rules of fair battle will be punctually observed the two grecian officers transmitted this reply to the emperor who heard it with pleasure and immediately proceeding to act upon the principle which he had laid down of maintaining peace if possible with the crusaders named prince tancred with the protospathaire as field marshals of the lists fully empowered under the emperor to decide all the terms of the combat and to have recourse to alexius himself where their opinions disagreed this was made known to the assistants who were thus prepared for the entry into the lists of the grecian officer and the italian prince in full armour while a proclamation announced to all the spectators their solemn office the same annunciation commanded the assistants of every kind to clear a convenient part of the seats which surrounded the lists on one side that it might serve for the accommodation of prince tancreds followers achilles tatius who was a heedful observer of all these passages saw with alarm that by the last collocation the armed latins were interposed between the immortal guards and the discontented citizens which made it most probable that the conspiracy was discovered and that alexius found he had a good right to reckon upon the assistance of tancred and his forces in the task of suppressing it this added to the cold and caustic manner in which the emperor communicated his commands to him made the acolyte of opinion that his best chance of escape from the danger in which he was now placed was that the whole conspiracy should fall to the ground and that the day should pass without the least attempt to shake the throne of alexius comnenus even then it continued highly doubtful whether a despot so wily and so suspicious as the emperor would think it sufficient to rest satisfied with the private knowledge of the undertaking and its failure with which he appeared to be possessed without putting into exercise the bowstrings and the blindingirons of the mutes of the interior there was however little possibility either of flight or of resistance the least attempt to withdraw himself from the neighbourhood of those faithful followers of the emperor personal foes of his own by whom he was gradually and more closely surrounded became each moment more perilous and more certain to provoke a rupture which it was the interest of the weaker party to delay with whatever difficulty and while the soldiers under achilless immediate authority seemed still to treat him as their superior officer and appeal to him for the word of command it became more and more evident that the slightest degree of suspicion which should be excited would be the instant signal for his being placed under arrest with a trembling heart therefore and eyes dimmed by the powerful idea of soon parting with the light of day and all that it made visible the acolyte saw himself condemned to watch the turn of circumstances over which he could have no influence and to content himself with waiting the result of a drama in which his own life was concerned although the piece was played by others indeed it seemed as if through the whole assembly some signal was waited for which no one was in readiness to give the discontented citizens and soldiers looked in vain for agelastes and the caesar and when they observed the condition of achilles tatius it seemed such as rather to express doubt and consternation than to give encouragement to the hopes they had entertained many of the lower classes however felt too secure in their own insignificance to fear the personal consequences of a tumult and were desirous therefore to provoke the disturbance which seemed hushing itself to sleep a hoarse murmur which attained almost the importance of a shout exclaimed justice justice ursel ursel the rights of the immortal guards c at this the trumpet of the varangians awoke and its tremendous tones were heard to peal loudly over the whole assembly as the voice of its presiding deity a dead silence prevailed in the multitude and the voice of a herald announced in the name of alexius comnenus his sovereign will and pleasure citizens of the roman empire your complaints stirred up by factious men have reached the ear of your emperor you shall yourselves be witness to his power of gratifying his people at your request and before your own sight the visual ray which hath been quenched shall be reillumined the mind whose efforts were restricted to the imperfect supply of individual wants shall be again extended if such is the owners will to the charge of an ample theme or division of the empire political jealousy more hard to receive conviction than the blind to receive sight shall yield itself conquered by the emperors paternal love of his people and his desire to give them satisfaction ursel the darling of your wishes supposed to be long dead or at least believed to exist in blinded seclusion is restored to you well in health clear in eyesight and possessed of every faculty necessary to adorn the emperors favour or merit the affection of the people as the herald thus spoke a figure which had hitherto stood shrouded behind some officers of the interior now stepped forth and flinging from him a dusky veil in which he was wrapt appeared in a dazzling scarlet garment of which the sleeves and buskins displayed those ornaments which expressed a rank nearly adjacent to that of the emperor himself he held in his hand a silver truncheon the badge of delegated command over the immortal guards and kneeling before the emperor presented it to his hands intimating a virtual resignation of the command which it implied the whole assembly were electrified at the appearance of a person long supposed either dead or by cruel means rendered incapable of public trust some recognised the man whose appearance and features were not easily forgot and gratulated him upon his most unexpected return to the service of his country others stood suspended in amazement not knowing whether to trust their eyes while a few determined malecontents eagerly pressed upon the assembly an allegation that the person presented as ursel was only a counterfeit and the whole a trick of the emperor speak to them noble ursel said the emperor tell them that if i have sinned against thee it has been because i was deceived and that my disposition to make thee amends is as ample as ever was my purpose of doing thee wrong friends and countrymen said ursel turning himself to the assembly his imperial majesty permits me to offer my assurance that if in any former part of my life i have suffered at his hand it is more than wiped out by the feelings of a moment so glorious as this and that i am well satisfied from the present instant to spend what remains of my life in the service of the most generous and beneficent of sovereigns or with his permission to bestow it in preparing by devotional exercises for an infinite immortality to be spent in the society of saints and angels whichever choice i shall make i reckon that you my beloved countrymen who have remembered me so kindly during years of darkness and captivity will not fail to afford me the advantage of your prayers this sudden apparition of the longlost ursel had too much of that which elevates and surprises not to captivate the multitude and they sealed their reconciliation with three tremendous shouts which are said to have shaken the air that birds incapable of sustaining themselves sunk down exhausted out of their native element chapter the thirtythird what leave the combat out exclaimed the knight yea or we must renounce the stagyrite so large a crowd the stage will neer contain then build a new or act it on a plain pope the sounds of the gratulating shout had expanded over the distant shores of the bosphorus by mountain and forest and died at length in the farthest echoes when the people in the silence which ensued appeared to ask each other what next scene was about to adorn a pause so solemn and a stage so august the pause would probably have soon given place to some new clamour for a multitude from whatever cause assembled seldom remains long silent had not a new signal from the varangian trumpet given notice of a fresh purpose to solicit their attention the blast had something in its tone spiritstirring and yet melancholy partaking both of the character of a point of war and of the doleful sounds which might be chosen to announce an execution of peculiar solemnity its notes were high and widely extended and prolonged and long dwelt upon as if the brazen clamour had been waked by something more tremendous than the lungs of mere mortals the multitude appeared to acknowledge these awful sounds which were indeed such as habitually solicited their attention to imperial edicts of melancholy import by which rebellions were announced dooms of treason discharged and other tidings of a great and affecting import intimated to the people of constantinople when the trumpet had in its turn ceased with its thrilling and doleful notes to agitate the immense assembly the voice of the herald again addressed them it announced in a grave and affecting strain that it sometimes chanced how the people failed in their duty to a sovereign who was unto them as a father and how it became the painful duty of the prince to use the rod of correction rather than the olive sceptre of mercy fortunate continued the herald it is when the supreme deity having taken on himself the preservation of a throne in beneficence and justice resembling his own has also assumed the most painful task of his earthly delegate by punishing those whom his unerring judgment acknowledges as most guilty and leaving to his substitute the more agreeable task of pardoning such of those as art has misled and treachery hath involved in its snares such being the case greece and its accompanying themes are called upon to listen and learn that a villain namely agelastes who had insinuated himself into the favour of the emperor by affection of deep knowledge and severe virtue had formed a treacherous plan for the murder of the emperor alexius comnenus and a revolution in the state this person who under pretended wisdom hid the doctrines of a heretic and the vices of a sensualist had found proselytes to his doctrines even among the emperors household and those persons who were most bound to him and down to the lower order to excite the last of whom were dispersed a multitude of forged rumours similar to those concerning ursols death and blindness of which your own eyes have witnessed the falsehood the people who had hitherto listened in silence upon this appeal broke forth in a clamorous assent they had scarcely been again silent ere the ironvoiced herald continued his proclamation not korah dathan and abiram he said had more justly or more directly fallen under the doom of an offended deity than this villain agelastes the steadfast earth gaped to devour the apostate sons of israel but the termination of this wretched mans existence has been as far as can now be known by the direct means of an evil spirit whom his own arts had evoked into the upper air by the spirit as would appear by the testimony of a noble lady and other females who witnessed the termination of his life agelastes was strangled a fate wellbecoming his odious crimes such a death even of a guilty man must indeed be most painful to the humane feelings of the emperor because it involves suffering beyond this world but the awful catastrophe carries with it this comfort that it absolves the emperor from the necessity of carrying any farther a vengeance which heaven itself seems to have limited to the exemplary punishment of the principal conspirator some changes of offices and situations shall be made for the sake of safety and good order but the secret who had or who had not been concerned in this awful crime shall sleep in the bosoms of the persons themselves implicated since the emperor is determined to dismiss their offence from his memory as the effect of a transient delusion let all therefore who now hear me whatever consciousness they may possess of a knowledge of what was this day intended return to their houses assured that their own thoughts will be their only punishment let them rejoice that almighty goodness has saved them from the meditations of their own hearts and according to the affecting language of scripture let them repent and sin no more lest a worse thing befall them the voice of the herald then ceased and was again answered by the shouts of the audience these were unanimous for circumstances contributed to convince the malecontent party that they stood at the sovereigns mercy and the edict that they heard having shown his acquaintance with their guilt it lay at his pleasure to let loose upon them the strength of the varangians while from the terms on which it had pleased him to receive tancred it was probable that the apuleian forces were also at his disposal the voices therefore of the bulky stephanos of harpax the centurion and other rebels both of the camp and city were the first to thunder forth their gratitude for the clemency of the emperor and their thanks to heaven for his preservation the audience reconciled to the thoughts of the discovered and frustrated conspiracy began meantime according to their custom to turn themselves to the consideration of the matter which had more avowedly called them together and private whispers swelling by degrees into murmurs began to express the dissatisfaction of the citizens at being thus long assembled without receiving any communication respecting the announced purpose of their meeting alexius was not slow to perceive the tendency of their thoughts and on a signal from his hand the trumpets blew a point of war in sounds far more lively than those which had prefaced the imperial edict robert count of paris then said a herald art thou here in thy place or by knightly proxy to answer the challenge brought against thee by his imperial highness nicephorus briennius caesar of this empire the emperor conceived himself to have equally provided against the actual appearance at this call of either of the parties named and had prepared an exhibition of another kind namely certain cages tenanted by wild animals which being now loosened should do their pleasure with each other in the eyes of the assembly his astonishment and confusion therefore were great when as the last note of the proclamation died in the echo count robert of paris stood forth armed capapie his mailed charger led behind him from within the curtained enclosure at one end of the lists as if ready to mount at the signal of the marshal the alarm and the shame that were visible in every countenance near the imperial presence when no caesar came forth in like fashion to confront the formidable frank were not of long duration hardly had the style and title of the count of paris been duly announced by the heralds and their second summons of his antagonist uttered in due form when a person dressed like one of the varangian guards sprung into the lists and announced himself as ready to do battle in the name and place of the caesar nicephorus briennius and for the honour of the empire alexius with the utmost joy beheld this unexpected assistance and readily gave his consent to the bold soldier who stood thus forward in the hour of utmost need to take upon himself the dangerous office of champion he the more readily acquiesced as from the size and appearance of the soldier and the gallant bearing he displayed he had no doubt of his individual person and fully confided in his valour but prince tancred interposed his opposition the lists he said were only open to knights and nobles or at any rate men were not permitted to meet therein who were not of some equality of birth and blood nor could he remain a silent witness where the laws of chivalry are in such respects forgotten let count robert of paris said the varangian look upon my countenance and say whether he has not by promise removed all objection to our contest which might be founded upon an inequality of condition and let him be judge himself whether by meeting me in this field he will do more than comply with a compact which he has long since become bound by count robert upon this appeal advanced and acknowledged without further debate that notwithstanding their difference of rank he held himself bound by his solemn word to give this valiant soldier a meeting in the field that he regretted on account of this gallant mans eminent virtues and the high services he had received at his hands that they should now stand upon terms of such bloody arbitration but since nothing was more common than that the fate of war called on friends to meet each other in mortal combat he would not shrink from the engagement he had pledged himself to nor did he think his quality in the slightest degree infringed or diminished by meeting in battle a warrior so well known and of such good account as hereward the brave varangian he added that he willingly admitted that the combat should take place on foot and with the battleaxe which was the ordinary weapon of the varangian guard hereward had stood still almost like a statue while this discourse passed but when the count of paris had made this speech he inclined himself towards him with a grateful obeisance and expressed himself honoured and gratified by the manly manner in which the count acquitted himself according to his promise with complete honour and fidelity what we are to do said count robert with a sigh of regret which even his love of battle could not prevent let us do quickly the heart may be affected but the hand must do its duty hereward assented with the additional remark let us then lose no more time which is already flying fast and grasping his axe he stood prepared for combat i also am ready said count robert of paris taking the same weapon from a varangian soldier who stood by the lists both were immediately upon the alert nor did further forms or circumstances put off the intended duel the first blows were given and parried with great caution and prince tancred and others thought that on the part of count robert the caution was much greater than usual but in combat as in food the appetite increases with the exercise the fiercer passions began as usual to awaken with the clash of arms and the sense of deadly blows some of which were made with great fury on either side and parried with considerable difficulty and not so completely but that blood flowed on both their parts the greeks looked with astonishment on a single combat such as they had seldom witnessed and held their breath as they beheld the furious blows dealt by either warrior and expected with each stroke the annihilation of one or other of the combatants as yet their strength and agility seemed somewhat equally matched although those who judged with more pretension to knowledge were of opinion that count robert spared putting forth some part of the military skill for which he was celebrated and the remark was generally made and allowed that he had surrendered a great advantage by not insisting upon his right to fight upon horseback on the other hand it was the general opinion that the gallant varangian omitted to take advantage of one or two opportunities afforded him by the heat of count roberts temper who obviously was incensed at the duration of the combat accident at length seemed about to decide what had been hitherto an equal contest count robert making a feint on one side of his antagonist struck him on the other which was uncovered with the edge of his weapon so that the varangian reeled and seemed in the act of falling to the earth the usual sound made by spectators at the sight of any painful or unpleasant circumstance by drawing the breath between the teeth was suddenly heard to pass through the assembly while a female voice loud and eagerly exclaimed count robert of paris forget not this day that thou owest a life to heaven and me the count was in the act of again seconding his blow with what effect could hardly be judged when this cry reached his ears and apparently took away his disposition for farther combat i acknowledge the debt he said sinking his battleaxe and retreating two steps from his antagonist who stood in astonishment scarcely recovered from the stunning effect of the blow by which he was so nearly prostrated he sank the blade of his battleaxe in imitation of his antagonist and seemed to wait in suspense what was to be the next process of the combat i acknowledge my debt said the valiant count of paris alike to bertha of britain and to the almighty who has preserved me from the crime of ungrateful bloodguiltiness you have seen the fight gentlemen turning to tancred and his chivalry and can testify on your honour that it has been maintained fairly on both sides and without advantage on either i presume my honourable antagonist has by this time satisfied the desire which brought me under his challenge and which certainly had no taste in it of personal or private quarrel on my part i retain towards him such a sense of personal obligation as would render my continuing this combat unless compelled to it by selfdefence a shameful and sinful action alexius gladly embraced the terms of truce which he was far from expecting and threw down his warder in signal that the duel was ended tancred though somewhat surprised and perhaps even scandalized that a private soldier of the emperors guard should have so long resisted the utmost efforts of so approved a knight could not but own that the combat had been fought with perfect fairness and equality and decided upon terms dishonourable to neither party the counts character being well known and established amongst the crusaders they were compelled to believe that some motive of a most potent nature formed the principle upon which very contrary to his general practice he had proposed a cessation of the combat before it was brought to a deadly or at least to a decisive conclusion the edict of the emperor upon the occasion therefore passed into a law acknowledged by the assent of the chiefs present and especially affirmed and gratulated by the shouts of the assembled spectators but perhaps the most interesting figure in the assembly was that of the bold varangian arrived so suddenly at a promotion of military renown which the extreme difficulty he had experienced in keeping his ground against count robert had prevented him from anticipating although his modesty had not diminished the indomitable courage with which he maintained the contest he stood in the middle of the lists his face ruddy with the exertion of the combat and not less so from the modest consciousness proper to the plainness and simplicity of his character which was disconcerted by finding himself the central point of the gaze of the multitude speak to me my soldier said alexius strongly affected by the gratitude which he felt was due to hereward upon so singular an occasion speak to thine emperor as his superior for such thou art at this moment and tell him if there is any manner even at the expense of half his kingdom to atone for his own life saved and what is yet dearer for the honour of his country which thou hast so manfully defended and preserved my lord answered hereward your imperial highness values my poor services over highly and ought to attribute them to the noble count of paris first for his condescending to accept of an antagonist so mean in quality as myself and next in generously relinquishing victory when he might have achieved it by an additional blow for i here confess before your majesty my brethren and the assembled grecians that my power of protracting the combat was ended when the gallant count by his generosity put a stop to it do not thyself that wrong brave man said count robert for i vow to our lady of the broken lances that the combat was yet within the undetermined doom of providence when the pressure of my own feelings rendered me incapable of continuing it to the necessary harm perhaps to the mortal damage of an antagonist to whom i owe so much kindness choose therefore the recompense which the generosity of thy emperor offers in a manner so just and grateful and fear not lest mortal voice pronounces that reward unmerited which robert of paris shall avouch with his sword to have been gallantly won upon his own crest you are too great my lord and too noble answered the anglosaxon to be gainsaid by such as i am and i must not awaken new strife between us by contesting the circumstances under which our combat so suddenly closed nor would it be wise or prudent in me further to contradict you my noble emperor generously offers me the right of naming what he calls my recompense but let not his generosity be dispraised although it is from you my lord and not from his imperial highness that i am to ask a boon to me the dearest to which my voice can give utterance and that said the count has reference to bertha the faithful attendant of my wife even so said hereward it is my proposal to request my discharge from the varangian guard and permission to share in your lordships pious and honourable vow for the recovery of palestine with liberty to fight under your honoured banner and permission from time to time to recommend my lovesuit to bertha the attendant of the countess of paris and the hope that it may find favour in the eyes of her noble lord and lady i may thus finally hope to be restored to a country which i have never ceased to love over the rest of the world thy service noble soldier said the count shall be as acceptable to me as that of a born earl nor is there an opportunity of acquiring honour which i can shape for thee to which as it occurs i will not gladly prefer thee i will not boast of what interest i have with the king of england but something i can do with him and it shall be strained to the uttermost to settle thee in thine own beloved native country the emperor then spoke bear witness heaven and earth and you my faithful subjects and you my gallant allies above all you my bold and true varangian guard that we would rather have lost the brightest jewel from our imperial crown than have relinquished the service of this true and faithful anglosaxon but since go he must and will it shall be my study to distinguish him by such marks of beneficence as may make it known through his future life that he is the person to whom the emperor alexius comnenus acknowledged a debt larger than his empire could discharge you my lord tancred and your principal leaders will sup with us this evening and tomorrow resume your honourable and religious purpose of pilgrimage we trust both the combatants will also oblige us by their presence trumpets give the signal for dismission the trumpets sounded accordingly and the different classes of spectators armed and unarmed broke up into various parties or formed into their military ranks for the purpose of their return to the city the screams of women suddenly and strangely raised was the first thing that arrested the departure of the multitude when those who glanced their eyes back saw sylvan the great ourangoutang produce himself in the lists to their surprise and astonishment the women and many of the men who were present unaccustomed to the ghastly look and savage appearance of a creature so extraordinary raised a yell of terror so loud that it discomposed the animal who was the occasion of its being raised sylvan in the course of the night having escaped over the gardenwall of agelastes and clambered over the rampart of the city found no difficulty in hiding himself in the lists which were in the act of being raised having found a lurkingplace in some dark corner under the seats of the spectators from this he was probably dislodged by the tumult of the dispersing multitude and had been compelled therefore to make an appearance in public when he least desired it not unlike that of the celebrated puliccinello at the conclusion of his own drama when he enters in mortal strife with the foul fiend himself a scene which scarcely excites more terror among the juvenile audience than did the unexpected apparition of sylvan among the spectators of the duel bows were bent and javelins pointed by the braver part of the soldiery against an animal of an appearance so ambiguous and whom his uncommon size and grizzly look caused most who beheld him to suppose either the devil himself or the apparition of some fiendish deity of ancient days whom the heathens worshipped sylvan had so far improved such opportunities as had been afforded him as to become sufficiently aware that the attitudes assumed by so many military men inferred immediate danger to his person from which he hastened to shelter himself by flying to the protection of hereward with whom he had been in some degree familiarized he seized him accordingly by the cloak and by the absurd and alarmed look of his fantastic features and a certain wild and gibbering chatter endeavoured to express his fear and to ask protection hereward understood the terrified creature and turning to the emperors throne said aloud poor frightened being turn thy petition and gestures and tones to a quarter which having today pardoned so many offences which were wilfully and maliciously schemed will not be i am sure obdurate to such as thou in thy halfreasoning capacity may have been capable of committing the creature as is the nature of its tribe caught from hereward himself the mode of applying with most effect his gestures and pitiable supplication while the emperor notwithstanding the serious scene which had just past could not help laughing at the touch of comedy flung into it by this last incident my trusty hereward he said aside i will not again call him edward if i can help it thou art the refuge of the distressed whether it be man or beast and nothing that sues through thy intercession while thou remainest in our service shall find its supplication in vain do thou good hereward for the name was now pretty well established in his imperial memory and such of thy companions as know the habits of the creature lead him back to his old quarters in the blacquernal and that done my friend observe that we request thy company and that of thy faithful mate bertha to partake supper at our court with our wife and daughter and such of our servants and allies as we shall request to share the same honour be assured that while thou remainest with us there is no point of dignity which shall not be willingly paid to thee and do thou approach achilles tatius as much favoured by thine emperor as before this day dawned what charges are against thee have been only whispered in a friendly ear which remembers them not unless which heaven forefend their remembrance is renewed by fresh offences achilles tatius bowed till the plume of his helmet mingled with the mane of his fiery horse but held it wisest to forbear any answer in words leaving his crime and his pardon to stand upon those general terms in which the emperor had expressed them once more the multitude of all ranks returned on their way to the city nor did any second interruption arrest their march sylvan accompanied by one or two varangians who led him in a sort of captivity took his way to the vaults of the blacquernal which were in fact his proper habitation upon the road to the city harpax the notorious corporal of the immortal guards held a discourse with one or two of his own soldiers and of the citizens who had been members of the late conspiracy so said stephanos the prizefighter a fine affair we have made of it to suffer ourselves to be all anticipated and betrayed by a thick sculled varangian every chance turning against us as they would against corydon the shoemaker if he were to defy me to the circus ursel whose death made so much work turns out not to be dead after all and what is worse he lives not to our advantage this fellow hereward who was yesterday no better than myself what do i say better he was a great deal worse an insignificant nobody in every respect is now crammed with honours praises and gifts till he wellnigh returns what they have given him and the caesar and the acolyte our associates have lost the emperors love and confidence and if they are suffered to survive it must be like the tame domestic poultry whom we pamper with food one day that upon the next their necks may be twisted for spit or spot stephanos replied the centurion thy form of body fits thee well for the palaestra but thy mind is not so acutely formed as to detect that which is real from that which is only probable in the political world of which thou art now judging considering the risk incurred by lending a mans ear to a conspiracy thou oughtest to reckon it a saving in every particular where he escapes with his life and character safe this has been the case with achilles tatius and with the caesar they have remained also in their high places of trust and power and maybe confident that the emperor will hardly dare to remove them at a future period since the possession of the full knowledge of their guilt has not emboldened him to do so their power thus left with them is in fact ours nor is there a circumstance to be supposed which can induce them to betray their confederates to the government it is much more likely that they will remember them with the probability of renewing at a finer time the alliance which binds them together cheer up thy noble resolution therefore my prince of the circus and think that thou shalt still retain that predominant influence which the favourites of the amphitheatre are sure to possess over the citizens of constantinople i cannot tell answered stephanos but it gnaws at my heart like the worm that dieth not to see this beggarly foreigner betray the noblest blood in the land not to mention the best athlete in the palaestra and move off not only without punishment for his treachery but with praise honour and preferment true said harpax but observe my friend that he does move off to purpose he leaves the land quits the corps in which he might claim preferment and a few vain honours being valued at what such trifles amount to hereward in the course of one or two days shall be little better than a disbanded soldier subsisting by the poor bread which he can obtain as a follower of this beggarly count or which he is rather bound to dispute with the infidel by encountering with his battleaxe the turkish sabres what will it avail him amidst the disasters the slaughter and the famine of palestine that he once upon a time was admitted to supper with the emperor we know alexius comnenus he is willing to discharge at the highest cost such obligations as are incurred to men like this hereward and believe me i think that i see the wily despot shrug his shoulders in derision when one morning he is saluted with the news of a battle in palestine lost by the crusaders in which his old acquaintance has fallen a dead man i will not insult thee by telling thee how easy it might be to acquire the favour of a gentlewoman in waiting upon a lady of quality nor do i think it would be difficult should that be the object of the prizefighter to acquire the property of a large baboon like sylvan which no doubt would set up as a juggler any frank who had meanness of spirit to propose to gain his bread in such a capacity from the alms of the starving chivalry of europe but he who can stoop to envy the lot of such a person ought not to be one whose chief personal distinctions are sufficient to place him first in rank over all the favourites of the amphitheatre there was something in this sophistical kind of reasoning which was but half satisfactory to the obtuse intellect of the prizefighter to whom it was addressed although the only answer which he attempted was couched in this observation ay but noble centurion you forget that besides empty honours this varangian hereward or edward whichever is his name is promised a mighty donative of gold marry you touch me there said the centurion and when you tell me that the promise is fulfilled i will willingly agree that the anglo saxon hath gained something to be envied for but while it remains in the shape of a naked promise you shall pardon me my worthy stephanos if i hold it of no more account than the mere pledges which are distributed among ourselves as well as to the varangians promising upon future occasions mints of money which we are likely to receive at the same time with the last years snow keep up your heart therefore noble stephanos and believe not that your affairs are worse for the miscarriage of this day and let not thy gallant courage sink but remembering those principles upon which it was called into action believe that thy objects are not the less secure because fate has removed their acquisition to a more distant day the veteran and unbending conspirator harpax thus strengthened for some future renewal of their enterprise the failing spirits of stephanos after this such leaders as were included in the invitation given by the emperor repaired to the evening meal and from the general content and complaisance expressed by alexius and his guests of every description it could little have been supposed that the day just passed over was one which had inferred a purpose so dangerous and treacherous the absence of the countess brenhilda during this eventful day created no small surprise to the emperor and those in his immediate confidence who knew her enterprising spirit and the interest she must have felt in the issue of the combat bertha had made an early communication to the count that his lady agitated with the many anxieties of the few preceding days was unable to leave her apartment the valiant knight therefore lost no time in acquainting his faithful countess of his safety and afterwards joining those who partook of the banquet at the palace he bore himself as if the least recollection did not remain on his mind of the perfidious conduct of the emperor at the conclusion of the last entertainment he knew in truth that the knights of prince tancred not only maintained a strict watch round the house where brenhilda remained but also that they preserved a severe ward in the neighbourhood of the blacquernal as well for the safety of their heroic leader as for that of count robert the respected companion of their military pilgrimage it was the general principle of the european chivalry that distrust was rarely permitted to survive open quarrels and that whatever was forgiven was dismissed from their recollection as unlikely to recur but on the present occasion there was a more than usual assemblage of troops which the occurrences of the day had drawn together so that the crusaders were called upon to be particularly watchful it may be believed that the evening passed over without any attempt to renew the ceremonial in the council chamber of the lions which had been upon a former occasion terminated in such misunderstanding indeed it would have been lucky if the explanation between the mighty emperor of greece and the chivalrous knight of paris had taken place earlier for reflection on what had passed had convinced the emperor that the franks were not a people to be imposed upon by pieces of clockwork and similar trifles and that what they did not understand was sure instead of procuring their awe or admiration to excite their anger and defiance nor had it altogether escaped count robert that the manners of the eastern people were upon a different scale from those to which he had been accustomed that they neither were so deeply affected by the spirit of chivalry nor in his own language was the worship of the lady of the broken lances so congenial a subject of adoration this notwithstanding count robert observed that alexius comnenus was a wise and politic prince his wisdom perhaps too much allied to cunning but yet aiding him to maintain with great address that empire over the minds of his subjects which was necessary for their good and for maintaining his own authority he therefore resolved to receive with equanimity whatever should be offered by the emperor either in civility or in the way of jest and not again to disturb an understanding which might be of advantage to christendom by a quarrel founded upon misconception of terms or misapprehension of manners to this prudent resolution the count of paris adhered during the whole evening with some difficulty however since it was somewhat inconsistent with his own fiery and inquisitive temper which was equally desirous to know the precise amount of whatever was addressed to him and to take umbrage at it should it appear in the least degree offensive whether so intended or not chapter the thirtyfourth it was not until after the conquest of jerusalem that count robert of paris returned to constantinople and with his wife and such proportion of his followers as the sword and pestilence had left after that bloody warfare resumed his course to his native kingdom upon reaching italy the first care of the noble count and countess was to celebrate in princely style the marriage of hereward and his faithful bertha who had added to their other claims upon their master and mistress those acquired by herewards faithful services in palestine and no less by berthas affectionate ministry to her lady in constantinople as to the fate of alexius comnenus it may be read at large in the history of his daughter anna who has represented him as the hero of many a victory achieved says the purpleborn in the third chapter and fifteenth book of her history sometimes by his arms and sometimes by his prudence his boldness alone has gained some battles at other times his success has been won by stratagem he has erected the most illustrious of his trophies by confronting danger by combating like a simple soldier and throwing himself bareheaded into the thickest of the foe but there are others continues the accomplished lady which he gained an opportunity of erecting by assuming the appearance of terror and even of retreat in a word he knew alike how to triumph either in flight or in pursuit and remained upright even before those enemies who appeared to have struck him down resembling the military implement termed the calthrop which remains always upright in whatever direction it is thrown on the ground it would be unjust to deprive the princess of the defence she herself makes against the obvious charge of partiality i must still once more repel the reproach which some bring against me as if my history was composed merely according to the dictates of the natural love for parents which is engraved in the hearts of children in truth it is not the effect of that affection which i bear to mine but it is the evidence of matter of fact which obliges me to speak as i have done is it not possible that one can have at the same time an affection for the memory of a father and for truth for myself i have never directed my attempt to write history otherwise than for the ascertainment of the matter of fact with this purpose i have taken for my subject the history of a worthy man is it just that by the single accident of his being the author of my birth his quality of my father ought to form a prejudice against me which would ruin my credit with my readers i have given upon other occasions proofs sufficiently strong of the ardour which i had for the defence of my fathers interests which those that know me can never doubt but on the present i have been limited by the inviolable fidelity with which i respect the truth which i should have felt conscience to have veiled under pretence of serving the renown of my father alexiad chap iii book xv this much we have deemed it our duty to quote in justice to the fair historian we will extract also her description of the emperors death and are not unwilling to allow that the character assigned to the princess by our own gibbon has in it a great deal of fairness and of truth notwithstanding her repeated protests of sacrificing rather to the exact and absolute truth than to the memory of her deceased parent gibbon remarks truly that instead of the simplicity of style and narrative which wins a belief an elaborate affectation of rhetoric and science betrays in every page the vanity of a female author the genuine character of alexius is lost in a vague constellation of virtues and the perpetual strain of panegyric and apology awakens our jealousy to question the veracity of the historian and the merit of the hero we cannot however refuse her judicious and important remark that the disorders of the times were the misfortune and the glory of alexius and that every calamity which can afflict a declining empire was accumulated on his reign by the justice of heaven and the vices of his predecessors gibbons roman empire vol ix p foot note the princess accordingly feels the utmost assurance that a number of signs which appeared in heaven and on earth were interpreted by the soothsayers of the day as foreboding the death of the emperor by these means anna comnena assigned to her father those indications of consequence which ancient historians represent as necessary intimations of the sympathy of nature with the removal of great characters from the world but she fails not to inform the christian reader that her fathers belief attached to none of these prognostics and that even on the following remarkable occasion he maintained his incredulity a splendid statue supposed generally to be a relic of paganism holding in its hand a golden sceptre and standing upon a base of porphyry was overturned by a tempest and was generally believed to be an intimation of the death of the emperor this however he generously repelled phidias he said and other great sculptors of antiquity had the talent of imitating the human frame with surprising accuracy but to suppose that the power of foretelling future events was reposed in these masterpieces of art would be to ascribe to their makers the faculties reserved by the deity for himself when he says it is i who kill and make alive during his latter days the emperor was greatly afflicted with the gout the nature of which has exercised the wit of many persons of science as well as of anna comnena the poor patient was so much exhausted that when the empress was talking of most eloquent persons who should assist in the composition of his history he said with a natural contempt of such vanities the passages of my unhappy life call rather for tears and lamentation than for the praises you speak of a species of asthma having come to the assistance of the gout the remedies of the physicians became as vain as the intercession of the monks and clergy as well as the alms which were indiscriminately lavished two or three deep successive swoons gave ominous warning of the approaching blow and at length was terminated the reign and life of alexius comnenus a prince who with all the faults which may be imputed to him still possesses a real right from the purity of his general intentions to be accounted one of the best sovereigns of the lower empire for some time the historian forgot her pride of literary rank and like an ordinary person burst into tears and shrieks tore her hair and defaced her countenance while the empress irene cast from her her princely habits cut off her hair changed her purple buskins for black mourning shoes and her daughter mary who had herself been a widow took a black robe from one of her own wardrobes and presented it to her mother even in the moment when she put it on says anna comnena the emperor gave up the ghost and in that moment the sun of my life set we shall not pursue her lamentations farther she upbraids herself that after the death of her father that light of the world she had also survived irene the delight alike of the east and of the west and survived her husband also i am indignant she said that my soul suffering under such torrents of misfortune should still deign to animate my body have i not said she been more hard and unfeeling than the rocks themselves and is it not just that one who could survive such a father and mother and such a husband should be subjected to the influence of so much calamity but let me finish this history rather than any longer fatigue my readers with my unavailing and tragical lamentation having thus concluded her history she adds the following two lines the learned comnena lays her pen aside what time her subject and her father died footnote greek laexen hopou biotoio alexios d komnaenos entha kalae thygataer laexen alexiados these quotations will probably give the readers as much as they wish to know of the real character of this imperial historian fewer words will suffice to dispose of the other parties who have been selected from her pages as persons in the foregoing drama there is very little doubt that the count robert of paris whose audacity in seating himself upon the throne of the emperor gives a peculiar interest to his character was in fact a person of the highest rank being no other as has been conjectured by the learned du cange than an ancestor of the house of bourbon which has so long given kings to france he was a successor it has been conceived of the counts of paris by whom the city was valiantly defended against the normans and an ancestor of hugh capet there are several hypotheses upon this subject deriving the wellknown hugh capet first from the family of saxony secondly from st arnoul afterwards bishop of altex third from nibilong fourth from the duke of bavaria and fifth from a natural son of the emperor charlemagne variously placed but in each of these contested pedigrees appears this robert surnamed the strong who was count of that district of which paris was the capital most peculiarly styled the county or isle of france anna comnena who has recorded the bold usurpation of the emperors seat by this haughty chieftain has also acquainted us with his receiving a severe if not a mortal wound at the battle of dorylseum owing to his neglecting the warlike instructions with which her father had favoured him on the subject of the turkish wars the antiquary who is disposed to investigate this subject may consult the late lord ashburnhams elaborate genealogy of the royal house of france also a note of du canges on the princesss history p arguing for the identity of her robert of paris a haughty barbarian with the robert called the strong mentioned as an ancestor of hugh capet gibbon vol xi p may also be consulted the french antiquary and the english historian seem alike disposed to find the church called in the tale that of the lady of the broken lances in that dedicated to st drusas or drosin of soissons who was supposed to have peculiar influence on the issue of combats and to be in the habit of determining them in favour of such champions as spent the night preceding at his shrine in consideration of the sex of one of the parties concerned the author has selected our lady of the broken lances as a more appropriate patroness than st drusas himself for the amazons who were not uncommon in that age gaita for example the wife of robert guiscard a redoubted hero and the parent of a most heroic race of sons was herself an amazon fought in the foremost ranks of the normans and is repeatedly commemorated by our imperial historian anna comnena the reader can easily conceive to himself that robert of paris distinguished himself among his brethrenatarms and fellowcrusaders his fame resounded from the walls of antioch but at the battle of dorylaeum he was so desperately wounded as to be disabled from taking a part in the grandest scene of the expedition his heroic countess however enjoyed the great satisfaction of mounting the walls of jerusalem and in so far discharging her own vows and those of her husband this was the more fortunate as the sentence of the physicians pronounced that the wounds of the count had been inflicted by a poisoned weapon and that complete recovery was only to be hoped for by having recourse to his native air after some time spent in the vain hope of averting by patience this unpleasant alternative count robert subjected himself to necessity or what was represented as such and with his wife and the faithful hereward and all others of his followers who had been like himself disabled from combat took the way to europe by sea a light galley procured at a high rate conducted them safely to venice and from that then glorious city the moderate portion of spoil which had fallen to the counts share among the conquerors of palestine served to convey them to his own dominions which more fortunate than those of most of his fellowpilgrims had been left uninjured by their neighbours during the time of their proprietors absence on the crusade the report that the count had lost his health and the power of continuing his homage to the lady of the broken lances brought upon him the hostilities of one or two ambitious or envious neighbours whose covetousness was however sufficiently repressed by the brave resistance of the countess and the resolute hereward less than a twelvemonth was required to restore the count of paris to his full health and to render him as formerly the assured protector of his own vassals and the subject in whom the possessors of the french throne reposed the utmost confidence this latter capacity enabled count robert to discharge his debt towards hereward in a manner as ample as he could have hoped or expected being now respected alike for his wisdom and his sagacity as much as he always was for his intrepidity and his character as a successful crusader he was repeatedly employed by the court of france in settling the troublesome and intricate affairs in which the norman possessions of the english crown involved the rival nations william rufus was not insensible to his merit nor blind to the importance of gaining his good will and finding out his anxiety that hereward should be restored to the land of his fathers he took or made an opportunity by the forfeiture of some rebellious noble of conferring upon our varangian a large district adjacent to the new forest being part of the scenes which his father chiefly frequented

following introduction to castle dangerous was forwarded by sir walter scott from naples in february together with some corrections of the text and notes on localities mentioned in the novel the materials for the introduction must have been collected before he left scotland in september but in the hurry of preparing for his voyage he had not been able to arrange them so as to accompany the first edition of this romance a few notes supplied by the editor are placed within brackets the incidents on which the ensuing novel mainly turns are derived from the ancient metrical chronicle of the brace by archdeacon barbour and from the history of the houses of douglas and angus by david hume of godscroft and are sustained by the immemorial tradition of the western parts of scotland they are so much in consonance with the spirit and manners of the troubled age to which they are referred that i can see no reason for doubting their being founded in fact the names indeed of numberless localities in the vicinity of douglas castle appear to attest beyond suspicion many even of the smallest circumstances embraced in the story of godscroft among all the associates of robert the brace in his great enterprise of rescuing scotland from the power of edward the first place is universally conceded to james the eighth lord douglas to this day venerated by his countrymen as the good sir james the gud schyr james of douglas that in his time sa worthy was that off his price and his bounte in far landis renownyt was he barbour the good sir james the dreadful blacke douglas that in his dayes so wise and worthie was wha here and on the infidels of spain such honour praise and triumphs did obtain gordon from the time when the king of england refused to reinstate him on his return from france where he had received the education of chivalry in the extensive possessions of his family which had been held forfeited by the exertions of his father william the hardy the young knight of douglas appears to have embraced the cause of bruce with enthusiastic ardour and to have adhered to the fortunes of his sovereign with unwearied fidelity and devotion the douglasse says hollinshed was right joyfully received of king robert in whose service he faithfully continued both in peace and war to his lifes end though the surname and familie of the douglasses was in some estimation of nobilitie before those daies yet the rising thereof to honour chanced through this james douglasse for by meanes of his advancement others of that lineage tooke occasion by their singular manhood and noble prowess shewed at sundrie times in defence of the realme to grow to such height in authoritie and estimation that their mightie puissance in mainrent footnote vassalage lands and great possessions at length was through suspicion conceived by the kings that succeeded the cause in part of their ruinous decay in every narrative of the scottish war of independence a considerable space is devoted to those years of perilous adventure and suffering which were spent by the illustrious friend of bruce in harassing the english detachments successively occupying his paternal territory and in repeated and successful attempts to wrest the formidable fortress of douglas castle itself from their possession in the english as well as scotch chronicles and in rymers foedera occur frequent notices of the different officers intrusted by edward with the keeping of this renowned stronghold especially sir robert de clifford ancestor of the heroic race of the cliffords earls of cumberland his lieutenant sir richard de thurlewalle written sometimes thruswall of thirwall castle on the tippal in northumberland and sir john de walton the romantic story of whose love pledge to hold the castle of douglas for a year and day or surrender all hope of obtaining his mistresss favour with the tragic consequences softened in the novel is given at length in godscroft and has often been pointed out as one of the affecting passages in the chronicles of chivalry footnote the reader will find both this story and that of robert of paris in sir w scotts essay on chivalry published in in the supplement to the encyclopaedia britannica e the author before he had made much progress in this probably the last of his novels undertook a journey to douglasdale for the purpose of examining the remains of the famous castle the kirk of st bride of douglas the patron saint of that great family and the various localities alluded to by godscroft in his account of the early adventures of good sir james but though he was fortunate enough to find a zealous and wellinformed cicerone in mr thomas haddow and had every assistance from the kindness of mr alexander finlay the resident chamberlain of his friend lord douglas the state of his health at the time was so feeble that he found himself incapable of pursuing his researches as in better days he would have delighted to do and was obliged to be contented with such a cursory view of scenes in themselves most interesting as could be snatched in a single morning when any bodily exertion was painful mr haddow was attentive enough to forward subsequently some notes on the points which the author had seemed desirous of investigating but these did not reach him until being obliged to prepare matters for a foreign excursion in quest of health and strength he had been compelled to bring his work such as it is to a conclusion the remains of the old castle of douglas are inconsiderable they consist indeed of but one ruined tower standing at a short distance from the modern mansion which itself is only a fragment of the design on which the duke of douglas meant to reconstruct the edifice after its last accidental destruction by fire footnote the following notice of douglas castle c is from the description of the sheriffdom of lanark by william hamilton of wishaw written in the beginning of the last century and printed by the maitland club of glasgow in douglass parish and baronie and lordship heth very long appertained to the family of douglass and continued with the earles of douglass untill their fatall forfeiture anno during which tyme there are many noble and important actions recorded in histories performed by them by the lords and earls of that great family it was thereafter given to douglass earle of anguse and continued with them untill william earle of anguse was created marquess of douglass anno and is now the principal seat of the marquess of douglass his family it is a large baronie and parish and ane laick patronage and the marquess is both titular and patron he heth there near to the church a very considerable great house called the castle of douglas and near the church is a fyne village called the town of douglass long since erected in a burgh of baronie it heth ane handsome church with many ancient monuments and inscriptions on the old interments of the earles of this place the water of douglas runs quyte through the whole length of this parish and upon either side of the water it is called douglasdale it toucheth clyde towards the north and is bounded by lesmahagow to the west kyle to the southwest crawford john and carmichaell to the south and southeast it is a pleasant strath plentifull in grass and corn and coal and the minister is well provided the lands of heysleside belonging to samuel douglass has a good house and pleasant seat close by wood c p his grace had kept in view the ancient prophecy that as often as douglas castle might be destroyed it should rise again in enlarged dimensions and improved splendour and projected a pile of building which if it had been completed would have much exceeded any noblemans residence then existing in scotland as indeed what has been finished amounting to about oneeighth part of the plan is sufficiently extensive for the accommodation of a large establishment and contains some apartments the dimensions of which are magnificent the situation is commanding and though the dukes successors have allowed the mansion to continue as he left it great expense has been lavished on the environs which now present a vast sweep of richly undulated woodland stretching to the borders of the cairntable mountains repeatedly mentioned as the favourite retreat of the great ancestor of the family in the days of his hardship and persecution there remains at the head of the adjoining bourg the choir of the ancient church of st bride having beneath it the vault which was used till lately as the burial place of this princely race and only abandoned when their stone and leaden coffins had accumulated in the course of five or six hundred years in such a way that it could accommodate no more here a silver case containing the dust of what was once the brave heart of good sir james is still pointed out and in the dilapidated choir above appears though in a sorely ruinous state the once magnificent tomb of the warrior himself after detailing the wellknown circumstances of sir jamess death in spain th august where he fell assisting the king of arragon in an expedition against the moors when on his way back to scotland from jerusalem to which he had conveyed the heart of bruce the old poet barbour tells us that quhen his men lang had mad murnyn thai debowalyt him and syne gert scher him swa

their custom converted the kirk of st bride of douglas into a stable for their horses enough however remains to identify the restingplace of the great sir james the effigy of dark stone is crossedlegged marking his character as one who had died after performing the pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre and in actual conflict with the infidels of spain and the introduction of the heart adopted as an addition to the old arms of douglas in consequence of the knights fulfilment of bruces dying injunction appears when taken in connexion with the posture of the figure to set the question at rest the monument in its original state must have been not inferior in any respect to the best of the same period in westminster abbey and the curious reader is referred for farther particulars of it to the sepulchral antiquities of great britain by edward blore fsa london to where may also be found interesting details of some of the other tombs and effigies in the cemetery of the first house of douglas as considerable liberties have been taken with the historical incidents on which this novel is founded it is due to the reader to place before him such extracts from godscroft and barbour as may enable him to correct any misimpression the passages introduced in the appendix from the ancient poem of the bruce will moreover gratify those who have not in their possession a copy of the text of barbour as given in the valuable quarto edition of my learned friend dr jamieson as furnishing on the whole a favourable specimen of the style and manner of a venerable classic who wrote when scotland was still full of the fame and glory of her liberators from the yoke of plantagenet and especially of sir james douglas of whom says godscroft we will not omit here to shut up all the judgment of those times concerning him in a rude verse indeed yet such as beareth witness of his true magnanimity and invincible mind in either fortune good sir james douglas who wise and wight and worthy was was never over glad in no winning nor yet oversad for no lineing good fortune and evil chance he weighed both in one balance w s appendix no i extracts from the history of the houses of douglas and angus by master david hume of godscroft fol edit and here indeed the course of the kings misfortunes begins to make some halt and stay by thus much prosperous successe in his own person but more in the person of sir james by the reconquests of his owne castles and countries from hence he went into douglasdale where by the means of his fathers old servant thomas dickson he took in the castle of douglas and not being able to keep it he caused burn it contenting himself with this that his enemies had one strength fewer in that country than before the manner of his taking of it is said to have beene thus sir james taking only with him two of his servants went to thomas dickson of whom he was received with tears after he had revealed himself to him for the good old man knew him not at first being in mean and homely apparel there he kept him secretly in a quiet chamber and brought unto him such as had been trusty servants to his father not all at once but apart by one and one for fear of discoverie their advice was that on palmsunday when the english would come forth to the church and his partners were conveened that then he should give the word and cry the douglas slogan and presently set upon them that should happen to be there who being despatched the castle might be taken easily this being concluded and they come so soon as the english were entered into the church with palms in their hands according to the costume of that day little suspecting or fearing any such thing sir james according to their appointment cryed too soon a douglas a douglas which being heard in the church this was saint brides church of douglas thomas dickson supposing he had beene hard at hand drew out his sword and ran upon them having none to second him but another man so that oppressed by the number of his enemies he was beaten downe and slaine in the meantime sir james being come the english that were in the chancel kept off the scots and having the advantage of the strait and narrow entrie defended themselves manfully but sir james encouraging his men not so much by words as by deeds and good example and having slain the boldest resisters prevailed at last and entring the place slew some twentysix of their number and took the rest about ten or twelve persons intending by them to get the castle upon composition or to enter with them when the gates should be opened to let them in but it needed not for they of the castle were so secure that there was none left to keep it save the porter and the cooke who knowing nothing of what had hapned at the church which stood a large quarter of a mile from thence had left the gate wide open the porter standing without and the cooke dressing the dinner within they entered without resistance and meat being ready and the cloth laid they shut the gates and tooke their refection at good leasure now that he had gotten the castle into his hands considering with himselfe as he was a man no lesse advised than valiant that it was hard for him to keep it the english being as yet the stronger in that countrey who if they should besiege him he knewe of no reliefe he thought better to carry away such things as be most easily transported gold silver and apparell with ammunition and armour whereof he had greatest use and need and to destroy the rest of the provision together with the castle itselfe then to diminish the number of his followers for a garrison there where it could do no good and so he caused carrie the meale and malt and other cornes and graine into the cellar and laid altogether in one heape then he took the prisoners and slew them to revenge the death of his trustie and valiant servant thomas dickson mingling the victuals with their bloud and burying their carkasses in the heap of corne after that he struck out the heads of the barrells and puncheons and let the drink runn through all and then he cast the carkasses of dead horses and other carrion amongst it throwing the salt above all so as to make altogether unuseful to the enemie and this cellar is called yet the douglas lairder last of all he set the house on fire and burnt all the timber and what else the fire could overcome leaving nothing but the scorched walls behind him and this seemes to be the first taking of the castle of douglas for it is supposed that he took it twice for this service and others done to lord william his father sir james gave unto thomas dickson the lands of hisleside which hath beene given him before the castle was taken as an encouragement to whet him on and not after for he was slain in the church which was both liberally and wisely done of him thus to hearten and draw men to his service by such a noble beginning the castle being burnt sir james retired and parting his men into divers companies so as they might be most secret he caused cure such as were wounded in the fight and he himselfe kept as close as he could waiting ever for an occasion to enterprise something against the enemie so soone as he was gone the lord clifford being advertised of what had happened came himselfe in person to douglas and caused reedifie and repair the castle in a very short time unto which he also added a tower which is yet called harries tower from him and so returned into england leaving one thurswall to be captain thereof pp he sir james douglas getting him again into douglasdale did use this stratagem against thurswall captain of the castle under the said lord clifford he caused some of his folk drive away the cattle that fed near unto the castle and when the captain of the garrison followed to rescue gave orders to his men to leave them and to flee away thus he did often to make the captain slight such frays and to make him secure that he might not suspect any further end to be on it which when he had wrought sufficiently as he thought he laid some men in ambuscado and sent others away to drive such beasts as they should find in the view of the castle as if they had been thieves and robbers as they had done often before the captain hearing of it and supposing there was no greater danger now than had been before issued forth of the castle and followed after them with such haste that his men running who should be first were disordered and out of their ranks the drivers also fled as fast as they could till they had drawn the captain a little way beyond the place of ambuscado which when they perceived rising quickly out of their covert they set fiercely upon him and his company and so slew himself and chased his men back to the castle some of whom were overtaken and slain others got into the castle and so were saved sir james not being able to force the house took what booty he could get without in the fields and so departed by this means and such other exploits he so affrighted the enemy that it was counted a matter of such great jeopardy to keep this castle that it began to be called the adventurous or hazardous castle of douglas whereupon sir john walton being in suit of an english lady she wrote to him that when he had kept the adventurous castle of douglas seven years then he might think himself worthy to be a suitor to her upon this occasion walton took upon him the keeping of it and succeeded to thurswall but he ran the same fortune with the rest that were before him for sir james having first dressed an ambuscado near unto the place he made fourteen of his men take so many sacks and fill them with grass as though it had been corn which they carried in the way toward lanark the chief market town in that county so hoping to draw forth the captain by that bait and either to take him or the castle or both neither was this expectation frustrate for the captain did bite and came forth to have taken this victual as he supposed but ere he could reach these carriers sir james with his company had gotten between the castle and him and these disguised carriers seeing the captain following after them did quickly cast off their upper garments wherein they had masked themselves and throwing off their sacks mounted themselves on horseback and met the captain with a sharp encounter he being so much the more amazed that it was unlooked for wherefore when he saw these carriers metamorphosed into warriors and ready to assault him fearing that which was that there was some train laid for them he turned about to have retired into the castle but there also he met with his enemies between which two companies he and his followers were slain so that none escaped the captain afterwards being searched they found as it is reported his mistresss letters about him then he went and took in the castle but it is uncertain say our writers whether by force or composition but it seems that the constable and those that were within have yielded it up without force in regard that he used them so gently which he would not have done if he had taken it at utterance for he sent them all safe home to the lord clifford and gave them also provision and money for their entertainment by the way the castle which he had burnt only before now he razeth and casts down the walls thereof to the ground by these and the like proceedings within a short while he freed douglasdale attrict forest and jedward forest of the english garrisons and subjection ibid p no ii extracts from the bruce liber compositus

of an early spring day when nature in a cold province of scotland was reviving from her winters sleep and the air at least though not the vegetation gave promise of an abatement of the rigour of the season that two travellers whose appearance at that early period sufficiently announced their wandering character which in general secured a free passage even through a dangerous country were seen coming from the southwestward within a few miles of the castle of douglas and seemed to be holding their course in the direction of the river of that name whose dale afforded a species of approach to that memorable feudal fortress the stream small in comparison to the extent of its fame served as a kind of drain to the country in its neighbourhood and at the same time afforded the means of a rough road to the castle and village the high lords to whom the castle had for ages belonged might had they chosen have made this access a great deal smoother and more convenient but there had been as yet little or no exercise for those geniuses who have taught all the world that it is better to take the more circuitous road round the base of a hill than the direct course of ascending it on the one side and descending it directly on the other without yielding a single step to render the passage more easy to the traveller still less were those mysteries dreamed of which madam has of late days expounded but indeed to what purpose should the ancient douglasses have employed his principles even if they had known them in ever so much perfection wheelcarriages except of the most clumsy description and for the most simple operations of agriculture were totally unknown even the most delicate female had no resource save a horse or in case of sore infirmity a litter the men used their own sturdy limbs or hardy horses to transport themselves from place to place and travellers females in particular experienced no small inconvenience from the rugged nature of the country a swollen torrent sometimes crossed their path and compelled them to wait until the waters had abated their frenzy the bank of a small river was occasionally torn away by the effects of a thunderstorm a recent inundation or the like convulsions of nature and the wayfarer relied upon his knowledge of the district or obtained the best local information in his power how to direct his path so as to surmount such untoward obstacles the douglas issues from an amphitheatre of mountains which bounds the valley to the southwest from whose contributions and the aid of sudden storms it receives its scanty supplies the general aspect of the country is that of the pastoral hills of the south of scotland forming as is usual bleak and wild farms many of which had at no great length of time from the date of the story been covered with trees as some of them still attest by bearing the name of shaw that is wild natural wood the neighbourhood of the douglas water itself was flat land capable of bearing strong crops of oats and rye supplying the inhabitants with what they required of these productions at no great distance from the edge of the river a few special spots excepted the soil capable of agriculture was more and more mixed with the pastoral and woodland country till both terminated in desolate and partly inaccessible moorlands above all it was wartime and of necessity all circumstances of mere convenience were obliged to give way to a paramount sense of danger the inhabitants therefore instead of trying to amend the paths which connected them with other districts were thankful that the natural difficulties which surrounded them rendered it unnecessary to break up or to fortify the access from more open countries their wants with a very few exceptions were completely supplied as we have already said by the rude and scanty produce of their own mountains and holms footnote holms or flat plains by the sides of the brooks and rivers termed in the south ings the last of which served for the exercise of their limited agriculture while the better part of the mountains and forest glens produced pasture for their herds and flocks the recesses of the unexplored depths of these sylvan retreats being seldom disturbed especially since the lords of the district had laid aside during this time of strife their constant occupation of hunting the various kinds of game had increased of late very considerably so that not only in crossing the rougher parts of the hilly and desolate country we are describing different varieties of deer were occasionally seen but even the wild cattle peculiar to scotland sometimes showed themselves and other animals which indicated the irregular and disordered state of the period the wildcat was frequently surprised in the dark ravines or the swampy thickets and the wolf already a stranger to the more populous districts of the lothians here maintained his ground against the encroachments of man and was still himself a terror to those by whom he was finally to be extirpated in winter especially and winter was hardly yet past these savage animals were wont to be driven to extremity for lack of food and used to frequent in dangerous numbers the battlefield the deserted churchyard nay sometimes the abodes of living men there to watch for children their defenceless prey with as much familiarity as the fox nowadays will venture to prowl near the mistresss footnote the good dame or wife of a respectable farmer is almost universally thus designated in scotland poultryyard from what we have said our readers if they have made as who in these days has not the scottish tour will be able to form a tolerably just idea of the wilder and upper part of douglas dale during the earlier period of the fourteenth century the setting sun cast his gleams along a moorland country which to the westward broke into larger swells terminating in the mountains called the larger and lesser cairntable the first of these is as it were the father of the hills in the neighbourhood the source of an hundred streams and by far the largest of the ridge still holding in his dark bosom and in the ravines with which his sides are ploughed considerable remnants of those ancient forests with which all the high grounds of that quarter were once covered and particularly the hills in which the rivers both those which run to the east and those which seek the west to discharge themselves into the solway hide like so many hermits their original and scanty sources the landscape was still illuminated by the reflection of the evening sun sometimes thrown back from pool or stream sometimes resting on grey rocks huge cumberers of the soil which labour and agriculture have since removed and sometimes contenting itself with gilding the banks of the stream tinged alternately grey green or ruddy as the ground itself consisted of rock or grassy turf or bare earthen mound or looked at a distance like a rampart of dark red porphyry occasionally too the eye rested on the steep brown extent of moorland as the sunbeam glanced back from the little tarn or mountain pool whose lustre like that of the eye in the human countenance gives a life and vivacity to every feature around the elder and stouter of the two travellers whom we have mentioned was a person well and even showily dressed according to the finery of the times and bore at his back as wandering minstrels were wont a case containing a small harp rote or viol or some such species of musical instrument for accompanying the voice the leathern case announced so much although it proclaimed not the exact nature of the instrument the colour of the travellers doublet was blue and that of his hose violet with slashes which showed a lining of the same colour with the jerkin a mantle ought according to ordinary custom to have covered this dress but the heat of the sun though the season was so early had induced the wearer to fold up his cloak in small compass and form it into a bundle attached to the shoulders like the military greatcoat of the infantry soldier of the present day the neatness with which it was made up argued the precision of a practised traveller who had been long accustomed to every resource which change of weather required a great profusion of narrow ribands or points constituting the loops with which our ancestors connected their doublet and hose formed a kind of cordon composed of knots of blue or violet which surrounded the travellers person and thus assimilated in colour with the two garments which it was the office of these strings to combine the bonnet usually worn with this showy dress was of that kind with which henry the eighth and his son edward the sixth are usually represented it was more fitted from the gay stuff of which it was composed to appear in a public place than to encounter a storm of rain it was partycoloured being made of different stripes of blue and violet and the wearer arrogated a certain degree of gentility to himself by wearing a plume of considerable dimensions of the same favourite colours the features over which this feather drooped were in no degree remarkable for peculiarity of expression yet in so desolate a country as the west of scotland it would not have been easy to pass the man without more minute attention than he would have met with where there was more in the character of the scenery to arrest the gaze of the passengers a quick eye a sociable look seeming to say ay look at me i am a man worth noticing and not unworthy your attention carried with it nevertheless an interpretation which might be thought favourable or otherwise according to the character of the person whom the traveller met a knight or soldier would merely have thought that he had met a merry fellow who could sing a wild song or tell a wild tale and help to empty a flagon with all the accomplishments necessary for a boon companion at an hostelry except perhaps an alacrity at defraying his share of the reckoning a churchman on the other hand might have thought he of the blue and violet was of too loose habits and accustomed too little to limit himself within the boundaries of beseeming mirth to be fit society for one of his sacred calling yet the man of song had a certain steadiness of countenance which seemed fitted to hold place in scenes of serious business as well as of gaiety a wayfaring passenger of wealth not at that time a numerous class might have feared in him a professional robber or one whom opportunity was very likely to convert into such a female might have been apprehensive of uncivil treatment and a youth or timid person might have thought of murder or such direful doings unless privately armed however the minstrel was illaccoutred for any dangerous occupation his only visible weapon was a small crooked sword like what we now call a hanger and the state of the times would have justified any man however peaceful his intentions in being so far armed against the perils of the road if a glance at this man had in any respect prejudiced him in the opinion of those whom he met on his journey a look at his companion would so far as his character could be guessed at for he was closely muffled up have passed for an apology and warrant for his associate the younger traveller was apparently in early youth a soft and gentle boy whose sclavonic gown the appropriate dress of the pilgrim he wore more closely drawn about him than the coldness of the weather seemed to authorize or recommend his features imperfectly seen under the hood of his pilgrims dress were prepossessing in a high degree and though he wore a walking sword it seemed rather to be in compliance with general fashion than from any violent purpose he did so there were traces of sadness upon his brow and of tears upon his cheeks and his weariness was such as even his rougher companion seemed to sympathize with while he privately participated also in the sorrow which left its marks upon a countenance so lovely they spoke together and the elder of the two while he assumed the deferential air proper to a man of inferior rank addressing a superior showed in tone and gesture something that amounted to interest and affection bertram my friend said the younger of the two how far are we still from douglas castle we have already come farther than the twenty miles which thou didst say was the distance from cammock or how didst thou call the last hostelry which we left by daybreak cummock my dearest lady i beg ten thousand excuses my gracious young lord call me augustine replied his comrade if you mean to speak as is fittest for the time nay as for that said bertram if your ladyship can condescend to lay aside your quality my own good breeding is not so firmly sewed to me but that i can doff it and resume it again without its losing a stitch and since your ladyship to whom i am sworn in obedience is pleased to command that i should treat you as my own son shame it were to me if i were not to show you the affection of a father more especially as i may well swear my great oath that i owe you the duty of such though well i wot it has in our case been the lot of the parent to be maintained by the kindness and liberality of the child for when was it that i hungered or thirsted and the black stockfootnote the table dormant which stood in a barons hall was often so designated of berkley did not relieve my wants i would have it so answered the young pilgrim i would have it so what use of the mountains of beef and the oceans of beer which they say our domains produce if there is a hungry heart among our vassalage or especially if thou bertram who hast served as the minstrel of our house for more than twenty years shouldst experience such a feeling certes lady answered bertram it would be like the catastrophe which is told of the baron of fastenough when his last mouse was starved to death in the very pantry and if i escape this journey without such a calamity i shall think myself out of reach of thirst or famine for the whole of my life thou hast suffered already once or twice by these attacks my poor friend said the lady it is little answered bertram any thing that i have suffered and i were ungrateful to give the inconvenience of missing a breakfast or making an untimely dinner so serious a name but then i hardly see how your ladyship can endure this gear much longer you must yourself feel that the plodding along these high lands of which the scots give us such good measure in their miles is no jesting matter and as for douglas castle why it is still three good miles off the question then is quoth the lady heaving a sigh what we are to do when we have so far to travel and when the castle gates must be locked long before we arrive there for that i will pledge my word answered bertram the gates of douglas under the care of sir john de walton do not open so easily as those of the buttery hatch at our own castle when it is well oiled and if your ladyship take my advice you will turn southward ho and in two days at farthest we shall be in a land where mens wants are provided for as the inns proclaim it with the least possible delay and the secret of this little journey shall never be known to living mortal but ourselves as sure as i am sworn minstrel and man of faith i thank thee for thy advice mine honest bertram said the lady but i cannot profit by it should thy knowledge of these parts possess thee with an acquaintance with any decent house whether it belong to rich or poor i would willingly take quarters there if i could obtain them from this time until tomorrow morning the gates of douglas castle will then be open to guests of so peaceful an appearance as we carry with us and and it will out we might have time to make such applications to our toilet as might ensure us a good reception by drawing a comb through our locks or such like foppery ah madam said bertram were not sir john de walton in question methinks i should venture to reply that an unwashed brow an unkempt head of hair and a look far more saucy than your ladyship ever wears or can wear were the proper disguise to trick out that minstrels boy whom you wish to represent in the present pageant do you suffer your youthful pupils to be indeed so slovenly and so saucy bertram answered the lady i for one will not imitate them in that particular and whether sir john be now in the castle of douglas or not i will treat the soldiers who hold so honourable a charge with a washed brow and a head of hair somewhat ordered as for going back without seeing a castle which has mingled even with my very dreams at a word bertram thou mayst go that way but i will not and if i part with your ladyship on such terms responded the minstrel now your frolic is so nearly accomplished it shall be the foul fiend himself and nothing more comely or less dangerous that shall tear me from your side and for lodging there is not far from hence the house of one tom dickson of hazelside one of the most honest fellows of the dale and who although a labouring man ranked as high as a warrior when i was in this country as any noble gentleman that rode in the band of the douglas he is then a soldier said the lady when his country or his lord need his sword replied bertram and to say the truth they are seldom at peace but otherwise he is no enemy save to the wolf which plunders his herds but forget not my trusty guide replied the lady that the blood in our veins is english and consequently that we are in danger from all who call themselves foes to the ruddy cross do not fear this mans faith answered bertram you may trust to him as to the best knight or gentleman of the land we may make good our lodging by a tune or a song and it may remember you that i undertook provided it pleased your ladyship to temporize a little with the scots who poor souls love minstrelsy and when they have but a silver penny will willingly bestow it to encourage the gay science i promised you i say that we should be as welcome to them as if we had been born amidst their own wild hills and for the best that such a house as dicksons affords the gleemans son fair lady shall not breathe a wish in vain and now will you speak your mind to your devoted friend and adopted father or rather your sworn servant and guide bertram the minstrel what it is your pleasure to do in this matter o we will certainly accept of the scots hospitality said the lady your minstrel word being plighted that he is a true man tom dickson call you him yes replied bertram such is his name and by looking on these sheep i am assured that we are now upon his land indeed said the lady with some surprise and how is your wisdom aware of that i see the first letter of his name marked upon this flock answered the guide ah learning is what carries a man through the world as well as if he had the ring by virtue of which old minstrels tell that adam understood the language of the beasts in paradise ah madam there is more wit taught in the shepherds shieling than the lady thinks of who sews her painted seam in her summer bower be it so good bertram and although not so deeply skilled in the knowledge of written language as you are it is impossible for me to esteem its value more than i actually do so hold we on the nearest road to this tom dicksons whose very sheep tell of his whereabout i trust we have not very far to go although the knowledge that our journey is shortened by a few miles has so much recovered my fatigue that methinks i could dance all the rest of the way chapter the second rosalind well this is the forest of arden touchstone ay now am i in arden the more fool i when i was at home i was in a better place but travellers must be content rosalind ay be so good touchstone look you who comes here a young man and an old in solemn talk as you like it scene iv act as the travellers spoke together they reached a turn of the path which presented a more extensive prospect than the broken face of the country had yet shown them a valley through which flowed a small tributary stream exhibited the wild but not unpleasant features of a lone vale of green braken here and there besprinkled with groups of alder trees of hazels and of copseoakwood which had maintained their stations in the recesses of the valley although they had vanished from the loftier and more exposed sides of the hills the farmhouse or mansionhouse for from its size and appearance it might have been the one or the other was a large but low building and the walls of the outhouses were sufficiently strong to resist any band of casual depredators there was nothing however which could withstand a more powerful force for in a country laid waste by war the farmer was then as now obliged to take his chance of the great evils attendant upon that state of things and his condition never a very eligible one was rendered considerably worse by the insecurity attending it about half a mile farther was seen a gothic building of very small extent having a half dismantled chapel which the minstrel pronounced to be the abbey of saint bride the place he said i understand is allowed to subsist as two or three old monks and as many nuns whom it contains are permitted by the english to serve god there and sometimes to give relief to scottish travellers and who have accordingly taken assurance with sir john de walton and accepted as their superior a churchman on whom he thinks he can depend but if these guests happen to reveal any secrets they are by some means or other believed to fly towards the english governor and therefore unless your ladyships commands be positive i think we had best not trust ourselves to their hospitality of a surety no said the lady if thou canst provide me with lodgings where we shall have more prudent hosts at this moment two human forms were seen to approach the farmhouse in a different direction from the travellers and speaking so high in a tone apparently of dispute that the minstrel and his companion could distinguish their voices though the distance was considerable having screened his eyes with his hand for some minutes bertram at length exclaimed by our lady it is my old friend tom dickson sure enough what can make him in such bad humour with the lad who i think may be the little wild boy his son charles who used to run about and plait rushes some twenty years ago it is lucky however we have found our friends astir for i warrant tom hath a hearty piece of beef in the pot ere he goes to bed and he must have changed his wont if an old friend hath not his share and who knows had we come later at what hour they may now find it convenient to drop latch and draw bolt so near a hostile garrison for if we call things by their right names such is the proper term for an english garrison in the castle of a scottish nobleman foolish man answered the lady thou judgest of sir john de walton as thou wouldst of some rude boor to whom the opportunity of doing what he wills is a temptation and license to exercise cruelty and oppression now i could plight you my word that setting apart the quarrel of the kingdoms which of course will be fought out in fair battles on both sides you will find that english and scottish within this domain and within the reach of sir john de waltons influence live together as that same flock of sheep and goats do with the shepherds dog a foe from whom they fly upon certain occasions but around whom they nevertheless eagerly gather for protection should a wolf happen to show himself it is not to your ladyship answered bertram that i should venture to state my opinion of such matters but the young knight when he is sheathed in armour is a different being from him who feasts in halls among press of ladies and he that feeds by another mans fireside and when his landlord of all men in the world chances to be the black douglas has reason to keep his eyes about him as he makes his meal but it were better i looked after our own evening refreshment than that i stood here gaping and talking about other folks matters so saying he called out in a thundering tone of voice dickson what ho thomas dickson will you not acknowledge an old friend who is much disposed to trust his supper and nights lodging to your hospitality the scotchman attracted by the call looked first along the banks of the river then upward to the bare side of the hill and at length cast his eyes upon the two figures who were descending from it as if he felt the night colder while he advanced from the more sheltered part of the valley to meet them the douglas dale farmer wrapped closer around him the grey plaid which from an early period has been used by the shepherds of the south of scotland and the appearance of which gives a romantic air to the peasantry and middle classes and which although less brilliant and gaudy in its colours is as picturesque in its arrangement as the more military tartan mantle of the highlands when they approached near to each other the lady might observe that this friend of her guide was a stout athletic man somewhat past the middle of life and already showing marks of the approach but none of the infirmities of age upon a countenance which had been exposed to many a storm sharp eyes too and a quick observation exhibited signs of vigilance acquired by one who had lived long in a country where he had constant occasion for looking around him with caution his features were still swollen with displeasure and the handsome young man who attended him seemed to be discontented like one who had undergone no gentle marks of his fathers indignation and who from the sullen expression which mingled with an appearance of shame on his countenance seemed at once affected by anger and remorse do you not remember me old friend said bertram as they approached within a distance for communing or have the twenty years which have marched over us since we met carried along with them all remembrance of bertram the english minstrel in troth answered the scot it is not for want of plenty of your countrymen to keep you in my remembrance and i have hardly heard one of them so much as whistle hey now the day dawns but it has recalled some note of your blythe rebeck and yet such animals are we that i had forgot the mien of my old friend and scarcely knew him at a distance but we have had trouble lately there are a thousand of your countrymen that keep garrison in the perilous castle of douglas yonder as well as in other places through the vale and that is but a woful sight for a true scotchman even my own poor house has not escaped the dignity of a garrison of a manatarms besides two or three archer knaves and one or two slips of mischievous boys called pages and so forth who will not let a man say this is my own by his own fireside do not therefore think hardly of me old comrade if i show you a welcome something colder than you might expect from a friend of other days for by saint bride of douglas i have scarcely anything left to which i can say welcome small welcome will serve said bertram my son make thy reverence to thy fathers old friend augustine is learning my joyous trade but he will need some practice ere he can endure its fatigues if you could give him some little matter of food and a quiet bed for the night theres no fear but that we shall both do well enough for i dare say when you travel with my friend charles there if that tall youth chance to be my old acquaintance charles you will find yourself accommodated when his wants are once well provided for nay the foul fiend take me if i do answered the scottish husbandman i know not what the lads of this day are made of not of the same clay as their fathers to be sure not sprung from their heather which fears neither wind nor rain but from some delicate plant of a foreign country which will not thrive unless it be nourished under glass with a murrain to it the good lord of douglas i have been his henchman and can vouch for it did not in his pagehood desire such food and lodging as in the present day will hardly satisfy such a lad as your friend charles nay said bertram it is not that my augustine is over nice but for other reasons i must request of you a bed to himself he hath of late been unwell ay i understand said dickson your son hath had a touch of that illness which terminates so frequently in the black death you english folk die of we hear much of the havoc it has made to the southward comes it hitherward bertram nodded well my fathers house continued the farmer hath more rooms than one and your son shall have one wellaired and comfortable and for supper ye shall have a part of what is prepared for your countrymen though i would rather have their room than their company since i am bound to feed a score of them they will not dispute the claim of such a skilful minstrel as thou art to a nights hospitality i am ashamed to say that i must do their bidding even in my own house welladay if my good lord were in possession of his own i have heart and hand enough to turn the whole of them out of my house like like to speak plainly said bertram like a southern strolling gang from redesdale whom i have seen you fling out of your house like a litter of blind puppies when not one of them looked behind to see who had done him the courtesy until he was halfway to cairntable ay answered the scotchman drawing himself up at least six inches taller than before then i had a house of my own and a cause and an arm to keep it now i am what signifies it what i am the noblest lord in scotland is little better truly friend said bertram now you view this matter in a rational light i do not say that the wisest the richest or the strongest man in this world has any right to tyrannize over his neighbour because he is the more weak ignorant and the poorer but yet if he does enter into such a controversy he must submit to the course of nature and that will always give the advantage in the tide of battle to wealth strength and health with permission however answered dickson the weaker party if he use his facilities to the utmost may in the long run obtain revenge upon the author of his sufferings which would be at least compensation for his temporary submission and he acts simply as a man and most foolishly as a scotchman whether he sustain these wrongs with the insensibility of an idiot or whether he endeavour to revenge them before heavens appointed time has arrived but if i talk thus i shall scare you as i have scared some of your countrymen from accepting a meal of meat and a nights lodging in a house where you might be called with the morning to a bloody settlement of a national quarrel never mind said bertram we have been known to each other of old and i am no more afraid of meeting unkindness in your house than you expect me to come here for the purpose of adding to the injuries of which you complain so be it said dickson and you my old friend are as welcome to my abode as when it never held any guest save of my own inviting and you my young friend master augustine shall be looked after as well as if you came with a gay brow and a light cheek such as best becomes the gay science but wherefore may i ask said bertram so much displeased but now at my young friend charles the youth answered before his father had time to speak my father good sir may put what show upon it he will but shrewd and wise men wax weak in the brain these troublous times he saw two or three wolves seize upon three of our choicest wethers and because i shouted to give the alarm to the english garrison he was angry as if he could have murdered me just for saving the sheep from the jaws that would have devoured them this is a strange account of thee old friend said bertram dost thou connive with the wolves in robbing thine own fold why let it pass if thou lovest me answered the countryman charles could tell thee something nearer the truth if he had a mind but for the present let it pass the minstrel perceiving that the scotchman was fretted and embarrassed with the subject pressed it no farther at this moment in crossing the threshold of thomas dicksons house they were greeted with sounds from two english soldiers within quiet anthony said one voice quiet man for the sake of common sense if not common manners robin hood himself never sat down to his board ere the roast was ready ready quoth another rough voice it is roasting to rags and small had been the knave dicksons share even of these rags had it not been the express orders of the worshipful sir john de walton that the soldiers who lie at outposts should afford to the inmates such provisions as are not necessary for their own subsistence hush anthony hush for shame replied his fellowsoldier if ever i heard our hosts step i heard it this instant so give over thy grumbling since our captain as we all know hath prohibited under strict penalties all quarrels between his followers and the people of the country i am sure replied anthony that i have ministered occasion to none but i would i were equally certain of the good meaning of this sullen browed thomas dickson towards the english soldiers for i seldom go to bed in this dungeon of a house but i expect my throat will gape as wide as a thirsty oyster before i awaken here he comes however added anthony sinking his sharp tones as he spoke and i hope to be excommunicated if he has not brought with him that mad animal his son charles and two other strangers hungry enough ill be sworn to eat up the whole supper if they do us no other injury shame of thyself anthony repeated his comrade a good archer thou as ever wore kendal green and yet affect to be frightened for two tired travellers and alarmed for the inroad their hunger may make on the nights meal there are four or five of us here we have our bows and our bills within reach and scorn to be chased from our supper or cheated out of our share of it by a dozen scotchmen whether stationary or strollers how sayst thou he added turning to dickson how say ye quartermaster it is no secret that by the directions given to our post we must enquire into the occupations of such guests as you may receive besides ourselves your unwilling inmates you are as ready for supper i warrant as supper is for you and i will only delay you and my friend anthony who becomes dreadfully impatient until you answer two or three questions which you wot of bendthebow answered dickson thou art a civil fellow and although it is something hard to be constrained to give an account of ones friends because they chance to quarter in ones own house for a night or two yet i must submit to the times and make no vain opposition you may mark down in your breviary there that upon the fourteenth day before palm sunday thomas dickson brought to his house of hazelside in which you hold garrison by orders from the english governor sir john de walton two strangers to whom the said thomas dickson had promised refreshment and a bed for the evening if it be lawful at this time and place but what are they these strangers said anthony somewhat sharply a fine world the while murmured thomas dickson that an honest man should be forced to answer the questions of every paltry companion but he mitigated his voice and proceeded the eldest of my guests is bertram an ancient english minstrel who is bound on his own errand to the castle of douglas and will communicate what he has to say of news to sir john de walton himself i have known him for twenty years and never heard any thing of him save that he was good man and true the younger stranger is his son a lad recovering from the english disorder which has been raging far and wide in westmoreland and cumberland tell me said bendthebow this same bertram was he not about a year since in the service of some noble lady in our own country i have heard so answered dickson we shall in that case i think incur little danger replied bend thebow by allowing this old man and his son to proceed on their journey to the castle you are my elder and my better answered anthony but i may remind you that it is not so clearly our duty to give free passage into a garrison of a thousand men of all ranks to a youth who has been so lately attacked by a contagious disorder and i question if our commander would not rather hear that the black douglas with a hundred devils as black as himself since such is his colour had taken possession of the outposts of hazelside with sword and battleaxe than that one person suffering under this fell sickness had entered peaceably and by the open wicket of the castle there is something in what thou sayest anthony replied his comrade and considering that our governor since he has undertaken the troublesome job of keeping a castle which is esteemed so much more dangerous than any other within scotland has become one of the most cautious and jealous men in the world we had better i think inform him of the circumstance and take his commands how the stripling is to be dealt with content am i said the archer and first methinks i would just in order to show that we know what belongs to such a case ask the stripling a few questions as how long he has been ill by what physicians he has been attended when he was cured and how his cure is certified e true brother said bendthebow thou hearest minstrel we would ask thy son some questions what has become of him he was in this apartment but now so please you answered bertram he did but pass through the apartment mr thomas dickson at my entreaty as well as in respectful reverence to your honours health carried him through the room without tarriance judging his own bedchamber the fittest place for a young man recovering from a severe illness and after a day of no small fatigue well answered the elder archer though it is uncommon for men who like us live by bowstring and quiver to meddle with interrogations and examinations yet as the case stands we must make some enquiries of your son ere we permit him to set forth to the castle of douglas where you say his errand leads him rather my errand noble sir said the minstrel than that of the young man himself if such be the case answered bendthebow we may sufficiently do our duty by sending yourself with the first grey light of dawn to the castle and letting your son remain in bed which i warrant is the fittest place for him until we shall receive sir john de waltons commands whether he is to be brought onward or not and we may as well said anthony since we are to have this mans company at supper make him acquainted with the rules of the out garrison stationed here for the time so saying he pulled a scroll from his leathern pouch and said minstrel canst thou read it becomes my calling said the minstrel it has nothing to do with mine though answered the archer and therefore do thou read these regulations aloud for since i do not comprehend these characters by sight i lose no chance of having them read over to me as often as i can that i may fix their sense in my memory so beware that thou readest the words letter for letter as they are set down for thou dost so at thy peril sir minstrel if thou readest not like a true man on my minstrel word said bertram and began to read excessively slow for he wished to gain a little time for consideration which he foresaw would be necessary to prevent his being separated from his mistress which was likely to occasion her much anxiety and distress he therefore began thus outpost at hazelside the steading of goodman thomas dickson ay thomas and is thy house so called it is the ancient name of the steading said the scot being surrounded by a hazelshaw or thicket hold your chattering tongue minstrel said anthony and proceed as you value your ears which you seem disposed to make less use of his garrison proceeded the minstrel reading consists of a lance with its furniture what then a lance in other words a belted knight commands this party tis no concern of thine said the archer but it is answered the minstrel we have a right to be examined by the highest person in presence i will show thee thou rascal said the archer starting up that i am lance enough for thee to reply to and i will break thy head if thou sayst a word more take care brother anthony said his comrade we are to use travellers courteously and with your leave those travellers best who come from our native land it is even so stated here said the minstrel and he proceeded to read the watch at this outpost of hazelside footnote hazelside place the fief granted to thomas dickson by william the hardy seventh lord douglas is still pointed out about two miles to the southwest of the castle dangerous dickson was sixty years of age at the time when lord james first appeared in douglasdale his heirs kept possession of the fief for centuries and some respectable gentlemens families in lanarkshire still trace themselves to this ancestor from notes by mr haddow shall stop and examine all travellers passing by the said station suffering such to pass onward to the town of douglas or to douglas castle always interrogating them with civility and detaining and turning them back if there arise matter of suspicion but conducting themselves in all matters civilly and courteously to the people of the country and to those who travel in it you see most excellent and valiant archer added the commentator bertram that courtesy and civility are above all recommended to your worship in your conduct towards the inhabitants and those passengers who like us may chance to fall under your rules in such matters i am not to be told at this time of day said the archer how to conduct myself in the discharge of my duties let me advise you sir minstrel to be frank and open in your answers to our enquiries and you shall have no reason to complain i hope at all events said the minstrel to have your favour for my son who is a delicate stripling and not accustomed to play his part among the crew which inhabit this wild world well continued the elder and more civil of the two archers if thy son be a novice in this terrestrial navigation i warrant that thou my friend from thy look and manner of speech hast enough of skill to use thy compass to comfort thee although thou must thyself answer the questions of our governor or deputygovernor in order that he may see there is no offence in thee i think there may be permission granted for thy sons residing here in the convent hard by where the nuns by the way are as old as the monks and have nearly as long beards so thou mayst be easy about thy sons morals until thou hast done thy business at douglas castle and art ready to resume thy journey if such permission said the minstrel can be obtained i should be better pleased to leave him at the abbey and go myself in the first place to take the directions of your commanding officer certainly answered the archer that will be the safest and best way and with a piece or two of money thou mayst secure the protection of the abbot thou sayst well answered the minstrel i have known life i have known every stile gap pathway and pass of this wilderness of ours for some thirty years and he that cannot steer his course fairly through it like an able seaman after having served such an apprenticeship can hardly ever be taught were a century to be given him to learn it in since thou art so expert a mariner answered the archer anthony thou hast i warrant me met in thy wanderings a potation called a mornings draught which they who are conducted by others where they themselves lack experience are used to bestow upon those who undertake the task of guide upon such an occasion i understand you sir quoth the minstrel and although money or drinkgeld as the fleming calls it is rather a scarce commodity in the purse of one of my calling yet according to my feeble ability thou shalt have no cause to complain that thine eyes or those of thy comrades have been damaged by a scottish mist while we can find an english coin to pay for the good liquor which would wash them clear content said the archer we now understand each other and if difficulties arise on the road thou shalt not want the countenance of anthony to sail triumphantly through them but thou hadst better let thy son know soon of the early visit to the abbot tomorrow for thou mayst guess that we cannot and dare not delay our departure for the convent a minute after the eastern sky is ruddy and with other infirmities young men often are prone to laziness and a love of ease thou shalt have no reason to think so answered the minstrel not the lark himself when waked by the first ray peeping over the black cloud springs more lightly to the sky than will my augustine answer the same brilliant summons and now we understand each other i would only further pray you to forbear light talk while my son is in your company a boy of innocent life and timid in conversation nay jolly minstrel said the elder archer thou givest us here too gross an example of satan reproving sin if thou hast followed thy craft for twenty years as thou pretendest thy son having kept thee company since childhood must by this time be fit to open a school to teach even devils the practice of the seven deadly sins of which none know the theory if those of the gay science are lacking truly comrade thou speakest well answered bertram and i acknowledge that we minstrels are too much to blame in this matter nevertheless in good sooth the fault is not one of which i myself am particularly guilty on the contrary i think that he who would wish to have his own hair honoured when time has strewed it with silver should so rein his mirth when in the presence of the young as may show in what respect he holds innocence i will therefore with your permission speak a word to augustine that tomorrow we must be on foot early do so my friend said the english soldier and do the same the more speedily that our poor supper is still awaiting until thou art ready to partake of it to which i promise thee said bertram i am disposed to entertain no delay follow me then said dickson and i will show thee where this young bird of thine has his nest their host accordingly tripped up the wooden stair and tapped at a door which he thus indicated was that of his younger guest your father continued he as the door opened would speak with you master augustine excuse me my host answered augustine the truth is that this room being directly above your eatingchamber and the flooring not in the best possible repair i have been compelled to the unhandsome practice of eavesdropping and not a word has escaped me that passed concerning my proposed residence at the abbey our journey tomorrow and the somewhat early hour at which i must shake off sloth and according to thy expression fly down from the roost and how dost thou relish said dickson being left with the abbot of saint brides little flock here why well said the youth if the abbot is a man of respectability becoming his vocation and not one of those swaggering churchmen who stretch out the sword and bear themselves like rank soldiers in these troublous times for that young master said dickson if you let him put his hand deep enough into your purse he will hardly quarrel with any thing then i will leave him to my father replied augustine who will not grudge him any thing he asks in reason in that case replied the scotchman you may trust to our abbot for good accommodation and so both sides are pleased it is well my son said bertram who now joined in the conversation and that thou mayst be ready for early travelling i shall presently get our host to send thee some food after partaking of which thou shouldst go to bed and sleep off the fatigue of today since tomorrow will bring work for itself and as for thy engagement to these honest archers answered augustine i hope you will be able to do what will give pleasure to our guides if they are disposed to be civil and true men god bless thee my child answered bertram thou knowest already what would drag after thy beck all the english archers that were ever on this side of the solway there is no fear of a grey goose shaft if you sing a reveillez like to that which chimed even now from that silken nest of dainty young goldfinches hold me as in readiness then said the seeming youth when you depart tomorrow morning i am within hearing i suppose of the bells of saint brides chapel and have no fear through my sloth of keeping you or your company waiting good night and god bless thee my child again said the minstrel remember that your father sleeps not far distant and on the slightest alarm will not fail to be with you i need scarce bid thee recommend thyself meantime to the great being who is the friend and father of us all the pilgrim thanked his supposed father for his evening blessing and the visitors withdrew without farther speech at the time leaving the young lady to those engrossing fears which the novelty of her situation and the native delicacy of her sex being considered naturally thronged upon her the tramp of a horses foot was not long after heard at the house of hazelside and the rider was welcomed by its garrison with marks of respect bertram understood so much as to discover from the conversation of the warders that this late arrival was aymer de valence the knight who commanded the little party and to the furniture of whose lance as it was technically called belonged the archers with whom we have already been acquainted a manatarms or two a certain proportion of pages or grooms and in short the command and guidance of the garrison at thomas dicksons while in rank he was deputy governor of douglas castle to prevent all suspicion respecting himself and his companion as well as the risk of the latter being disturbed the minstrel thought it proper to present himself to the inspection of this knight the great authority of the little place he found him with as little scruple as the archers heretofore making a supper of the relics of the roast beef before this young knight bertram underwent an examination while an old soldier took down in writing such items of information as the examinate thought proper to express in his replies both with regard to the minutiae of his present journey his business at castle douglas and his route when that business should be accomplished a much more minute examination in a word than he had hitherto undergone by the archers or perhaps than was quite agreeable to him being encumbered with at least the knowledge of one secret whatever more not that this new examinator had any thing stern or severe in his looks or his questions as to the first he was mild gentle and meek as a maid and possessed exactly of the courteous manners ascribed by our father chaucer to the pattern of chivalry whom he describes upon his pilgrimage to canterbury but with all his gentleness de valence showed a great degree of acuteness and accuracy in his queries and well pleased was bertram that the young knight did not insist upon seeing his supposed son although even in that case his ready wit had resolved like a seaman in a tempest to sacrifice one part to preserve the rest he was not however driven to this extremity being treated by sir aymer with that degree of courtesy which in that age men of song were in general thought entitled to the knight kindly and liberally consented to the lads remaining in the convent as a fit and quiet residence for a stripling and an invalid until sir john de walton should express his pleasure on the subject and sir aymer consented to this arrangement the more willingly as it averted all possible danger of bringing disease into the english garrison by the young knights order all in dicksons house were despatched earlier to rest than usual the matin bell of the neighbouring chapel being the signal for their assembly by daybreak they rendezvoused accordingly and proceeded to saint brides where they heard mass after which an interview took place between the abbot jerome and the minstrel in which the former undertook with the permission of de valence to receive augustine into his abbey as a guest for a few days less or more and for which bertram promised an acknowledgment in name of alms which was amply satisfactory so be it said bertram taking leave of his supposed son rely on it i will not tarry a day longer at douglas castle than shall suffice for transacting my business there which is to look after the old books you wot of and i will speedily return for thee to the abbey of saint bride to resume in company our journey homeward o father replied the youth with a smile i fear if you get among romances and chronicles you will be so earnest in your researches that you will forget poor augustine and his concerns never fear me augustine said the old man making the motion of throwing a kiss towards the boy thou art good and virtuous and heaven will not neglect thee were thy father unnatural enough to do so believe me all the old songs since merlins day shall not make me forget thee thus they separated the minstrel with the english knight and his retinue to move towards the castle and the youth in dutiful attendance on the venerable abbot who was delighted to find that his guests thoughts turned rather upon spiritual things than on the morning repast of the approach of which he could not help being himself sensible chapter the third this night methinks is but the daylight sick it looks a little paler tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid merchant of venice to facilitate the progress of the party on its way to douglas castle the knight of valence offered the minstrel the convenience of a horse which the fatigues of yesterday made him gladly accept any one acquainted with equestrian exercise is aware that no means of refreshment carries away the sense of fatigue from over walking so easily as the exchange to riding which calls into play another set of muscles and leaves those which have been over exerted an opportunity of resting through change of motion more completely than they could in absolute repose sir aymer de valence was sheathed in armour and mounted on his charger two of the archers a groom of mean rank and a squire who looked in his day for the honour of knighthood completed the detachment which seemed so disposed as to secure the minstrel from escape and to protect him against violence not said the young knight addressing himself to bertram that there is usually danger in travelling in this country any more than in the most quiet districts of england but some disturbances as you may have learnt have broken out here within this last year and have caused the garrison of castle douglas to maintain a stricter watch but let us move on for the complexion of the day is congenial with the original derivation of the name of the country and the description of the chiefs to whom it belonged sholto dhu glass see yon dark grey man and dark grey will our route prove this morning though by good luck it is not long the morning was indeed what the original gaelic words implied a drizzly dark moist day the mist had settled upon the hills and unrolled itself upon brook glade and tarn and the spring breeze was not powerful enough to raise the veil though from the wild sounds which were heard occasionally on the ridges and through the glens it might be supposed to wail at a sense of its own inability the route of the travellers was directed by the course which the river had ploughed for itself down the valley the banks of which bore in general that dark grey livery which sir aymer de valence had intimated to be the prevalent tint of the country some ineffectual struggles of the sun shot a ray here and there to salute the peaks of the hills yet these were unable to surmount the dulness of a march morning and at so early an hour produced a variety of shades rather than a gleam of brightness upon the eastern horizon the view was monotonous and depressing and apparently the good knight aymer sought some amusement in occasional talk with bertram who as was usual with his craft possessed a fund of knowledge and a power of conversation well suited to pass away a dull morning the minstrel well pleased to pick up such information as he might be able concerning the present state of the country embraced every opportunity of sustaining the dialogue i would speak with you sir minstrel said the young knight if thou dost not find the air of this morning too harsh for thine organs heartily do i wish thou wouldst fairly tell me what can have induced thee being as thou seemst a man of sense to thrust thyself into a wild country like this at such a time and you my masters addressing the archers and the rest of the party methinks it would be as fitting and seeming if you reined back your steeds for a horses length or so since i apprehend you can travel on your way without the pastime of minstrelsy the bowmen took the hint and fell back but as was expressed by their grumbling observations by no means pleased that there seemed little chance of their overhearing what conversation should pass between the young knight and the minstrel which proceeded as follows i am then to understand good minstrel said the knight that you who have in your time borne arms and even followed saint georges red cross banner to the holy sepulchre are so little tired of the danger attending our profession that you feel yourself attracted unnecessarily to regions where the sword for ever loose in its scabbard is ready to start on the slightest provocation it would be hard replied the minstrel bluntly to answer such a question in the affirmative and yet when you consider how nearly allied is his profession who celebrates deeds of arms with that of the knight who performs them your honour i think will hold it advisable that a minstrel desirous of doing his devoir should like a young knight seek the truth of adventures where it is to be found and rather visit countries where the knowledge is preserved of high and noble deeds than those lazy and quiet realms in which men live indolently and die ignobly in peace or by sentence of law you yourself sir and those like you who hold life cheap in respect of glory guide your course through this world on the very same principle which brings your poor rhyming servant bertram from a far province of merry england to this dark country of rugged scotland called douglas dale you long to see adventures worthy of notice and i under favour for naming us two in the same breath seek a scanty and precarious but not a dishonourable living by preparing for immortality as well as i can the particulars of such exploits especially the names of those who were the heroes of these actions each therefore labours in his vocation nor can the one be justly wondered at more than the other seeing that if there be any difference in the degrees of danger to which both the hero and the poet are exposed the courage strength arms and address of the valiant knight render it safer for him to venture into scenes of peril than for the poor man of rhyme you say well answered the warrior and although it is something of novelty to me to hear your craft represented as upon a level with my own mode of life yet shame were it to say that the minstrel who toils so much to keep in memory the feats of gallant knights should not himself prefer fame to existence and a single achievement of valour to a whole age without a name or to affirm that he follows a mean and unworthy profession your worship will then acknowledge said the minstrel that it is a legitimate object in such as myself who simple as i am have taken my regular degrees among the professors of the gay science at the capital town of aiguesmortos to struggle forward into this northern district where i am well assured many things have happened which have been adapted to the harp by minstrels of great fame in ancient days and have become the subject of lays which lie deposited in the library of castle douglas where unless copied over by some one who understands the old british characters and language they must with whatever they may contain whether of entertainment or edification be speedily lost to posterity if these hidden treasures were preserved and recorded by the minstrel art of my poor self and others it might be held well to compensate for the risk of a chance blow of a broadsword or the sweep of a brown bill while i am engaged in collecting them and i were unworthy of the name of a man much more of an inventor or finder footnote the name of maker stands for poet with the original sense of which word it exactly corresponds in the old scottish language that of trouveur or troubadour finder in short has a similar meaning and almost in every country the poetical tribes have been graced with the same epithets inferring the property of those who employ invention or creation should i weigh the loss of life a commodity always so uncertain against the chance of that immortality which will survive in my lay after my broken voice and shivered harp shall no longer be able either to express tune or accompany tale certainly said sir aymer having a heart to feel such a motive you have an undoubted right to express it nor should i have been in any degree disposed to question it had i found many minstrels prepared like yourself to prefer renown even to life itself which most men think of greatly more consequence there are indeed noble sir replied bertram minstrels and with your reverence even belted knights themselves who do not sufficiently value that renown which is acquired at the risk of life to such ignoble men we must leave their own reward let us abandon to them earth and the things of earth since they cannot aspire to that glory which is the best reward of others the minstrel uttered these last words with such enthusiasm that the knight drew his bridle and stood fronting bertram with his countenance kindling at the same theme on which after a short silence he expressed himself with a like vivacity well fare thy heart gay companion i am happy to see there is still so much enthusiasm surviving in the world thou hast fairly won the minstrel groat and if i do not pay it in conformity to my sense of thy merit it shall be the fault of dame fortune who has graced my labours in these scottish wars with the niggard pay of scottish money a gold piece or two there must be remaining of the ransom of one french knight whom chance threw into my hands and that my friend shall surely be thine own and hark thee i aymer de valence who now speak to thee am born of the noble house of pembroke and though now landless shall by the grace of our lady have in time a fitting establishment wherein i will find room for a minstrel like thee if thy talents have not by that time found thee a better patron thank thee noble knight said the minstrel as well for thy present intentions as i hope i shall for thy future performance but i may say with truth that i have not the sordid inclination of many of my brethren he who partakes the true thirst of noble fame said the young knight can have little room in his heart for the love of gold but thou hast not yet told me friend minstrel what are the motives in particular which have attracted thy wandering steps to this wild country were i to do so replied bertram rather desirous to avoid the question as in some respects too nearly bordering on the secret purpose of his journey it might sound like a studied panegyric on thine own bold deeds sir knight and those of your companions in arms and such adulation minstrel as i am i hate like an empty cup at a companions lips but let me say in few words that douglas castle and the deeds of valour which it has witnessed have sounded wide through england nor is there a gallant knight or trusty minstrel whose heart does not throb at the name of the stronghold which in former days the foot of an englishman never entered except in hospitality there is a magic in the very names of sir john de walton and sir aymer de valence the gallant defenders of a place so often won back by its ancient lords and with such circumstances of valour and cruelty that it bears in england the name of the dangerous castle yet i would fain hear answered the knight your own minstrel account of those legends which have induced you for the amusement of future times to visit a country which at this period is so distracted and perilous if you can endure the length of a minstrel tale said bertram i for one am always amused by the exercise of my vocation and have no objection to tell my story provided you do not prove an impatient listener nay for that matter said the young knight a fair listener thou shalt have of me and if my reward be not great my attention at least shall be remarkable and he said the minstrel must be a poor gleeman who does not hold himself better paid with that than with gold or silver were the pieces english rosenobles on this condition then i begin a long story which may in one or other of its details find subject for better minstrels than myself and be listened to by such warriors as you hundreds of years hence chapter the fourth while many a merry lay and many a song cheerd the rough road we wishd the rough road long the rough road then returning in a round markd their impatient steps for all was fairy ground dr johnson it was about the year of redemption one thousand two hundred and eightyfive years began the minstrel when king alexander the third of scotland lost his daughter margaret whose only child of the same name called the maiden of norway as her father was king of that country became the heiress of this kingdom of scotland as well as of her fathers crown an unhappy death was this for alexander who had no nearer heirs left of his own body than this grandchild she indeed might claim his kingdom by birthright but the difficulty of establishing such a claim of inheritance must have been anticipated by all who bestowed a thought upon the subject the scottish king therefore endeavoured to make up for his loss by replacing his late queen who was an english princess sister of our edward the first with juletta daughter of the count de dreux the solemnities at the nuptial ceremony which took place in the town of jedburgh were very great and remarkable and particularly when amidst the display of a pageant which was exhibited on the occasion a ghastly spectre made its appearance in the form of a skeleton as the king of terrors is said to be represented your worship is free to laugh at this if you think it a proper subject for mirth but men are alive who viewed it with their own eyes and the event showed too well of what misfortunes this apparition was the singular prognostication i have heard the story said the knight but the monk who told it me suggested that the figure though unhappily chosen was perhaps purposely introduced as a part of the pageant i know not that said the minstrel dryly but there is no doubt that shortly after this apparition king alexander died to the great sorrow of his people the maid of norway his heiress speedily followed her grandfather to the grave and our english king sir knight raked up a claim of dependency and homage due he said by scotland which neither the lawyers nobles priests nor the very minstrels of scotland had ever before heard of now beshrew me interrupted sir aymer de valence this is beyond bargain i agreed to hear your tale with patience but i did not pledge myself that it should contain matter to the reproach of edward the first of blessed memory nor will i permit his name to be mentioned in my hearing without the respect due his high rank and noble qualities nay said the minstrel i am no highland bagpiper or genealogist to carry respect for my art so far as to quarrel with a man of worship who stops me at the beginning of a pibroch i am an englishman and wish dearly well to my country and above all i must speak the truth but i will avoid disputable topics your age sir though none of the ripest authorizes me to suppose you may have seen the battle of falkirk and other onslaughts in which the competition of bruce and baliol has been fiercely agitated and you will permit me to say that if the scottish have not had the right upon their side they have at least defended the wrong with the efforts of brave men and true of brave men i grant you said the knight for i have seen no cowards amongst them but as for truth they can best judge of it who know how often they have sworn faith to england and how repeatedly they have broken their vow i shall not stir the question said the minstrel leaving it to your worship to determine which has most falsehood he who compels a weaker person to take an unjust path or he who compelled by necessity takes the imposed oath without the intention of keeping his word nay nay said de valence let us keep our opinions for we are not likely to force each other from the faith we have adopted on this subject but take my advice and whilst thou travellest under an english pennon take heed that thou keepest off this conversation in the hall and kitchen where perhaps the soldier may be less tolerant than the officer and now in a word what is thy legend of this dangerous castle for that replied bertram methinks your worship is most likely to have a better edition than i who have not been in this country for many years but it is not for me to bandy opinions with your knightship i will even proceed with the tale as i have heard it i need not i presume inform your worship that the lords of douglas who founded this castle are second to no lineage in scotland in the antiquity of their descent nay they have themselves boasted that their family is not to be seen or distinguished like other great houses until it is found at once in a certain degree of eminence you may see us in the tree they say you cannot discover us in the twig you may see us in the stream you cannot trace us to the fountain in a word they deny that historians or genealogists can point out the first mean man named douglas who originally elevated the family and true it is that so far back as we have known this race they have always been renowned for valour and enterprise accompanied with the power which made that enterprise effectual enough said the knight i have heard of the pride and power of that great family nor does it interest me in the least to deny or detract from their bold claims to consideration in this respect without doubt you must also have heard noble sir replied the minstrel many things of james the present heir of the house of douglas more than enough answered the english knight he is known to have been a stout supporter of that outlawed traitor william wallace and again upon the first raising of the banner by this robert bruce who pretends to be king of scotland this young springald james douglas must needs start into rebellion anew he plunders his uncle the archbishop of st andrews of a considerable sum of money to fill the scottish usurpers not overburdened treasury debauches the servants of his relation takes arms and though repeatedly chastised in the field still keeps his vaunt and threatens mischief to those who in the name of his rightful sovereign defend the castle of douglasdale it is your pleasure to say so sir knight replied bertram yet i am sure were you a scot you would with patience hear me tell over what has been said of this young man by those who have known him and whose account of his adventures shows how differently the same tale may be told these men talk of the present heir of this ancient family as fully adequate to maintain and augment its reputation ready indeed to undergo every peril in the cause of robert the bruce because the bruce is esteemed by him his lawful king and sworn and devoted with such small strength as he can muster to revenge himself on those southrons who have for several years as he thinks unjustly possessed themselves of his fathers abode o replied sir aymer de valence we have heard much of his achievements in this respect and of his threats against our governor and ourselves yet we think it scarce likely that sir john de walton will move from douglasdale without the kings order although this james douglas a mere chicken take upon himself to crack his voice by crowing like a cock of the game sir answered bertram our acquaintance is but brief and yet i feel it has been so beneficial to me that i trust there is no harm in hoping that james douglas and you may never meet in bodily presence till the state of the two countries shall admit of peace being between you thou art obliging friend answered sir aymer and i doubt not sincere and truly thou seemest to have a wholesome sense of the respect due to this young knight when men talk of him in his native valley of douglas for me i am only poor aymer of valence without an acre of land or much hope of acquiring any unless i cut something huge with my broadsword out of the middle of these hills only this good minstrel if thou livest to tell my story may i pray thee to use thy scrupulous custom of searching out the verity and whether i live or die thou shalt not i think discover that thy late acquaintance of a spring morning hath added more to the laurels of james of douglas than any mans death must give to him by whose stronger arm or more lucky chance it is his lot to fall i nothing fear you sir knight said the minstrel for yours is that happy brain which bold in youth as beseems a young knight is in more advanced life the happy source of prudent counsel of which i would not by an early death wish thy country to be deprived thou art so candid then as to wish old england the benefit of good advice said sir aymer though thou leanest to the side of scotland in the controversy assuredly sir knight said the minstrel since in wishing that scotland and england each knew their own true interest i am bound to wish them both alike well and they should i think desire to live in friendship together occupying each their own portion of the same island and living under the same laws and being at peace with each other they might without fear face the enmity of the whole world if thy faith be so liberal answered the knight as becomes a good man thou must certainly pray sir minstrel for the success of england in the war by which alone these murderous hostilities of the northern nation can end in a solid peace the rebellions of this obstinate country are but the struggles of the stag when he is mortally wounded the animal grows weaker and weaker with every struggle till his resistance is effectually tamed by the hand of death not so sir knight said the minstrel if my creed is well taught me we ought not so to pray we may without offence intimate in our prayers the end we wish to obtain but it is not for us poor mortals to point out to an allseeing providence the precise manner in which our petitions are to be accomplished or to wish the downfall of a country to end its commotions as the deathstab terminates the agonies of the wounded stag whether i appeal to my heart or to my understanding the dictate would be to petition heaven for what is just and equal in the case and if i should fear for thee sir knight in an encounter with james of douglas it is only because he upholds as i conceive the better side of the debate and powers more earthly have presaged to him success do you tell me so sir minstrel said de valence in a threatening tone knowing me and my office your personal dignity and authority said bertram cannot change the right into wrong or avert what providence has decreed to take place you know i must presume that the douglas hath by various devices already contrived to make himself master of this castle of douglas three several times and that sir john de walton the present governor holds it with a garrison trebled in force and under the assurance that if without surprise he should keep it from the scottish power for a year and a day he shall obtain the barony of douglas with its extensive appendages in free property for his reward while on the other hand if he shall suffer the fortress during this space to be taken either by guile or by open force as has happened successively to the holders of the dangerous castle he will become liable to dishonour as a knight and to attainder as a subject and the chiefs who take share with him and serve under him will participate also in his guilt and his punishment all this i know well said sir aymer and i only wonder that having become public the conditions have nevertheless been told with so much accuracy but what has this to do with the issue of the combat if the douglas and i should chance to meet i will not surely be disposed to fight with less animation because i wear my fortune upon my sword or become coward because i fight for a portion of the douglass estate as well as for fame and for fatherland and after all hear me said the minstrel an ancient gleeman has said that in a false quarrel there is no true valour and the los or praise won therein is when balanced against honest fame as valueless as a wreath formed out of copper compared to a chaplet of pure gold but i bid you not take me for thy warrant in this important question thou well knowest how james of thirlwall the last english commander before sir john de walton was surprised and the castle sacked with circumstances of great inhumanity truly said sir aymer i think that scotland and england both have heard of that onslaught and of the disgusting proceedings of the scottish chieftain when he caused transport into the wild forest gold silver ammunition and armour and all things that could be easily removed and destroyed a large quantity of provisions in a manner equally savage and unheardof perhaps sir knight said bertram you were yourself an eyewitness of that transaction which has been spoken of far and wide and is called the douglas larder i saw not the actual accomplishment of the deed said de valence that is i witnessed it not adoing but i beheld enough of the sad relics to make the douglas larder never by me to be forgotten as a record of horror and abomination i would speak it truly by the hand of my father and by my honour as a knight and i will leave it to thee to judge whether it was a deed calculated to secure the smiles of heaven in favour of the actors this is my edition of the story a large quantity of provisions had during two years or thereabouts been collected from different points and the castle of douglas newly repaired and as was thought carefully guarded was appointed as the place where the said provisions were to be put in store for the service of the king of england or of the lord clifford whichever should first enter the western marches with an english army and stand in need of such a supply this army was also to relieve our wants i mean those of my uncle the earl of pembroke who for some time before had lain with a considerable force in the town called ayr near the old caledonian forest and where we had hot wars with the insurgent scots well sir it happened as in similar cases that thirlwall though a bold and active soldier was surprised in the castle of douglas about hallowmass by this same worthy young james douglas in no very good humour was he as you may suppose for his father called william the hardy or william longlegs having refused on any terms to become anglicized was made a lawful prisoner and died as such closely confined in berwick or as some say in newcastle the news of his fathers death had put young douglas into no small rage and tended i think to suggest what he did in his resentment embarrassed by the quantity of provisions which he found in the castle which the english being superior in the country he had neither the means to remove nor the leisure to stay and consume the fiend as i think inspired him with a contrivance to render them unfit for human use you shall judge yourself whether it was likely to be suggested by a good or an evil spirit according to this device the gold silver and other transportable commodities being carried to secret places of safety douglas caused the meat the malt and other corn or grain to be brought down into the castle cellar where he emptied the contents of the sacks into one loathsome heap striking out the heads of the barrels and puncheons so as to let the mingled drink run through the heap of meal grain and so forth the bullocks provided for slaughter were in like manner knocked on the head and their blood suffered to drain into the mass of edible substances and lastly the flesh of these oxen was buried in the same mass in which was also included the dead bodies of those in the castle who receiving no quarter from the douglas paid dear enough for having kept no better watch this base and unworthy abuse of provisions intended for the use of man together with throwing into the well of the castle carcasses of men and horses and other filth for polluting the same has since that time been called the douglas larder i pretend not good sir aymer said the minstrel to vindicate what you justly reprove nor can i conceive any mode of rendering provisions arranged after the form of the douglas larder proper for the use of any christian yet this young gentleman might perhaps act under the sting of natural resentment rendering his singular exploit more excusable than it may seem at first think if your own noble father had just died in a lingering captivity his inheritance seized upon and occupied as a garrison by a foreign enemy would not these things stir you to a mode of resentment which in cold blood and judging of it as the action of an enemy your honour might hold in natural and laudable abhorrence would you pay respect to dead and senseless objects which no one could blame your appropriating to your own use or even scruple the refusal of quarter to prisoners which is so often practised even in wars which are otherwise termed fair and humane you press me close minstrel said aymer de valence i at least have no great interest to excuse the douglas in this matter since its consequences were that i myself and the rest of my uncles host laboured with clifford and his army to rebuild this same dangerous castle and feeling no stomach for the cheer that the douglas had left us we suffered hard commons though i acknowledge we did not hesitate to adopt for our own use such sheep and oxen as the miserable scots had still left around their farmhouses and i jest not sir minstrel when i acknowledge in sad earnest that we martial men ought to make our petitions with peculiar penitence to heaven for mercy when we reflect on the various miseries which the nature of our profession compels us to inflict on each other it seems to me answered the minstrel that those who feel the stings of their own conscience should be more lenient when they speak of the offences of others nor do i greatly rely on a sort of prophecy which was delivered as the men of this hill district say to the young douglas by a man who in the course of nature should have been long since dead promising him a course of success against the english for having sacrificed his own castle to prevent their making it a garrison we have time enough for the story said sir aymer and methinks it would suit a knight and a minstrel better than the grave converse we have hitherto held which would have beseemed so god save me the mouths of two travelling friars so be it said the minstrel the rote or the viol easily changes its time and varies its note chapter the fifth a tale of sorrow for your eyes may weep a tale of horror for your flesh may tingle a tale of wonder for the eyebrows arch and the flesh curdles if you read it rightly old play your honour must be informed gentle sir aymer de valence that i have heard this story told at a great distance from the land in which it happened by a sworn minstrel the ancient friend and servant of the house of douglas one of the best it is said who ever belonged to that noble family this minstrel hugo hugonet by name attended his young master when on this fierce exploit as was his wont the castle was in total tumult in one corner the warmen were busy breaking up and destroying provisions in another they were slaying men horses and cattle and these actions were accompanied with appropriate sounds the cattle particularly had become sensible of their impending fate and with awkward resistance and piteous cries testified that reluctance with which these poor creatures look instinctively on the shambles the groans and screams of men undergoing or about to undergo the stroke of death and the screeches of the poor horses which were in mortal agony formed a fearful chorus hugonet was desirous to remove himself from such unpleasant sights and sounds but his master the douglas had been a man of some reading and his old servant was anxious to secure a book of poetry to which he had been attached of old this contained the lays of an ancient scottish bard who if an ordinary human creature while he was in this life cannot now perhaps be exactly termed such he was in short that thomas distinguished by the name of the rhymer and whose intimacy it is said became so great with the gifted people called the faery folk that he could like them foretell the future deed before it came to pass and united in his own person the quality of bard and of soothsayer but of late years he had vanished almost entirely from this mortal scene and although the time and manner of his death were never publicly known yet the general belief was that he was not severed from the land of the living but removed to the land of faery from whence he sometimes made excursions and concerned himself only about matters which were to come hereafter hugonet was the more earnest to prevent the loss of the works of this ancient bard as many of his poems and predictions were said to be preserved in the castle and were supposed to contain much especially connected with the old house of douglas as well as other families of ancient descent who had been subjects of this old mans prophecy and accordingly he determined to save this volume from destruction in the general conflagration to which the building was about to be consigned by the heir of its ancient proprietors with this view he hurried up into the little old vaulted room called the douglass study in which there might be some dozen old books written by the ancient chaplains in what the minstrels call the letter black he immediately discovered the celebrated lay called sir tristrem which has been so often altered and abridged as to bear little resemblance to the original hugonet who well knew the value in which this poem was held by the ancient lords of the castle took the parchment volume from the shelves of the library and laid it upon a small desk adjacent to the barons chair having made such preparation for putting it in safety he fell into a brief reverie in which the decay of light and the preparations for the douglas larder but especially the last sight of objects which had been familiar to his eyes now on the eve of destruction engaged him at that moment the bard therefore was thinking within himself upon the uncommon mixture of the mystical scholar and warrior in his old master when as he bent his eyes upon the book of the ancient rhymer he was astonished to observe it slowly removed from the desk on which it lay by an invisible hand the old man looked with horror at the spontaneous motion of the book for the safety of which he was interested and had the courage to approach a little nearer the table in order to discover by what means it had been withdrawn i have said the room was already becoming dark so as to render it difficult to distinguish any person in the chair though it now appeared on closer examination that a kind of shadowy outline of a human form was seated in it but neither precise enough to convey its exact figure to the mind nor so detailed as to intimate distinctly its mode of action the bard of douglas therefore gazed upon the object of his fear as if he had looked upon something not mortal nevertheless as he gazed more intently he became more capable of discovering the object which offered itself to his eyes and they grew by degrees more keen to penetrate what they witnessed a tall thin form attired in or rather shaded with a long flowing dusky robe having a face and physiognomy so wild and overgrown with hair as to be hardly human were the only marked outlines of the phantom and looking more attentively hugonet was still sensible of two other forms the outlines it seemed of a hart and a hind which appeared half to shelter themselves behind the person and under the robe of this supernatural figure a probable tale said the knight for you sir minstrel a man of sense as you seem to be to recite so gravely from what wise authority have you had this tale which though it might pass well enough amid clanging beakers must be held quite apocryphal in the sober hours of the morning by my minstrel word sir knight answered bertram i am no propagator of the fable if it be one hugonet the violer when he had retired into a cloister near the lake of pembelmere in wales communicated the story to me as i now tell it therefore as it was upon the authority of an eyewitness i apologize not for relating it to you since i could hardly discover a more direct source of knowledge be it so sir minstrel said the knight tell on thy tale and may thy legend escape criticism from others as well as from me hugonet sir knight answered bertram was a holy man and maintained a fair character during his whole life notwithstanding his trade may be esteemed a light one the vision spoke to him in an antique language like that formerly used in the kingdom of strath clyde being a species of scots or gaelic which few would have comprehended you are a learned man said the apparition and not unacquainted with the dialects used in your country formerly although they are now out of date and you are obliged to translate them into the vulgar saxon of deira or northumberland but highly must an ancient british bard prize one in this remote term of time who sets upon the poetry of his native country a value which invites him to think of its preservation at a moment of such terror as influences the present evening it is indeed said hugonet a night of terror that calls even the dead from the grave and makes them the ghastly and fearful companions of the living who or what art thou in gods name who breakest the bounds which divide them and revisitest thus strangely the state thou hast so long bid adieu to i am replied the vision that celebrated thomas the rhymer by some called thomas of erceldoun or thomas the true speaker like other sages i am permitted at times to revisit the scenes of my former life nor am i incapable of removing the shadowy clouds and darkness which overhang futurity and know thou afflicted man that what thou now seest in this woeful country is not a general emblem of what shall therein befall hereafter but in proportion as the douglasses are now suffering the loss and destruction of their home for their loyalty to the rightful heir of the scottish kingdom so hath heaven appointed for them a just reward and as they have not spared to burn and destroy their own house and that of their fathers in the bruces cause so is it the doom of heaven that as often as the walls of douglas castle shall be burnt to the ground they shall be again rebuilt still more stately and more magnificent than before a cry was now heard like that of a multitude in the courtyard joining in a fierce shout of exultation at the same time a broad and ruddy glow seemed to burst from the beams and rafters and sparks flew from them as from the smiths stithy while the element caught to its fuel and the conflagration broke its way through every aperture see ye that said the vision casting his eye towards the windows and disappearing begone the fated hour of removing this book is not yet come nor are thine the destined hands but it will be safe where i have placed it and the time of its removal shall come the voice was heard after the form had vanished and the brain of hugonet almost turned round at the wild scene which he beheld his utmost exertion was scarcely sufficient to withdraw him from the terrible spot and douglas castle that night sunk into ashes and smoke to arise in no great length of time in a form stronger than ever the minstrel stopt and his hearer the english knight remained silent for some minutes ere at length he replied it is true minstrel answered sir aymer that your tale is so far undeniable that this castle three times burned down by the heir of the house and of the barony has hitherto been as often reared again by henry lord clifford and other generals of the english who endeavoured on every occasion to build it up more artificially and more strongly than it had formerly existed since it occupies a position too important to the safety of our scottish border to permit our yielding it up this i myself have partly witnessed but i cannot think that because the castle has been so destroyed it is therefore decreed so to be repaired in future considering that such cruelties as surely cannot meet the approbation of heaven have attended the feats of the douglasses but i see thou art determined to keep thine own faith nor can i blame thee since the wonderful turns of fate which have attended this fortress are sufficient to warrant any one to watch for what seem the peculiar indications of the will of heaven but thou mayst believe good minstrel that the fault shall not be mine if the young douglas shall have opportunity to exercise his cookery upon a second edition of his family larder or to profit by the predictions of thomas the rhymer i do not doubt due circumspection upon your own part and sir john de waltons said bertram but there is no crime in my saying that heaven can accomplish its own purposes i look upon douglas castle as in some degree a fated place and i long to see what changes time may have made in it during the currency of twenty years above all i desire to secure if possible the volume of this thomas of erceldoun having in it such a fund of forgotten minstrelsy and of prophecies respecting the future fates of the british kingdom both northern and southern the knight made no answer but rode a little space forward keeping the upper part of the ridge of the water by which the road down the vale seemed to be rather sharply conducted it at length attained the summit of an acclivity of considerable length from this point and behind a conspicuous rock which appeared to have been pushed aside as it were like the scene of a theatre to admit a view of the under part of the valley the travellers beheld the extensive vale parts of which have been already shown in detail but which as the river became narrower was now entirely laid bare in its height and depth as far as it extended and displayed in its precincts at a little distance from the course of the stream the towering and lordly castle to which it gave the name the mist which continued to encumber the valley with its fleecy clouds showed imperfectly the rude fortifications which served to defend the small town of douglas which was strong enough to repel a desultory attack but not to withstand what was called in those days a formal siege the most striking feature was its church an ancient gothic pile raised on an eminence in the centre of the town and even then extremely ruinous to the left and lying in the distance might be seen other towers and battlements and divided from the town by a piece of artificial water which extended almost around it arose the dangerous castle of douglas sternly was it fortified after the fashion of the middle ages with donjon and battlements displaying above others the tall tower which bore the name of lord henrys or the cliffords tower yonder is the castle said aymer de valence extending his arm with a smile of triumph upon his brow thou mayst judge thyself whether the defences added to it under the clifford are likely to render its next capture a more easy deed than the last the minstrel barely shook his head and quoted from the psalmist nisi dominus custodiet nor did he prosecute the discourse though de valence answered eagerly my own edition of the text is not very different from thine but methinks thou art more spiritually minded than can always be predicated of a wandering minstrel god knows said bertram that if i or such as i are forgetful of the finger of providence in accomplishing its purposes in this lower world we have heavier blame than that of other people since we are perpetually called upon in the exercise of our fanciful profession to admire the turns of fate which bring good out of evil and which render those who think only of their own passions and purposes the executors of the will of heaven i do submit to what you say sir minstrel answered the knight and it would be unlawful to express any doubt of the truths which you speak so solemnly any more than of your own belief in them let me add sir that i think i have power enough in this garrison to bid you welcome and sir john de walton i hope will not refuse access to hall castle or knights bower to a person of your profession and by whose conversation we shall perhaps profit somewhat i cannot however lead you to expect such indulgence for your son considering the present state of his health but if i procure him the privilege to remain at the convent of saint bride he will be there unmolested and in safety until you have renewed your acquaintance with douglas dale and its history and are disposed to set forward on your journey i embrace your honours proposal the more willingly said the minstrel that i can recompense the father abbot a main point with holy men or women replied de valence who in time of warfare subsist by affording the visitors of their shrine the means of maintenance in their cloisters for a passing season the party now approached the sentinels on guard at the castle who were closely and thickly stationed and who respectfully admitted sir aymer de valence as next in command under sir john de walton fabian for so was the young squire named who attended on de valence mentioned it as his masters pleasure that the minstrel should also be admitted an old archer however looked hard at the minstrel as he followed sir aymer it is not for us said he or any of our degree to oppose the pleasure of sir aymer do valence nephew to the earl of pembroke in such a matter and for us master fabian welcomes are you to make the gleeman your companion both at bed and board as well as your visitant a week or two at the castle of douglas but your worship is well aware of the strict order of watch laid upon us and if solomon king of israel were to come here as a travelling minstrel by my faith i durst not give him entrance unless i had positive authority from sir john de walton do you doubt sirrah said aymer de valence who returned on hearing an altercation betwixt fabian and the archer do you doubt that i have good authority to entertain a guest or do you presume to contest it heaven forbid said the old man that i should presume to place my own desire in opposition to your worship who has so lately and so honourably acquired your spurs but in this matter i must think what will be the wish of sir john de walton who is your governor sir knight as well as mine and so far i hold it worth while to detain your guest until sir john return from a ride to the outposts of the castle and this i conceive being my duty will be no matter of offence to your worship methinks said the knight it is saucy in thee to suppose that my commands can have any thing in them improper or contradictory to those of sir john de walton thou mayst trust to me at least that thou shalt come to no harm keep this man in the guardroom let him not want good cheer and when sir john de walton returns report him as a person admitted by my invitation and if any thing more be wanted to make out your excuse i shall not be reluctant in stating it to the governor the archer made a signal of obedience with the pike which he held in his hand and resumed the grave and solemn manner of a sentinel upon his post he first however ushered in the minstrel and furnished him with food and liquor speaking at the same time to fabian who remained behind the smart young stripling had become very proud of late in consequence of obtaining the name of sir aymers squire and advancing a step in chivalry as sir aymer himself had somewhat earlier than the usual period been advanced from squire to knight i tell thee fabian said the old archer whose gravity sagacity and skill in his vocation while they gained him the confidence of all in the castle subjected him as he himself said occasionally to the ridicule of the young coxcombs and at the same time we may add rendered him somewhat pragmatic and punctilious towards those who stood higher than himself in birth and rank i tell thee fabian thou wilt do thy master sir aymer good service if thou wilt give him a hint to suffer an old archer manatarms or such like to give him a fair and civil answer respecting that which he commands for undoubtedly it is not in the first score of a mans years that he learns the various proper forms of military service and sir john de walton a most excellent commander no doubt is one earnestly bent on pursuing the strict line of his duty and will be rigorously severe as well believe me with thy master as with a lesser person nay he also possesses that zeal for his duty which induces him to throw blame if there be the slightest ground for it upon aymer de valence himself although his uncle the earl of pembroke was john de waltons steady patron and laid the beginning of his good fortune for all which by training up his nephew in the true discipline of the french wars sir john has taken the best way of showing himself grateful to the eld earl be it as you will old gilbert greenleaf answered fabian thou knowest i never quarrel with thy sermonizing and therefore give me credit for submitting to many a lecture from sir john de walton and thyself but thou drivest this a little too far if thou canst not let a day pass without giving me a flogging credit me sir john de walton will not thank thee if thou term him one too old to remember that he himself had once some green sap in his veins ay thus it is the old man will not forget that he has once been young nor the young that he must some day be old and so the one changes his manners into the lingering formality of advanced age and the other remains like a midsummer torrent swoln with rain every drop of water in it noise froth and overflow there is a maxim for thee gilbert heardest thou ever better hang it up amidst thy axioms of wisdom and see if it will not pass among them like fifteen to the dozen it will serve to bring thee off man when the winepot thine only fault good gilbert hath brought thee on occasion into something of a scrape best keep it for thyself good sir squire said the old man methinks it is more like to stand thyself one day in good stead who ever heard of a knight or of the wood of which a knight is made and that is a squire being punished corporally like a poor old archer or horseboy your worst fault will be mended by some of these witty sayings and your best service will scarce be rewarded more thankfully than by giving thee the name of fabian the fabler or some such witty title having unloosed his repartee to this extent old greenleaf resumed a certain acidity of countenance which may be said to characterise those whose preferment hath become frozen under the influence of the slowness of its progress and who display a general spleen against such as have obtained the advancement for which all are struggling earlier and as they suppose with less merit than their own from time to time the eye of the old sentinel stole from the top of his pike and with an air of triumph rested upon the young man fabian as if to see how deeply the wound had galled him while at the same time he held himself on the alert to perform whatever mechanical duty his post might require both fabian and his master were at the happy period of life when such discontent as that of the grave archer affected them lightly and at the very worst was considered as the jest of an old man and a good soldier the more especially as he was always willing to do the duty of his companions and was much trusted by sir john de walton who though very much younger had been bred up like greenleaf in the wars of edward the first and was tenacious in upholding strict discipline which since the death of that great monarch had been considerably neglected by the young and warmblooded valour of england meantime it occurred to sir aymer de valence that though in displaying the usual degree of hospitality shown to such a man as bertram he had merely done what was becoming his own rank as one possessed of the highest honours of chivalry the selfstyled minstrel might not in reality be a man of that worth which he assumed there was certainly something in his conversation at least more grave if not more austere than was common to those of his calling and when he recollected many points of sir john de waltons minuteness a doubt arose in his mind that the governor might not approve of his having introduced into the castle a person of bertrams character who was capable of making observations from which the garrison might afterwards feel much danger and inconvenience secretly therefore he regretted that he had not fairly intimated to the wandering minstrel that his reception or that of any stranger within the dangerous castle was not at present permitted by the circumstances of the times in this case the express line of his duty would have been his vindication and instead perhaps of discountenance and blame he would have had praise and honour from his superior with these thoughts passing through his mind some tacit apprehension arose of a rebuke on the part of his commandingofficer for this officer notwithstanding his strictness sir aymer loved as well as feared he went therefore towards the guardroom of the castle under the pretence of seeing that the rites of hospitality had been duly observed towards his late travelling companion the minstrel arose respectfully and from the manner in which he paid his compliments seemed if he had not expected this call of enquiry at least to be in no degree surprised at it sir aymer on the other hand assumed an air something more distant than he had yet used towards bertram and in reverting to his former invitation he now so far qualified it as to say that the minstrel knew that he was only second in command and that effectual permission to enter the castle ought to be sanctioned by sir john de walton there is a civil way of seeming to believe any apology which people are disposed to receive in payment without alleging suspicion of its currency the minstrel therefore tendered his thanks for the civility which had so far been shown to him it was a mere wish of passing curiosity he said which if not granted could be attended with no consequences either inconvenient or disagreeable to him thomas of erceldoun was according to the welsh triads one of the three bards of britain who never stained a spear with blood or was guilty either of taking or retaking castles and fortresses and thus far not a person likely after death to be suspected of such warlike feats but i can easily conceive why sir john de walton should have allowed the usual rites of hospitality to fall into disuse and why a man of public character like myself ought not to desire food or lodging where it is accounted so dangerous and it can surprise no one why the governor did not even invest his worthy young lieutenant with the power of dispensing with so strict and unusual a rule these words very coolly spoken had something of the effect of affronting the young knight as insinuating that he was not held sufficiently trustworthy by sir john de walton with whom he had lived on terms of affection and familiarity though the governor had attained his thirtieth year and upwards and his lieutenant did not yet write himself oneandtwenty the full age of chivalry having been in his case particularly dispensed with owing to a feat of early manhood ere he had fully composed the angry thoughts which were chafing in his mind the sound of a hunting bugle was heard at the gate and from the sort of general stir which it spread through the garrison it was plain that the governor had returned from his ride every sentinel seemingly animated by his presence shouldered his pike more uprightly gave the word of the post more sharply and seemed more fully awake and conscious of his duty sir john de walton having alighted from his horse asked greenleaf what had passed during his absence the old archer thought it his duty to say that a minstrel who seemed like a scotchman or wandering borderer had been admitted into the castle while his son a lad sick of the pestilence so much talked of had been left for a time at the abbey of saint bride this he said on fabians information the archer added that the father was a man of tale and song who could keep the whole garrison amused without giving them leave to attend to their own business we want no such devices to pass the time answered the governor and we would have been better satisfied if our lieutenant had been pleased to find us other guests and fitter for a direct and frank communication than one who by his profession is a detractor of god and a deceiver of man yet said the old soldier who could hardly listen even to his commander without indulging the humour of contradiction i have heard your honour intimate that the trade of a minstrel when it is justly acted up to is as worthy as even the degree of knighthood itself such it may have been in former days answered the knight but in modern minstrelsy the duty of rendering the art an incentive to virtue is forgotten and it is well if the poetry which fired our fathers to noble deeds does not now push on their children to such as are base and unworthy but i will speak upon this to my friend aymer than whom i do not know a more excellent or a more highspirited young man while discoursing with the archer in this manner sir john de walton of a tall and handsome figure advanced and stood within the ample arch of the guardroom chimney and was listened to in reverential silence by trusty gilbert who filled up with nods and signs as an attentive auditor the pauses in the conversation the conduct of another hearer of what passed was not equally respectful but from his position he escaped observation this third person was no other than the squire fabian who was concealed from observation by his position behind the hob or projecting portion of the oldfashioned fireplace and hid himself yet more carefully when he heard the conversation between the governor and the archer turn to the prejudice as he thought of his master the squires employment at this time was the servile task of cleaning sir aymers arms which was conveniently performed by heating upon the projection already specified the pieces of steel armour for the usual thin coating of varnish he could not therefore if he should be discovered be considered as guilty of any thing insolent or disrespectful he was better screened from view as a thick smoke arose from a quantity of oak panelling carved in many cases with the crest and achievements of the douglas family which being the fuel nearest at hand lay smouldering in the chimney and gathering to a blaze the governor unconscious of this addition to his audience pursued his conversation with gilbert greenleaf i need not tell you he said that i am interested in the speedy termination of this siege or blockade with which douglas continues to threaten us my own honour and affections are engaged in keeping this dangerous castle safe in englands behalf but i am troubled at the admission of this stranger and young de valence would have acted more strictly in the line of his duty if he had refused to this wanderer any communication with this garrison without my permission pity it is replied old greenleaf shaking his head that this good natured and gallant young knight is somewhat drawn aside by the rash advices of his squire the boy fabian who has bravery but as little steadiness in him as a bottle of fermented small beer now hang thee thought fabian to himself for an old relic of the wars stuffed full of conceit and warlike terms like the soldier who to keep himself from the cold has lapped himself so close in a tattered ensign for a shelter that his very outside may show nothing but rags and blazonry i would not think twice of the matter were the party less dear to me said sir john de walton but i would fain be of use to this young man even although i should purchase his improvement in military knowledge at the expense of giving him a little pain experience should as it were be burnt in upon the mind of a young man and not merely impressed by marking the lines of his chart out for him with chalk i will remember the hint you greenleaf have given and take an opportunity of severing these two young men and though i most dearly love the one and am far from wishing ill to the other yet at present as you well hint the blind is leading the blind and the young knight has for his assistant and counsellor too young a squire and that must be amended marry out upon thee old palmerworm said the page within himself have i found thee in the very fact of maligning myself and my master as it is thy nature to do towards all the hopeful young buds of chivalry if it were not to dirty the arms of an eleve of chivalry by measuring them with one of thy rank i might honour thee with a knightly invitation to the field while the scandal which thou hast spoken is still foul upon thy tongue as it is thou shalt not carry one kind of language publicly in the castle and another before the governor upon the footing of having served with him under the banner of longshanks i will carry to my master this tale of thine evil intentions and when we have concerted together it shall appear whether the youthful spirits of the garrison or the grey beards are most likely to be the hope and protection of this same castle of douglas it is enough to say that fabian pursued his purpose in carrying to his master and in no very good humour the report of what had passed between sir john de walton and the old soldier he succeeded in representing the whole as a formal offence intended to sir aymer de valence while all that the governor did to remove the suspicions entertained by the young knight could not in any respect bring him to take a kindly view of the feelings of his commander towards him he retained the impression which he had formed from fabians recital of what he had heard and did not think he was doing sir john de walton any injustice in supposing him desirous to engross the greatest share of the fame acquired in the defence of the castle and thrusting back his companions who might reasonably pretend to a fair portion of it the mother of mischief says a scottish proverb is no bigger than a midges wing footnote ie gnats wing in this matter of quarrel neither the young man nor the older knight had afforded each other any just cause of offence de walton was a strict observer of military discipline in which he had been educated from his extreme youth and by which he was almost as completely ruled as by his natural disposition and his present situation added force to his original education common report had even exaggerated the military skill the love of adventure and the great variety of enterprise ascribed to james the young lord of douglas he had in the eyes of this southern garrison the faculties of a fiend rather than those of a mere mortal for if the english soldiers cursed the tedium of the perpetual watch and ward upon the dangerous castle which admitted of no relaxation from the severity of extreme duty they agreed that a tall form was sure to appear to them with a battleaxe in his hand and entering into conversation in the most insinuating manner never failed with an ingenuity and eloquence equal to that of a fallen spirit to recommend to the discontented sentinel some mode in which by giving his assistance to betray the english he might set himself at liberty the variety of these devices and the frequency of their recurrence kept sir john de waltons anxiety so perpetually upon the stretch that he at no time thought himself exactly out of the black douglass reach any more than the good christian supposes himself out of reach of the wiles of the devil while every new temptation instead of confirming his hope seems to announce that the immediate retreat of the evil one will be followed by some new attack yet more cunningly devised under this general state of anxiety and apprehension the temper of the governor changed somewhat for the worse and they who loved him best regretted most that he became addicted to complain of the want of diligence on the part of those who neither invested with responsibility like his nor animated by the hope of such splendid rewards did not entertain the same degree of watchful and incessant suspicion as himself the soldiers muttered that the vigilance of their governor was marked with severity the officers and men of rank of whom there were several as the castle was a renowned school of arms and there was a certain merit attained even by serving within its walls complained at the same time that sir john de walton no longer made parties for hunting for hawking or for any purpose which might soften the rigours of warfare and suffered nothing to go forward but the precise discipline of the castle on the other hand it may be usually granted that the castle is well kept where the governor is a disciplinarian and where feuds and personal quarrels are found in the garrison the young men are usually more in fault than those whose greater experience has convinced them of the necessity of using the strictest precautions a generous mind and such was sir john de waltons is often in this way changed and corrupted by the habit of overvigilance and pushed beyond its natural limits of candour neither was sir aymer de valence free from a similar change suspicion though from a different cause seemed also to threaten to bias his open and noble disposition in those qualities which had hitherto been proper to him it was in vain that sir john de walton studiously sought opportunities to give his younger friend indulgences which at times were as far extended as the duty of the garrison permitted the blow was struck the alarm had been given to a proud and fiery temper on both sides and while de valence entertained an opinion that he was unjustly suspected by a friend who was in several respects bound to him de walton on the other hand was led to conceive that a young man of whom he took a charge as affectionate as if he had been a son of his own and who owed to his lessons what he knew of warfare and what success he had obtained in life had taken offence at trifles and considered himself illtreated on very inadequate grounds the seeds of disagreement thus sown between them failed not like the tares sown by the enemy among the wheat to pass from one class of the garrison to another the soldiers though without any better reason than merely to pass the time took different sides between their governor and his young lieutenant and so the ball of contention being once thrown up between them never lacked some arm or other to keep it in motion chapter the sixth alas they had been friends in youth but whispering tongues can poison truth and constancy lives in realms above and life is thorny and youth is vain and to be wroth with one we love doth work like madness in the brain each spoke words of high disdain and insult to his hearts dear brother but never either found another to free the hollow heart from paining they stood aloof the scars remaining like cliffs which had been rent asunder a dreary sea now flows between but neither heat nor frost nor thunder shall wholly do away i ween the marks of that which once hath been christabelle of coleridge in prosecution of the intention which when his blood was cool seemed to him wisest sir john de walton resolved that he would go to the verge of indulgence with his lieutenant and his young officers furnish them with every species of amusement which the place rendered possible and make them ashamed of their discontent by overloading them with courtesy the first time therefore that he saw aymer de valence after his return to the castle he addressed him in high spirits whether real or assumed what thinkest thou my young friend said de walton if we try some of the woodland sports proper they say to this country there are still in our neighbourhood some herds of the caledonian breed of wild cattle which are nowhere to be found except among the moorlands the black and rugged frontier of what was anciently called the kingdom of strathclyde there are some hunters too who have been accustomed to the sport and who vouch that these animals are by far the most bold and fierce subjects of chase in the island of britain you will do as you please replied sir aymer coldly but it is not i sir john who would recommend for the sake of a huntingmatch that you should involve the whole garrison in danger you know best the responsibilities incurred by your office here and no doubt must have heedfully attended to them before making a proposal of such a nature i do indeed know my own duty replied de walton offended in turn and might be allowed to think of yours also without assuming more than my own share of responsibility but it seems to me as if the commander of this dangerous castle among other inabilities were as old people in this country say subjected to a spell and one which renders it impossible for him to guide his conduct so as to afford pleasure to those whom he is most desirous to oblige not a great many weeks since whose eyes would have sparkled like those of sir aymer de valence at the proposal of a general huntingmatch after a new object of game and now what is his bearing when such sport is proposed merely i think to disappoint my purpose of obliging him a cold acquiescence drops half frozen from his lips and he proposes to go to rouse the wild cattle with an air of gravity as if he were undertaking a pilgrimage to the tomb of a martyr not so sir john answered the young knight in our present situation we stand conjoined in more charges than one and although the greater and controlling trust is no doubt laid upon you as the elder and abler knight yet still i feel that i myself have my own share of a serious responsibility i trust therefore you will indulgently hear my opinion and bear with it even though it should appear to have relation to that part of our common charge which is more especially intrusted to your keeping the dignity of knighthood which i have the honour to share with you the accolade laid on my shoulder by the royal plantagenet entitles me methinks to so much grace i cry you mercy said the elder cavalier i forgot how important a person i had before me dubbed by king edward himself who was moved no doubt by special reasons to confer such an early honour and i certainly feel that i overstep my duty when i propose any thing that savours like idle sport to a person of such grave pretensions sir john de walton retorted de valence we have had something too much of this let it stop here all that i mean to say is that in this wardship of douglas castle it will not be by my consent if any amusement which distinctly infers a relaxation of discipline be unnecessarily engaged in and especially such as compels us to summon to our assistance a number of the scots whose evil disposition towards us we well know nor will i though my years have rendered me liable to such suspicion suffer any thing of this kind to be imputed to me and if unfortunately though i am sure i know not why we are in future to lay aside those bonds of familiar friendship which formerly linked us to each other yet i see no reason why we should not bear ourselves in our necessary communications like knights and gentlemen and put the best construction on each others motives since there can be no reason for imputing the worst to any thing that comes from either of us you may be right sir aymer de valence said the governor bending stiffly and since you say we are no longer bound to each other as friends you may be certain nevertheless that i will never permit a hostile feeling of which you are the object to occupy my bosom you have been long and i hope not uselessly my pupil in the duties of chivalry you are the near relation of the earl of pembroke my kind and constant patron and if these circumstances are well weighed they form a connexion which it would be difficult at least for me to break through if you feel yourself as you seem to intimate less strictly tied by former obligations you must take your own choice in fixing our relations towards each other i can only say replied de valence that my conduct will naturally be regulated by your own and you sir john cannot hope more devoutly than i do that our military duties may be fairly discharged without interfering with our friendly intercourse the knights here parted after a conference which once or twice had very nearly terminated in a full and cordial explanation but still there was wanting one kind heartfelt word from either to break as it were the ice which was fast freezing upon their intercourse and neither chose to be the first in making the necessary advances with sufficient cordiality though each would have gladly done so had the other appeared desirous of meeting it with the same ardour but their pride was too high and prevented either from saying what might at once have put them upon an open and manly footing they parted therefore without again returning to the subject of the proposed diversion until it was afterwards resumed in a formal note praying sir aymer de valence to accompany the commandant of douglas castle upon a solemn huntingmatch which had for its object the wild cattle of the neighbouring dale the time of meeting was appointed at six in the morning beyond the gate of the outer barricade and the chase was declared to be ended in the afternoon when the recheat should be blown beneath the great oak known by the name of sholtos club which stood a remarkable object where douglas dale was bounded by several scattered trees the outskirts of the forest and hill country the usual warning was sent out to the common people or vassals of the district which they notwithstanding their feeling of antipathy received in general with delight upon the great epicurean principle of carpe diem that is to say in whatever circumstances it happens to present itself be sure you lose no recreation which life affords a huntingmatch has still its attractions even though an english knight take his pleasure in the woods of the douglas it was no doubt afflicting to these faithful vassals to acknowledge another lord than the redoubted douglas and to wait by wood and river at the command of english officers and in the company of their archers whom they accounted their natural enemies still it was the only species of amusement which had been permitted them for a long time and they were not disposed to omit the rare opportunity of joining in it the chase of the wolf the wild boar or even the timid stag required silvan arms the wild cattle still more demanded this equipment of war bows and shafts boarspears and sharp swords and other tools of the chase similar to those used in actual war considering this the scottish inhabitants were seldom allowed to join in the chase except under regulations as to number and arms and especially in preserving a balance of force on the side of the english soldiers which was very offensive to them the greater part of the garrison was upon such occasions kept on foot and several detachments formed according to the governors direction were stationed in different positions in case any quarrel should suddenly break out chapter the seventh the drivers thorough the wood went for to raise the deer bowmen bickered upon the bent with their broad arrows clear the wylde thorough the woods went on every side shear grehounds thorough the groves glent for to kill thir deer ballad of chevy chase old edit the appointed morning came in cold and raw after the manner of the scottish march weather dogs yelped yawned and shivered and the huntsmen though hardy and cheerful in expectation of the days sport twitched their mauds or lowland plaids close to their throats and looked with some dismay at the mists which floated about the horizon now threatening to sink down on the peaks and ridges of prominent mountains and now to shift their position under the influence of some of the uncertain gales which rose and fell alternately as they swept along the valley nevertheless the appearance of the whole formed as is usual in almost all departments of the chase a gay and a jovial spectacle a brief truce seemed to have taken place between the nations and the scottish people appeared for the time rather as exhibiting the sports of their mountains in a friendly manner to the accomplished knights and bonny archers of old england than as performing a feudal service neither easy nor dignified in itself at the instigation of usurping neighbours the figures of the cavaliers now half seen now exhibited fully and at the height of strenuous exertion according to the character of the dangerous and broken ground particularly attracted the attention of the pedestrians who leading the dogs or beating the thickets dislodged such objects of chase as they found in the dingles and kept their eyes fixed upon their companions rendered more remarkable from being mounted and the speed at which they urged their horses the disregard of all accidents being as perfect as meltonmowbray itself or any other noted field of hunters of the present day can exhibit the principles on which modern and ancient hunting were conducted are however as different as possible a fox or even a hare is in our own day considered as a sufficient apology for a days exercise to forty or fifty dogs and nearly as many men and horses but the ancient chase even though not terminating as it often did in battle carried with it objects more important and an interest immeasurably more stirring if indeed one species of exercise can be pointed out as more universally exhilarating and engrossing than others it is certainly that of the chase the poor overlaboured drudge who has served out his day of life and wearied all his energies in the service of his fellowmortals he who has been for many years the slave of agriculture or still worse of manufactures engaged in raising a single peck of corn from year to year or in the monotonous labours of the desk can hardly remain dead to the general happiness when the chase sweeps past him with hound and horn and for a moment feels all the exultation of the proudest cavalier who partakes the amusement let any one who has witnessed the sight recall to his imagination the vigour and lively interest which he has seen inspired into a village including the oldest and feeblest of its inhabitants in the words of wordsworth it is on such occasions up timothy up with your staff and away not a soul will remain in the village today the hare has just started from hamiltons grounds and skiddaw is glad with the cry of the hounds but compare those inspiring sounds to the burst of a whole feudal population enjoying the sport whose lives instead of being spent in the monotonous toil of modern avocations have been agitated by the hazards of war and of the chase its near resemblance and you must necessarily suppose that the excitation is extended like a fire which catches to dry heath to use the common expression borrowed from another amusement all is fish that comes in the net on such occasions an ancient huntingmatch the nature of the carnage excepted was almost equal to a modern battle when the strife took place on the surface of a varied and unequal country a whole district poured forth its inhabitants who formed a ring of great extent called technically a tinchel and advancing and narrowing their circle by degrees drove before them the alarmed animals of every kind all and each of which as they burst from the thicket or the moorland were objects of the bow the javelin or whatever missile weapons the hunters possessed while others were run down and worried by large greyhounds or more frequently brought to bay when the more important persons present claimed for themselves the pleasure of putting them to death with their chivalrous hands incurring individually such danger as is inferred from a mortal contest even with the timid buck when he is brought to the deathstruggle and has no choice but yielding his life or putting himself upon the defensive by the aid of his splendid antlers and with all the courage of despair the quantity of game found in douglas dale on this occasion was very considerable for as already noticed it was a long time since a hunting upon a great scale had been attempted under the douglasses themselves whose misfortunes had commenced several years before with those of their country the english garrison too had not sooner judged themselves strong or numerous enough to exercise these valued feudal privileges in the meantime the game increased considerably the deer the wild cattle and the wild boars lay near the foot of the mountains and made frequent irruptions into the lower part of the valley which in douglas dale bears no small resemblance to an oasis surrounded by tangled woods and broken moors occasionally rocky and showing large tracts of that bleak dominion to which wild creatures gladly escape when pressed by the neighbourhood of man as the hunters traversed the spots which separated the field from the wood there was always a stimulating uncertainty what sort of game was to be found and the marksman with his bow ready bent or his javelin poised and his good and wellbitted horse thrown upon its haunches ready for a sudden start observed watchfully what should rush from the covert so that were it deer boar wolf wild cattle or any other species of game he might be in readiness the wolf which on account of its ravages was the most obnoxious of the beasts of prey did not however supply the degree of diversion which his name promised he usually fled far in some instances many miles before he took courage to turn to bay and though formidable at such moments destroying both dogs and men by his terrible bite yet at other times was rather despised for his cowardice the boar on the other hand was a much more irascible and courageous animal the wild cattle the most formidable of all the tenants of the ancient caledonian forest were however to the english cavaliers by far the most interesting objects of pursuit footnote these bulls are thus described by hector boetius concerning whom he says in this wood namely the caledonian wood were sometime white bulls with crisp and curling manes like fierce lions and though they seemed meek and tame in the remanent figure of their bodies they were more wild than any other beasts and had such hatred against the society and company of men that they never came in the woods nor lesuries where they found any foot or hand thereof and many days after they eat not of the herbs that were touched or handled by man these bulls were so wild that they were never taken but by slight and crafty labour and so impatient that after they were taken they died from insupportable dolour as soon as any man invaded these bulls they rushed with such terrible press upon him that they struck him to the earth taking no fear of hounds sharp lances or other most penetrative weapons boetius chron scot vol i page xxxix the wild cattle of this breed which are now only known in one manor in england that of chillingham castle in northumberland the seat of the earl of tankerville were in the memory of man still preserved in three places in scotland namely drumlanrig cumbernauld and the upper park at hamilton palace at all of which places except the last i believe they have now been destroyed on account of their ferocity but though those of modern days are remarkable for their white colour with black muzzles and exhibiting in a small degree the black mane about three or four inches long by which the bulls in particular are distinguished they do not by any means come near the terrific description given us by the ancient authors which has made some naturalists think that these animals should probably be referred to a different species though possessing the same general habits and included in the same genus the bones which are often discovered in scottish mosses belong certainly to a race of animals much larger than those of chillingham which seldom grow to above stone of lbs the general weight varying from to stone we should be accounted very negligent by one class of readers did we not record that the beef furnished by those cattle is of excellent flavour and finely marbled the following is an extract from a letter received by sir walter scott some time after the publication of the novel when it is wished to kill any of the cattle at chillingham the keeper goes into the herd on horseback in which way they are quite accessible and singling out his victim takes aim with a large riflegun and seldom fails in bringing him down if the poor animal makes much bellowing in his agony and especially if the ground be stained with his blood his companions become very furious and are themselves i believe accessory to his death after which they fly off to a distant part of the park and he is drawn away on a sledge lord tankerville is very tenacious of these singular animals he will on no account part with a living one and hardly allows of a sufficient number being killed to leave pasturage for those that remain it happened on one occasion three or four years ago that a party visiting at the castle among whom were some men of war who had hunted buffaloes in foreign parts obtained permission to do the keepers work and shoot one of the wild cattle they sallied out on horseback and duly equipped for the enterprise attacked their object the poor animal received several wounds but none of them proving fatal he retired before his pursuers roaring with pain and rage till planting himself against a wall or tree he stood at bay offering a front of defiance in this position the youthful heir of the castle lord ossulston rode up to give him the fatal shot though warned of the danger of approaching near to the enraged animal and especially of firing without first having turned his horses head in a direction to he ready for flight he discharged his piece but ere he could turn his horse round to make his retreat the raging beast had plunged his immense horns into its flank the horse staggered and was near falling but recovering by a violent effort he extricated himself from his infuriated pursuer making off with all the speed his wasting strength supplied his entrails meanwhile dragging on the ground till at length he fell and died at the same moment the animal was now close upon his rear and the young lord would unquestionably have shared the fate of his unhappy steed had not the keeper deeming it full time to conclude the days diversion fired at the instant his shot brought the beast to the ground and running in with his large knife he put a period to his existence this scene of gentlemanly pastime was viewed from a turret of the castle by lady tankerville and her female visitors such a situation for the mother of the young hero was anything but enviable altogether the ringing of bugles the clattering of horses hoofs the lowing and bellowing of the enraged mountain cattle the sobs of deer mingled by throttling dogs the wild shouts of exultation of the men made a chorus which extended far through the scene in which it arose and seemed to threaten the inhabitants of the valley even in its inmost recesses during the course of the hunting when a stag or a boar was expected one of the wild cattle often came rushing forward bearing down the young trees crashing the branches in its progress and in general dispersing whatever opposition was presented to it by the hunters sir john de walton was the only one of the chivalry of the party who individually succeeded in mastering one of these powerful animals like a spanish tauridor he bore down and killed with his lance a ferocious bull two wellgrown calves and three kine were also slain being unable to carry off the quantity of arrows javelins and other missiles directed against them by the archers and drivers but many others in spite of every endeavour to intercept them escaped to their gloomy haunts in the remote skirts of the mountain called cairntable with their hides well feathered with those marks of human enmity a large portion of the morning was spent in this way until a particular blast from the master of the hunt announced that he had not forgot the discreet custom of the repast which on such occasions was provided for upon a scale proportioned to the multitude who had been convened to attend the sport the blast peculiar to the time assembled the whole party in an open space in a wood where their numbers had room and accommodation to sit down upon the green turf the slain game affording a plentiful supply for roasting or broiling an employment in which the lower class were all immediately engaged while puncheons and pipes placed in readiness and scientifically opened supplied gascoigne wine and mighty ale at the pleasure of those who chose to appeal to them the knights whose rank did not admit of interference were seated by themselves and ministered to by their squires and pages to whom such menial services were not accounted disgraceful but on the contrary a proper step of their education the number of those distinguished persons seated upon the present occasion at the table of dais as it was called in virtue of a canopy of green boughs with which it was overshadowed comprehended sir john de walton sir aymer de valance and some reverend brethren dedicated to the service of saint bride who though scottish ecclesiastics were treated with becoming respect by the english soldiers one or two scottish retainers or vavasours maintaining perhaps in prudence a suitable deference to the english knights sat at the bottom of the table and as many english archers peculiarly respected by their superiors were invited according to the modern phrase to the honours of the sitting sir john de walton sat at the head of the table his eye though it seemed to have no certain object yet never for a moment remained stationary but glanced from one countenance to another of the ring formed by his guests for such they all were no doubt though he himself could hardly have told upon what principle he had issued the invitations and even apparently was at a loss to think what in one or two cases had procured him the honour of their presence one person in particular caught de waltons eye as having the air of a redoubted manatarms although it seemed as if fortune had not of late smiled upon his enterprises he was a tall rawboned man of an extremely rugged countenance and his skin which showed itself through many a loophole in his dress exhibited a complexion which must have endured all the varieties of an outlawed life and akin to one who had according to the customary phrase taen the bent with robin bruce in other words occupied the moors with him as an insurgent some such idea certainly crossed de waltons mind yet the apparent coolness and absence of alarm with which the stranger sat at the board of an english officer at the same time being wholly in his power had much in it which was irreconcilable with any such suggestion de walton and several of those about him had in the course of the day observed that this tattered cavalier the most remarkable parts of whose garb and equipments consisted of an old coatofmail and a rusted yet massive partisan about eight feet long was possessed of superior skill in the art of hunting to any individual of their numerous party the governor having looked at this suspicious figure until he had rendered the stranger aware of the special interest which he attracted at length filled a goblet of choice wine and requested him as one of the best pupils of sir tristem who had attended upon the days chase to pledge him in a vintage superior to that supplied to the general company i suppose however sir said de walton you will have no objections to put off my challenge of a brimmer until you can answer my pledge in gascoigne wine which grew in the kings own demesne was pressed for his own lip and is therefore fittest to be emptied to his majestys health and prosperity one half of the island of britain said the woodsman with great composure will be of your honours opinion but as i belong to the other half even the choicest liquor in gascony cannot render that health acceptable to me a murmur of disapprobation ran through the warriors present the priests hung their heads looked deadly grave and muttered their paternosters you see stranger said de walton sternly that your speech discomposes the company it may be so replied the man in the same blunt tone and it may happen that there is no harm in the speech notwithstanding do you consider that it is made in my presence answered de walton yes sir governor and have you thought what must be the necessary inference continued de walton i may form a round guess answered the stranger what i might have to fear if your safe conduct and word of honour when inviting me to this hunting were less trustworthy than i know full well it really is but i am your guest your meat is even now passing my throat your cup filled with right good wine i have just now quaffed off and i would not fear the rankest paynim infidel if we stood in such relation together much less an english knight i tell you besides sir knight you undervalue the wine we have quaffed the high flavour and contents of your cup grow where it will give me spirit to tell you one or two circumstances which cold cautious sobriety would in a moment like this have left unsaid you wish i doubt not to know who i am my christian name is michael my surname is that of turnbull a redoubted clan to whose honours even in the field of hunting or of battle i have added something my abode is beneath the mountain of rubieslaw by the fair streams of teviot you are surprised that i know how to hunt the wild cattle i who have made them my sport from infancy in the lonely forests of jed and southdean and have killed more of them than you or any englishman in your host ever saw even if you include the doughty deeds of this day the bold borderer made this declaration with the same provoking degree of coolness which predominated in his whole demeanour and was indeed his principal attribute his effrontery did not fail to produce its effect upon sir john de walton who instantly called out to arms to arms secure the spy and traitor ho pages and yeomen william anthony bendthebow and greenleaf seize the traitor and bind him with your bowstrings and dogleashes bind him i say until the blood start from beneath his nails here is a goodly summons said turnbull with a sort of horselaugh were i as sure of being answered by twenty men i could name there would be small doubt of the upshot of this day the archers thickened around the hunter yet laid no hold on him none of them being willing to be the first who broke the peace proper to the occasion tell me said de walton thou traitor for what waitest thou here simply and solely said the jed forester that i may deliver up to the douglas the castle of his ancestors and that i may ensure thee sir englishman the payment of thy deserts by cutting that very throat which thou makest such a brawling use of at the same time perceiving that the yeomen were crowding behind him to carry their lords commands into execution so soon as they should be reiterated the huntsman turned himself short round upon those who appeared about to surprise him and having by the suddenness of the action induced them to step back a pace he proceeded yes john de walton my purpose was ere now to have put thee to death as one whom i find in possession of that castle and territory which belong to my master a knight much more worthy than thyself but i know not why i have paused thou hast given me food when i have hungered for twenty four hours i have not therefore had the heart to pay thee at advantage as thou hast deserved begone from this place and country and take the fair warning of a foe thou hast constituted thyself the mortal enemy of this people and there are those among them who have seldom been injured or defied with impunity take no care in searching after me it will be in vain until i meet thee at a time which will come at my pleasure not thine push not your inquisition into cruelty to discover by what means i have deceived you for it is impossible for you to learn and with this friendly advice look at me and take your leave for although we shall one day meet it may be long ere i see you again de walton remained silent hoping that his prisoner for he saw no chance of his escaping might in his communicative humour drop some more information and was not desirous to precipitate a fray with which the scene was likely to conclude unconscious at the same time of the advantage which he thereby gave the daring hunter as turnbull concluded his sentence he made a sudden spring backwards which carried him out of the circle formed around him and before they were aware of his intentions at once disappeared among the underwood seize him seize him repeated de walton let us have him at least at our discretion unless the earth has actually swallowed him this indeed appeared not unlikely for near the place where turnbull had made the spring there yawned a steep ravine into which he plunged and descended by the assistance of branches bushes and copsewood until he reached the bottom where he found some road to the outskirts of the forest through which he made his escape leaving the most expert woodsmen among the pursuers totally at fault and unable to trace his footsteps chapter the eighth this interlude carried some confusion into the proceedings of the hunt thus suddenly surprised by the apparition of michael turnbull an armed and avowed follower of the house of douglas a sight so little to be expected in the territory where his master was held a rebel and a bandit and where he himself must have been well known to most of the peasantry present the circumstance made an obvious impression on the english chivalry sir john de walton looked grave and thoughtful ordered the hunters to be assembled on the spot and directed his soldiers to commence a strict search among the persons who had attended the chase so as to discover whether turnbull had any companions among them but it was too late to make that enquiry in the strict fashion which de walton directed the scottish attendants on the chase when they beheld that the hunting under pretence of which they were called together was interrupted for the purpose of laying hands upon their persons and subjecting them to examination took care to suit their answers to the questions put to them in a word they kept their own secret if they had any many of them conscious of being the weaker party became afraid of foul play slipt away from the places to which they had been appointed and left the huntingmatch like men who conceived they had been invited with no friendly intent sir john de walton became aware of the decreasing numbers of the scottish their gradual disappearance awakening in the english knight that degree of suspicion which had of late become his peculiar characteristic take i pray thee said he to sir aymer de valence as many menat arms as thou canst get together in five minutes space and at least a hundred of the mounted archers and ride as fast as thou canst without permitting them to straggle from thy standard to reinforce the garrison of douglas for i have my own thoughts what may have been attempted on the castle when we observe with our own eyes such a nest of traitors here assembled with reverence sir john replied aymer you shoot in this matter rather beyond the mark that the scottish peasants have had bad thoughts against us i will be the last to deny but long debarred from any silvan sport you cannot wonder at their crowding to any diversion by wood or river and still less at their being easily alarmed as to the certainty of the safe footing on which they stand with us the least rough usage is likely to strike them with fear and with the desire of escape and so and so said sir john de walton who had listened with a degree of impatience scarce consistent with the grave and formal politeness which one knight was accustomed to bestow upon another and so i would rather see sir aymer de valence busy his horses heels to execute my orders than give his tongue the trouble of impugning them at this sharp reprimand all present looked at each other with indications of marked displeasure sir aymer was highly offended but saw it was no time to indulge in reprisal he bowed until the feather which was in his barretcap mingled with his horses mane and without reply for he did not even choose to trust his voice in reply at the moment headed a considerable body of cavalry by the straightest road back to the castle of douglas when he came to one of those eminences from which he could observe the massive and complicated towers and walls of the old fortress with the glitter of the broad lake which surrounded it on three sides he felt much pleasure at the sight of the great banner of england which streamed from the highest part of the building i knew it he internally said i was certain that sir john de walton had become a very woman in the indulgence of his fears and suspicions alas that a situation of responsibility should so much have altered a disposition which i have known so noble and so knightly by this good day i scarce know in what manner i should demean me when thus publicly rebuked before the garrison certainly he deserves that i should at some time or other let him understand that however he may triumph in the exercise of his shortlived command yet when man is to meet with man it will puzzle sir john de walton to show himself the superior of aymer de valence or perhaps to establish himself as his equal but if on the contrary his fears however fantastic are sincere at the moment he expresses them it becomes me to obey punctually commands which however absurd are imposed in consequence of the governors belief that they are rendered necessary by the times and not inventions designed to vex and domineer over his officers in the indulgence of his official powers i would i knew which is the true statement of the case and whether the once famed de walton is become afraid of his enemies more than fits a knight or makes imaginary doubts the pretext of tyrannizing over his friend i cannot say it would make much difference to me but i would rather have it that the man i once loved had turned a petty tyrant than a weakspirited coward and i would be content that he should study to vex me rather than be afraid of his own shadow with these ideas passing in his mind the young knight crossed the causeway which traversed the piece of water that fed the moat and passing under the strongly fortified gateway gave strict orders for letting down the portcullis and elevating the drawbridge even at the appearance of de waltons own standard before it a slow and guarded movement from the huntingground to the castle of douglas gave the governor ample time to recover his temper and to forget that his young friend had shown less alacrity than usual in obeying his commands he was even disposed to treat as a jest the length of time and extreme degree of ceremony with which every point of martial discipline was observed on his own readmission to the castle though the raw air of a wet spring evening whistled around his own unsheltered person and those of his followers as they waited before the castle gate for the exchange of passwords the delivery of keys and all the slow minutiae attendant upon the movements of a garrison in a wellguarded fortress come said he to an old knight who was peevishly blaming the lieutenantgovernor it was my own fault i spoke but now to aymer de valence with more authoritative emphasis than his newlydubbed dignity was pleased with and this precise style of obedience is a piece of not unnatural and very pardonable revenge well we will owe him a return sir philip shall we not this is not a night to keep a man at the gate this dialogue overheard by some of the squires and pages was bandied about from one to another until it entirely lost the tone of good humour in which it was spoken and the offence was one for which sir john de walton and old sir philip were to meditate revenge and was said to have been represented by the governor as a piece of mortal and intentional offence on the part of his subordinate officer thus an increasing feud went on from day to day between two warriors who with no just cause of quarrel had at heart every reason to esteem and love each other it became visible in the fortress even to those of the lower rank who hoped to gain some consequence by intermingling in the species of emulation produced by the jealousy of the commanding officers an emulation which may take place indeed in the present day but can hardly have the same sense of wounded pride and jealous dignity attached to it which existed in times when the personal honour of knighthood rendered those who possessed it jealous of every punctilio so many little debates took place between the two knights that sir aymer de valence thought himself under the necessity of writing to his uncle and namesake the earl of pembroke stating that his officer sir john de walton had unfortunately of late taken some degree of prejudice against him and that after having borne with many provoking instances of his displeasure he was now compelled to request that his place of service should be changed from the castle of douglas to wherever honour could be acquired and time might be given to put an end to his present cause of complaint against his commanding officer through the whole letter young sir aymer was particularly cautious how he expressed his sense of sir john de waltons jealousy or severe usage but such sentiments are not easily concealed and in spite of him an air of displeasure glanced out from several passages and indicated his discontent with his uncles old friend and companion in arms and with the sphere of military duty which his uncle had himself assigned him an accidental movement among the english troops brought sir aymer an answer to his letter sooner than he could have hoped for at that time of day in the ordinary course of correspondence which was then extremely slow and interrupted pembroke a rigid old warrior entertained the most partial opinion of sir john de walton who was a work as it were of his own hands and was indignant to find that his nephew whom he considered as a mere boy elated by having had the dignity of knighthood conferred upon him at an age unusually early did not absolutely coincide with him in this opinion he replied to him accordingly in a tone of high displeasure and expressed himself as a person of rank would write to a young and dependent kinsman upon the duties of his profession and as he gathered his nephews cause of complaint from his own letter he conceived that he did him no injustice in making it slighter than it really was he reminded the young man that the study of chivalry consisted in the faithful and patient discharge of military service whether of high or low degree according to the circumstances in which war placed the champion that above all the post of danger which douglas castle had been termed by common consent was also the post of honour and that a young man should be cautious how he incurred the supposition of being desirous of quitting his present honourable command because he was tired of the discipline of a military director so renowned as sir john de walton much also there was as was natural in a letter of that time concerning the duty of young men whether in council or in arms to be guided implicitly by their elders and it was observed with justice that the commanding officer who had put himself into the situation of being responsible with his honour if not his life for the event of the siege or blockade might justly and in a degree more than common claim the implicit direction of the whole defence lastly pembroke reminded his nephew that he was in a great measure dependent upon the report of sir john de walton for the character which he was to sustain in after life and reminded him that a few actions of headlong and inconsiderate valour would not so firmly found his military reputation as months and years spent in regular humble and steady obedience to the commands which the governor of douglas castle might think necessary in so dangerous a conjuncture this missive arrived within so short a time after the despatch of the letter to which it was a reply that sir aymer was almost tempted to suppose that his uncle had some mode of corresponding with de walton unknown to the young knight himself and to the rest of the garrison and as the earl alluded to some particular displeasure which had been exhibited by de valence on a late trivial occasion his uncles knowledge of this and other minutiae seemed to confirm his idea that his own conduct was watched in a manner which he did not feel honourable to himself or dignified on the part of his relative in a word he conceived himself exposed to that sort of surveillance of which in all ages the young have accused the old it hardly needs to say that the admonition of the earl of pembroke greatly chafed the fiery spirit of his nephew insomuch that if the earl had wished to write a letter purposely to increase the prejudices which he desired to put an end to he could not have made use of terms better calculated for that effect the truth was that the old archer gilbert greenleaf had without the knowledge of the young knight gone to pembrokes camp in ayrshire and was recommended by sir john de walton to the earl as a person who could give such minute information respecting aymer de valence as he might desire to receive the old archer was as we have seen a formalist and when pressed on some points of sir aymer de valences discipline he did not hesitate to throw out hints which connected with those in the knights letter to his uncle made the severe old earl adopt too implicitly the idea that his nephew was indulging a spirit of insubordination and a sense of impatience under authority most dangerous to the character of a young soldier a little explanation might have produced a complete agreement in the sentiments of both but for this fate allowed neither time nor opportunity and the old earl was unfortunately induced to become a party instead of a negotiator in the quarrel and by decision more embroild the fray sir john de walton soon perceived that the receipt of pembrokes letter did not in any respect alter the cold ceremonious conduct of his lieutenant towards him which limited their intercourse to what their situation rendered indispensable and exhibited no advances to any more frank or intimate connexion thus as may sometimes be the case between officers in their relative situations even at the present day they remained in that cold stiff degree of official communication in which their intercourse was limited to as few expressions as the respective duties of their situation absolutely demanded such a state of misunderstanding is in fact worse than a downright quarrel the latter may be explained or apologized for or become the subject of mediation but in such a case as the former an eclaircissement is as unlikely to take place as a general engagement between two armies which have taken up strong defensive positions on both sides duty however obliged the two principal persons in the garrison of douglas castle to be often together when they were so far from seeking an opportunity of making up matters that they usually revived ancient subjects of debate it was upon such an occasion that de walton in a very formal manner asked de valence in what capacity and for how long time it was his pleasure that the minstrel called bertram should remain at the castle a week said the governor is certainly long enough in this time and place to express the hospitality due to a minstrel certainly replied the young man i have not interest enough in the subject to form a single wish upon it in that case resumed de walton i shall request of this person to cut short his visit at the castle of douglas i know no particular interest replied aymer de valence which i can possibly have in this mans motions he is here under pretence of making some researches after the writings of thomas of erceldoun called the rhymer which he says are infinitely curious and of which there is a volume in the old barons study saved somehow from the flames at the last conflagration this told you know as much of his errand as i do and if you hold the presence of a wandering old man and the neighbourhood of a boy dangerous to the castle under your charge you will no doubt do well to dismiss them it will cost but a word of your mouth pardon me said de walton the minstrel came here as one of your retinue and i could not in fitting courtesy send him away without your leave i am sorry then answered sir aymer in my turn that you did not mention your purpose sooner i never entertained a dependent vassal or servant whose residence in the castle i would wish to have prolonged a moment beyond your honourable pleasure i am sorry said sir john de walton that we two have of late grown so extremely courteous that it is difficult for us to understand each other this minstrel and his son come from we know not where and are bound we know not whither there is a report among some of your escort that this fellow bertram upon the way had the audacity to impugn even to your face the king of englands right to the crown of scotland and that he debated the point with you while your other attendants were desired by you to keep behind and out of hearing hah said sir aymer do you mean to found on that circumstance any charge against my loyalty i pray you to observe that such an averment would touch mine honour which i am ready and willing to defend to the last gasp no doubt of it sir knight answered the governor but it is the strolling minstrel and not the highborn english knight against whom the charge is brought well the minstrel comes to this castle and he intimates a wish that his son should be allowed to take up his quarters at the little old convent of saint bride where two or three scottish nuns and friars are still permitted to reside most of them rather out of respect to their order than for any good will which they are supposed to bear the english or their sovereign it may also be noticed that his leave was purchased by a larger sum of money if my information be correct than is usually to be found in the purses of travelling minstrels a class of wanderers alike remarkable for their poverty and for their genius what do you think of all this i replied de valence i am happy that my situation as a soldier under command altogether dispenses with my thinking of it at all my post as lieutenant of your castle is such that if i can manage matters so as to call my honour and my soul my own i must think that quite enough of freewill is left at my command and i promise you shall not have again to reprove or send a bad report of me to my uncle on that account this is beyond sufferance said sir john de walton half aside and then proceeded aloud do not for heavens sake do yourself and me the injustice of supposing that i am endeavouring to gain an advantage over you by these questions recollect young knight that when you evade giving your commanding officer your advice when required you fail as much in point of duty as if you declined affording him the assistance of your sword and lance such being the case answered de valence let me know plainly on what matter it is that you require my opinion i will deliver it plainly and stand by the result even if i should have the misfortune a crime unpardonable in so young a man and so inferior an officer to differ from that of sir john de walton i would ask you then sir knight of valence answered the governor what is your opinion with respect to this minstrel bertram and whether the suspicions respecting him and his son are not such as to call upon me in performance of my duty to put them to a close examination with the question ordinary and extraordinary as is usual in such cases and to expel them not only from the castle but from the whole territory of douglas dale under pain of scourging if they be again found wandering in these parts you ask me my opinion said de valence and you shall have it sir knight of walton and freely and fairly as if matters stood betwixt us on a footing as friendly as they ever did i agree with you that most of those who in this day profess the science of minstrelsy are altogether unqualified to support the higher pretensions of that noble order minstrels by right are men who have dedicated themselves to the noble occupation of celebrating knightly deeds and generous principles it is in their verse that the valiant knight is handed down to fame and the poet has a right nay is bound to emulate the virtues which he praises the looseness of the times has diminished the consequence and impaired the morality of this class of wanderers their satire and their praise are now too often distributed on no other principle than love of gain yet let us hope that there are still among them some who know and also willingly perform their duty my own opinion is that this bertram holds himself as one who has not shared in the degradation of his brethren nor bent the knee to the mammon of the times it must remain with you sir to judge whether such a person honourably and morally disposed can cause any danger to the castle of douglas but believing from the sentiments he has manifested to me that he is incapable of playing the part of a traitor i must strongly remonstrate against his being punished as one or subjected to the torture within the walls of an english garrison i should blush for my country if it required of us to inflict such wanton misery upon wanderers whose sole fault is poverty and your own knightly sentiments will suggest more than would become me to state to sir john de walton unless in so far as is necessary to apologize for retaining my own opinion sir john de waltons dark brow was stricken with red when he heard an opinion delivered in opposition to his own which plainly went to stigmatize his advice as ungenerous unfeeling and unknightly he made an effort to preserve his temper while he thus replied with a degree of calmness you have given your opinion sir aymer de valence and that you have given it openly and boldly without regard to my own i thank you it is not quite so clear that i am obliged to defer my own sentiments to yours in case the rules on which i hold my office the commands of the king and the observations which i may personally have made shall recommend to me a different line of conduct from that which you think it right to suggest de walton bowed in conclusion with great gravity and the young knight returning the reverence with exactly the same degree of stiff formality asked whether there were any particular orders respecting his duty in the castle and having received an answer in the negative took his departure sir john de walton after an expression of impatience as if disappointed at finding that the advance which he had made towards an explanation with his young friend had proved unexpectedly abortive composed his brow as if to deep thought and walked several times to and fro in the apartment considering what course he was to take in these circumstances it is hard to censure him severely he said when i recollect that on first entering upon life my own thoughts and feelings would have been the same with those of this giddy and hot headed but generous boy now prudence teaches me to suspect mankind in a thousand instances where perhaps there is not sufficient ground if i am disposed to venture my own honour and fortune rather than an idle travelling minstrel should suffer a little pain which at all events i might make up to him by money still have i a right to run the risk of a conspiracy against the king and thus advance the treasonable surrender of the castle of douglas for which i know so many schemes are formed for which too none can be imagined so desperate but agents will be found bold enough to undertake the execution a man who holds my situation although the slave of conscience ought to learn to set aside those false scruples which assume the appearance of flowing from our own moral feeling whereas they are in fact instilled by the suggestion of affected delicacy i will not i swear by heaven be infected by the follies of a boy such as aymer i will not that i may defer to his caprices lose all that love honour and ambition can propose for the reward of twelve months service of a nature the most watchful and unpleasant i will go straight to my point and use the ordinary precautions in scotland which i should employ in normandy or gascoigny what ho page who waits there one of his attendants replied to his summons seek me out gilbert greenleaf the archer and tell him i would speak with him touching the two bows and the sheaf of arrows concerning which i gave him a commission to ayr a few minutes intervened after the order was given when the archer entered holding in his hand two bowstaves not yet fashioned and a number of arrows secured together with a thong he bore the mysterious looks of one whose apparent business is not of very great consequence but is meant as a passport for other affairs which are in themselves of a secret nature accordingly as the knight was silent and afforded no other opening for greenleaf that judicious negotiator proceeded to enter upon such as was open to him here are the bowstaves noble sir which you desired me to obtain while i was at ayr with the earl of pembrokes army they are not so good as i could have wished yet are perhaps of better quality than could have been procured by any other than a fair judge of the weapon the earl of pembrokes whole camp are frantic mad in order to procure real spanish staves from the groyne and other ports in spain but though two vessels laden with such came into the port of ayr said to be for the kings army yet i believe never one half of them have come into english hands these two grew in sherwood which having been seasoned since the time of robin hood are not likely to fail either in strength or in aim in so strong a hand and with so just an eye as those of the men who wait on your worship and who has got the rest since two ships cargoes of new bowstaves are arrived at ayr and thou with difficulty hast only procured me two old ones said the governor faith i pretend not skill enough to know answered greenleaf shrugging his shoulders talk there is of plots in that country as well as here it is said that their bruce and the rest of his kinsmen intend a new maygame and that the outlawed king proposes to land near turnberry early in summer with a number of stout kernes from ireland and no doubt the men of his mock earldom of garrick are getting them ready with bow and spear for so hopeful an undertaking i reckon that it will not cost us the expense of more than a few score of sheaves of arrows to put all that matter to rights do you talk then of conspiracies in this part of the country greenleaf said de walton i know you are a sagacious fellow well bred for many a day to the use of the bent stick and string and will not allow such a practice to go on under thy nose without taking notice of it i am old enough heaven knows said greenleaf and have had good experience of these scottish wars and know well whether these native scots are a people to be trusted to by knight or yeoman say they are a false generation and say a good archer told you so who with a fair aim seldom missed a handsbreadth of the white ah sir your honour knows how to deal with them ride them strongly and rein them hard you are not like those simple novices who imagine that all is to be done by gentleness and wish to parade themselves as courteous and generous to those faithless mountaineers who never in the course of their lives knew any tincture either of courteousness or generosity thou alludest to some one said the governor and i charge thee gilbert to be plain and sincere with me thou knowest methinks that in trusting me thou wilt come to no harm it is true it is true sir said the old remnant of the wars carrying his hand to his brow but it were imprudent to communicate all the remarks which float through an old mans brain in the idle moments of such a garrison as this one stumbles unawares on fantasies as well as realities and thus one gets not altogether undeservedly the character of a talebearer and mischiefmaker among his comrades and methinks i would not willingly fall under that accusation speak frankly to me answered de walton and have no fear of being misconstrued whosoever the conversation may concern nay in plain truth answered gilbert i fear not the greatness of this young knight being as i am the oldest soldier in the garrison and having drawn a bowstring long and many a day ere he was weaned from his nurses breast it is then said de walton my lieutenant and friend aymer de valence at whom your suspicions point at nothing replied the archer touching the honour of the young knight himself who is as brave as the sword he wears and his youth considered stands high in the roll of english chivalry but he is young as your worship knows and i own that in the choice of his company he disturbs and alarms me why you know greenleaf answered the governor that in the leisure of a garrison a knight cannot always confine his sports and pleasures among those of his own rank who are not numerous and may not be so gamesome or fond of frolic as he would desire them to be i know that well answered the archer nor would i say a word concerning your honours lieutenant for joining any honest fellows however inferior their rank in the wrestling ring or at a bout of quarterstaff but if sir aymer de valence has a fondness for martial tales of former days methinks he had better learn them from the ancient soldiers who have followed edward the first whom god assoilzie and who have known before his time the barons wars and other onslaughts in which the knights and archers of merry england transmitted so many gallant actions to be recorded by fame this truly i say were more beseeming the earl of pembrokes nephew than to see him closet himself day after day with a strolling minstrel who gains his livelihood by reciting nonsense and lies to such young men as are fond enough to believe him of whom hardly any one knows whether he be english or scottish in his opinions and still less can any one pretend to say whether he is of english or scottish birth or with what purpose he lies lounging about this castle and is left free to communicate every thing which passes within it to those old mutterers of matins at st brides who say with their tongues god save king edward but pray in their hearts god save king robert the bruce such a communication he can easily carry on by means of his son who lies at saint brides cell as your worship knows under pretence of illness how do you say exclaimed the governor under pretence is he not then really indisposed nay he may be sick to the death for aught i know said the archer but if so were it not then more natural that the father should attend his sons sickbed than that he should be ranging about this castle where one eternally meets him in the old barons study or in some corner where you least expect to find him if he has no lawful object replied the knight it might be as you say but he is said to be in quest of ancient poems or prophecies of merlin of the rhymer or some other old bard and in truth it is natural for him to wish to enlarge his stock of knowledge and power of giving amusement and where should he find the means save in a study filled with ancient books no doubt replied the archer with a sort of dry civil sneer of incredulity i have seldom known an insurrection in scotland but that it was prophesied by some old forgotten rhyme conjured out of dust and cobwebs for the sake of giving courage to these north country rebels who durst not otherwise have abidden the whistling of the greygoose shaft but curled heads are hasty and with license even your own train sir knight retains too much of the fire of youth for such uncertain times as the present thou hast convinced me gilbert greenleaf and i will look into this mans business and occupation more closely than hitherto this is no time to peril the safety of a royal castle for the sake of affecting generosity towards a man of whom we know so little and to whom till we receive a very full explanation we may without doing him injustice attach grave suspicions is he now in the apartment called the barons study your worship will be certain to find him there replied greenleaf then follow me with two or three of thy comrades and keep out of sight but within hearing it may be necessary to arrest this man my assistance said the old archer shall be at hand when you call but but what said the knight i hope i am not to find doubts and disobedience on all hands certainly not on mine replied greenleaf i would only remind your worship that what i have said was a sincere opinion expressed in answer to your worships question and that as sir aymer de valence has avowed himself the patron of this man i would not willingly be left to the hazard of his revenge pshaw answered de walton is aymer de valence governor of this castle or am i or to whom do you imagine you are responsible for answering such questions as i may put to you nay replied the archer secretly not displeased at seeing de walton show some little jealousy of his own authority believe me sir knight that i know my own station and your worships and that i am not now to be told to whom i owe obedience to the study then and let us find the man said the governor a fine matter indeed subjoined greenleaf following him that your worship should have to go in person to look after the arrest of so mean an individual but your honour is right these minstrels are often jugglers and possess the power of making their escape by means which borrel footnote unlearned folk like myself are disposed to attribute to necromancy without attending to these last words sir john de walton set forth towards the study walking at a quick pace as if this conversation had augmented his desire to find himself in possession of the person of the suspected minstrel traversing the ancient passages of the castle the governor had no difficulty in reaching the study which was strongly vaulted with stone and furnished with a sort of iron cabinet intended for the preservation of articles and papers of value in case of fire here he found the minstrel seated at a small table sustaining before him a manuscript apparently of great antiquity from which he seemed engaged in making extracts the windows of the room were very small and still showed some traces that they had originally been glazed with a painted history of saint bride another mark of the devotion of the great family of douglas to their tutelar saint the minstrel who had seemed deeply wrapped in the contemplation of his task on being disturbed by the unlookedfor entrance of sir john de walton rose with every mark of respect and humility and remaining standing in the governors presence appeared to wait for his interrogations as if he had anticipated that the visit concerned himself particularly i am to suppose sir minstrel said sir john de walton that you have been successful in your search and have found the roll of poetry or prophecies that you proposed to seek after amongst these broken shelves and tattered volumes more successful than i could have expected replied the minstrel considering the effects of the conflagration this sir knight is apparently the fatal volume for which i sought and strange it is considering the heavy chance of other books contained in this library that i have been able to find a few though imperfect fragments of it since therefore you have been permitted to indulge your curiosity said the governor i trust minstrel you will have no objection to satisfy mine the minstrel replied with the same humility that if there was any thing within the poor compass of his skill which could gratify sir john de walton in any degree he would but reach his lute and presently obey his commands you mistake sir said sir john somewhat harshly i am none of those who have hours to spend in listening to tales or music of former days my life has hardly given me time enough for learning the duties of my profession far less has it allowed me leisure for such twangling follies i care not who knows it but my ear is so incapable judging of your art which you doubtless think a noble one that i can scarcely tell the modulation of one tune from another in that case replied the minstrel composedly i can hardly promise myself the pleasure of affording your worship the amusement which i might otherwise have done nor do i look for any from your hand said the governor advancing a step nearer to him and speaking in a sterner tone i want information sir which i am assured you can give me if you incline and it is my duty to tell you that if you show unwillingness to speak the truth i know means by which it will become my painful duty to extort it in a more disagreeable manner than i would wish if your questions sir knight answered bertram be such as i can or ought to answer there shall be no occasion to put them more than once if they are such as i cannot or ought not to reply to believe me that no threats of violence will extort an answer from me you speak boldly said sir john de walton but take my word for it that your courage will be put to the test i am as little fond of proceeding to such extremities as you can be of undergoing them but such will be the natural consequence of your own obstinacy i therefore ask you whether bertram be your real name whether you have any other profession than that of a travelling minstrel and lastly whether you have any acquaintance or connexion with any englishman or scottishman beyond the walls of this castle of douglas to these questions replied the minstrel i have already answered the worshipful knight sir aymer de valence and having fully satisfied him it is not i conceive necessary that i should undergo a second examination nor is it consistent either with your worships honour or that of the lieutenantgovernor that such a reexamination should take place you are very considerate replied the governor of my honour and of that of sir aymer de valence take my word for it they are both in perfect safety in our own keeping and may dispense with your attention i ask you will you answer the enquiries which it is my duty to make or am i to enforce obedience by putting you under the penalties of the question i have already it is my duty to say seen the answers you have returned to my lieutenant and they do not satisfy me he at the same time clapped his hands and two or three archers showed themselves stripped of their tunics and only attired in their shirts and hose i understand said the minstrel that you intend to inflict upon me a punishment which is foreign to the genius of the english laws in that no proof is adduced of my guilt i have already told that i am by birth an englishman by profession a minstrel and that i am totally unconnected with any person likely to nourish any design against this castle of douglas sir john de walton or his garrison what answers you may extort from me by bodily agony i cannot to speak as a plain dealing christian hold myself responsible for i think that i can endure as much pain as any one i am sure that i never yet felt a degree of agony that i would not willingly prefer to breaking my plighted word or becoming a false informer against innocent persons but i own i do not know the extent to which the art of torture may be carried and though i do not fear you sir john de walton yet i must acknowledge that i fear myself since i know not to what extremity your cruelty may be capable of subjecting me or how far i may be enabled to bear it i therefore in the first place protest that i shall in no manner be liable for any words which i may utter in the course of any examination enforced from me by torture and you must therefore under such circumstances proceed to the execution of an office which permit me to say is hardly that which i expected to have found thus administered by an accomplished knight like yourself hark you sir replied the governor you and i are at issue and in doing my duty i ought instantly to proceed to the extremities i have threatened but perhaps you yourself feel less reluctance to undergo the examination as proposed than i shall do in commanding it i will therefore consign you for the present to a place of confinement suitable to one who is suspected of being a spy upon this fortress until you are pleased to remove such suspicions your lodgings and nourishment are those of a prisoner in the meantime before subjecting you to the question take notice i will myself ride to the abbey of saint bride and satisfy myself whether the young person whom you would pass as your son is possessed of the same determination as that which you yourself seem to assert it may so happen that his examination and yours may throw such light upon each other as will decidedly prove either your guilt or innocence without its being confirmed by the use of the extraordinary question if it be otherwise tremble for your sons sake if not for your own have i shaken you sir or do you fear for your boys young sinews and joints the engines which in your case you seem willing to defy sir answered the minstrel recovering from the momentary emotion he had shown i leave it to yourself as a man of honour and candour whether you ought in common fairness to form a worse opinion of any man because he is not unwilling to incur in his own person severities which he would not desire to be inflicted upon his child a sickly youth just recovering from a dangerous disease it is my duty answered de walton after a short pause to leave no stone unturned by which this business may be traced to the source and if thou desirest mercy for thy son thou wilt thyself most easily attain it by setting him the example of honesty and plaindealing the minstrel threw himself back on the seat as if fully resolved to bear every extremity that could be inflicted rather than make any farther answer than he had already offered sir john de walton himself seemed in some degree uncertain what might now be his best course he felt an invincible repugnance to proceed without due consideration in what most people would have deemed the direct line of his duty by inflicting the torture both upon father and son but deep as was his sense of devotion towards the king and numerous as were the hopes and expectations he had formed upon the strict discharge of his present high trust he could not resolve upon having recourse at once to this cruel method of cutting the knot bertrams appearance was venerable and his power of words not unworthy of his aspect and bearing the governor remembered that aymer de valence whose judgment in general it was impossible to deny had described him as one of those rare individuals who vindicated the honour of a corrupted profession by their personal good behaviour and he acknowledged to himself that there was gross cruelty and injustice in refusing to admit the prisoner to the credit of being a true and honest man until by way of proving his rectitude he had strained every sinew and crushed every joint in his body as well as those of his son i have no touchstone he said internally which can distinguish truth from falsehood the bruce and his followers are on the alerthe has certainly equipped the galleys which lay at rachrin during winter this story too of greenleaf about arms being procured for a new insurrection tallies strangely with the appearance of that savagelooking forester at the hunt and all tends to show that something is upon the anvil which it is my duty to provide against i will therefore pass over no circumstance by which i can affect the mind through hope or fear but please god to give me light from any other source i will not think it lawful to torment these unfortunate and it may yet be honest men he accordingly took his departure from the library whispering a word to greenleaf respecting the prisoner he had reached the outward door of the study and his satellites had already taken the minstrel into their grasp when the voice of the old man was heard calling upon de walton to return for a single moment what hast thou to say sir said the governor be speedy for i have already lost more time in listening to thee than i am answerable for and so i advise thee for thine own sake i advise thee said the minstrel for thine own sake sir john de walton to beware how thou dost insist on thy present purpose by which thou thyself alone of all men living will most severely suffer if thou harmest a hair of that young mans head nay if thou permittest him to undergo any privation which it is in thy power to prevent thou wilt in doing so prepare for thine own suffering a degree of agony more acute than anything else in this mortal world could cause thee i swear by the most blessed objects of our holy religion i call to witness that holy sepulchre of which i have been an unworthy visitor that i speak nothing but the truth and that thou wilt one day testify thy gratitude for the part i am now acting it is my interest as well as yours to secure you in the safe possession of this castle although assuredly i know some things respecting it and respecting your worship which i am not at liberty to tell without the consent of that youth bring me but a note under his hand consenting to my taking you into our mystery and believe me you will soon see those clouds charmed away since there was never a doleful uncertainty which more speedily changed to joy or a thundercloud of adversity which more instantly gave way to sunshine than would then the suspicions which appear now so formidable he spoke with so much earnestness as to make some impression upon sir john de walton who was once more wholly at a loss to know what line his duty called upon him to pursue i would most gladly said the governor follow out my purpose by the gentlest means in my power and i shall bring no further distress upon this poor lad than thine own obstinacy and his shall appear to deserve in the meantime think sir minstrel that my duty has limits and if i slack it for a day it will become thee to exert every effort in thy power to meet my condescension i will give thee leave to address thy son by a line under thy hand and i will await his answer before i proceed farther in this matter which seems to be very mysterious meantime as thou hast a soul to be saved i conjure thee to speak the truth and tell me whether the secrets of which thou seemest to be a too faithful treasurer have regard to the practices of douglas of bruce or of any in their names against this castle of douglas the prisoner thought a moment and then replied i am aware sir knight of the severe charge under which this command is intrusted to your hands and were it in my power to assist you as a faithful minstrel and loyal subject either with hand or tongue i should feel myself called upon so to do but so far am i from being the character your suspicions have apprehended that i should have held it for certain that the bruce and douglas had assembled their followers for the purpose of renouncing their rebellious attempts and taking their departure for the holy land but for the apparition of the forester who i hear bearded you at the hunting which impresses upon me the belief that when so resolute a follower and henchman of the douglas was sitting fearless among you his master and comrades could be at no great distance how far his intentions could be friendly to you i must leave it to yourself to judge only believe me thus far that the rack pulley or pincers would not have compelled me to act the informer or adviser in a quarrel wherein i have little or no share if i had not been desirous of fixing the belief upon you that you are dealing with a true man and one who has your welfare at heart meanwhile permit me to have writing materials or let my own be restored for i possess in some degree the higher arts of my calling nor do i fear but that i can procure for you an explanation of these marvels without much more loss of time god grant it prove so said the governor though i see not well how i can hope for so favourable a termination and i may sustain great harm by trusting too much on the present occasion my duty however requires that in the meantime you be removed into strict confinement he handed to the prisoner as he spoke the writing materials which had been seized upon by the archers on their first entrance and then commanded those satellites to unhand the minstrel i must then said bertram remain subjected to all the severities of a strict captivity but i deprecate no hardship whatever in my own person so i may secure you from acting with a degree of rashness of which you will all your life repent without the means of atoning no more words minstrel said the governor but since i have made my choice perhaps a very dangerous one for myself let us carry this spell into execution which thou sayest is to serve me as mariners say that oil spread upon the raging billows will assuage their fury chapter the ninth beware beware of the black friar he still retains his sway for he is yet the churchs heir by right whoever may be the lay amundeville is lord by day but the monk is lord by night nor wine nor wassel could raise a vassal to question that friars right don juan canto xvii the minstrel made no vain boast of the skill which he possessed in the use of pen and ink in fact no priest of the time could have produced his little scroll more speedily more neatly composed or more fairly written than were the lines addressed to the youth called augustine son of bertram the minstrel i have not folded this letter said he nor tied it with silk for it is not expressed so as to explain the mystery to you nor to speak frankly do i think that it can convey to you any intelligence but it may be satisfactory to show you what the letter does not contain and that it is written from and to a person who both mean kindly towards you and your garrison that said the governor is a deception which is easily practised it tends however to show though not with certainty that you are disposed to act upon good faith and until the contrary appear i shall consider it a point of duty to treat you with as much gentleness as the matter admits of meantime i will myself ride to the abbey of saint bride and in person examine the young prisoner and as you say he has the power so i pray to heaven he may have the will to read this riddle which seems to throw us all into confusion so saying he ordered his horse and while it was getting ready he perused with great composure the minstrels letter its contents ran thus dear augustine sir john de walton the governor of this castle has conceived those suspicions which i pointed out as likely to be the consequence of our coming to this country without an avowed errand i at least am seized and threatened with examination under torture to force me to tell the purpose of our journey but they shall tear the flesh from my bones ere they force me to break the oath which i have taken and the purport of this letter is to apprize you of the danger in which you stand of being placed in similar circumstances unless you are disposed to authorize me to make the discovery to this knight but on this subject you are only to express your own wishes being assured they shall be in every respect attended to by your devoted bertram this letter did not throw the smallest light upon the mystery of the writer the governor read it more than once and turned it repeatedly in his hand as if he had hoped by that mechanical process to draw something from the missive which at a first view the words did not express but as no result of this sort appeared de walton retired to the hall where he informed sir aymer de valence that he was going abroad as far as the abbey of saint bride and that he would be obliged by his taking upon him the duties of governor during his absence sir aymer of course intimated his acquiescence in the charge and the state of disunion in which they stood to each other permitted no further explanation upon the arrival of sir john de walton at the dilapidated shrine the abbot with trembling haste made it his business immediately to attend the commander of the english garrison upon whom for the present their house depended for every indulgence they experienced as well as for the subsistence and protection necessary to them in so perilous a period having interrogated this old man respecting the youth residing in the abbey de walton was informed that he had been indisposed since left there by his father bertram a minstrel it appeared to the abbot that his indisposition might be of that contagious kind which at that period ravaged the english borders and made some incursions into scotland where it afterwards worked a fearful progress after some farther conversation sir john de walton put into the abbots hand the letter to the young person under his roof on delivering which to augustine the reverend father was charged with a message to the english governor so bold that he was afraid to be the bearer of it it signified that the youth could not and would not at that moment receive the english knight but that if he came back on the morrow after mass it was probable he might learn something of what was requested this is not an answer said sir john de walton to be sent by a boy like this to a person in my charge and me thinks father abbot you consult your own safety but slenderly in delivering such an insolent message the abbot trembled under the folds of his large coarse habit and de walton imagining that his discomposure was the consequence of guilty fear called upon him to remember the duties which he owed to england the benefits which he had received from himself and the probable consequence of taking part in a pert boys insolent defiance of the power of the governor of the province the abbot vindicated himself from these charges with the utmost anxiety he pledged his sacred word that the inconsiderate character of the boys message was owing to the waywardness arising from indisposition he reminded the governor that as a christian and an englishman he had duties to observe towards the community of saint bride which had never given the english government the least subject of complaint as he spoke the churchman seemed to gather courage from the immunities of his order he said he could not permit a sick boy who had taken refuge within the sanctuary of the church to be seized or subjected to any species of force unless he was accused of a specific crime capable of being immediately proved the douglasses a headstrong race had in former days uniformly respected the sanctuary of saint bride and it was not to be supposed that the king of england the dutiful and obedient child of the church of rome would act with less veneration for her rights than the followers of a usurper homicide and excommunicated person like robert bruce walton was considerably shaken with this remonstrance he knew that in the circumstances of the times the pope had great power in every controversy in which it was his pleasure to interfere he knew that even in the dispute respecting the supremacy of scotland his holiness had set up a claim to the kingdom which in the temper of the times might perhaps have been deemed superior both to that of robert bruce and that of edward of england and he conceived his monarch would give him little thanks for any fresh embroilment which might take place with the church moreover it was easy to place a watch so as to prevent augustine from escaping during the night and on the following morning he would be still as effectually in the power of the english governor as if he were seized on by open force at the present moment sir john de walton however so far exerted his authority over the abbot that he engaged in consideration of the sanctuary being respected for this space of time that when it expired he would be aiding and assisting with his spiritual authority to surrender the youth should he not allege a sufficient reason to the contrary this arrangement which appeared still to flatter the governor with the prospect of an easy termination of this troublesome dispute induced him to grant the delay which augustine rather demanded than petitioned for at your request father abbot whom i have hitherto found a true man i will indulge this youth with the grace he asks before taking him into custody understanding that he shall not be permitted to leave this place and thou art to be responsible to this effect giving thee as is reasonable power to command our little garrison at hazelside to which i will send a reinforcement on my return to the castle in case it should be necessary to use the strong hand or circumstances impose upon me other measures worthy sir knight replied the abbot i have no idea that the frowardness of this youth will render any course necessary saving that of persuasion and i venture to say that you yourself will in the highest degree approve of the method in which i shall acquit myself of my present trust the abbot went through the duties of hospitality enumerating what simple cheer the cloister of the convent permitted him to offer to the english knight sir john de walton declined the offer of refreshment however took a courteous leave of the churchman and did not spare his horse until the noble animal had brought him again before the castle of douglas sir aymer de valence met him on the drawbridge and reported the state of the garrison to be the same in winch he had left it excepting that intimation had been received that twelve or fifteen men were expected on their way to the town of lanark and being on march from the neighbourhood of ayr would that night take up their quarters at the outpost of hazelside i am glad of it replied the governor i was about to strengthen that detachment this stripling the son of bertram the minstrel or whoever he is has engaged to deliver himself up for examination in the morning as this party of soldiers are followers of your uncle lord pembroke may i request you will ride to meet them and command them to remain at hazelside until you make farther enquiries about this youth who has still to clear up the mystery which hangs about him and reply to a letter which i delivered with my own hand to the abbot of saint bride i have shown too much forbearance in this matter and i trust to your looking to the security of this young man and conveying him hither with all due care and attention as being a prisoner of some importance certainly sir john answered sir aymer your orders shall be obeyed since you have none of greater importance for one who hath the honour to be second only to yourself in this place i crave your mercy sir aymer returned the governor if the commission be in any degree beneath your dignity but it is our misfortune to misunderstand each other when we endeavour to be most intelligible but what am i to do said sir aymer no way disputing your command but only asking for information what am i to do if the abbot of saint bride offers opposition how answered sir john de walton with the reinforcement from my lord of pembroke you will command at least twenty warmen with bow and spear against five or six timid old monks with only gown and hood true said sir aymer but ban and excommunication are sometimes in the present day too hard for the mail coat and i would not willingly be thrown out of the pale of the christian church well then thou very suspicious and scrupulous young man replied de walton know that if this youth does not deliver himself up to thee of his own accord the abbot has promised to put him into thy hands there was no farther answer to be made and de valence though still thinking himself unnecessarily harassed with the charge of a petty commission took the sort of half arms which were always used when the knights stirred beyond the walls of the garrison and proceeded to execute the commands of de walton a horseman or two together with his squire fabian accompanied him the evening closed in with one of those scottish mists which are commonly said to be equal to the showers of happier climates the path became more and more dark the hills more wreathed in vapours and more difficult to traverse and all the little petty inconveniences which rendered travelling through the district slow and uncertain were augmented by the density of the fog which overhung every thing sir aymer therefore occasionally mended his pace and often incurred the fate of one who is overlate delaying himself by his efforts to make greater expedition the knight bethought himself that he would get into a straight road by passing through the almost deserted town of douglas the inhabitants of which had been treated so severely by the english in the course of those fierce troubles that most of them who were capable of bearing arms had left it and withdrawn themselves to different parts of the country this almost deserted place was defended by a rude palisade and a ruder drawbridge which gave entrance into streets so narrow as to admit with difficulty three horses abreast and evincing with what strictness the ancient lords of the village adhered to their prejudice against fortifications and their opinion in favour of keeping the field so quaintly expressed in the wellknown proverb of the family it is better to hear the lark sing than the mouse cheep the streets or rather the lanes were dark but for a shifting gleam of moonlight which as that planet began to rise was now and then visible upon some steep and narrow gable no sound of domestic industry or domestic festivity was heard and no ray of candle or firelight glanced from the windows of the houses the ancient ordinance called the curfew which the conqueror had introduced into england was at this time in full force in such parts of scotland as were thought doubtful and likely to rebel under which description it need not be said the ancient possessions of the douglas were most especially regarded the church whose gothic monuments were of a magnificent character had been as far as possible destroyed by fire but the ruins held together by the weight of the massive stones of which they were composed still sufficiently evinced the greatness of the family at whose cost it had been raised and whose bones from immemorial time had been entombed in its crypts paying little attention to these relics of departed splendour sir aymer de valence advanced with his small detachment and had passed the scattered fragments of the cemetery of the douglasses when to his surprise the noise of his horses feet was seemingly replied to by sounds which rung like those of another knightly steed advancing heavily up the street as if it were to meet him valence was unable to conjecture what might be the cause of these warlike sounds the ring and the clang of armour was distinct and the heavy tramp of a war horse was not to be mistaken by the ear of a warrior the difficulty of keeping soldiers from straying out of quarters by night would have sufficiently accounted for the appearance of a straggling footsoldier but it was more difficult to account for a mounted horseman in full armour and such was the apparition which a peculiarly bright glimpse of moonlight now showed at the bottom of the causewayed hill perhaps the unknown warrior obtained at the same time a glance of aymer de valence and his armed followers at least each of them shouted who goes there the alarm of the times and on the instant the deep answers of st george on the one side and the douglas on the other awakened the still echoes of the small and ruinous street and the silent arches of the dilapidated church astonished at a warcry with which so many recollections were connected the english knight spurred his horse at full gallop down the steep and broken descent leading out at the south or southeast gate of the town and it was the work of an instant to call out ho saint george upon the insolent villain all of you to the gate fabian and cut him off from flight saint george i say for england bows and bills bows and bills at the same time aymer de valence laid in rest his own long lance which he snatched from the squire by whom it was carried but the light was seen and gone in an instant and though de valence concluded that the hostile warrior had hardly room to avoid his career yet he could take no aim for the encounter unless by mere guess and continued to plunge down the dark declivity among shattered stones and other encumbrances without groping out with his lance the object of his pursuit he rode in short at a broken gallop a descent of about fifty or sixty yards without having any reason to suppose that he had met the figure which had appeared to him although the narrowness of the street scarcely admitted his having passed him unless both horse and horseman could have melted at the moment of encounter like an airbubble the riders of his suite meanwhile were struck with a feeling like supernatural terror which a number of singular adventures had caused most of them to attach to the name of douglas and when he reached the gate by which the broken street was terminated there was none close behind him but fabian in whose head no suggestions of a timorous nature could outlive the sound of his dear masters voice here there were a post of english archers who were turning out in considerable alarm when de valence and his page rode in amongst them villains shouted de valence why were you not upon your duty who was it passed through your post even now with the traitorous cry of douglas we know of no such said the captain of the watch that is to say you besotted villains answered the young knight you have been drinking and have slept the men protested the contrary but in a confused manner which was far from overcoming de valences suspicions he called loudly to bring cressets torches and candles and a few remaining inhabitants began to make their unwilling appearance with such various means of giving light as they chanced to possess they heard the story of the young english knight with wonder nor although it was confirmed by all his retinue did they give credit to the recital more than that the englishmen wished somehow or other to pick a quarrel with the people of the palace under the pretence of their having admitted a retainer of their ancient lord by night into the town they protested therefore their innocence of the cause of tumult and endeavoured to seem active in hastening from house to house and corner to corner with their torches in order to discover the invisible cavalier the english suspected them no less of treachery than the scottish imagined the whole matter a pretext for bringing an accusation on the part of the young knight against the citizens the women however who now began to issue from the houses had a key for the solution of the apparition which at that time was believed of efficacy sufficient to solve any mystery the devil they said must have appeared visibly amongst them an explanation which had already occurred to the followers of the young knight for that a living man and horse both as it seemed of a gigantic size could be conjured in the twinkling of an eye and appear in a street secured at one end by the best of the archers and at the other by the horsemen under valence himself was altogether it seemed a thing impossible the inhabitants did not venture to put their thoughts on the subject into language for fear of giving offence and only indicated by a passing word to each other the secret degree of pleasure which they felt in the confusion and embarrassment of the english garrison still however they continued to affect a great deal of interest in the alarm which de valence had received and the anxiety which he expressed to discover the cause at length a female voice spoke above the babel of confused sounds saying where is the southern knight i am sure that i can tell him where he can find the only person who can help him out of his present difficulty and who is that good woman said aymer de valence who was growing every moment more impatient at the loss of time which was flying fast in an investigation which had something vexatious in it and even ridiculous at the same time the sight of an armed partisan of the douglasses in their own native town seemed to bode too serious consequences if it should be suffered to pass without being probed to the bottom come hither to me said the female voice and i will name to you the only person who can explain all matters of this kind that chance in this country on this the knight snatched a torch from some of those who were present and holding it up descried the person who spoke a tall woman who evidently endeavoured to render herself remarkable when he approached her she communicated her intelligence in a grave and sententious tone of voice we had once wise men that could have answered any parables which might have been put to them for explanation in this country side whether you yourselves gentlemen have not had some hand in weeding them out good troth it is not for the like of me to say at any rate good counsel is not so easy come by as it was in this douglas country nor may be is it a safe thing to pretend to the power of giving it good woman said de valence if you will give me an explanation of this mystery i will owe you a kirtle of the best raploch grey it is not i said the old woman that pretend to possess the knowledge which may assist you but i would fain know that the man whom i shall name to you shall be skaithless and harmless upon your knighthood and your honour will you promise to me so much assuredly said de valence such a person shall even have thanks and reward if he is a faithful informer ay and pardon moreover although he may have listened to any dangerous practices or been concerned in any plots oh not he replied the female it is old goodman powheid who has the charge of the muniments meaning probably monuments that is such part of them as you english have left standing i mean the old sexton of the kirk of douglas who can tell more stories of these old folk whom your honour is not very fond of hearing named than would last us from this day to yule does anybody said the knight know whom it is that this old woman means i conjecture replied fabian that she speaks of an old dotard who is i think the general referee concerning the history and antiquities of this old town and of the savage family that lived here perhaps before the flood and who i dare say said the knight knows as much about the matter as she herself does but where is this man a sexton is he he may be acquainted with places of concealment which are often fabricated in gothic buildings and known to those whose business calls them to frequent them come my good old dame bring this man to me or what may be better i will go to him for we have already spent too much time time replied the old woman is time an object with your honour i am sure i can hardly get so much for mine as will hold soul and body together you are not far from the old mans house she led the way accordingly blundering over heaps of rubbish and encountering all the embarrassments of a ruinous street in lighting the way to sir aymer who giving his horse to one of his attendants and desiring fabian to be ready at a call scrambled after as well as the slowness of his guide would permit both were soon involved in the remains of the old church much dilapidated as it had been by wanton damage done to it by the soldiery and so much impeded by rubbish that the knight marvelled how the old woman could find the way she kept talking all the while as she stumbled onward sometimes she called out in a screeching tone powheid lazarus powheid and then muttered ay ay the old man will be busy with some of his duties as he calls them i wonder he fashes wi them in these times but never mind i warrant they will last for his day and for mine and the times lord help us for all that i can see are well enough for those that are to live in them are you sure good woman replied the knight that there is any inhabitant in these ruins for my part i should rather suppose that you are taking me to the charnelhouse of the dead maybe you are right said the old woman with a ghastly laugh carles and carlines agree weel with funeral vaults and charnelhouses and when an auld bedral dwells near the dead he is living ye ken among his customers halloo powheid lazarus powheid there is a gentleman would speak with you and she added with some sort of emphasis an english noble gentleman one of the honourable garrison an old mans step was now heard advancing so slowly that the glimmering light which he held in his hand was visible on the ruined walls of the vault some time before it showed the person who bore it the shadow of the old man was also projected upon the illuminated wall ere his person came in view his dress was in considerable confusion owing to his having been roused from his bed and since artificial light was forbidden by the regulations of the garrison the natives of douglas dale spent in sleep the time that they could not very well get rid of by any other means the sexton was a tall thin man emaciated by years and by privations his body was bent habitually by his occupation of gravedigging and his eye naturally inclined downward to the scene of his labours his hand sustained the cruise or little lamp which he held so as to throw light upon his visitant at the same time it displayed to the young knight the features of the person with whom he was now confronted which though neither handsome nor pleasing were strongly marked sagacious and venerable indicating at the same time a certain air of dignity which age even mere poverty may be found occasionally to bestow as conferring that last melancholy species of independence proper to those whose situation can hardly by any imaginable means be rendered much worse than years and fortune have already made it the habit of a lay brother added somewhat of religious importance to his appearance what would you with me young man said the sexton your youthful features and your gay dress bespeak one who stands in need of my ministry neither for himself nor for others i am indeed replied the knight a living man and therefore need not either shovel or pickaxe for my own behoof i am not as you see attired in mourning and therefore need not your offices in behalf of any friend i would only ask you a few questions what you would have done must needs be done you being at present one of our rulers and as i think a man of authority replied the sexton follow me this way into my poor habitation i have had a better in my day and yet heaven knows it is good enough for me when many men of much greater consequence must perforce content themselves with worse he opened a lowly door which was fitted though irregularly to serve as the entrance of a vaulted apartment where it appeared that the old man held apart from the living world his wretched and solitary dwelling footnote this is a most graphic and accurate description of the present state of the ruin its being occupied by the sexton as a dwellingplace and the whole scene of the old mans interview with de valence may be classed with our illustrious authors most felicitous imaginings note by the rev mr stewart of douglas the floor composed of paving stones laid together with some accuracy and here and there inscribed with letters and hieroglyphics as if they had once upon a time served to distinguish sepulchres was indifferently well swept and a fire at the upper end directed its smoke into a hole which served for a chimney the spade and pickaxe with other tools which the chamberlain of mortality makes use of lay scattered about the apartment and with a rude stool or two and a table where some inexperienced hand had unquestionably supplied the labours of the joiner were nearly the only furniture if we include the old mans bed of straw lying in a corner and discomposed as if he had been just raised from it at the lower end of the apartment the wall was almost entirely covered by a large escutcheon such as is usually hung over the graves of men of very high rank having the appropriate quarters to the number of sixteen each properly blazoned and distinct placed as ornaments around the principal armorial coat itself let us sit said the old man the posture will better enable my failing ears to apprehend your meaning and the asthma will deal with me more mercifully in permitting me to make you understand mine a peal of short asthmatic coughs attested the violence of the disorder which he had last named and the young knight followed his hosts example in sitting down on one of the rickety stools by the side of the fire the old man brought from one corner of the apartment an apron which he occasionally wore full of broken boards in irregular pieces some of which were covered with black cloth or driven full of nails black as it might happen or gilded you will find this fresh fuel necessary said the old man to keep some degree of heat within this waste apartment nor are the vapours of mortality with which this vault is apt to be filled if the fire is permitted to become extinct indifferent to the lungs of the dainty and the healthy like your worship though to me they are become habitual the wood will catch fire although it is some time ere the damps of the grave are overcome by the drier air and the warmth of the chimney accordingly the relics of mortality with which the old man had heaped his fireplace began by degrees to send forth a thick unctuous vapour which at length leaped to light and blazing up the aperture gave a degree of liveliness to the gloomy scene the blazonry of the huge escutcheon met and returned the rays with as brilliant a reflection as that lugubrious object was capable of and the whole apartment looked with a fantastic gaiety strangely mingled with the gloomy ideas which its ornaments were calculated to impress upon the imagination you are astonished said the old man and perhaps sir knight you have never before seen these relics of the dead applied to the purpose of rendering the living in some degree more comfortable than their condition would otherwise admit of comfortable returned the knight of valence shrugging his shoulders i should be sorry old man to know that i had a dog that was as indifferently quartered as thou art whose grey hairs have certainly seen better days it may be answered the sexton and it may be otherwise but it was not i presume concerning my own history that your worship seemed disposed to ask me some questions and i would venture to enquire therefore to whom they have relation i will speak plainly to you replied sir aymer and you will at once acknowledge the necessity of giving a short and distinct reply i have even now met in the streets of this village a person only shown to me by a single flash of light who had the audacity to display the armorial insignia and utter the warcry of the douglasses nay if i could trust a transient glance this daring cavalier had the features and the dark complexion proper to the douglas i am referred to thee as to one who possesses means of explaining this extraordinary circumstance which as an english knight and one holding a charge under king edward i am particularly called upon to make enquiry into let me make a distinction said the old man the douglasses of former generations are my near neighbours and according to my superstitious townsmen my acquaintances and visitors i can take it upon my conscience to be answerable for their good behaviour and to become bound that none of the old barons to whom the roots of that mighty tree may it is said be traced will again disturb with their warcry the towns or villages of their native country not one will parade in moonshine the black armour which has long rusted upon their tombs the knights are dust and their good swords are rust their souls are with the saints we trust footnote the author has somewhat altered part of a beautiful unpublished fragment of coleridge where is the grave of sir arthur orellan where may the grave of that good knight be by the marge of a brook on the slope of helvellyn under the boughs of a young birch tree the oak that in summer was pleasant to hear that rustled in autumn all withered and sear that whistled and groand thro the winter alone he hath gone and a birch in his place is grown the knights bones are dust his good sword is rust his spirit is with the saints we trust edit look around sir knight you have above and around you the men of whom we speak beneath us in a little aisle which hath not been opened since these thin grey locks were thick and brown there lies the first man whom i can name as memorable among those of this mighty line it is he whom the thane of athol pointed out to the king of scotland as sholto dhuglass or the dark ironcoloured man whose exertions had gained the battle for his native prince and who according to this legend bequeathed his name to our dale and town though others say that the race assumed the name of douglass from the stream so called in unrecorded times before they had their fastness on its banks others his descendants called eachain or hector the first and orodh or hugh william the first of that name and gilmour the theme of many a minstrel song commemorating achievements done under the oriflamme of charles the great emperor of france have all consigned themselves to their last sleep nor has their memory been sufficiently preserved from the waste of time something we know concerning their great deeds their great power and alas their great crimes something we also know of a lord of douglas who sat in a parliament at forfar held by king malcolm the first and we are aware that from his attachment to hunting the wild hart he built himself a tower called blackhouse in the forest of ettrick which perhaps still exists i crave your forgiveness old man said the knight but i have no time at present to bestow upon the recitation of the pedigree of the house of douglas a less matter would hold a wellbreathed minstrel in subject for recitation for a calendar month sundays and holidays included what other information can you expect from me said the sexton than that respecting those heroes some of whom it has been my lot to consign to that eternal rest which will for ever divide the dead from the duties of this world i have told you where the race sleep down to the reign of the royal malcolm i can tell you also of another vault in which lie sir john of douglasburn with his son lord archibald and a third william known by an indenture with lord abernethy lastly i can tell you of him to whom that escutcheon with its appurtenances of splendour and dignity justly belong do you envy that nobleman whom if death were in the sound i would not hesitate to term my honourable patron and have you any design of dishonouring his remains it will be a poor victory nor does it become a knight and nobleman to come in person to enjoy such a triumph over the dead against whom when he lived there were few knights dared spur their horses he fought in defence of his country but he had not the good fortune of most of his ancestors to die on the field of battle captivity sickness and regret for the misfortunes of his native land brought his head to the grave in his prisonhouse in the land of the stranger the old mans voice here became interrupted by emotion and the english knight found it difficult to continue his examination in the stern fashion which his duty required old man he said i do not require from thee this detail which must be useless to me as well as painful to thyself thou dost but thy duty in rendering justice to thy ancient lord but thou hast not yet explained to me why i have met in this town this very night and not half an hour since a person in the arms and bearing the complexion of one of the black douglasses who cried his warcry as if in contempt of his conquerors surely replied the sexton it is not my business to explain such a fancy otherwise than by supposing that the natural fears of the southron will raise the spectre of a douglas at any time when he is within sight of their sepulchre methinks in such a night as this the fairest cavalier would wear the complexion of this swarthy race nor can i hold it wonderful that the warcry which was once in the throats of so many thousands in this country should issue upon occasion from the mouth of a single champion you are bold old man returned the english knight do you consider that your life is in my power and that it may in certain cases be my duty to inflict death with that degree of pain at which humanity shudders the old man rose up slowly in the light of the blazing fire displaying his emaciated features which resembled those ascribed by artists to saint anthony of the desert and pointing to the feeble lamp which he placed upon the coarse table thus addressed his interrogator with an appearance of perfect firmness and something even resembling dignity young knight of england you see that utensil constructed for the purpose of dispensing light amid these fatal vaults it is as frail as any thing can well be whose flame is supplied by living element contained in a frame composed of iron it is doubtless in your power entirely to end its service by destroying the frame or extinguishing the light threaten it with such annihilation sir knight and see whether your menace will impress any sense of fear either on the element or the iron know that you have no more power over the frail mortal whom you threaten with similar annihilation you may tear from my body the skin in which it is now swathed but although my nerves might glow with agony during the inhuman operation it would produce no more impression on me than flaying on the stag which an arrow has previously pierced through the heart my age sets me beyond your cruelty if you think otherwise call your agents and commence your operations neither threats nor inflictions will enable you to extort from me any thing that i am not ready to tell you of my own accord you trifle with me old man said de valence you talk as if you possessed some secret respecting the motions of these douglasses who are to you as gods yet you communicate no intelligence to me whatever you may soon know replied the old man all that a poor sexton has to communicate and it will not increase your knowledge respecting the living though it may throw some light upon my proper domains which are those of the dead the spirits of the deceased douglasses do not rest in their graves during the dishonour of their monuments and the downfall of their house that upon death the greater part of any line are consigned to the regions of eternal bliss or of neverending misery religion will not suffer us to believe and amidst a race who had so great a share of worldly triumph and prosperity we must suppose there have existed many who have been justly subjected to the doom of an intermediate space of punishment you have destroyed the temples which were built by their posterity to propitiate heaven for the welfare of their souls you have silenced the prayers and stopt the choirs by the mediation of which the piety of children had sought to appease the wrath of heaven in behalf of their ancestors subjected to expiatory fires can you wonder that the tormented spirits thus deprived of the relief which had been proposed to them should not according to the common phrase rest in their graves can you wonder they should show themselves like discontented loiterers near to the places which but for the manner in which you have prosecuted your remorseless warfare might have ere now afforded them rest or do you marvel that these fleshless warriors should interrupt your marches and do what else their airy nature may permit to disturb your councils and meet as far as they may the hostilities which you make it your boast to carry on as well against those who are deceased as against any who may yet survive your cruelty old man replied aymer de valence you cannot expect that i am to take for answer a story like this being a fiction too gross to charm to sleep a schoolboy tormented with the toothache nevertheless i thank god that thy doom does not remain in my hands my squire and two archers shall carry thee captive to the worshipful sir john de walton governor of the castle and valley that he may deal with thee as seems meet nor is he a person to believe in your apparitions and ghosts from purgatory what ho fabian come hither and bring with thee two archers of the guard fabian accordingly who had waited at the entrance of the ruined building now found his way by the light of the old sextons lamp and the sound of his masters voice into the singular apartment of the old man the strange decorations of which struck the youth with great surprise and some horror take the two archers with thee fabian said the knight of valence and with their assistance convey this old man on horseback or in a litter to the presence of the worshipful sir john de walton tell him what we have seen which thou didst witness as well as i and tell him that this old sexton whom i send to be examined by his superior wisdom seems to know more than he is willing to disclose respecting our ghostly cavalier though he will give us no account of him except intimating that he is a spirit of the old douglasses from purgatory to which sir john de walton will give what faith he pleases you may say that for my part my belief is either that the sexton is crazed by age want and enthusiasm or that he is connected with some plot which the country people are hatching you may also say that i shall not use much ceremony with the youth under the care of the abbot of st bride there is something suspicious in all the occurrences that are now passing around us fabian promised obedience and the knight pulling him aside gave him an additional caution to behave with attention in this business seeing he must recollect that neither the judgment of himself nor that of his master were apparently held in very much esteem by the governor and that it would ill become them to make any mistake in a matter where the safety of the castle was perhaps concerned fear me not worshipful sir replied the youth i am returning to pure air in the first place and a good fire in the second both acceptable exchanges for this dungeon of suffocating vapours and execrable smells you may trust to my making no delay a very short time will carry me back to castle douglas even moving with suitable attention to this old mans bones use him humanely answered the knight and thou old man if thou art insensible to threats of personal danger in this matter remember that if thou art found paltering with us thy punishment will perhaps be more severe than any we can inflict upon thy person can you administer the torture to the soul said the sexton as to thee answered the knight we have that power we will dissolve every monastery or religious establishment held for the souls of these douglasses and will only allow the religious people to hold their residence there upon condition of their praying for the soul of king edward the first of glorious memory the malleus scotorum and if the douglasses are deprived of the ghostly benefit of the prayers and services of such shrines they may term thy obstinacy the cause such a species of vengeance answered the old man in the same bold unsubdued tone which he had hitherto used were more worthy of the infernal fiends than of christian men the squire raised his hand the knight interposed forbear him he said fabian he is very old and perhaps insane and you sexton remember that the vengeance threatened is lawfully directed towards a family which have been the obstinate supporters of the excommunicated rebel who murdered the red comyn at the high church in dumfries so saying aymer strode out of the ruins picking his way with much difficulty took his horse which he found at the entrance repeated a caution to fabian to conduct himself with prudence and passing on to the southwestern gate gave the strongest injunctions concerning the necessity of keeping a vigilant watch both by patrols and by sentinels intimating at the same time that it must have been neglected during the preceding part of the evening the men murmured an apology the confusion of which seemed to express that there had existed some occasion for the reprimand sir aymer then proceeded on his journey to hazelside his train diminished by the absence of fabian and his assistants after a hasty but not a short journey the knight alighted at thomas dicksons where he found the detachment from ayr had arrived before him and were snugly housed for the night he sent one of the archers to announce his approach to the abbot of saint bride and his young guest intimating at the same time that the archer must keep sight of the latter until he himself arrived at the chapel which would be instantly chapter the tenth when the nightengale singes the wodes waxes grene lef and gras and blosme springeth in april i wene and love is to myne herte gone with one speare so kene night and day my blood hyt drynkes mine herte deth me fane mss hail quoted by warton sir aymer de valance had no sooner followed his archer to the convent of saint bride than he summoned the abbot to his presence who came with the air of a man who loves his ease and who is suddenly called from the couch where he has consigned himself to a comfortable repose at the summons of one whom he does not think it safe to disobey and to whom he would not disguise his sense of peevishness if he durst it is a late ride he said which has brought your worthy honour hither from the castle may i be informed of the cause after the arrangement so recently gone into with the governor it is my hope replied the knight that you father abbot are not already conscious of it suspicions are afloat and i myself have this night seen something to confirm them that some of the obstinate rebels of this country are again setting afoot dangerous practices to the peril of the garrison and i come father to see whether in requital of many favours received from the english monarch you will not merit his bounty and protection by contributing to the discovery of the designs of his enemies assuredly so answered father jerome in an agitated voice most unquestionably my information should stand at your command that is if i knew any thing the communication of which could be of advantage to you father abbot replied the english knight although it is rash to make myself responsible for a northcountry man in these times yet i own i do consider you as one who has ever been faithfully subject to the king of england and i willingly hope that you will still continue so and a fine encouragement i have said the abbot to be called out of my bed at midnight in this raw weather to undergo the examination of a knight who is the youngest perhaps of his own honourable rank and who will not tell me the subject of the interrogatories but detains me on this cold pavement till according to the opinion of celsus the podagra which lurks in my feet may be driven into my stomach and then goodnight to abbacy and examinations from henceforward good father said the young man the spirit of the times must teach thee patience recollect that i can feel no pleasure in this duty and that if an insurrection should take place the rebels who are sufficiently displeased with thee for acknowledging the english monarch would hang thee from thine own steeple to feed the crows or that if thou hast secured thy peace by some private compact with the insurgents the english governor who will sooner or later gain the advantage will not fail to treat thee as a rebel to his sovereign it may appear to you my noble son answered the abbot obviously discomposed that i am hung up in this case on the horns of the dilemma which you have stated nevertheless i protest to you that if any one accuses me of conspiring with the rebels against the king of england i am ready provided you give me time to swallow a potion recommended by celsus in my perilous case to answer with the most perfect sincerity every question which you can put to me upon that subject so saying he called upon a monk who had attended at his levee and giving him a large key whispered something in his ear the cup which the monk brought was of such capacity as proved celsuss draught required to be administered in considerable quantity and a strong smell which it spread through the apartment accredited the knights suspicion that the medicine chiefly consisted of what were then termed distilled waters a preparation known in the monasteries for some time before that comfortable secret had reached the laity in general the abbot neither overawed by the strength nor by the quantity of the potion took it off with what he himself would have called a feeling of solace and pleasance and his voice became much more composed he signified himself as comforted extraordinarily by the medicine and willing to proceed to answer any questions which could be put to him by his gallant young friend at present said the knight you are aware father that strangers travelling through this country must be the first objects of our suspicions and enquiries what is for example your own opinion of the youth termed augustine the son or calling himself so of a person called bertram the minstrel who has resided for some days in your convent the abbot heard the question with eyes expressive of surprise at the quarter from which it came assuredly said he i think of him as a youth who from any thing i have seen is of that excellent disposition both with respect to loyalty and religion which i should have expected were i to judge from the estimable person who committed him to my care with this the abbot bowed to the knight as if he had conceived that this repartee gave him a silencing advantage in any question which could follow upon that subject and he was probably therefore surprised when sir aymer replied as follows it is very true father abbot that i myself did recommend this stripling to you as a youth of a harmless disposition and with respect to whom it would be unnecessary to exercise the strict vigilance extended to others in similar circumstances but the evidence which seemed to me to vouch for this young mans innocence has not appeared so satisfactory to my superior and commander and it is by his orders that i now make farther enquiries of you you must think they are of consequence since we again trouble you and at so unwonted an hour i can only protest by my order and by the veil of saint bride replied the abbot the spirit of celsus appearing to fail his pupil that whatever evil may be in this matter is totally unknown to me nor could it be extorted from me by racks or implements of torture whatever signs of disloyalty may have been evinced by this young man i have witnessed none of them although i have been strictly attentive to his behaviour in what respect said the knight and what is the result of your observation my answer said the abbot of saint bride shall be sincere and downright the youth condescended upon payment of a certain number of gold crowns not by any means to repay the hospitality of the church of saint bride but merely nay father interrupted the knight you may cut that short since the governor and i well understand the terms upon which the monks of saint bride exercise their hospitality in what manner it is more necessary to ask was it received by this boy with the utmost gentleness and moderation noble sir answered the abbot indeed it appeared to me at first that he might be a troublesome guest since the amount of his benevolence to the convent was such as to encourage and in some degree to authorise his demanding accommodation of a kind superior to what we had to bestow in which case said sir aymer you would have had the discomfort of returning some part of the money you have received that replied the abbot would have been a mode of settlement contrary to our vows what is paid to the treasury of saint bridget cannot agreeably to our rule be on any account restored but noble knight there was no occasion for this a crust of white bread and a draught of milk were diet sufficient to nourish this poor youth for a day and it was my own anxiety for his health that dictated the furnishing of his cell with a softer bed and coverlet than are quite consistent with the rules of our order now hearken to what i say sir abbot and answer me truly said the knight of valence what communication has this youth held with the inmates of your convent or with those beyond your house search your memory concerning this and let me have a distinct answer for your guests safety and your own depend upon it as i am a christian man said the abbot i have observed nothing which could give ground for your worships suspicions the boy augustine unlike those whom i have observed who have been educated in the world showed a marked preference to the company of such sisters as the house of saint bride contains rather than for that of the monks my brethren although there are among them pleasant and conversible men scandal said the young knight might find a reason for that preference not in the case of the sisters of saint bridget said the abbot most of whom have been either sorely misused by time or their comeliness destroyed by some mishap previously to their being received into the seclusion of the house this observation the good father made with some internal movement of mirth which was apparently excited at the idea of the sisterhood of saint bridget becoming attractive to any one by dint of their personal beauty in which as it happened they were all notably and almost ludicrously deficient the english knight to whom the sisterhood were well known felt also inclined to smile at this conversation i acquit he said the pious sisterhood of charming otherwise than by their kind wishes and attention to the wants of the suffering stranger sister beatrice continued the father resuming his gravity is indeed blessed with a winning gift of making comfits and syllabubs but on minute enquiry i do not find that the youth has tasted any of them neither is sister ursula so hardfavoured by nature as from the effects of an accident but your honour knows that when a woman is ugly the men do not trouble themselves about the cause of her hard favour i will go with your leave and see in what state the youth now is and summon him before you i request you to do so father for the affair is instant and i earnestly advise you to watch in the closest manner this augustines behaviour you cannot be too particular i will wait your return and either carry the boy to the castle or leave him here as circumstances may seem to require the abbot bowed promised his utmost exertions and hobbled out of the room to wait on the youth augustine in his cell anxious to favour if possible the wishes of de valence whom he looked upon as rendered by circumstances his military patron he remained long absent and sir aymer began to be of opinion that the delay was suspicious when the abbot returned with perplexity and discomposure in his countenance i crave your pardon for keeping your worship waiting said jerome with much anxiety but i have myself been detained and vexed by unnecessary formalities and scruples on the part of this peevish boy in the first place hearing my foot approaching his bedroom my youth instead of undoing the door which would have been but proper respect to my place on the contrary draws a strong bolt on the inside and this fastening forsooth has been placed on his chamber by ursulas command that his slumbers might be suitably respected i intimated to him as i best could that he must attend you without delay and prepare to accompany you to the castle of douglas but he would not answer a single word save recommending to me patience to which i was fain to have recourse as well as your archer whom i found standing sentinel before the door of the cell and contenting himself with the assurance of the sisters that there was no other passage by which augustine could make his escape at length the door opens and my young master presents himself fully arrayed for his journey the truth is i think some fresh attack of his malady has affected the youth he may perhaps be disturbed with some touch of hypochondria or black choler a species of dotage of the mind which is sometimes found concomitant with and symptomatic of this disorder but he is at present composed and if your worship chooses to see him he is at your command call him hither said the knight and a considerable space of time again elapsed ere the eloquence of the abbot half chiding and half soothing prevailed on the lady in her adopted character to approach the parlour in which at last she made her appearance with a countenance on which the marks of tears might still be discovered and a pettish sullenness like that of a boy or with reverence that of a girl who is determined upon taking her own way in any matter and equally resolved to give no reason for her doing so her hurried levee had not prevented her attending closely to all the mufflings and disguisings by which her pilgrims dress was arranged so as to alter her appearance and effectually disguise her sex but as civility prevented her wearing her large slouched hat she necessarily exposed her countenance more than in the open air and though the knight beheld a most lovely set of features yet they were not such as were inconsistent with the character she had adopted and which she had resolved upon maintaining to the last she had accordingly mustered up a degree of courage which was not natural to her and which she perhaps supported by hopes which her situation hardly admitted so soon as she found herself in the same apartment with de valence she assumed a style of manners bolder and more determined than she had hitherto displayed your worship she said addressing him even before he spoke is a knight of england and possessed doubtless of the virtues which become that noble station i am an unfortunate lad obliged by reasons which i am under the necessity of keeping secret to travel in a dangerous country where i am suspected without any just cause of becoming accessory to plots and conspiracies which are contrary to my own interest and which my very soul abhors and which i might safely abjure by imprecating upon myself all the curses of our religion and renouncing all its promises if i were accessory to such designs in thought word or deed nevertheless you who will not believe my solemn protestations are about to proceed against me as a guilty person and in so doing i must warn you sir knight that you will commit a great and cruel injustice i shall endeavour to avoid that said the knight by referring the duty to sir john de walton the governor who will decide what is to be done in this case my only duty will be to place you in his hands at douglas castle must you do this said augustine certainly replied the knight or be answerable for neglecting my duty but if i become bound to answer your loss with a large sum of money a large tract of land no treasure no land supposing such at your disposal answered the knight can atone for disgrace and besides boy how should i trust to your warrant were my avarice such as would induce me to listen to such proposals i must then prepare to attend you instantly to the castle of douglas and the presence of sir john de walton replied augustine young man answered de valence there is no remedy since if you delay me longer i must carry you thither by force what will be the consequence to my father said the youth that replied the knight will depend exactly on the nature of your confession and his something you both have to say as is evident from the terms of the letter sir john de walton conveyed to you and i assure you you were better to speak it out at once than to risk the consequences of more delay i can admit of no more trifling and believe me that your fate will be entirely ruled by your own frankness and candour i must prepare then to travel at your command said the youth but this cruel disease still hangs around me and abbot jerome whose leechcraft is famous will himself assure you that i cannot travel without danger of my life and that while i was residing in this convent i declined every opportunity of exercise which was offered me by the kindness of the garrison at hazelside lest i might by mishap bring the contagion among your men the youth says right said the abbot the archers and menatarms have more than once sent to invite this lad to join in some of their military games or to amuse them perhaps with some of his minstrelsy but he has uniformly declined doing so and according to my belief it is the effects of this disorder which have prevented his accepting an indulgence so natural to his age and in so dull a place as the convent of saint bride must needs seem to a youth bred up in the world do you then hold reverend father said sir aymer that there is real danger in carrying this youth to the castle tonight as i proposed i conceive such danger replied the abbot to exist not only as it may occasion the relapse of the poor youth himself but as particularly likely no preparations having been made to introduce the infection among your honourable garrison for it is in these relapses more than in the first violence of the malady that it has been found most contagious then said the knight you must be content my friend to give a share of your room to an archer by way of sentinel i cannot object said augustine provided my unfortunate vicinity does not endanger the health of the poor soldier he will be as ready to do his duty said the abbot without the door of the apartment as within it and if the youth should sleep soundly which the presence of a guard in his chamber might prevent he is the more likely to answer your purpose on the morrow let it be so said sir aymer so you are sure that you do not minister any facility of escape the apartment said the monk hath no other entrance than that which is guarded by the archer but to content you i shall secure the door in your presence so be it then said the knight of valence this done i myself will lie down without doffing my mailshirt and snatch a sleep till the ruddy dawn calls me again to duty when you augustine will hold yourself ready to attend me to our castle of douglas the bells of the convent summoned the inhabitants and inmates of saint bride to morning prayers at the first peep of day when this duty was over the knight demanded his prisoner the abbot marshalled him to the door of augustines chamber the sentinel who was stationed there armed with a brownbill or species of partisan reported that he had heard no motion in the apartment during the whole night the abbot tapped at the door but received no answer he knocked again louder but the silence was unbroken from within what means this said the reverend ruler of the convent of saint bride my young patient has certainly fallen into a syncope or swoon i wish father abbot said the knight that he may not have made his escape instead an accident which both you and i may be required to answer since according to our strict duty we ought to have kept sight of him and detained him in close custody until daybreak i trust your worship said the abbot only anticipates a misfortune which i cannot think possible we shall speedily see said the knight and raising his voice he called aloud so as to be heard within bring crowbars and levers and burst me that door into splinters without an instants delay the loudness of his voice and the stern tone in which he spoke soon brought around him the brethren of the house and two or three soldiers of his own party who were already busy in caparisoning their horses the displeasure of the young knight was manifested by his flushed features and the abrupt manner in which he again repeated his commands for breaking open the door this was speedily performed though it required the application of considerable strength and as the shattered remains fell crashing into the apartment de valence sprung and the abbot hobbled into the cell of the prisoner which to the fulfilment of their worst suspicions they found empty chapter the eleventh where is he has the deep earth swallowd him or hath he melted like some airy phantom that shuns the approach of morn and the young sun or hath he wrapt him in cimmerian darkness and passd beyond the circuit of the sight with things of the nights shadows anonymous the disappearance of the youth whose disguise and whose fate have we hope inclined our readers to take some interest in him will require some explanation ere we proceed with the other personages of the story and we shall set about giving it accordingly when augustine was consigned to his cell for the second time on the preceding evening both the monk and the young knight of valence had seen the key turned upon him and had heard him secure the door in the inside with the bolt which had been put on at his request by sister ursula in whose affections the youth of augustine his extreme handsomeness and above all his indisposition of body and his melancholy of mind had gained him considerable interest so soon accordingly as augustine reentered his apartment he was greeted in a whisper by the sister who during the interval of his absence had contrived to slip into the cell and having tappiced herself behind the little bed came out with great appearance of joy to greet the return of the youth the number of little attentions the disposal of holly boughs and such other evergreens as the season permitted showed the anxiety of the holy sisters to decorate the chamber of their guest and the greetings of sister ursula expressed the same friendly interest at the same time intimating that she was already in some degree in possession of the strangers mystery as augustine and the holy sister were busied in exchange of confidence the extraordinary difference between their countenances and their persons must have struck any one who might have been accidentally a witness of their interview the dark pilgrims robe of the disguised female was not a stronger contrast to the white woollen garment worn by the votaress of saint bride than the visage of the nun seamed with many a ghastly scar and the light of one of her eyes extinguished for ever causing it to roll a sightless luminary in her head was to the beautiful countenance of augustine now bent with a confidential and even affectionate look upon the extraordinary features of her companion you know said the supposed augustine the principal part of my story can you or will you lend me your assistance if not my dearest sister you must consent to witness my death rather than my shame yes sister ursula i will not be pointed at by the finger of scorn as the thoughtless maiden who sacrificed so much for a young man of whose attachment she was not so well assured as she ought to have been i will not be dragged before de walton for the purpose of being compelled by threats of torture to declare myself the female in honour of whom he holds the dangerous castle no doubt he might be glad to give his hand in wedlock to a damsel whose dowry is so ample but who can tell whether he will regard me with that respect which every woman would wish to command or pardon that boldness of which i have been guilty even though its consequences have been in his own favour nay my darling daughter answered the nun comfort yourself for in all i can aid you be assured i will my means are somewhat more than my present situation may express and be assured they shall be tried to the uttermost methinks i still hear that lay which you sung to the other sisters and myself although i alone touched by feelings kindred to yours had the address to comprehend that it told your own tale i am yet surprised said augustine speaking beneath her breath how i had the boldness to sing in your ears the lay which in fact was the history of my disgrace alas that you will say so returned the nun there was not a word but what resembled those tales of love and of highspirited daring which the best minstrels love to celebrate and the noblest knights and maidens weep at once and smile to hear the lady augusta of berkely a great heiress according to the world both in land and movable goods becomes the kings ward by the death of her parents and thus is on the point of being given away in marriage to a minion of the king of england whom in these scottish valleys we scruple not to call a peremptory tyrant i must not say so my sister said the pilgrim and yet true it is that the cousin of the obscure parasite gaviston on whom the king wished to confer my poor hand was neither by birth merit nor circumstance worthy of such an alliance meantime i heard of the fame of sir john de walton and i heard of it not with the less interest that his feats of chivalry were said to adorn a knight who rich in everything else was poor in worldly goods and in the smiles of fortune i saw this sir john de walton and i acknowledge that a thought which had already intruded itself on my imagination became after this interview by frequent recurrence more familiar and more welcome to me methought that the daughter of a powerful english family if she could give away with her hand such wealth as the world spoke of would more justly and honourably bestow it in remedying the errors of fortune in regard to a gallant knight like de walton than in patching the revenues of a beggarly frenchman whose only merit was in being the kinsman of a man who was very generally detested by the whole kingdom of england excepting the infatuated monarch himself nobly designed my daughter said the nun what more worthy of a noble heart possessing riches beauty birth and rank than to confer them all upon indigent and chivalrous merit such dearest sister was my intention replied augustine but i have perhaps scarce sufficiently explained the manner in which i meant to proceed by the advice of a minstrel of our house the same who is now prisoner at douglas i caused exhibit a large feast upon christmas eve and sent invitations abroad to the young knights of noble name who were known to spend their leisure in quest of arms and adventures when the tables were drawn and the feast concluded bertram as had been before devised was called upon to take his harp he sung receiving from all who were present the attention due to a minstrel of so much fame the theme which he chose was the frequent capture of this douglas castle or as the poet termed it castle dangerous where are the champions of the renowned edward the first said the minstrel when the realm of england cannot furnish a man brave enough or sufficiently expert in the wars to defend a miserable hamlet of the north against the scottish rebels who have vowed to retake it over our soldiers heads ere the year rolls to an end where are the noble ladies whose smiles used to give countenance to the knights of saint georges cross alas the spirit of love and of chivalry is alike dead amongst us our knights are limited to petty enterprises and our noblest heiresses are given as prizes to strangers as if their own country had no one to deserve them here stopt the harp and i shame to say that i myself as if moved to enthusiasm by the song of the minstrel arose and taking from my neck the chain of gold which supported a crucifix of special sanctity i made my vow always under the kings permission that i would give my hand and the inheritance of my fathers to the good knight being of noble birth and lineage who should keep the castle of douglas in the king of englands name for a year and a day i sat down my dearest sister deafened with the jubilee in which my guests expressed their applause of my supposed patriotism yet some degree of pause took place amidst the young knights who might reasonably have been supposed ready to embrace this offer although at the risk of being encumbered with augusta of berkely shame on the man said sister ursula who should think so put your beauty alone my dearest into consideration and a true knight ought to have embraced the dangers of twenty castles of douglas rather than let such an invaluable opportunity of gaining your favour be lost it may be that some in reality thought so said the pilgrim but it was supposed that the kings favour might be lost by those who seemed too anxious to thwart his royal purpose upon his wards hand at any rate greatly to my joy the only person who availed himself of the offer i had made was sir john de walton and as his acceptance of it was guarded by a clause saving and reserving the kings approbation i hope he has not suffered any diminution of edwards favour assure yourself noble and highspirited young lady replied the nun that there is no fear of thy generous devotion hurting thy lover with the king of england something we hear concerning worldly passages even in this remote nook of saint brides cloister and the report goes among the english soldiers that their king was indeed offended at your putting your will in opposition to his own yet on the other hand this preferred lover sir john de walton was a man of such extensive fame and your offer was so much in the character of better but not forgotten times that even a king could not at the beginning of a long and stubborn war deprive an errant cavalier of his bride if she should be duly won by his sword and lance ah dearest sister ursula sighed the disguised pilgrim but on the other hand how much time must pass by in the siege by defeating which that suit must needs be advanced while i sat in my lonely castle tidings came to astound me with the numerous or rather the constant dangers with which my lover was surrounded until at length in a moment i think of madness i resolved to set out in this masculine disguise and having myself with my own eyes seen in what situation i had placed my knight i determined to take such measures in respect to shortening the term of his trial or otherwise as a sight of douglas castle and why should i deny it of sir john de walton might suggest perhaps you my dearest sister may not so well understand my being tempted into flinching from the resolution which i had laid down for my own honour and that of my lover but consider that my resolution was the consequence of a moment of excitation and that the course which i adopted was the conclusion of a long wasting sickening state of uncertainty the effect of which was to weaken the nerves which were once highly strung with love of my country as i thought but in reality alas with fond and anxious feelings of a more selfish description alas said sister ursula evincing the strongest symptoms of interest and compassion am i the person dearest child whom you suspect of insensibility to the distresses which are the fruit of true love do you suppose that the air which is breathed within these walls has the property upon the female heart of such marvellous fountains as they say change into stone the substances which are immersed into their waters hear my tale and judge if it can be thus with one who possesses my causes of grief and do not fear for loss of time we must let our neighbours at hazelside be settled for the evening ere i furnish you with the means of escape and you must have a trusty guide for whose fidelity i will be responsible to direct your path through these woods and protect you in case of any danger too likely to occur in these troublesome times it will thus be nigh an hour ere you depart and sure i am that in no manner can you spend the time better than in listening to distresses too similar to your own and flowing from the source of disappointed affection which you must needs sympathize with the distresses of the lady augusta did not prevent her being in some degree affected almost ludicrously with the singular contrast between the hideous countenance of this victim of the tender passion and the cause to which she imputed her sorrows but it was not a moment for giving way to a sense of the ridiculous which would have been in the highest degree offensive to the sister of saint bride whose goodwill she had so many reasons to conciliate she readily therefore succeeded in preparing herself to listen to the votary with an appearance of sympathy which might reward that which she had herself experienced at the hands of sister ursula while the unfortunate recluse with an agitation which made her ugliness still more conspicuous narrated nearly in a whisper the following circumstances my misfortunes commenced long before i was called sister ursula or secluded as a votaress within these walls my father was a noble norman who like many of his countrymen sought and found fortune at the court of the king of scotland he was endowed with the sheriffdom of this county and maurice de hattely or hautlieu was numbered among the wealthy and powerful barons of scotland wherefore should i deny it that the daughter of this baron then called margaret de hautlieu was also distinguished among the great and fair of the land it can be no censurable vanity which provokes me to speak the truth and unless i tell it myself you could hardly suspect what a resemblance i once bore even to the lovely lady augusta of berkely about this time broke out those unfortunate feuds of bruce and baliol which have been so long the curse of this country my father determined in his choice of party by the arguments of his wealthy kinsmen at the court of edward embraced with passion the faction of the english interest and became one of the keenest partisans at first of john baliol and afterwards of the english monarch none among the anglocisedscottish as his party was called were so zealous as he for the red cross and no one was more detested by his countrymen who followed the national standard of saint andrew and the patriot wallace among those soldiers of the soil malcolm fleming of biggar was one of the most distinguished by his noble birth his high acquirements and his fame in chivalry i saw him and the ghastly spectre who now addresses you must not be ashamed to say that she loved and was beloved by one of the handsomest youths in scotland our attachment was discovered to my father almost ere we had owned it to each other and he was furious both against my lover and myself he placed me under the charge of a religious woman of this rule and i was immured within the house of saint bride where my father shamed not to announce he would cause me to take the veil by force unless i agreed to wed a youth bred at the english court his nephew and as heaven had granted him no son the heir as he had resolved of the house of hautlieu i was not long in making my election i protested that death should be my choice rather than any other husband excepting malcolm fleming neither was my lover less faithful he found means to communicate to me a particular night on which he proposed to attempt to storm the nunnery of saint bride and carry me from hence to freedom and the greenwood of which wallace was generally called the king in an evil hour an hour i think of infatuation and witchery i suffered the abbess to wheedle the secret out of me which i might have been sensible would appear more horribly flagitious to her than to any other woman that breathed but i had not taken the vows and i thought wallace and fleming had the same charms for every body as for me and the artful woman gave me reason to believe that her loyalty to bruce was without a flaw of suspicion and she took part in a plot of which my freedom was the object the abbess engaged to have the english guards removed to a distance and in appearance the troops were withdrawn accordingly in the middle of the night appointed the window of my cell which was two stories from the ground was opened without noise and never were my eyes more gladdened than as ready disguised and arrayed for flight even in a horsemans dress like yourself fairest lady augusta i saw malcolm fleming spring into the apartment he rushed towards me but at the same time my father with ten of his strongest men filled the room and cried their warcry of baliol blows were instantly dealt on every side a form like a giant however appeared in the midst of the tumult and distinguished himself even to my halfgiddy eye by the ease with which he bore down and dispersed those who fought against our freedom my father alone offered an opposition which threatened to prove fatal to him for wallace it was said could foil any two martial champions that ever drew sword brushing from him the armed men as a lady would drive away with her fan a swarm of troublesome flies he secured me in one arm used his other for our mutual protection and i found myself in the act of being borne in safety down the ladder by which my deliverers had ascended from without but an evil fate awaited this attempt my father whom the champion of scotland had spared for my sake or rather for flemings gained by his victors compassion and lenity a fearful advantage and made a remorseless use of it having only his left hand to oppose to the maniac attempts of my father even the strength of wallace could not prevent the assailant with all the energy of desperation from throwing down the ladder on which his daughter was perched like a dove in the grasp of an eagle the champion saw our danger and exerting his inimitable strength and agility cleared himself and me from the ladder and leaped free of the moat of the convent into which we must otherwise have been precipitated the champion of scotland was saved in the desperate attempt but i who fell among a heap of stones and rubbish i the disobedient daughter wellnigh the apostate vestal waked only from a long bed of sickness to find myself the disfigured wretch which you now see me i then learned that malcolm had escaped from the fray and shortly after i heard with feelings less keen perhaps than they ought to have been that my father was slain in one of the endless battles which took place between the contending factions if he had lived i might have submitted to the completion of my fate but since he was no more i felt that it would be a preferable lot to be a beggar in the streets of a scottish village than an abbess in this miserable house of saint bride nor was even that poor object of ambition on which my father used to expatiate when desirous of persuading me to enter the monastic state by milder means than throwing me off the battlements long open to me the old abbess died of a cold caught the evening of the fray and the place which might have been kept open until i was capable of filling it was disposed of otherwise when the english thought fit to reform as they termed it the discipline of the house and instead of electing a new abbess sent hither two or three friendly monks who have now the absolute government of the community and wield it entirely according to the pleasure of the english but i for one who have had the honour to be supported by the arms of the champion of my country will not remain here to be commanded by this abbot jerome i will go forth nor do i fear to find relations and friends who will provide a more fitting place of refuge for margaret de hautlieu than the convent of saint bride you too dearest lady shall obtain your freedom and it will be well to leave such information as will make sir john de walton aware of the devotion with which his happy fate has inspired you it is not then your own intention said the lady augusta to return into the world again and you are about to renounce the lover in a union with whom you and he once saw your joint happiness it is a question my dearest child said sister ursula which i dare not ask myself and to which i am absolutely uncertain what answer i should return i have not taken the final and irrevocable vows i have done nothing to alter my situation with regard to malcolm fleming he also by the vows plighted in the chancery of heaven is my affianced bridegroom nor am i conscious that i less deserve his faith in any respect now than at the moment when it was pledged to me but i confess dearest lady that rumours have reached me which sting me to the quick the reports of my wounds and scars are said to have estranged the knight of my choice i am now indeed poor she added with a sigh and i am no longer possessed of those personal charms which they say attract the love and fix the fidelity of the other sex i teach myself therefore to think in my moments of settled resolution that all betwixt me and malcolm fleming is at an end saving good wishes on the part of both towards the other and yet there is a sensation in my bosom which whispers in spite of my reason that if i absolutely believed that which i now say there would be no object on earth worthy my living for in order to attain it this insinuating prepossession whispers to my secret soul and in very opposition to my reason and understanding that malcolm fleming who could pledge his all upon the service of his country is incapable of nourishing the versatile affection of an ordinary a coarse or a venal character methinks were the difference upon his part instead of mine he would not lose his interest in my eyes because he was seamed with honourable scars obtained in asserting the freedom of his choice but that such wounds would in my opinion add to his merit whatever they took away from his personal comeliness ideas rise on my soul as if malcolm and margaret might yet be to each other all that their affections once anticipated with so much security and that a change which took nothing from the honour and virtue of the beloved person must rather add to than diminish the charms of the union look at me dearest lady augusta look me if you have courage full in the face and tell me whether i do not rave when my fancy is thus converting mere possibilities into that which is natural and probable the lady of berkely conscious of the necessity raised her eyes on the unfortunate nun afraid of losing her own chance of deliverance by the mode in which she should conduct herself in this crisis yet not willing at the same time to flatter the unfortunate ursula with suggesting ideas for which her own sense told her she could hardly find any rational grounds but her imagination stored with the minstrelsy of the time brought back to her recollection the loathly lady in the marriage of sir gawain and she conducted her reply in the following manner you ask me my dear lady margaret a trying question which it would be unfriendly to answer otherwise than sincerely and most cruel to answer with too much rashness it is true that what is called beauty is the first quality on which we of the weaker sex learn to set a value we are flattered by the imputation of personal charms whether we actually possess them or not and no doubt we learn to place upon them a great deal more consequence than in reality is found to belong to them women however even such as are held by their own sex and perhaps in secret by themselves as devoid of all pretensions to beauty have been known to become from their understanding their talents or their accomplishments the undoubted objects of the warmest attachment wherefore then should you in the mere rashness of your apprehension deem it impossible that your malcolm fleming should be made of that porcelain clay of the earth which despises the passing captivations of outward form in comparison to the charms of true affection and the excellence of talents and virtue the nun pressed her companions hand to her bosom and answered her with a deep sigh i fear she said you flatter me and yet in a crisis like this it does one good to be flattered even as cordials otherwise dangerous to the constitution are wisely given to support a patient through a paroxysm of agony and enable him to endure at least what they cannot cure answer only one question and it will be time to drop this conversation could you sweet lady you upon whom fortune has bestowed so many charms could any argument make you patient under the irretrievable loss of your personal advantages with the concomitant loss as in my case is most probable of that lover for whom you have already done so much the english lady cast her eyes again on her friend and could not help shuddering a little at the thought of her own beautiful countenance being exchanged for the seamed and scarred features of the lady of hautlieu irregularly lighted by the beams of a single eye believe me she said looking solemnly upwards that even in the case which you suppose i would not sorrow so much for myself as i would for the poorspirited thoughts of the lover who could leave me because those transitory charms which must in any case erelong take their departure had fled ere yet the bridal day it is however concealed by the decrees of providence in what manner or to what extent other persons with whose disposition we are not fully acquainted may be affected by such changes i can only assure you that my hopes go with yours and that there is no difficulty which shall remain in your path in future if it is in my power to remove it hark it is the signal of our freedom replied ursula giving attention to something resembling the whoop of the nightowl we must prepare to leave the convent in a few minutes have you anything to take with you nothing answered the lady of berkely except the few valuables which i scarce know why i brought with me on my flight hither this scroll which i shall leave behind gives my faithful minstrel permission to save himself by confessing to sir john de walton who the person really is whom he has had within his reach it is strange said the novice of saint bride through what extraordinary labyrinths this love this willofthewisp guides his votaries take heed as you descend this trapdoor carefully concealed curiously jointed and oiled leads to a secret postern where i conceive the horses already wait which will enable us speedily to bid adieu to saint brides heavens blessing on her and on her convent we can have no advantage from any light until we are in the open air during this time sister ursula to give her for the last time her conventual name exchanged her stole or loose upper garment for the more succinct cloak and hood of a horseman she led the way through divers passages studiously complicated until the lady of berkely with throbbing heart stood in the pale and doubtful moonlight which was shining with grey uncertainty upon the walls of the ancient building the imitation of an owlets cry directed them to a neighbouring large elm and on approaching it they were aware of three horses held by one concerning whom they could only see that he was tall strong and accoutred in the dress of a manatarms the sooner he said we are gone from this place lady margaret it is so much the better you have only to direct the course which we shall hold lady margarets answer was given beneath her breath and replied to with a caution from the guide to ride slowly and silently for the first quarter of an hour by which time inhabited places would be left at a distance chapter the twelfth great was the astonishment of the young knight of valence and the reverend father jerome when upon breaking into the cell they discovered the youthful pilgrims absence and from the garments which were left saw every reason to think that the oneeyed novice sister ursula had accompanied him in his escape from custody a thousand thoughts thronged upon sir aymer how shamefully he had suffered himself to be outwitted by the artifices of a boy and of a novice his reverend companion in error felt no less contrition for having recommended to the knight a mild exercise of his authority father jerome had obtained his preferment as abbot upon the faith of his zeal for the cause of the english monarch with the affected interest in which he was at a loss to reconcile his proceedings of the last night a hurried enquiry took place from which little could be learned save that the young pilgrim had most certainly gone off with the lady margaret de hautlieu an incident at which the females of the convent expressed surprise mingled with a great deal of horror while that of the males whom the news soon reached was qualified with a degree of wonder which seemed to be founded upon the very different personal appearance of the two fugitives sacred virgin said a nun who could have conceived the hopeful votaress sister ursula so lately drowned in tears for her fathers untimely fate capable of eloping with a boy scarce fourteen years old and holy saint bride said the abbot jerome what could have made so handsome a young man lend his arm to assist such a nightmare as sister ursula in the commission of so great an enormity certainly he can neither plead temptation nor seduction but must have gone as the worldly phrase is to the devil with a dishclout i must disperse the soldiers to pursue the fugitives said de valence unless this letter which the pilgrim must have left behind him shall contain some explanations respecting our mysterious prisoner after viewing the contents with some surprise he read aloud the undersigned late residing in the house of saint bride do you father jerome the abbot of said house to know that finding you were disposed to treat me as a prisoner and a spy in the sanctuary to which you had received me as a distressed person i have resolved to use my natural liberty with which you have no right to interfere and therefore have withdrawn myself from your abbacy moreover finding that the novice called in your convent sister ursula who hath by monastic rule and discipline a fair title to return to the world unless she is pleased after a years novitiate to profess herself sister of your order is determined to use such privilege i joyfully take the opportunity of her company in this her lawful resolution as being what is in conformity to the law of god and the precepts of saint bride which gave you no authority to detain any person in your convent by force who hath not taken upon her irrevocably the vows of the order to you sir john de walton and sir aymer de valence knights of england commanding the garrison of douglas dale i have only to say that you have acted and are acting against me under a mystery the solution of which is comprehended in a secret known only to my faithful minstrel bertram of the many lays as whose son i have found it convenient to pass myself but as i cannot at this time prevail upon myself personally to discover a secret which cannot well be unfolded without feelings of shame i not only give permission to the said bertram the minstrel but i charge and command him that he tell to you the purpose with which i came originally to the castle of douglas when this is discovered it will only remain to express my feelings towards the two knights in return for the pain and agony of mind which their violence and threats of further severities have occasioned me and first respecting sir aymer de valence i freely and willingly forgive him for having been involved in a mistake to which i myself led the way and i shall at all times be happy to meet with him as an acquaintance and never to think farther of his part in these few days history saving as matter of mirth and ridicule but respecting sir john de walton i must request of him to consider whether his conduct towards me standing as we at present do towards each other is such as he himself ought to forget or i ought to forgive and i trust he will understand me when i tell him that all former connexions must henceforth be at an end between him and the supposed augustine this is madness said the abbot when he had read the letter very midsummer madness not unfrequently an accompaniment of this pestilential disease and i should do well in requiring of those soldiers who shall first apprehend this youth augustine that they reduce his victuals immediately to water and bread taking care that the diet do not exceed in measure what is necessary to sustain nature nay i should be warranted by the learned did i recommend a sufficient intermixture of flagellation with belts stirrupleathers or surcingles and failing those with ridingwhips switches and the like hush my reverend father said de valence a light begins to break in upon me john de walton if my suspicions be true would sooner expose his own flesh to be hewn from his bones than have this augustines finger stung by a gnat instead of treating this youth as a madman i for my own part will be contented to avow that i myself have been bewitched and fascinated and by my honour if i send out my attendants in quest of the fugitives it shall be with the strict charge that when apprehended they treat them with all respect and protect them if they object to return to this house to any honourable place of refuge which they may desire i hope said the abbot looking strangely confused i shall be first heard in behalf of the church concerning this affair of an abducted nun you see yourself sir knight that this scapegrace of a minstrel avouches neither repentance nor contrition at his share in a matter so flagitious you shall be secured an opportunity of being fully heard replied the knight if you shall find at last that you really desire one meantime i must back without a moments delay to inform sir john de walton of the turn which affairs have taken farewell reverend father by my honour we may wish each other joy that we have escaped from a troublesome charge which brought as much terror with it as the phantoms of a fearful dream and is yet found capable of being dispelled by a cure as simple as that of awakening the sleeper but by saint bride both churchmen and laymen are bound to sympathise with the unfortunate sir john de walton i tell thee father that if this letter touching the missive with his finger is to be construed literally as far as respects him he is the man most to be pitied betwixt the brink of solway and the place where we now stand suspend thy curiosity most worthy churchman lest there should be more in this matter than i myself see so that while thinking that i have lighted on the true explanation i may not have to acknowledge that i have been again leading you into error sound to horse there ho he called out from the window of the apartment and let the party i brought hither prepare to scour the woods on their return by my faith said father jerome i am right glad that this young nutcracker is going to leave me to my own meditation i hate when a young person pretends to understand whatever passes while his betters are obliged to confess that it is all a mystery to them such an assumption is like that of the conceited fool sister ursula who pretended to read with a single eye a manuscript which i myself could not find intelligible with the assistance of my spectacles this might not have quite pleased the young knight nor was it one of those truths which the abbot would have chosen to deliver in his hearing but the knight had shaken him by the hand said adieu and was already at hazelside issuing particular orders to little troops of the archers and others and occasionally chiding thomas dickson who with a degree of curiosity which the english knight was not very willing to excuse had been endeavouring to get some account of the occurrences of the night peace fellow he said and mind thine own business being well assured that the hour will come in which it will require all the attention thou canst give leaving others to take care of their own affairs if i am suspected of any thing answered dickson in a tone rather dogged and surly than otherwise methinks it were but fair to let me know what accusation is brought against me i need not tell you that chivalry prescribes that a knight should not attack an enemy undefied when you are a knight answered sir aymer de valence it will be time enough for me to reckon with you upon the points of form due to you by the laws of chivalry meanwhile you had best let me know what share you have had in playing off the martial phantom which sounded the rebellious slogan of douglas in the town of that name i know nothing of what you speak answered the goodman of hazelside see then said the knight that you do not engage yourself in the affairs of other people even if your conscience warrants that you are in no danger from your own so saying he rode off not waiting any answer the ideas which filled his head were to the following purpose i know not how it is but one mist seems no sooner to clear away than we find ourselves engaged in another i take it for granted that the disguised damsel is no other than the goddess of waltons private idolatry who has cost him and me so much trouble and some certain degree of misunderstanding during these last weeks by my honour this fair lady is right lavish in the pardon which she has so frankly bestowed upon me and if she is willing to be less complaisant to sir john de walton why then and what then it surely does not infer that she would receive me into that place in her affections from which she has just expelled de walton nor if she did could i avail myself of a change in favour of myself at the expense of my friend and companion in arms it were a folly even to dream of a thing so improbable but with respect to the other business it is worth serious consideration yon sexton seems to have kept company with dead bodies until he is unfit for the society of the living and as to that dickson of hazelside as they call him there is no attempt against the english during these endless wars in which that man has not been concerned had my life depended upon it i could not have prevented myself from intimating my suspicions of him let him take it as he lists so saying the knight spurred his horse and arriving at douglas castle without farther adventure demanded in a tone of greater cordiality than he had of late used whether he could be admitted to sir john de walton having something of consequence to report to him he was immediately ushered into an apartment in which the governor was seated at his solitary breakfast considering the terms upon which they had lately stood the governor of douglas dale was somewhat surprised at the easy familiarity with which de valence now approached him some uncommon news said sir john rather gravely have brought me the honour of sir aymer de valences company it is answered sir aymer what seems of high importance to your interest sir john de walton and therefore i were to blame if i lost a moment in communicating it i shall be proud to profit by your intelligence said sir john de walton and i too said the young knight am both to lose the credit of having penetrated a mystery which blinded sir john de walton at the same time i do not wish to be thought capable of jesting with you which might be the case were i from misapprehension to give a false key to this matter with your permission then we will proceed thus we go together to the place of bertram the minstrels confinement i have in my possession a scroll from the young person who was intrusted to the care of the abbot jerome it is written in a delicate female hand and gives authority to the minstrel to declare the purpose which brought them to this vale of douglas it must be as you say said sir john de walton although can scarce see occasion for adding so much form to a mystery which can be expressed in such small compass accordingly the two knights the warder leading the way proceeded to the dungeon to which the minstrel had been removed chapter the thirteenth the doors of the stronghold being undone displayed a dungeon such as in those days held victims hopeless of escape but in which the ingenious knave of modern times would scarcely have deigned to remain many hours the huge rings by which the fetters were soldered together and attached to the human body were when examined minutely found to be clenched together by riveting so very thin that when rubbed with corrosive acid or patiently ground with a bit of sandstone the hold of the fetters upon each other might easily be forced asunder and the purpose of them entirely frustrated the locks also large and apparently very strong were so coarsely made that an artist of small ingenuity could easily contrive to get the better of their fastenings upon the same principle the daylight found its way to the subterranean dungeon only at noon and through a passage which was purposely made tortuous so as to exclude the rays of the sun while it presented no obstacle to wind or rain the doctrine that a prisoner was to be esteemed innocent until he should be found guilty by his peers was not understood in those days of brute force and he was only accommodated with a lamp or other alleviation of his misery if his demeanour was quiet and he appeared disposed to give his jailor no trouble by attempting to make his escape such a cell of confinement was that of bertram whose moderation of temper and patience had nevertheless procured for him such mitigations of his fate as the warder could grant he was permitted to carry into his cell the old book in the perusal of which he found an amusement of his solitude together with writing materials and such other helps towards spending his time as were consistent with his abode in the bosom of the rock and the degree of information with which his minstrel craft had possessed him he raised his head from the table as the knights entered while the governor observed to the young knight as you seem to think yourself possessed of the secret of this prisoner i leave it to you sir aymer de valence to bring it to light in the manner which you shall judge most expedient if the man or his son have suffered unnecessary hardship it shall be my duty to make amends which i suppose can be no very important matter bertram looked up and fixed his eyes full upon the governor but read nothing in his looks which indicated his being better acquainted than before with the secret of his imprisonment yet upon turning his eye towards sir aymer his countenance evidently lighted up and the glance which passed between them was one of intelligence you have my secret then said he and you know who it is that passes under the name of augustine sir aymer exchanged with him a look of acquiescence while the eyes of the governor glancing wildly from the prisoner to the knight of valence exclaimed sir aymer de valence as you are belted knight and christian man as you have honour to preserve on earth and a soul to rescue after death i charge you to tell me the meaning of this mystery it may be that you conceive with truth that you have subject of complaint against me if so i will satisfy you as a knight may the minstrel spoke at the same moment i charge this knight he said by his vow of chivalry that he do not divulge any secret belonging to a person of honour and of character unless he has positive assurance that it is done entirely by that persons own consent let this note remove your scruples said sir aymer putting the scroll into the hands of the minstrel and for you sir john de walton far from retaining the least feeling of any misunderstanding which may have existed between us i am disposed entirely to bury it in forgetfulness as having arisen out of a series of mistakes which no mortal could have comprehended and do not be offended my dear sir john when i protest on my knightly faith that i pity the pain which i think this scroll is likely to give you and that if my utmost efforts can be of the least service to you in unravelling this tangled skein i will contribute them with as much earnestness as ever i did aught in my life this faithful minstrel will now see that he can have no difficulty in yielding up a secret which i doubt not but for the writing i have just put into his hands he would have continued to keep with unshaken fidelity sir aymer now placed in de waltons hand a note in which he had ere he left saint brides convent signified his own interpretation of the mystery and the governor had scarcely read the name it contained before the same name was pronounced aloud by bertram who at the same moment handed to the governor the scroll which he had received from the knight of valence the white plume which floated over the knights cap of maintenance which was worn as a headpiece within doors was not more pale in complexion than was the knight himself at the unexpected and surprising information that the lady who was in chivalrous phrase empress of hia thoughts and commander of his actions and to whom even in less fantastic times he must have owed the deepest gratitude for the generous election which she had made in his favour was the same person whom he had threatened with personal violence and subjected to hardships and affronts which he would not willingly have bestowed even upon the meanest of her sex yet sir john de walton seemed at first scarcely to comprehend the numerous ill consequences which might probably follow this unhappy complication of mistakes he took the paper from the minstrels hand and while his eye assisted by the lamp wandered over the characters without apparently their conveying any distinct impression to his understanding de valence even became alarmed that he was about to lose his faculties for heavens sake sir he said be a man and support with manly steadiness these unexpected occurrences i would fain think they will reach to nothing else which the wit of man could not have prevented this fair lady i would fain hope cannot be much hurt or deeply offended by a train of circumstances the natural consequence of your anxiety to discharge perfectly a duty upon which must depend the accomplishment of all the hopes she had permitted you to entertain in gods name rouse up sir let it not be said that an apprehended frown of a fair lady hath damped to such a degree the courage of the boldest knight in england be what men have called you walton the unwavering in heavens name let us at least see that the lady is indeed offended before we conclude that she is irreconcilably so to whose fault are we to ascribe the source of all these errors surely with all due respect to the caprice of the lady herself which has engendered such a nest of mistakes think of it as a man and as a soldier suppose that you yourself or i desirous of proving the fidelity of our sentinels or for any other reason good or bad attempted to enter this dangerous castle of douglas without giving the password to the warders would we be entitled to blame those upon duty if not knowing our persons they manfully refused us entrance made us prisoners and mishandled us while resisting our attempt in terms of the orders which we ourselves had imposed upon them what is there that makes a difference between such a sentinel and yourself john de walton in this curious affair which by heaven would rather form a gay subject for the minstrelsy of this excellent bard than the theme of a tragic lay come look not thus sir john de walton be angry if you will with the lady who has committed such a piece of folly or with me who have rode up and down nearly all night on a fools errand and spoiled my best horse in absolute uncertainty how i shall get another till my uncle of pembroke and i shall be reconciled or lastly if you desire to be totally absurd in your wrath direct it against this worthy minstrel on account of his rare fidelity and punish him for that for which he better deserves a chain of gold let passion out if you will but chase this desponding gloom from the brow of a man and a belted knight sir john de walton made an effort to speak and succeeded with some difficulty aymer de valence he said in irritating a madman you do but sport with your own life and then remained silent i am glad you can say so much replied his friend for i was not jesting when i said i would rather that you were at variance with me than that you laid the whole blame on yourself it would be courteous i think to set this minstrel instantly at liberty meantime for his ladys sake i will entreat him in all honour to be our guest till the lady augusta de berkely shall do us the same honour and to assist us in our search after her place of retirement good minstrel he continued you hear what i say and you will not i suppose be surprised that in all honour and kind usage you find yourself detained for a short space in this castle of douglas you seem sir knight replied the minstrel not so much to keep your eye upon the right of doing what you should as to possess the might of doing what you would i must necessarily be guided by your advice since you have the power to make it a command and i trust continued de valence that when your mistress and you again meet we shall have the benefit of your intercession for any thing which we may have done to displeasure her considering that the purpose of our action was exactly the reverse let me said sir john de walton say a single word i will offer thee a chain of gold heavy enough to bear down the weight of these shackles as a sign of regret for having condemned thee to suffer so many indignities enough said sir john said de valence let us promise no more till this good minstrel shall see some sign of performance follow me this way and i will tell thee in private of other tidings which it is important that you should know so saying he withdrew de walton from the dungeon and sending for the old knight sir philip de montenay already mentioned who acted as seneschal of the castle he commanded that the minstrel should be enlarged from the dungeon well looked to in other respects yet prohibited though with every mark of civility from leaving the castle without a trusty attendant and now sir john de walton he said methinks you are a little churlish in not ordering me some breakfast after i have been all night engaged in your affairs and a cup of muscadel would i think be no bad induction to a full consideration of this perplexed matter thou knowest answered de walton that thou mayest call for what thou wilt provided always thou tellest me without loss of time what else thou knowest respecting the will of the lady against whom we have all sinned so grievously and i alas beyond hope of forgiveness trust me i hope said the knight of valence the good lady bears me no malice as indeed she has expressly renounced any illwill against me the words you see are as plain as you yourself may read the lady pardons poor aymer de valence and willingly for having been involved in a mistake to which she herself led the way she herself will at all times be happy to meet with him as an acquaintance and never to think farther of these few days history except as matter of mirth and ridicule so it is expressly written and set down yes replied sir john de walton but see you not that her offending lover is expressly excluded from the amnesty granted to the lesser offender mark you not the concluding paragraph he took the scroll with a trembling hand and read with a discomposed voice its closing words it is even so all former connexion must henceforth be at an end between him and the supposed augustine explain to me how the reading of these words is reconcilable to anything but their plain sense of condemnation and forfeiture of contract implying destruction of the hopes of sir john de walton you are somewhat an older man than i sir knight answered de valence and i will grant by far the wiser and more experienced yet i will uphold that there is no adopting the interpretation which you seem to have affixed in your mind to this letter without supposing the preliminary that the fair writer was distracted in her understanding nay never start look wildly or lay your hand on your sword i do not affirm this is the case i say again that no woman in her senses would have pardoned a common acquaintance for his behaving to her with unintentional disrespect and unkindness during the currency of a certain masquerade and at the same time sternly and irrevocably broke off with the lover to whom her troth was plighted although his error in joining in the offence was neither grosser nor more protracted than that of the person indifferent to her love do not blaspheme said sir john do walton and forgive me if in justice to truth and to the angel whom i fear i have forfeited for ever i point out to you the difference which a maiden of dignity and of feeling must make between an offence towards her committed by an ordinary acquaintance and one of precisely the same kind offered by a person who is bound by the most undeserved preference by the most generous benefits and by every thing which can bind human feeling to think and reflect ere he becomes an actor in any case in which it is possible for her to be concerned now by mine honour said aymer de valence i am glad to hear thee make some attempt at reason although it is but an unreasonable kind of reason too since its object is to destroy thine own hopes and argue away thine own chance of happiness but if i have in the progress of this affair borne me sometimes towards thee as to give not only the governor but even the friend some cause of displeasure i will make it up to thee now john de walton by trying to convince thee in spite of thine own perverse logic but here comes the muscadel and the breakfast wilt thou take some refreshment or shall we go on without the spirit of muscadel for heavens sake replied de walton do as thou wilt so thou make me clear of thy wellintended babble nay thou shalt not brawl me out of my powers of argument said de valence laughing and helping himself to a brimming cup of wine if thou acknowledgest thyself conquered i am contented to give the victory to the inspiring strength of the jovial liquor do as thou listest said de walton but make an end of an argument which thou canst not comprehend i deny the charge answered the younger knight wiping his lips after having finished his draught and listen walton the warlike to a chapter in the history of woman in which thou art more unskilled than i would wish thee to be thou canst not deny that be it right or wrong the lady augusta hath ventured more forward with you than is usual upon the sea of affection she boldly made thee her choice while thou wert as yet known to her only as a flower of english chivalry faith and i respect her for her frankness but it was a choice which the more cold of her own sex might perhaps claim occasion to term rash and precipitate nay be not i pray thee offended i am far from thinking or saying so on the contrary i will uphold with my lance her selection of john de walton against the minions of a court to be a wise and generous choice and her own behaviour as alike candid and noble but she herself is not unlikely to dread unjust misconstruction a fear of which may not improbably induce her upon any occasion to seize some opportunity of showing an unwonted and unusual rigour towards her lover in order to balance her having extended towards him in the beginning of their intercourse somewhat of an unusual degree of frank encouragement nay it might be easy for her lover so far to take part against himself by arguing as thou dost when out of thy senses as to make it difficult for her to withdraw from an argument which he himself was foolish enough to strengthen and thus like a maiden too soon taken at her first naysay she shall perhaps be allowed no opportunity of bearing herself according to her real feelings or retracting a sentence issued with consent of the party whose hopes it destroys i have heard thee de valence answered the governor of douglas dale nor is it difficult for me to admit that these thy lessons may serve as a chart to many a female heart but not to that of augusta de berkely by my life i say i would much sooner be deprived of the merit of those few deeds of chivalry which thou sayest have procured for me such enviable distinction than i would act upon them with the insolence as if i said that my place in the ladys bosom was too firmly fixed to be shaken even by the success of a worthier man or by my own gross failure in respect to the object of my attachment no herself alone shall have power to persuade me that even goodness equal to that of an interceding saint will restore me to the place in her affections which i have most unworthily forfeited by a stupidity only to be compared to that of brutes if you are so minded said aymer de valence i have only one word more forgive me if i speak it peremptorily the lady as you say and say truly must be the final arbitress in this question my arguments do not extend to insisting that you should claim her hand whether she herself will or no but to learn her determination it is necessary that you should find out where she is of which i am unfortunately not able to inform you how what mean you exclaimed the governor who now only began to comprehend the extent of his misfortune whither hath she fled or with whom she is fled for what i know said de valence in search of a more enterprising lover than one who is so willing to interpret every air of frost as a killing blight to his hopes perhaps she seeks the black douglas or some such hero of the thistle to reward with her lands her lordships and beauty those virtues of enterprise and courage of which john de walton was at one time thought possessed but seriously events are passing around us of strange import i saw enough last night on my way to saint brides to make me suspicious of every one i sent to you as a prisoner the old sexton of the church of douglas i found him contumacious as to some enquiries which i thought it proper to prosecute but of this more at another time the escape of this lady adds greatly to the difficulties which encircle this devoted castle aymer de valence replied de walton in a solemn and animated tone douglas castle shall be defended as we have hitherto been able with the aid of heaven to spread from its battlements the broad banner of st george come of me what lists during my life i will die the faithful lover of augusta de berkely even although i no longer live as her chosen knight there are cloisters and hermitages ay marry are there replied sir aymer and girdles of hemp moreover and beads of oak but all these we omit in our reckonings till we discover where the lady augusta is and what she purposes to do in this matter you say well replied de walton let us hold counsel together by what means we shall if possible discover the ladys too hasty retreat by which she has done me great wrong i mean if she supposed her commands would not have been fully obeyed had she honoured with them the governor of douglas dale or any who are under his command now replied de valence you again speak like a true son of chivalry with your permission i would summon this minstrel to our presence his fidelity to his mistress has been remarkable and as matters stand now we must take instant measures for tracing the place of her retreat chapter the fourteenth the way is long my children long and rough the moors are dreary and the woods are dark but he that creeps from cradle on to grave unskilld save in the velvet course of fortune hath missd the discipline of noble hearts old play it was yet early in the day when after the governor and de valence had again summoned bertram to their councils the garrison of douglas was mustered and a number of small parties in addition to those already despatched by de valence from hazelside were sent out to scour the woods in pursuit of the fugitives with strict injunctions to treat them if overtaken with the utmost respect and to obey their commands keeping an eye however on the place where they might take refuge to facilitate this result some who were men of discretion were intrusted with the secret who the supposed pilgrim and the fugitive nun really were the whole ground whether forest or moorland within many miles of douglas castle was covered and traversed by parties whose anxiety to detect the fugitives was equal to the reward for their safe recovery liberally offered by de walton and de valence they spared not meantime to make such enquiries in all directions as might bring to light any machinations of the scottish insurgents which might be on foot in those wild districts of which as we have said before de valence in particular entertained strong suspicions their instructions were in case of finding such to proceed against the persons engaged by arrest and otherwise in the most rigorous manner such as had been commanded by de walton himself at the time when the black douglas and his accomplices had been the principal objects of his wakeful suspicions these various detachments had greatly reduced the strength of the garrison yet although numerous alert and despatched in every direction they had not the fortune either to fall on the trace of the lady of berkely or to encounter any party whatever of the insurgent scottish meanwhile our fugitives had as we have seen set out from the convent of st bride under the guidance of a cavalier of whom the lady augusta knew nothing save that he was to guide their steps in a direction where they would not be exposed to the risk of being overtaken at length margaret de hautlieu herself spoke upon the subject you have made no enquiry she said lady augusta whither you are travelling or under whose charge although methinks it should much concern you to know is it not enough for me to be aware answered lady augusta that i am travelling kind sister under the protection of one to whom you yourself trust as to a friend and why need i be anxious for any farther assurance of my safety simply said margaret de hautlieu because the persons with whom from national as well as personal circumstances i stand connected are perhaps not exactly the protectors to whom you lady can with such perfect safety intrust yourself in what sense said the lady augusta do you use these words because replied margaret de hautlieu the bruce the douglas malcolm fleming and others of that party although they are incapable of abusing such an advantage to any dishonourable purpose might nevertheless under a strong temptation consider you as an hostage thrown into their hands by providence through whom they might meditate the possibility of gaining some benefit to their dispersed and dispirited party they might make me answered the lady augusta the subject of such a treaty when i was dead but believe me never while i drew vital breath believe me also that with whatever pain shame or agony i would again deliver myself up to the power of de walton yes i would rather put myself in his hands what do i say his i would rather surrender myself to the meanest archer of my native country than combine with its foes to work mischief to merry england my own england that country which is the envy of every other country and the pride of all who can term themselves her natives i thought that your choice might prove so said lady margaret and since you have honoured me with your confidence gladly would i provide for your liberty by placing you as nearly in the situation which you yourself desire as my poor means have the power of accomplishing in half an hour we shall be in danger of being taken by the english parties which will be instantly dispersed in every direction in quest of us now take notice lady i know a place in which i can take refuge with my friends and countrymen those gallant scots who have never even in this dishonoured age bent the knee to baal for their honour their nicety of honour i could in other days have answered with my own but of late i am bound to tell you they have been put to those trials by which the most generous affections may be soured and driven to a species of frenzy the more wild that it is founded originally on the noblest feelings a person who feels himself deprived of his natural birthright denounced exposed to confiscation and death because he avouches the rights of his king the cause of his country ceases on his part to be nice or precise in estimating the degree of retaliation which it is lawful for him to exercise in the requital of such injuries and believe me bitterly should i lament having guided you into a situation which you might consider afflicting or degrading in a word then said the english lady what is it you apprehend i am like to suffer at the hands of your friends whom i must be excused for terming rebels if said the sister ursula your friends whom i should term oppressors and tyrants take our land and our lives seize our castles and confiscate our property you must confess that the rough laws of war indulge mine with the privilege of retaliation there can be no fear that such men under any circumstances would ever exercise cruelty or insult upon a lady of your rank but it is another thing to calculate that they will abstain from such means of extorting advantage from your captivity as are common in warfare you would not i think wish to be delivered up to the english on consideration of sir john de walton surrendering the castle of douglas to its natural lord yet were you in the hands of the bruce or douglas although i can answer for your being treated with all the respect which they have the means of showing yet i own their putting you at such a ransom might be by no means unlikely i would sooner die said the lady berkely than have my name mixed up in a treaty so disgraceful and de waltons reply to it would i am certain be to strike the head from the messenger and throw it from the highest tower of douglas castle where then lady would you now go said sister ursula were the choice in your power to my own castle answered lady augusta where if necessary i could be defended even against the king himself until i could place at least my person under the protection of the church in that case replied margaret de hautlieu my power of rendering you assistance is only precarious yet it comprehends a choice which i will willingly submit to your decision notwithstanding i thereby subject the secrets of my friends to some risk of being discovered and frustrated but the confidence which you have placed in me imposes on me the necessity of committing to you a like trust it rests with you whether you will proceed with me to the secret rendezvous of the douglas and his friends which i may be blamed for making known and there take your chance of the reception which you may encounter since i cannot warrant you of any thing save honourable treatment so far as your person is concerned or if you should think this too hazardous make the best of your way at once for the border in which last case i will proceed as far as i can with you towards the english line and then leave you to pursue your journey and to obtain a guard and a conductor among your own countrymen meantime it will be well for me if i escape being taken since the abbot would not shrink at inflicting upon me the death due to an apostate nun such cruelty my sister could hardly be inflicted upon one who had never taken the religious vows and who still according to the laws of the church had a right to make a choice between the world and the veil such choice as they gave their gallant victims said lady margaret who have fallen into english hands during these merciless wars such choice as they gave to wallace the champion of scotland such as they gave to hay the gentle and the free to sommerville the flower of chivalry and to athol the blood relation of king edward himself all of whom were as much traitors under which name they were executed as margaret de hautlieu is an apostate nun and subject to the rule of the cloister she spoke with some eagerness for she felt as if the english lady imputed to her more coldness than she was in such doubtful circumstances conscious of manifesting and after all she proceeded you lady augusta de berkely what do you venture if you run the risk of falling into the hands of your lover what dreadful risk do you incur you need not methinks fear being immured between four walls with a basket of bread and a cruise of water which were i seized would be the only support allowed to me for the short space that my life would be prolonged nay even were you to be betrayed to the rebel scots as you call them a captivity among the hills sweetened by the hope of deliverance and rendered tolerable by all the alleviations which the circumstances of your captors allowed them the means of supplying were not i think a lot so very hard to endure nevertheless answered the lady of berkely frightful enough it must have appeared to me since to fly from such i threw myself upon your guidance and whatever you think or suspect answered the novice i am as true to you as ever was one maiden to another and as sure as ever sister ursula was true to her vows although they were never completed so will i be faithful to your secret even at the risk of betraying my own hearken lady she said suddenly pausing do you hear that the sound to which she alluded was the same imitation of the cry of an owlet which the lady had before heard under the walls of the convent these sounds said margaret de hautlieu announce that one is near more able than i am to direct us in this matter i must go forward and speak with him and this man our guide will remain by you for a little space nor when he quits your bridle need you wait for any other signal but ride forward on the woodland path and obey the advice and directions which will be given you stay stay sister ursula cried the lady de berkely abandon me not in this moment of uncertainty and distress it must be for the sake of both returned margaret de hautlieu i also am in uncertainty i also am in distress and patience and obedience are the only virtues which can save us both so saying she struck her horse with the riding rod and moving briskly forward disappeared among the tangled boughs of a thicket the lady of berkely would have followed her companion but the cavalier who attended them laid a strong hand upon the bridle of her palfrey with a look which implied that he would not permit her to proceed in that direction terrified therefore though she could not exactly state a reason why the lady of berkely remained with her eyes fixed upon the thicket instinctively as it were expecting to see a band of english archers or rugged scottish insurgents issue from its tangled skirts and doubtful which she should have most considered as the objects of her terror in the distress of her uncertainty she again attempted to move forward but the stern check which her attendant again bestowed upon her bridle proved sufficiently that in restraining her wishes the stranger was not likely to spare the strength which he certainly possessed at length after some ten minutes had elapsed the cavalier withdrew his hand from her bridle and pointing with his lance towards the thicket through which there winded a narrow scarce visible path seemed to intimate to the lady that her road lay in that direction and that he would no longer prevent her following it do you not go with me said the lady who having been accustomed to this mans company since they left the convent had by degrees come to look upon him as a sort of protector he however gravely shook his head as if to excuse complying with a request which it was not in his power to grant and turning his steed in a different direction retired at a pace which soon carried him from her sight she had then no alternative but to take the path of the thicket which had been followed by margaret de hautlieu nor did she pursue it long before coming in sight of a singular spectacle the trees grew wider as the lady advanced and when she entered the thicket she perceived that though hedged in as it were by an enclosure of copsewood it was in the interior altogether occupied by a few of the magnificent trees such as seemed to have been the ancestors of the forest and which though few in number were sufficient to overshade all the unoccupied ground by the great extent of their complicated branches beneath one of these lay stretched something of a grey colour which as it drew itself together exhibited the figure of a man sheathed in armour but strangely accoutred and in a manner so bizarre as to indicate some of the wild fancies peculiar to the knights of that period his armour was ingeniously painted so as to represent a skeleton the ribs being constituted by the corselet and its backpiece the shield represented an owl with its wings spread a device which was repeated upon the helmet which appeared to be completely covered by an image of the same bird of ill omen but that which was particularly calculated to excite surprise in the spectator was the great height and thinness of the figure which as it arose from the ground and placed itself in an erect posture seemed rather to resemble an apparition in the act of extricating itself from the grave than that of an ordinary man rising upon his feet the horse too upon which the lady rode started back and snorted either at the sudden change of posture of this ghastly specimen of chivalry or disagreeably affected by some odour which accompanied his presence the lady herself manifested some alarm for although she did not utterly believe she was in the presence of a super natural being yet among all the strange halffrantic disguises of chivalry this was assuredly the most uncouth which she had ever seen and considering how often the knights of the period pushed their dreamy fancies to the borders of insanity it seemed at best no very safe adventure to meet one accoutred in the emblems of the king of terrors himself alone and in the midst of a wild forest be the knights character and purposes what they might she resolved however to accost him in the language and manner observed in romances upon such occasions in the hope even that if he were a madman he might prove a peaceable one and accessible to civility sir knight she said in as firm a tone as she could assume right sorry am i if by my hasty approach i have disturbed your solitary meditations my horse sensible i think of the presence of yours brought me hither without my being aware whom or what i was to encounter i am one answered the stranger in a solemn tone whom few men seek to meet till the time comes that they can avoid me no longer you speak sir knight replied the lady de berkely according to the dismal character of which it has pleased you to assume the distinction may i appeal to one whose exterior is so formidable for the purpose of requesting some directions to guide me through this wild wood as for instance what is the name of the nearest castle town or hostelry and by what course i am best likely to reach such it is a singular audacity answered the knight of the tomb that would enter into conversation with him who is termed the inexorable the unsparing and the pitiless whom even the most miserable forbears to call to his assistance lest his prayers should be too soon answered sir knight replied the lady augusta the character which you have assumed unquestionably for good reasons dictates to you a peculiar course of speech but although your part is a sad one it does not i should suppose render it necessary for you to refuse those acts of civility to which you must have bound yourself in taking the high vows of chivalry if you will trust to my guidance replied the ghastly figure there is only one condition upon which i can grant you the information which you require and that is that you follow my footsteps without any questions asked as to the tendency of our journey i suppose i must submit to your conditions she answered if you are indeed pleased to take upon yourself the task of being my guide in my heart i conceive you to be one of the unhappy gentlemen of scotland who are now in arms as they say for the defence of their liberties a rash undertaking has brought me within the sphere of your influence and now the only favour i have to request of you against whom i never did nor planned any evil is the guidance which your knowledge of the country permits you easily to afford me in my way to the frontiers of england believe that what i may see of your haunts or of your practices shall be to me things invisible as if they were actually concealed by the sepulchre itself of the king of which it has pleased you to assume the attributes and if a sum of money enough to be the ransom of a wealthy earl will purchase such a favour at need such a ransom will be frankly paid and with as much fidelity as ever it was rendered by a prisoner to the knight by whom he was taken do not reject me princely bruce noble douglas if indeed it is to either of these that i address myself in this my last extremity men speak of both as fearful enemies but generous knights and faithful friends let me entreat you to remember how much you would wish your own friends and connexions to meet with compassion under similar circumstances at the hands of the knights of england and have they done so replied the knight in a voice more gloomy than before or do you act wisely while imploring the protection of one whom you believe to be a true scottish knight for no other reason than the extreme and extravagant misery of his appearance is it i say well or wise to remind him of the mode in which the lords of england have treated the lovely maidens and the highborn dames of scotland have not their prison cages been suspended from the battlements of castles that their captivity might be kept in view of every base burgher who should desire to look upon the miseries of the noblest peeresses yea even the queen of scotland footnote the queen of robert the bruce and the countess of buchan by whom as one of macduffs descent he was crowned at scone were secured in the manner described is this a recollection which can inspire a scottish knight with compassion towards an english lady or is it a thought which can do aught but swell the deeply sworn hatred of edward plantagenet the author of these evils that boils in every drop of scottish blood which still feels the throb of life no it is all you can expect if cold and pitiless as the sepulchre i represent i leave you unassisted in the helpless condition in which you describe yourself to be you will not be so inhuman replied the lady in doing so you must surrender every right to honest fame which you have won either by sword or lance you must surrender every pretence to that justice which affects the merit of supporting the weak against the strong you must make it your principle to avenge the wrongs and tyranny of edward plantagenet upon the dames and damosels of england who have neither access to his councils nor perhaps give him their approbation in his wars against scotland it would not then said the knight of the sepulchre induce you to depart from your request should i tell you the evils to which you would subject yourself should we fall into the hands of the english troops and should they find you under such illomened protection as my own be assured said the lady the consideration of such an event does not in the least shake my resolution or desire of confiding in your protection you may probably know who i am and may judge how far even edward would hold himself entitled to extend punishment towards me how am i to know you replied the ghastly cavalier or your circumstances they must be extraordinary indeed if they could form a check either of justice or humanity upon the revengeful feelings of edward all who know him are well assured that it is no ordinary motive that will induce him to depart from the indulgence of his evil temper but be it as it may you lady if a lady you be throw yourself as a burden upon me and i must discharge myself of my trust as i best may for this purpose you must be guided implicitly by my directions which will be given after the fashion of those of the spiritual world being intimations rather than detailed instructions for your conduct and expressed rather by commands than by any reason or argument in this way it is possible that i may be of service to you in any other case it is most likely that i may fail you at need and melt from your side like a phantom which dreads the approach of day you cannot be so cruel answered the lady a gentleman a knight and a nobleman and i persuade myself i speak to all hath duties which he cannot abandon he has i grant it and they are most sacred to me answered the spectral knight but i have also duties whose obligations are doubly binding and to which i must sacrifice those which would otherwise lead me to devote myself to your rescue the only question is whether you feel inclined to accept my protection on the limited terms on which alone i can extend it or whether you deem it better that each go their own way and limit themselves to their own resources and trust the rest to providence alas replied the lady beset and hard pressed as i am to ask me to form a resolution for myself is like calling on the wretch in the act of falling from a precipice to form a calm judgment by what twig he may best gain the chance of breaking his fall his answer must necessarily be that he will cling to that which he can easiest lay hold of and trust the rest to providence i accept therefore your offer of protection in the modified way you are pleased to limit it and i put my faith in heaven and in you to aid me effectually however you must know my name and my circumstances all these answered the knight of the sepulchre have already been told me by your late companion for deem not young lady that either beauty rank extended domains unlimited wealth or the highest accomplishments can weigh any thing in the consideration of him who wears the trappings of the tomb and whose affections and desires are long buried in the charnelhouse may your faith said the lady augusta de berkely be as steady as your words appear severe and i submit to your guidance without the least doubt or fear that it will prove otherwise than as i venture to hope chapter the fifteenth like the dog following its master when engaged in training him to the sport in which he desires he should excel the lady augusta felt herself occasionally treated with a severity calculated to impress upon her the most implicit obedience and attention to the knight of the tomb in whom she had speedily persuaded herself she saw a principal man among the retainers of douglas if not james of douglas himself still however the ideas which the lady had formed of the redoubted douglas were those of a knight highly accomplished in the duties of chivalry devoted in particular to the service of the fair sex and altogether unlike the personage with whom she found herself so strangely united or rather for the present enthralled to nevertheless when as if to abridge farther communication he turned short into one of the mazes of the wood and seemed to adopt a pace which from the nature of the ground the horse on which the lady augusta was mounted had difficulty to keep up with she followed him with the alarm and speed of the young spaniel which from fear rather than fondness endeavours to keep up with the track of its severe master the simile it is true is not a very polite one nor entirely becoming an age when women were worshipped with a certain degree of devotion but such circumstances as the present were also rare and the lady augusta de berkely could not but persuade herself that the terrible champion whose name had been so long the theme of her anxiety and the terror indeed of the whole country might be able some way or other to accomplish her deliverance she therefore exerted herself to the utmost so as to keep pace with the phantomlike apparition and followed the knight as the evening shadow keeps watch upon the belated rustic as the lady obviously suffered under the degree of exertion necessary to keep her palfrey from stumbling in these steep and broken paths the knight of the tomb slackened his pace looked anxiously around him and muttered apparently to himself though probably intended for his companions ear there is no occasion for so much haste he proceeded at a slower rate until they seemed to be on the brink of a ravine being one of many irregularities on the surface of the ground effected by the sudden torrents peculiar to that country and which winding among the trees and copsewood formed as it were a net of places of concealment opening into each other so that there was perhaps no place in the world so fit for the purpose of ambuscade the spot where the borderer turnbull had made his escape at the hunting match was one specimen of this broken country and perhaps connected itself with the various thickets and passes through which the knight and pilgrim occasionally seemed to take their way though that ravine was at a considerable distance from their present route meanwhile the knight led the way as if rather with the purpose of bewildering the lady augusta amidst these interminable woods than following any exact or fixed path here they ascended and anon appeared to descend in the same direction finding only boundless wildernesses and varied combinations of tangled woodland scenery such part of the country as seemed arable the knight appeared carefully to avoid yet he could not direct his course with so much certainty but that he occasionally crossed the path of inhabitants and cultivators who showed a consciousness of so singular a presence but never as the lady observed evinced any symptoms of recognition the inference was obvious that the spectre knight was known in the country and that he possessed adherents or accomplices there who were at least so far his friends as to avoid giving any alarm which might be the means of his discovery the wellimitated cry of the nightowl too frequent a guest in the wilderness that its call should be a subject of surprise seemed to be a signal generally understood among them for it was heard in different parts of the wood and the lady augusta experienced in such journeys by her former travels under the guidance of the minstrel bertram was led to observe that on hearing such wild notes her guide changed the direction of his course and betook himself to paths which led through deeper wilds and more impenetrable thickets this happened so often that a new alarm came upon the unfortunate pilgrim which suggested other motives of terror was she not the confidant and almost the tool of some artful design laid with a view to an extensive operation which was destined to terminate as the efforts of douglas had before done in the surprise of his hereditary castle the massacre of the english garrison and finally in the dishonour and death of that sir john de walton upon whose fate she had long believed or taught herself to believe that her own was dependent it no sooner flashed across the mind of the lady augusta that she was engaged in some such conspiracy with a scottish insurgent than she shuddered at the consequences of the dark transactions in which she had now become involved and which appeared to have a tendency so very different from what she had at first apprehended the hours of the morning of this remarkable day being that of palm sunday were thus drawn out in wandering from place to place while the lady de berkely occasionally interposed by petitions for liberty which she endeavoured to express in the most moving and pathetic manner and by offers of wealth and treasures to which no answer whatever was returned by her strange guide at length as if worn out by his captives importunity the knight coming close up to the bridlerein of the lady augusta said in a solemn tone i am as you may well believe none of those knights who roam through wood and wild seeking adventures by which i may obtain grace in the eyes of a fair lady yet will i to a certain degree grant the request which thou dost solicit so anxiously and the arbitration of thy fate shall depend upon the pleasure of him to whose will thou hast expressed thyself ready to submit thine own i will on our arrival at the place of our destination which is now at hand write to sir john de walton and send my letter together with thy fair self by a special messenger he will no doubt speedily attend our summons and thou shalt thyself be satisfied that even he who has as yet appeared deaf to entreaty and insensible to earthly affections has still some sympathy for beauty and for virtue i will put the choice of safety and thy future happiness into thine own hands and those of the man whom thou hast chosen and thou mayst select which thou wilt betwixt those and misery while he thus spoke one of those ravines or clefts in the earth seemed to yawn before them and entering it at the upper end the spectre knight with an attention which he had not yet shown guided the ladys courser by the rein down the broken and steep path by which alone the bottom of the tangled dingle was accessible when placed on firm ground after the dangers of a descent in which her palfrey seemed to be sustained by the personal strength and address of the singular being who had hold of the bridle the lady looked with some astonishment at a place so well adapted for concealment as that which she had now reached it appeared evident that it was used for this purpose for more than one stifled answer was given to a very low buglenote emitted by the knight of the tomb and when the same note was repeated about half a score of armed men some wearing the dress of soldiers others those of shepherds and agriculturists showed themselves imperfectly as if acknowledging the summons chapter the sixteenth hail to you my gallant friends said the knight of the tomb to his companions who seemed to welcome him with the eagerness of men engaged in the same perilous undertaking the winter has passed over the festival of palm sunday is come and as surely as the ice and snow of this season shall not remain to chill the earth through the ensuing summer so surely we in a few hours keep our word to those southern braggarts who think their language of boasting and malice has as much force over our scottish bosoms as the blast possesses over the autumn fruits but it is not so while we choose to remain concealed they may as vainly seek to descry us as a housewife would search for the needle she has dropped among the withered foliage of yon gigantic oak yet a few hours and the lost needle shall become the exterminating sword of the genius of scotland avenging ten thousand injuries and especially the life of the gallant lord douglas cruelly done to death as an exile from his native country an exclamation between a yell and a groan burst from the assembled retainers of douglas upon being reminded of the recent death of their chieftain while they seemed at the same time sensible of the necessity of making little noise lest they should give the alarm to some of the numerous english parties which were then traversing different parts of the forest the acclamation so cautiously uttered had scarce died away in silence when the knight of the tomb or to call him by his proper name sir james douglas again addressed his handful of faithful followers one effort my friends may yet be made to end our strife with the southron without bloodshed fate has within a few hours thrown into my power the young heiress of berkely for whose sake it is said sir john de walton keeps with such obstinacy the castle which is mine by inheritance is there one among you who dare go as the honourable escort of augusta de berkely bearing a letter explaining the terms on which i am willing to restore her to her lover to freedom and to her english lordships if there is none other said a tall man dressed in the tattered attire of a woodsman and being in fact no other than the very michael turnbull who had already given so extraordinary a proof of his undaunted manhood i will gladly be the person who will be the ladys henchman on this expedition thou art never wanting said the douglas where a manly deed is to be done but remember this lady must pledge to us her word and oath that she will hold herself our faithful prisoner rescue or no rescue that she will consider herself as pledged for the life freedom and fair usage of michael turnbull and that if sir john de walton refuse my terms she must hold herself obliged to return with turnbull to our presence in order to be disposed of at our pleasure there was much in these conditions which struck the lady augusta with natural doubt and horror nevertheless strange as it may seem the declaration of the douglas gave a species of decision to her situation which might have otherwise been unattainable and from the high opinion which she entertained of the douglass chivalry she could not bring herself to think that any part which he might play in the approaching drama would be other than that which a perfect good knight would under all circumstances maintain towards his enemy even with respect to de walton she felt herself relieved of a painful difficulty the idea of her being discovered by the knight himself in a male disguise had preyed upon her spirits and she felt as if guilty of a departure from the laws of womanhood in having extended her favour towards him beyond maidenly limits a step too which might tend to lessen her in the eyes of the lover for whom she had hazarded so much the heart she said is lightly prized that is but lightly won and long shall mourn the heartless man that leaves his love too soon on the other hand to be brought before him as a prisoner was indeed a circumstance equally perplexing as unpleasing but it was one which was beyond her control and the douglas into whose hands she had fallen appeared to her to represent the deity in the play whose entrance was almost sufficient to bring its perplexities to a conclusion she therefore not unwillingly submitted to take what oaths and promises were required by the party in whose hands she found herself and accordingly engaged to be a true prisoner whatever might occur meantime she strictly obeyed the directions of those who had her motions at command devoutly praying that circumstances in themselves so adverse might nevertheless work together for the safety of her lover and her own freedom a pause ensued during which a slight repast was placed before the lady augusta who was wellnigh exhausted with the fatigues of her journey douglas and his partisans meanwhile whispered together as if unwilling she should hear their conference while to purchase their goodwill if possible she studiously avoided every appearance of listening after some conversation turnbull who appeared to consider the lady as peculiarly his charge said to her in a harsh voice do not fear lady no wrong shall be done you nevertheless you must be content for a space to be blindfolded she submitted to this in silent terror and the trooper wrapping part of a mantle round her head did not assist her to remount her palfrey but lent her his arm to support her in this blinded state chapter the seventeenth the ground which they traversed was as lady augusta could feel very broken and uneven and sometimes as she thought encumbered with ruins which were difficult to surmount the strength of her comrade assisted her forward on such occasions but his help was so roughly administered that the lady once or twice in fear or suffering was compelled to groan or sigh heavily whatever was her desire to suppress such evidence of the apprehension which she underwent or the pain which she endured presently upon an occasion of this kind she was distinctly sensible that the rough woodsman was removed from her side and another of the party substituted in his stead whose voice more gentle than that of his companions she thought she had lately heard noble lady were the words fear not the slightest injury at our hands and accept of my ministry instead of that of my henchman who has gone forward with our letter do not think me presuming on my situation if i bear you in my arms through ruins where you could not easily move alone and blindfold at the same time the lady augusta berkely felt herself raised from the earth in the strong arms of a man and borne onward with the utmost gentleness without the necessity of making those painful exertions which had been formerly required she was ashamed of her situation but however delicate it was no time to give vent to complaints which might have given offence to persons whom it was her interest to conciliate she therefore submitted to necessity and heard the following words whispered in her ear fear nothing there is no evil intended you nor shall sir john de walton if he loves you as you deserve at his hand receive any harm on our part we call on him but to do justice to ourselves and to you and be assured you will best accomplish your own happiness by aiding our views which are equally in favour of your wishes and your freedom the lady augusta would have made some answer to this but her breath betwixt fear and the speed with which she was transported refused to permit her to use intelligible accents meantime she began to be sensible that she was enclosed within some building and probably a ruinous one for although the mode of her transportation no longer permitted her to ascertain the nature of her path in any respect distinctly yet the absence of the external air which was however sometimes excluded and sometimes admitted in furious gusts intimated that she was conducted through buildings partly entire and in other places admitting the wind through wide rents and gaps in one place it seemed to the lady as if she passed through a considerable body of people all of whom observed silence although there was sometimes heard among them a murmur to which every one present in some degree contributed although the general sound did not exceed a whisper her situation made her attend to every circumstance and she did not fail to observe that these persons made way for him who bore her until at length she became sensible that he descended by the regular steps of a stair and that she was now alone excepting his company arrived as it appeared to the lady on more level ground they proceeded on their singular road by a course which appeared neither direct nor easy and through an atmosphere which was close to a smothering degree and felt at the same time damp and disagreeable as if from the vapours of a newmade grave her guide again spoke bear up lady augusta for a little longer and continue to endure that atmosphere which must be one day common to us all by the necessity of my situation i must resign my present office to your original guide and can only give you my assurance that neither he nor any one else shall offer you the least incivility or insult and on this you may rely on the faith of a man of honour he placed her as he said these words upon the soft turf and to her infinite refreshment made her sensible that she was once more in the open air and free from the smothering atmosphere which had before oppressed her like that of a charnelhouse at the same time she breathed in a whisper an anxious wish that she might be permitted to disencumber herself from the folds of the mantle which excluded almost the power of breathing though intended only to prevent her seeing by what road she travelled she immediately found it unfolded agreeably to her request and hastened with uncovered eyes to take note of the scene around her it was overshadowed by thick oak trees among which stood some remnants of buildings or what might have seemed such being perhaps the same in which she had been lately wandering a clear fountain of living water bubbled forth from under the twisted roots of one of those trees and offered the lady the opportunity of a draught of the pure element and in which she also bathed her face which had received more than one scratch in the course of her journey in spite of the care and almost the tenderness with which she had latterly been borne along the cool water speedily stopt the bleeding of those trifling injuries and the application served at the same time to recall the scattered senses of the damsel herself her first idea was whether an attempt to escape if such should appear possible was not advisable a moments reflection however satisfied her that such a scheme was not to be thought of and such second thoughts were confirmed by the approach of the gigantic form of the huntsman turnbull the rough tones of whose voice were heard before his figure was obvious to her eye were you impatient for my return fair lady such as i he continued in an ironical tone of voice who are foremost in the chase of wild stags and silvan cattle are not in use to lag behind when fair ladies like you are the objects of pursuit and if i am not so constant in my attendance as you might expect believe me it is because i was engaged in another matter to which i must sacrifice for a little even the duty of attending on you i offer no resistance said the lady forbear however in discharging thy duty to augment my uneasiness by thy conversation for thy master hath pledged me his word that he will not suffer me to be alarmed or ill treated nay fair one replied the huntsman i ever thought it was fit to make interest by soft words with fair ladies but if you like it not i have no such pleasure in hunting for fine holyday terms but that i can with equal ease hold myself silent come then since we must wait upon this lover of yours ere morning closes and learn his last resolution touching a matter which is become so strangely complicated i will hold no more intercourse with you as a female but talk to you as a person of sense although an englishwoman you will replied the lady best fulfil the intentions of those by whose orders you act by holding no society with me whatever otherwise than is necessary in the character of guide the man lowered his brows yet seemed to assent to what the lady of berkely proposed and remained silent as they for some time pursued their course each pondering over their own share of meditation which probably turned upon matters essentially different at length the loud blast of a bugle was heard at no great distance from the unsocial fellowtravellers that is the person we seek said turnbull i know his blast from any other who frequents this forest and my orders are to bring you to speech of him the blood darted rapidly through the ladys veins at the thought of being thus unceremoniously presented to the knight in whose favour she had confessed a rash preference more agreeable to the manners of those times when exaggerated sentiments often inspired actions of extravagant generosity than in our days when every thing is accounted absurd which does not turn upon a motive connected with the immediate selfish interests of the actor himself when turnbull therefore winded his horn as if in answer to the blast which they had heard the lady was disposed to fly at the first impulse of shame and of fear turnbull perceived her intention and caught hold of her with no very gentle grasp saying nay lady it is to be understood that you play your own part in the drama which unless you continue on the stage will conclude unsatisfactorily to us all in a combat at outrance between your lover and me when it will appear which of us is most worthy of your favour i will be patient said the lady bethinking her that even this strange mans presence and the compulsion which he appeared to use towards her was a sort of excuse to her female scruples for coming into the presence of her lover at least at her first appearance before him in a disguise which her feelings confessed was not extremely decorous or reconcilable to the dignity of her sex the moment after these thoughts had passed through her mind the tramp of a horse was heard approaching and sir john de walton pressing through the trees became aware of the presence of his lady captive as it seemed in the grasp of a scottish outlaw who was only known to him by his former audacity at the huntingmatch his surprise and joy only supplied the knight with those hasty expressions caitiff let go thy hold or die in thy profane attempt to control the motions of one whom the very sun in heaven should be proud to obey at the same time apprehensive that the huntsman might hurry the lady from his sight by means of some entangled path such as upon a former occasion had served him for escape sir john de walton dropt his cumbrous lance of which the trees did not permit him the perfect use and springing from his horse approached turnbull with his drawn sword the scotchman keeping his left hand still upon the ladys mantle uplifted with his right his battleaxe or jedwood staff for the purpose of parrying and returning the blow of his antagonist but the lady spoke sir john de walton she said for heavens sake forbear all violence till you hear upon what pacific object i am brought hither and by what peaceful means these wars may be put an end to this man though an enemy of yours has been to me a civil and respectful guardian and i entreat you to forbear him while he speaks the purpose for which he has brought me hither to speak of compulsion and the lady de berkely in the same breath would itself be cause enough for instant death said the governor of douglas castle but you command lady and i spare his insignificant life although i have causes of complaint against him the least of which were good warrant had he a thousand lives for the forfeiture of them all john de walton replied turnbull this lady well knows that no fear of thee operates in my mind to render this a peaceful meeting and were i not withheld by other circumstances of great consideration to the douglas as well as thyself i should have no more fear in facing the utmost thou couldst do than i have now in levelling that sapling to the earth it grows upon so saying michael turnbull raised his battleaxe and struck from a neighbouring oaktree a branch wellnigh as thick as a mans arm which with all its twigs and leaves rushed to the ground between de walton and the scotchman giving a singular instance of the keenness of his weapon and the strength and dexterity with which he used it let there be truce then between us good fellow said sir john de walton since it is the ladys pleasure that such should be the case and let me know what thou hast to say to me respecting her on that subject said turnbull my words are few but mark them sir englishman the lady augusta berkely wandering in this country has become a prisoner of the noble lord douglas the rightful inheritor of the castle and lordship and he finds himself obliged to attach to the liberty of this lady the following conditions being in all respects such as good and lawful warfare entitles a knight to exact that is to say in all honour and safety the lady augusta shall be delivered to sir john de walton or those whom he shall name for the purpose of receiving her on the other hand the castle of douglas itself together with all outposts or garrisons thereunto belonging shall be made over and surrendered by sir john de walton in the same situation and containing the same provisions and artillery as are now within their walls and the space of a month of truce shall be permitted to sir james douglas and sir john de walton farther to regulate the terms of surrender on both parts having first plighted their knightly word and oath that in the exchange of the honourable lady for the foresaid castle lies the full import of the present agreement and that every other subject of dispute shall at the pleasure of the noble knights foresaid be honourably compounded and agreed betwixt them or at their pleasure settled knightly by single combat according to usage and in a fair field before any honourable person that may possess power enough to preside it is not easy to conceive the astonishment of sir john de walton at hearing the contents of this extraordinary cartel he looked towards the lady of berkely with that aspect of despair with which a criminal may be supposed to see his guardian angel prepare for departure through her mind also similar ideas flowed as if they contained a concession of what she had considered as the summit of her wishes but under conditions disgraceful to her lover like the cherubs fiery sword of yore which was a barrier between our first parents and the blessings of paradise sir john de walton after a moments hesitation broke silence in these words noble lady you may be surprised if a condition be imposed upon me having for its object your freedom and if sir john de walton already standing under those obligations to you which he is proud of acknowledging should yet hesitate on accepting with the utmost eagerness what must ensure your restoration to freedom and independence but so it is that the words now spoken have thrilled in mine ear without reaching to my understanding and i must pray the lady of berkely for pardon if i take time to reconsider them for a short space and i replied turnbull have only power to allow you half an hour for the consideration of an offer in accepting which methinks you should jump shoulderheight instead of asking any time for reflection what does this cartel exact save what your duty as a knight implicitly obliges you to you have engaged yourself to become the agent of the tyrant edward in holding douglas castle as his commander to the prejudice of the scottish nation and of the knight of douglas dale who never as a community or as an individual were guilty of the least injury towards you you are therefore prosecuting a false path unworthy of a good knight on the other hand the freedom and safety of your lady is now proposed to be pledged to you with a full assurance of her liberty and honour on consideration of your withdrawing from the unjust line of conduct in which you have suffered yourself to be imprudently engaged if you persevere in it you place your own honour and the ladys happiness in the hands of men whom you have done everything in your power to render desperate and whom thus irritated it is most probable you may find such it is not from thee at least said the knight that i shall learn to estimate the manner in which douglas will explain the laws of war or de walton receive them at his dictating i am not then said turnbull received as a friendly messenger farewell and think of this lady as being in any hands but those which are safe while you make up at leisure your mind upon the message i have brought you come madam we must be gone so saying he seized upon the ladys hand and pulled her as if to force her to withdraw the lady had stood motionless and almost senseless while these speeches were exchanged between the warriors but when she felt the grasp of michael turnbull she exclaimed like one almost beside herself with fear help me de walton the knight stung to instant rage assaulted the forester with the utmost fury and dealt him with his long sword almost at unawares two or three heavy blows by which he was so wounded that he sunk backwards in the thicket and de walton was about to despatch him when he was prevented by the anxious cry of the lady alas de walton what have you done this man was only an ambassador and should have passed free from injury while he confined himself to the delivery of what he was charged with and if thou hast slain him who knows how frightful may prove the vengeance exacted the voice of the lady seemed to recover the huntsman from the effects of the blows he had received he sprung on his feet saying never mind me nor think of my becoming the means of making mischief the knight in his haste spoke without giving me warning and defiance which gave him an advantage which i think he would otherwise have scorned to have taken in such a case i will renew the combat on fairer terms or call another champion as the knight pleases with these words he disappeared fear not empress of de waltons thoughts answered the knight but believe that if we regain together the shelter of douglas castle and the safeguard of saint georges cross thou mayst laugh at all and if you can but pardon what i shall never be able to forgive myself the molelike blindness which did not recognise the sun while under a temporary eclipse the task cannot be named too hard for mortal valour to achieve which i shall not willingly undertake to wipe out the memory of my grievous fault mention it no more said the lady it is not at such a time as this when our lives are for the moment at stake that quarrels upon slighter topics are to be recurred to i can tell you if you do not yet know that the scots are in arms in this vicinity and that even the earth has yawned to conceal them from the sight of your garrison let it yawn then said sir john de walton and suffer every fiend in the infernal abyss to escape from his prisonhouse and reinforce our enemies still fairest having received in thee a pearl of matchless price my spurs shall be hacked from my heels by the basest scullion if i turn my horses head to the rear before the utmost force these ruffians can assemble either upon earth or from underneath it in thy name i defy them all to instant combat as sir john de walton pronounced these last words in something of an exalted tone a tall cavalier arrayed in black armour of the simplest form stepped forth from that part of the thicket where turnbull had disappeared i am he said james of douglas and your challenge is accepted i the challenged name the arms our knightly weapons as we now wear them and our place of combat this field or dingle called the bloody sykes the time being instant and the combatants like true knights foregoing each advantage on either side footnote the ominous name of bloodmiresink or syke marks a narrow hollow to the northwest of douglas castle from which it is distant about the third of a mile mr haddow states that according to local tradition the name was given in consequence of sir james douglas having at this spot intercepted and slain part of the garrison of the castle while de walton was in command so be it in gods name said the english knight who though surprised at being called upon to so sudden an encounter with so formidable a warrior as young douglas was too proud to dream of avoiding the combat making a sign to the lady to retire behind him that he might not lose the advantage which he had gained by setting her at liberty from the forester he drew his sword and with a deliberate and prepared attitude of offence moved slowly to the encounter it was a dreadful one for the courage and skill both of the native lord of douglas dale and of de walton among the most renowned of the times and perhaps the world of chivalry could hardly have produced two knights more famous their blows fell as if urged by some mighty engine where they were met and parried with equal strength and dexterity nor seemed it likely in the course of ten minutes encounter that an advantage would be gained by either combatant over the other an instant they stopped by mutually implied assent as it seemed for the purpose of taking breath during which douglas said i beg that this noble lady may understand that her own freedom is no way concerned in the present contest which entirely regards the injustice done by this sir john de walton and by his nation of england to the memory of my father and to my own natural rights you are generous sir knight replied the lady but in what circumstances do you place me if you deprive me of my protector by death or captivity and leave me alone in a foreign land if such should be the event of the combat replied sir james the douglas himself lady will safely restore thee to thy native land for never did his sword do an injury for which he was not willing to make amends with the same weapon and if sir john de walton will make the slightest admission that he renounces maintaining the present strife were it only by yielding up a feather from the plume of his helmet douglas will renounce every purpose on his part which can touch the ladys honour or safety and the combat may be suspended until the national quarrel again brings us together sir john de walton pondered a moment and the lady although she did not speak looked at him with eyes which plainly expressed how much she wished that he would choose the less hazardous alternative but the knights own scruples prevented his bringing the case to so favourable an arbitrement never shall it be said of sir john de walton he replied that he compromised in the slightest degree his own honour or that of his country this battle may end in my defeat or rather death and in that case my earthly prospects are closed and i resign to douglas with my last breath the charge of the lady augusta trusting that he will defend her with his life and find the means of replacing her with safety in the halls of her fathers but while i survive she may have a better but will not need another protector than he who is honoured by being her own choice nor will i yield up were it a plume from my helmet implying that i have maintained an unjust quarrel either in the cause of england or of the fairest of her daughters thus far alone i will concede to douglas an instant truce provided the lady shall not be interrupted in her retreat to england and the combat be fought out upon another day the castle and territory of douglas is the property of edward of england the governor in his name is the rightful governor and on this point i will fight while my eyelids are unclosed time flies said douglas without waiting for our resolves nor is there any part of his motions of such value as that which is passing with every breath of vital air which we presently draw why should we adjourn till tomorrow that which can be as well finished today will our swords be sharper or our arms stronger to wield them than they are at this moment douglas will do all which knight can do to succour a lady in distress but he will not grant to her knight the slightest mark of deference which sir john de walton vainly supposes himself able to extort by force of arms with these words the knights engaged once more in mortal combat and the lady felt uncertain whether she should attempt her escape through the devious paths of the wood or abide the issue of this obstinate fight it was rather her desire to see the fate of sir john de walton than any other consideration which induced her to remain as if fascinated upon the spot where one of the fiercest quarrels ever fought was disputed by two of the bravest champions that ever drew sword at last the lady attempted to put a stop to the combat by appealing to the bells which began to ring for the service of the day which was palm sunday for heavens sake she said for your own sakes and for that of ladys love and the duties of chivalry hold your hands only for an hour and take chance that where strength is so equal means will be found of converting the truce into a solid peace think this is palm sunday and will you defile with blood such a peculiar festival of christianity intermit your feud at least so far as to pass to the nearest church bearing with you branches not in the ostentatious mode of earthly conquerors but as rendering due homage to the rules of the blessed church and the institutions of our holy religion i was on my road fair lady for that purpose to the holy church of douglas said the englishman when i was so fortunate as to meet you at this place nor do i object to proceed thither even now holding truce for an hour and i fear not to find there friends to whom i can commit you with assurance of safety in case i am unfortunate in the combat which is now broken off to be resumed after the service of the day i also assent said the douglas to a truce for such short space nor do i fear that there may be good christians enough at the church who will not see their master overpowered by odds let us go thither and each take the chance of what heaven shall please to send us from these words sir john de walton little doubted that douglas had assured himself of a party among those who should there assemble but he doubted not of so many of the garrison being present as would bridle every attempt at rising and the risk he thought was worth incurring since ha should thereby secure an opportunity to place lady augusta de berkely in safety at least so far as to make her liberty depend on the event of a general conflict instead of the precarious issue of a combat between himself and douglas both these distinguished knights were inwardly of opinion that the proposal of the lady though it relieved them from their present conflict by no means bound them to abstain from the consequences which an accession of force might add to their general strength and each relied upon his superiority in some degree provided for by their previous proceedings sir john de walton made almost certain of meeting with several of his bands of soldiers who were scouring the country and traversing the woods by his direction and douglas it may be supposed had not ventured himself in person where a price was set upon his head without being attended by a sufficient number of approved adherents placed in more or less connexion with each other and stationed for mutual support each therefore entertained well grounded hopes that by adopting the truce proposed he would ensure himself an advantage over his antagonist although neither exactly knew in what manner or to what extent this success was to be obtained chapter the eighteenth his talk was of another world his bodiments strange doubtful and mysterious those who heard him listend as to a man in feverish dreams who speaks of other objects than the present and mutters like to him who sees a vision old play on the same palm sunday when de walton and douglas measured together their mighty swords the minstrel bertram was busied with the ancient book of prophecies which we have already mentioned as the supposed composition of thomas the rhymer but not without many anxieties as to the fate of his lady and the events which were passing around him as a minstrel he was desirous of an auditor to enter into the discoveries which he should make in that mystic volume as well as to assist in passing away the time sir john de walton had furnished him in gilbert greenleaf the archer with one who was well contented to play the listener from morn to dewy eve provided a flask of gascon wine or a stoup of good english ale remained on the board it may be remembered that de walton when he dismissed the minstrel from the dungeon was sensible that he owed him some compensation for the causeless suspicion which had dictated his imprisonment more particularly as he was a valued servant and had shown himself the faithful confidant of the lady augusta de berkely and the person who was moreover likely to know all the motives and circumstances of her scottish journey to secure his good wishes was therefore politic and de walton had intimated to his faithful archer that he was to lay aside all suspicion of bertram but at the same time keep him in sight and if possible in good humour with the governor of the castle and his adherents greenleaf accordingly had no doubt in his own mind that the only way to please a minstrel was to listen with patience and commendation to the lays which he liked best to sing or the tales which he most loved to tell and in order to ensure the execution of his masters commands he judged it necessary to demand of the butler such store of good liquor as could not fail to enhance the pleasure of his society having thus fortified himself with the means of bearing a long interview with the minstrel gilbert greenleaf proposed to confer upon him the bounty of an early breakfast which if it pleased him they might wash down with a cup of sack and having his masters commands to show the minstrel any thing about the castle which he might wish to see refresh their overwearied spirits by attending a part of the garrison of douglas to the service of the day which as we have already seen was of peculiar sanctity against such a proposal the minstrel a good christian by profession and by his connexion with the joyous science a good fellow having no objections to offer the two comrades who had formerly little goodwill towards each other commenced their mornings repast on that fated palm sunday with all manner of cordiality and good fellowship do not believe worthy minstrel said the archer that my master in any respect disparages your worth or rank in referring you for company or conversation to so poor a man as myself it is true i am no officer of this garrison yet for an old archer who for these thirty years has lived by bow and bowstring i do not our lady make me thankful hold less share in the grace of sir john de walton the earl of pembroke and other approved good soldiers than many of those giddy young men on whom commissions are conferred and to whom confidences are intrusted not on account of what they have done but what their ancestors have done before them i pray you to notice among them one youth placed at our head in de waltons absence and who bears the honoured name of aymer de valence being the same with that of the earl of pembroke of whom i have spoken this knight has also a brisk young page whom men call fabian harbothel is it to these gentlemen that your censure applies answered the minstrel i should have judged differently having never in the course of my experience seen a young man more courteous and amiable than the young knight you named i nothing dispute that it may be so said the archer hastening to amend the false step which he had made but in order that it should be so it will be necessary that he conform to the usages of his uncle taking the advice of experienced old soldiers in the emergencies which may present themselves and not believing that the knowledge which it takes many years of observation to acquire can be at once conferred by the slap of the flat of a sword and the magic words rise up sir arthur or however the case may be doubt not sir archer replied bertram that i am fully aware of the advantage to be derived from conversing with men of experience like you it benefiteth men of every persuasion and i myself am oft reduced to lament my want of sufficient knowledge of armorial bearings signs and cognizances and would right fain have thy assistance where i am a stranger alike to the names of places of persons and description of banners and emblems by which great families are distinguished from each other so absolutely necessary to the accomplishment of my present task pennons and banners answered the archer i have seen right many and can assign as is a soldiers wont the name of the leader to the emblem under which he musters his followers nevertheless worthy minstrel i cannot presume to understand what you call prophecies with or under warranted authority of old painted books expositions of dreams oracles revelations invocations of damned spirits judicials astrologicals and other gross and palpable offences whereby men pretending to have the assistance of the devil do impose upon the common people in spite of the warnings of the privy council not however that i suspect you worthy minstrel of busying yourself with these attempts to explain futurity which are dangerous attempts and may be truly said to be penal and part of treason there is something in what you say replied the minstrel yet it applieth not to books and manuscripts such as i have been consulting part of which things therein written having already come to pass authorize us surely to expect the completion of the rest nor would i have much difficulty in showing you from this volume that enough has been already proved true to entitle us to look with certainty to the accomplishment of that which remains i should be glad to hear that answered the archer who entertained little more than a soldiers belief respecting prophecies and auguries but yet cared not bluntly to contradict the minstrel upon such subjects as he had been instructed by sir john de walton to comply with his humour accordingly the minstrel began to recite verses which in our time the ablest interpreter could not make sense out of when the cook crows keep well his comb for the fox and the fulmart they are false both when the raven and the rook have rounded together and the kid in his cliff shall accord to the same then shall they be bold and soon to battle thereafter then the birds of the raven rugs and reives and the leal men of lothian are louping on their horse then shall the poor people be spoiled full near and the abbeys be burnt truly that stand upon tweed they shall burn and slay and great reif make there shall no poor man who say whose man he is then shall the land be lawless for love there is none then falset shall have foot fully five years then truth surely shall be tint and none shall lippen to other the one cousing shall not trust the other not the son the father nor the father the son for to have his goods he would have him hanged c c c the archer listened to these mystic prognostications which were not the less wearisome that they were in a considerable degree unintelligible at the same time subduing his hotspurlike disposition to tire of the recitation yet at brief intervals comforting himself with an application to the wine flagon and enduring as he might what he neither understood nor took interest in meanwhile the minstrel proceeded with his explanation of the dubious and imperfect vaticinations of which we have given a sufficient specimen could you wish said he to greenleaf a more exact description of the miseries which have passed over scotland in these latter days have not these the raven and rook the fox and the fulmart explained either because the nature of the birds or beasts bear an individual resemblance to those of the knights who display them on their banners or otherwise are bodied forth by actual blazonry on their shields and come openly into the field to ravage and destroy is not the total disunion of the land plainly indicated by these words that connexions of blood shall be broken asunder that kinsmen shall not trust each other and that the father and son instead of putting faith in their natural connexion shall seek each others life in order to enjoy his inheritance the leal men of lothian are distinctly mentioned as taking arms and there is plainly allusion to the other events of these late scottish troubles the death of this last william is obscurely intimated under the type of a hound which was that good lords occasional cognizance the hound that was harmd then muzzled shall be who loved him worst shall weep for his wreck yet shall a whelp rise of the same race that rudely shall roar and rule the whole north and quit the whole quarrel of old deeds done though he from his hold be kept back awhile true thomas told me this in a troublesome time in a harvest morning at eldoun hills this hath a meaning sir archer continued the minstrel and which flies as directly to its mark as one of your own arrows although there may be some want of wisdom in making the direct explication being however upon assurance with you i do not hesitate to tell you that in my opinion this lions whelp that awaits its time means this same celebrated scottish prince robert the bruce who though repeatedly defeated has still while hunted with bloodhounds and surrounded by enemies of every sort maintained his pretensions to the crown of scotland in despite of king edward now reigning minstrel answered the soldier you are my guest and we have sat down together as friends to this simple meal in good comradeship i must tell thee however though i am loath to disturb our harmony that thou art the first who hast adventured to speak a word before gilbert greenleaf in favour of that outlawed traitor robert bruce who has by his seditions so long disturbed the peace of this realm take my advice and be silent on this topic for believe me the sword of a true english archer will spring from its scabbard without consent of its master should it hear aught said to the disparagement of bonny st george and his ruddy cross nor shall the authority of thomas the rhymer or any other prophet in scotland england or wales be considered as an apology for such unbecoming predictions i were loth to give offence at any time said the minstrel much more to provoke you to anger when i am in the very act of experiencing your hospitality i trust however you will remember that i do not come your uninvited guest and that if i speak to you of future events i do so without having the least intention to add my endeavour to bring them to pass for god knows it is many years since my sincere prayer has been for peace and happiness to all men and particularly honour and happiness to the land of bowmen in which i was born and which i am bound to remember in my prayers beyond all other nations in the world it is well that you do so said the archer for so you shall best maintain your bounden duty to the fair land of your birth which is the richest that the sun shines upon something however i would know if it suits with your pleasure to tell me and that is whether you find anything in these rude rhymes appearing to affect the safety of the castle of douglas where we now are for mark me sir minstrel i have observed that these mouldering parchments when or by whomsoever composed have so far a certain coincidence with the truth that when such predictions which they contain are spread abroad in the country and create rumours of plots conspiracies and bloody wars they are very apt to cause the very mischances which they would be thought only to predict it were not very cautious in me said the minstrel to choose a prophecy for my theme which had reference to any attack on this garrison for in such case i should according to your ideas lay myself under suspicion of endeavouring to forward what no person could more heartily regret than myself take my word for it good friend said the archer that it shall not be thus with thee for i neither will myself conceive ill of thee nor report thee to sir john de walton as meditating harm against him or his garrison nor to speak truth would sir john de walton be willing to believe anyone who did he thinks highly and no doubt deservedly of thy good faith towards thy lady and would conceive it unjust to suspect the fidelity of one who has given evidence of his willingness to meet death rather than betray the least secret of his mistress in preserving her secret said bertram i only discharged the duty of a faithful servant leaving it to her to judge how long such a secret ought to be preserved for a faithful servant ought to think as little of the issue towards himself of the commission which he bears as the band of flock silk concerns itself with the secret of the letter which it secures and touching your question i have no objections although merely to satisfy your curiosity to unfold to you that these old prophecies do contain some intimations of wars befalling in douglas dale between an haggard or wild hawk which i take to be the cognizance of sir john de walton and the three stars or martlets which is the cognizance of the douglas and more particulars i could tell of these onslaughts did i know whereabouts is a place in these woods termed bloody sykes the scene also as i comprehend of slaughter and death between the followers of the three stars and those who hold the part of the saxon or king of england such a place replied gilbert greenleaf i have heard often mentioned by that name among the natives of these parts nevertheless it is vain to seek to discover the precise spot as these wily scots conceal from us with care every thing respecting the geography of their country as it is called by learned men but we may here mention the bloody sykes bottomless myre and other places as portentous names to which their traditions attach some signification of war and slaughter if it suits your wish however we can on our way to the church try to find this place called bloody sykes which i doubt not we shall trace out long before the traitors who meditate an attack upon us will find a power sufficient for the attempt accordingly the minstrel and archer the latter of whom was by this time reasonably well refreshed with wine marched out of the castle of douglas without waiting for others of the garrison resolving to seek the dingle bearing the ominous name of bloody sykes concerning which the archer only knew that by mere accident he had heard of a place bearing such a name at the hunting match made under the auspices of sir john de walton and knew that it lay in the woods somewhere near the town of douglas and in the vicinage of the castle chapter the nineteenth hotspur i cannot choose sometimes he angers me with telling me of the moldwarp and the ant of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies and of a dragon and a finless fish a cliptwingd griffin and a moulten raven a couching lion and a ramping cat and such a deal of skimbleskamble stuff as puts me from my faith king henry iv the conversation between the minstrel and the ancient archer naturally pursued a train somewhat resembling that of hotspur and glendower in which gilbert greenleaf by degrees took a larger share than was apparently consistent with his habits and education but the truth was that as he exerted himself to recall the recognisances of military chieftains their warcries emblems and other types by which they distinguished themselves in battle and might undoubtedly be indicated in prophetic rhymes he began to experience the pleasure which most men entertain when they find themselves unexpectedly possessed of a faculty which the moment calls upon them to employ and renders them important in the possession of the minstrels sound good sense was certainly somewhat surprised at the inconsistencies sometimes displayed by his companion as he was carried off by the willingness to make show of his newlydiscovered faculty on the one hand and on the other to call to mind the prejudices which he had nourished during his whole life against minstrels who with the train of legends and fables were the more likely to be false as being generally derived from the north countrie as they strolled from one glade of the forest to another the minstrel began to be surprised at the number of scottish votaries whom they met and who seemed to be hastening to the church and as it appeared by the boughs which they carried to assist in the ceremony of the day to each of these the archer put a question respecting the existence of a place called bloody sykes and where it was to be found but all seemed either to be ignorant on the subject or desirous of evading it for which they found some pretext in the jolly archers manner of interrogation which savoured a good deal of the genial breakfast the general answer was that they knew no such place or had other matters to attend to upon the morn of a holytide than answering frivolous questions at last when in one or two instances the answer of the scottish almost approached to sullenness the minstrel remarked it observing that there was ever some mischief on foot when the people of this country could not find a civil answer to their betters which is usually so ready among them and that they appeared to be making a strong muster for the service of palm sunday you will doubtless sir archer continued the minstrel make your report to your knight accordingly for i promise you that if you do not i myself whose ladys freedom is also concerned will feel it my duty to place before sir john de walton the circumstances which make me entertain suspicion of this extraordinary confluence of scottish men and the surliness which has replaced their wonted courtesy of manners tush sir minstrel replied the archer displeased at bertrams interference believe me that armies have ere now depended on my report to the general which has always been perspicuous and clear according to the duties of war your walk my worthy friend has been in a separate department such as affairs of peace old songs prophecies and the like in which it is far from my thoughts to contend with you but credit me it will be most for the reputation of both that we do not attempt to interfere with what concerns each other it is far from my wish to do so replied the minstrel but i would wish that a speedy return should be made to the castle in order to ask sir john de waltons opinion of that which we have but just seen to this replied greenleaf there can be no objection but would you seek the governor at the hour which now is you will find him most readily by going to the church of douglas to which he regularly wends on occasions such as the present with the principal part of his officers to ensure by his presence that no tumult arise of which there is no little dread between the english and the scottish let us therefore hold to our original intention of attending the service of the day and we shall rid ourselves of these entangled woods and gain the shortest road to the church of douglas let us go then with all despatch said the minstrel and with the greater haste that it appears to me that something has passed on this very spot this morning which argues that the christian peace due to the day has not been inviolably observed what mean these drops of blood alluding to those which had flowed from the wounds of turnbull wherefore is the earth impressed with these deep tints the footsteps of armed men advancing and retreating doubtless according to the chances of a fierce and heady conflict by our lady returned greenleaf i must own that thou seest clear what were my eyes made of when they permitted thee to be the first discoverer of these signs of conflict here are feathers of a blue plume which i ought to remember seeing my knight assumed it or at least permitted me to place it in his helmet this morning in sign of returning hope from the liveliness of its colour but here it lies shorn from his head and if i may guess by no friendly hand come friend to the church to the church and thou shalt have my example of the manner in which de walton ought to be supported when in danger he led the way through the town of douglas entering at the southern gate and up the very street in which sir aymer de valence had charged the phantom knight we can now say more fully that the church of douglas had originally been a stately gothic building whose towers arising high above the walls of the town bore witness to the grandeur of its original construction it was now partly ruinous and the small portion of open space which was retained for public worship was fitted up in the family aisle where its deceased lords rested from worldly labours and the strife of war from the open ground in the front of the building their eye could pursue a considerable part of the course of the river douglas which approached the town from the southwest bordered by a line of hills fantastically diversified in their appearance and in many places covered with copsewood which descended towards the valley and formed a part of the tangled and intricate woodland by which the town was surrounded the river itself sweeping round the west side of the town and from thence northward supplied that large inundation or artificial piece of water which we have already mentioned several of the scottish people bearing willow branches or those of yew to represent the palms which were the symbol of the day seemed wandering in the churchyard as if to attend the approach of some person of peculiar sanctity or procession of monks and friars come to render the homage due to the solemnity at the moment almost that bertram and his companion entered the churchyard the lady of berkely who was in the act of following sir john de walton into the church after having witnessed his conflict with the young knight of douglas caught a glimpse of her faithful minstrel and instantly determined to regain the company of that old servant of her house and confidant of her fortunes and trust to the chance afterwards of being rejoined by sir john de walton with a sufficient party to provide for her safety which she in no respect doubted it would be his care to collect she darted away accordingly from the path in which she was advancing and reached the place where bertram with his new acquaintance greenleaf were making some enquiries of the soldiers of the english garrison whom the service of the day had brought there lady augusta berkely in the meantime had an opportunity to say privately to her faithful attendant and guide take no notice of me friend bertram but take heed if possible that we be not again separated from each other having given him this hint she observed that it was adopted by the minstrel and that he presently afterwards looked round and set his eye upon her as muffled in her pilgrims cloak she slowly withdrew to another part of the cemetery and seemed to halt until detaching himself from greenleaf he should find an opportunity of joining her nothing in truth could have more sensibly affected the faithful minstrel than the singular mode of communication which acquainted him that his mistress was safe and at liberty to choose her own motions and as he might hope disposed to extricate herself from the dangers which surrounded her in scotland by an immediate retreat to her own country and domain he would gladly have approached and joined her but she took an opportunity by a sign to caution him against doing so while at the same time he remained somewhat apprehensive of the consequences of bringing her under the notice of his new friend greenleaf who might perhaps think it proper to busy himself so as to gain some favour with the knight who was at the head of the garrison meantime the old archer continued his conversation with bertram while the minstrel like many other men similarly situated heartily wished that his wellmeaning companion had been a hundred fathoms under ground so his evanishment had given him license to join his mistress but all he had in his power was to approach her as near as he could without creating any suspicion i would pray you worthy minstrel said greenleaf after looking carefully round that we may prosecute together the theme which we were agitating before we came hither is it not your opinion that the scottish natives have fixed this very morning for some of those dangerous attempts which they have repeatedly made and which are so carefully guarded against by the governors placed in this district of douglas by our good king edward our rightful sovereign i cannot see replied the minstrel on what grounds you found such an apprehension or what you see here in the churchyard different from that you talked of as we approached it when you held me rather in scorn for giving way to some suspicions of the same kind do you not see added the archer the numbers of men with strange faces and in various disguisements who are thronging about these ancient ruins which are usually so solitary yonder for example sits a boy who seems to shun observation and whose dress i will be sworn has never been shaped in scotland and if he is an english pilgrim replied the minstrel observing that the archer pointed towards the lady of berkely he surely affords less matter of suspicion i know not that said old greenleaf but i think it will bo my duty to inform sir john de walton if i can reach him that there are many persons here who in outward appearance neither belong to the garrison nor to this part of the country consider said bertram before you harass with accusation a poor young man and subject him to the consequences which must necessarily attend upon suspicions of this nature how many circumstances call forth men peculiarly to devotion at this period not only is this the time of the triumphal entrance of the founder of the christian religion into jerusalem but the day itself is called dominica confitentium or the sunday of confessors and the palmtree or the box and yew which are used as its substitutes and which are distributed to the priests are burnt solemnly to ashes and those ashes distributed among the pious by the priests upon the ashwednesday of the succeeding year all which rites and ceremonies in our country are observed by order of the christian church nor ought you gentle archer nor can you without a crime persecute those as guilty of designs upon your garrison who can ascribe their presence here to their desire to discharge the duties of the day and look ye at yon numerous procession approaching with banner and cross and as it appears consisting of some churchman of rank and his attendants let us first enquire who he is and it is probable we shall find in his name and rank sufficient security for the peaceable and orderly behaviour of those whom piety has this day assembled at the church of douglas greenleaf accordingly made the investigation recommended by his companion and received information that the holy man who headed the procession was no other than the diocesan of the district the bishop of glasgow who had come to give his countenance to the rites with which the day was to be sanctified the prelate accordingly entered the walls of the dilapidated churchyard preceded by his crossbearers and attended by numbers with boughs of yew and other evergreens used on the festivity instead of palms among them the holy father showered his blessing accompanied by signs of the cross which were met with devout exclamations by such of the worshippers as crowded around him to thee reverend father we apply for pardon for our offences which we humbly desire to confess to thee in order that we may obtain pardon from heaven in this manner the congregation and the dignified clergyman met together exchanging pious greeting and seemingly intent upon nothing but the rites of the day the acclamations of the congregation mingled with the deep voice of the officiating priest dispensing the sacred ritual the whole forming a scene which conducted with the catholic skill and ceremonial was at once imposing and affecting the archer on seeing the zeal with which the people in the churchyard as well as a number who issued from the church hastened proudly to salute the bishop of the diocese was rather ashamed of the suspicions which he had entertained of the sincerity of the good mans purpose in coming hither taking advantage of a fit of devotion not perhaps very common with old greenleaf who at this moment thrust himself forward to share in those spiritual advantages which the prelate was dispensing bertram slipped clear of his english friend and gliding to the side of the lady augusta exchanged by the pressure of the hand a mutual congratulation upon having rejoined company on a sign by the minstrel they withdrew to the inside of the church so as to remain unobserved amidst the crowd in which they were favoured by the dark shadows of some parts of the building the body of the church broken as it was and hung round with the armorial trophies of the last lords of douglas furnished rather the appearance of a sacrilegiously desecrated ruin than the inside of a holy place yet some care appeared to have been taken to prepare it for the service of the day at the lower end hung the great escutcheon of william lord of douglas who had lately died a prisoner in england around that escutcheon were placed the smaller shields of his sixteen ancestors and a deep black shadow was diffused by the whole mass unless where relieved by the glance of the coronets or the glimmer of bearings particularly gay in emblazonry i need not say that in other respects the interior of the church was much dismantled it being the very same place in which sir aymer de valence held an interview with the old sexton and who now drawing into a separate corner some of the straggling parties whom he had collected and brought to the church kept on the alert and appeared ready for an attack as well at midday as at the witching hour of midnight this was the more necessary as the eye of sir john de walton seemed busied in searching from one place to another as if unable to find the object he was in quest of which the reader will easily understand to be the lady augusta de berkely of whom he had lost sight in the pressure of the multitude at the eastern part of the church was fitted up a temporary altar by the side of which arrayed in his robes the bishop of glasgow had taken his place with such priests and attendants as composed his episcopal retinue his suite was neither numerous nor richly attired nor did his own appearance present a splendid specimen of the wealth and dignity of the episcopal order when he laid down however his golden cross at the stern command of the king of england that of simple wood which he assumed instead thereof did not possess less authority nor command less awe among the clergy and people of the diocese the various persons natives of scotland now gathered around seemed to watch his motions as those of a descended saint and the english waited in mute astonishment apprehensive that at some unexpected signal an attack would be made upon them either by the powers of earth or heaven or perhaps by both in combination the truth is that so great was the devotion of the scottish clergy of the higher ranks to the interests of the party of bruce that the english had become jealous of permitting them to interfere even with those ceremonies of the church which were placed under their proper management and thence the presence of the bishop of glasgow officiating at a high festival in the church of douglas was a circumstance of rare occurrence and not unattended both with wonder and suspicion a council of the church however had lately called the distinguished prelates of scotland to the discharge of their duty on the festivity of palm sunday and neither english nor scottish saw the ceremony with indifference an unwonted silence which prevailed in the church filled as it appeared with persons of different views hopes wishes and expectations resembled one of those solemn pauses which often take place before a strife of the elements and are well understood to be the forerunners of some dreadful concussion of nature all animals according to their various nature express their sense of the approaching tempest the cattle the deer and other inhabitants of the walks of the forest withdraw to the inmost recesses of their pastures the sheep crowd into their fold and the dull stupor of universal nature whether animate or inanimate presages its speedily awakening into general convulsion and disturbance when the lurid lightning shall hiss at command of the diapason of the thunder it was thus that in deep suspense those who had come to the church in arms at the summons of douglas awaited and expected every moment a signal to attack while the soldiers of the english garrison aware of the evil disposition of the natives towards them were reckoning every moment when the wellknown shouts of bows and bills should give signal for a general conflict and both parties gazing fiercely upon each other seemed to expect the fatal onset notwithstanding the tempest which appeared every moment ready to burst the bishop of glasgow proceeded with the utmost solemnity to perform the ceremonies proper to the day he paused from time to time to survey the throng as if to calculate whether the turbulent passions of those around him would be so long kept under as to admit of his duties being brought to a close in a manner becoming the time and place the prelate had just concluded the service when a person advanced towards him with a solemn and mournful aspect and asked if the reverend father could devote a few moments to administer comfort to a dying man who was lying wounded close by the churchman signified a ready acquiescence amidst a stillness which when he surveyed the lowering brows of one party at least of those who were in the church boded no peaceful termination to this fated day the father motioned to the messenger to show him the way and proceeded on his mission attended by some of those who were understood to be followers of the douglas there was something peculiarly striking if not suspicious in the interview which followed in a subterranean vault was deposited the person of a large tall man whose blood flowed copiously through two or three ghastly wounds and streamed amongst the trusses of straw on which he lay while his features exhibited a mixture of sternness and ferocity which seemed prompt to kindle into a still more savage expression the reader will probably conjecture that the person in question was no other than michael turnbull who wounded in the rencounter of the morning had been left by some of his friends upon the straw which was arranged for him by way of couch to live or die as he best could the prelate on entering the vault lost no time in calling the attention of the wounded man to the state of his spiritual affairs and assisting him to such comfort as the doctrine of the church directed should be administered to departing sinners the words exchanged between them were of that grave and severe character which passes between the ghostly father and his pupil when one world is rolling away from the view of the sinner and another is displaying itself in all its terrors and thundering in the ear of the penitent that retribution which the deeds done in the flesh must needs prepare him to expect this is one of the most solemn meetings which can take place between earthly beings and the courageous character of the jedwood forester as well as the benevolent and pious expression of the old churchman considerably enhanced the pathos of the scene turnbull said the churchman i trust you will believe me when i say that it grieves my heart to see thee brought to this situation by wounds which it is my duty to tell you you must consider mortal is the chase ended then said the jedwood man with a sigh i care not good father for i think i have borne me as becomes a gallant quarry and that the old forest has lost no credit by me whether in pursuit or in bringing to bay and even in this last matter methinks this gay english knight would not have come off with such advantage had the ground on which we stood been alike indifferent to both or had i been aware of his onset but it will be seen by any one who takes the trouble to examine that poor michael turnbulls foot slipped twice in the melee otherwise it had not been his fate to be lying here in the deadthraw footnote or death agony while yonder southron would probably have died like a dog upon this bloody straw in his place the bishop replied advising his penitent to turn from vindictive thoughts respecting the death of others and endeavour to fix his attention upon his own departure from existence which seemed shortly about to take place nay replied the wounded man you father undoubtedly know best what is fit for me to do yet methinks it would not be very well with me if i had prolonged to this time of day the task of revising my life and i am not the man to deny that mine has been a bloody and a desperate one but you will grant me i never bore malice to a brave enemy for having done me an injury and show me the man being a scotchman born and having a natural love for his own country who hath not in these times rather preferred a steel cap to a hat and feather or who hath not been more conversant with drawn blades than with prayerbook and you yourself know father whether in our proceedings against the english interest we have not uniformly had the countenance of the sincere fathers of the scottish church and whether we have not been exhorted to take arms and make use of them for the honour of the king of scotland and the defence of our own rights undoubtedly said the prelate such have been our exhortations towards our oppressed countrymen nor do i now teach you a different doctrine nevertheless having now blood around me and a dying man before me i have need to pray that i have not been misled from the true path and thus become the means of misdirecting others may heaven forgive me if i have done so since i have only to plead my sincere and honest intention in excuse for the erroneous counsel which i may have given to you and others touching these wars i am conscious that encouraging you so to stain your swords in blood i have departed in some degree from the character of my profession which enjoins that we neither shed blood nor are the occasion of its being shed may heaven enable us to obey our duties and to repent of our errors especially such as have occasioned the death or distress of our fellowcreatures and above all may this dying christian become aware of his errors and repent with sincerity of having done to others that which he would not willingly have suffered at their hand for that matter answered turnbull the time has never been when i would not exchange a blow with the best man who ever lived and if i was not in constant practice of the sword it was because i have been brought up to the use of the jedwoodaxe which the english call a partisan and which makes little difference i understand from the sword and poniard the distinction is not great said the bishop but i fear my friend that life taken with what you call a jedwoodaxe gives you no privilege over him who commits the same deed and inflicts the same injury with any other weapon nay worthy father said the penitent i must own that the effect of the weapons is the same as far as concerns the man who suffers but i would pray of you information why a jedwood man ought not to use as is the custom of his country a jedwoodaxe being as is implied in the name the offensive weapon proper to his country the crime of murder said the bishop consists not in the weapon with which the crime is inflicted but in the pain which the murderer inflicts upon his fellowcreature and the breach of good order which he introduces into heavens lovely and peaceable creation and it is by turning your repentance upon this crime that you may fairly expect to propitiate heaven for your offences and at the same time to escape the consequences which are denounced in holy writ against those by whom mans blood shall be shed but good father said the wounded man you know as well as any one that in this company and in this very church there are upon the watch scores of both scotchmen and englishmen who come here not so much to discharge the religious duties of the day as literally to bereave each other of their lives and give a new example of the horror of those feuds which the two extremities of britain nourish against each other what conduct then is a poor man like me to hold am i not to raise this hand against the english which methinks i still can make a tolerably efficient one or am i for the first time in my life to hear the warcry when it is raised and hold back my sword from the slaughter methinks it will be difficult perhaps altogether impossible for me to do so but if such is the pleasure of heaven and your advice most reverend father unquestionably i must do my best to be governed by your directions as of one who has a right and title to direct us in every dilemma or case as they term it of troubled conscience unquestionably said the bishop it is my duty as i have already said to give no occasion this day for the shedding of blood or the breach of peace and i must charge you as my penitent that upon your souls safety you do not minister any occasion to affray or bloodshed either by maintaining such in your own person or inciting others to the same for by following a different course of advice i am certain that you as well as myself would act sinfully and out of character so i will endeavour to think reverend father answered the huntsman nevertheless i hope it will be remembered in my favour that i am the first person bearing the surname of turnbull together with the proper name of the prince of archangels himself who has at any time been able to sustain the affront occasioned by the presence of a southron with a drawn sword and was not thereby provoked to pluck forth his own weapon and to lay about him take care my son returned the prelate of glasgow and observe that even now thou art departing from those resolutions which but a few minutes since thou didst adopt upon serious and just consideration wherefore do not be o my son like the sow that has wallowed in the mire and having been washed repeats its act of pollution and becomes again yet fouler than it was before well reverend father replied the wounded man although it seems almost unnatural for scottishmen and english to meet and part without a buffet yet i will endeavour most faithfully not to minister any occasion of strife nor if possible to snatch at any such occasion as shall be ministered to me in doing so returned the bishop thou wilt best atone for the injury which thou hast done to the law of heaven upon former occasions and thou shalt prevent the causes for strife betwixt thee and thy brethren of the southern land and shalt eschew the temptation towards that bloodguiltiness which is so rife in this our day and generation and do not think that i am imposing upon thee by these admonitions a duty more difficult than it is in thy covenant to bear as a man and as a christian i myself am a man and a scotchman and as such i feel offended at the unjust conduct of the english towards our country and sovereign and thinking as you do yourself i know what you must suffer when you are obliged to submit to national insults unretaliated and unrevenged but let us not conceive ourselves the agents of that retributive vengeance which heaven has in a peculiar degree declared to be its own attribute let us while we see and feel the injuries inflicted on our own country not forget that our own raids ambuscades and surprisals have been at least equally fatal to the english as their attacks and forays have been to us and in short let the mutual injuries of the crosses of saint andrew and of saint george be no longer considered as hostile to the inhabitants of the opposite district at least during the festivals of religion but as they are mutually signs of redemption let them be in like manner intimations of forbearance and peace on both sides i am contented answered turnbull to abstain from all offences towards others and shall even endeavour to keep myself from resenting those of others towards me in the hope of bringing to pass such a quiet and godly state of things as your words reverend father induce me to expect turning his face to the wall the borderer lay in stern expectation of approaching death which the bishop left him to contemplate the peaceful disposition which the prelate had inspired into michael turnbull had in some degree diffused itself among those present who heard with awe the spiritual admonition to suspend the national antipathy and remain in truce and amity with each other heaven had however decreed that the national quarrel in which so much blood had been sacrificed should that day again be the occasion of deadly strife a loud flourish of trumpets seeming to proceed from beneath the earth now rung through the church and roused the attention of the soldiers and worshippers then assembled most of those who heard these warlike sounds betook themselves to their weapons as if they considered it useless to wait any longer for the signal of conflict hoarse voices rude exclamations the rattle of swords against their sheaths or their clashing against other pieces of armour gave an awful presage of an onset which however was for a time averted by the exhortations of the bishop a second flourish of trumpets having taken place the voice of a herald made proclamation to the following purpose that whereas there were many noble pursuivants of chivalry presently assembled in the kirk of douglas and whereas there existed among them the usual causes of quarrel and points of debate for their advancement in chivalry therefore the scottish knights were ready to fight any number of the english who might be agreed either upon the superior beauty of their ladies or upon the national quarrel in any of its branches or upon whatever point might be at issue between them which should be deemed satisfactory ground of quarrel by both and the knights who should chance to be worsted in such dispute should renounce the prosecution thereof or the bearing arms therein thereafter with such other conditions to ensue upon their defeat as might be agreed upon by a council of the knights present at the kirk of douglas aforesaid but foremost of all any number of scottish knights from one to twenty will defend the quarrel which has already drawn blood touching the freedom of lady augusta de berkely and the rendition of douglas castle to the owner here present wherefore it is required that the english knights do intimate their consent that such trial of valour take place which according to the rules of chivalry they cannot refuse without losing utterly the reputation of valour and incurring the diminution of such other degree of estimation as a courageous pursuivant of arms would willingly be held in both by the good knights of his own country and those of others this unexpected gage of battle realized the worst fears of those who had looked with suspicion on the extraordinary assemblage this day of the dependents of the house of douglas after a short pause the trumpets again flourished lustily when the reply of the english knights was made in the following terms that god forbid the rights and privileges of englands knights and the beauty of her damsels should not be asserted by her children or that such english knights as were here assembled should show the least backwardness to accept the combat offered whether grounded upon the superior beauty of their ladies or whether upon the causes of dispute between the countries for either or all of which the knights of england here present were willing to do battle in the terms of the indenture aforesaid while sword and lance shall endure saving and excepting the surrender of the castle of douglas which can be rendered to no one but englands king or those acting under his orders chapter the twentieth cry the wild warnote let the champions pass do bravely each and god defend the right upon saint andrew thrice can they thus cry and thrice they shout on height and then marked them on the englishmen as i have told you right saint george the bright our ladies knight to name they were full fain our englishmen they cried on height and thrice they shout again old ballad the extraordinary crisis mentioned in the preceding chapter was the cause as may be supposed of the leaders on both sides now throwing aside all concealment and displaying their utmost strength by marshalling their respective adherents the renowned knight of douglas with sir malcolm fleming and other distinguished cavaliers were seen in close consultation sir john de walton startled by the first flourish of trumpets while anxiously endeavouring to secure a retreat for the lady augusta was in a moment seen collecting his followers in which he was assisted by the active friendship of the knight of valence the lady of berkely showed no craven spirit at these warlike preparations she advanced closely followed by the faithful bertram and a female in a ridinghood whose face though carefully concealed was no other than that of the unfortunate margaret de hautlieu whose worst fears had been realized as to the faithlessness of her betrothed knight a pause ensued which for some time no one present thought himself of authority sufficient to break at last the knight of douglas stepped forward and said loudly i wait to know whether sir john de walton requests leave of james of douglas to evacuate his castle without further wasting that daylight which might show us to judge a fair field and whether he craves douglass protection in doing so the knight of walton drew his sword i hold the castle of douglas he said in spite of all deadly and never will i ask the protection from any one which my own sword is competent to afford me i stand by you sir john said aymer de valence as your true comrade against whatever odds may oppose themselves to us courage noble english said the voice of greenleaf take your weapons in gods name bows and bills bows and bills a messenger brings us notice that pembroke is in full march hither from the borders of ayrshire and will be with us in half an hour fight on gallant english valence to the rescue and long life to the gallant earl of pembroke those english within and around the church no longer delayed to take arms and de walton crying out at the height of his voice i implore the douglas to look nearly to the safety of the ladies fought his way to the church door the scottish finding themselves unable to resist the impression of terror which affected them at the sight of this renowned knight seconded by his brotherinarms both of whom had been so long the terror of the district in the meantime it is possible that de walton might altogether have forced his way out of the church had he not been met boldly by the young son of thomas dickson of hazelside while his father was receiving from douglas the charge of preserving the stranger ladies from all harm from the fight which so long suspended was now on the point of taking place de walton cast his eye upon the lady augusta with a desire of rushing to the rescue but was forced to conclude that he provided best for her safety by leaving her under the protection of douglass honour young dickson in the meantime heaped blow on blow seconding with all his juvenile courage every effort he could make in order to attain the prize due to the conqueror of the renowned de walton silly boy at length said sir john who had for some time forborne the stripling take then thy death from a noble hand since thou preferrest that to peace and length of days i care not said the scottish youth with his dying breath i have lived long enough since i have kept you so long in the place where you now stand and the youth said truly for as he fell never again to rise the douglas stood in his place and without a word spoken again engaged with de walton in the same formidable single combat by which they had already been distinguished but with even additional fury aymer de valence drew up to his friend de waltons left hand and seemed but to desire the apology of one of douglass people attempting to second him to join in the fray but as he saw no person who seemed disposed to give him such opportunity he repressed the inclination and remained an unwilling spectator at length it seemed as if fleming who stood foremost among the scottish knights was desirous to measure his sword with de valence aymer himself burning with the desire of combat at last called out faithless knight of boghall step forth and defend yourself against the imputation of having deserted your ladylove and of being a mansworn disgrace to the rolls of chivalry my answer said fleming even to a less gross taunt hangs by my side in an instant his sword was in his hand and even the practised warriors who looked on felt difficulty in discovering the progress of the strife which rather resembled a thunder storm in a mountainous country than the stroke and parry of two swords offending on the one side and keeping the defensive on the other their blows were exchanged with surprising rapidity and although the two combatants did not equal douglas and de walton in maintaining a certain degree of reserve founded upon a respect which these knights mutually entertained for each other yet the want of art was supplied by a degree of fury which gave chance at least an equal share in the issue seeing their superiors thus desperately engaged the partisans as they were accustomed stood still on either side and looked on with the reverence which they instinctively paid to their commanders and leaders in arms one or two of the women were in the meanwhile attracted according to the nature of the sex by compassion for those who had already experienced the casualties of war young dickson breathing his last among the feet of the combatants footnote the fall of this brave stripling by the hand of the english governor and the stern heroism of the father in turning from the spot where he lay a model of beauty and strength that he might not be withdrawn from the duty which douglas had assigned him of protecting the lady of berkely excites an interest for both with which it is almost to be regretted that history interferes it was the old man thomas dickson not his son who fell the slogan a douglas a douglas having been prematurely raised dickson who was within the church thinking that his young lord with his armed band was at hand drew his sword and with only one man to assist him opposed the english who now rushed to the door cut across the middle by an english sword he still continued his opposition till he fell lifeless at the threshold such is tradition and it is supported by a memorial of some authority a tombstone still to be seen in the churchyard of douglas on winch is sculptured a figure of dickson supporting with his left arm his protruding entrails and raising his sword with the other in the attitude of combat note by the rev mr stewart of douglas was in some sort rescued from the tumult by the lady of berkely in whom the action seemed less strange owing to the pilgrims dress which she still retained and who in vain endeavoured to solicit the attention of the boys father to the task in which she was engaged cumber yourself not lady about that which is bootless said old dickson and distract not your own attention and mine from preserving you whom it is the douglass wish to rescue and whom so please god and st bride i consider as placed by my chieftain under my charge believe me this youths death is in no way forgotten though this be not the time to remember it a time will come for recollection and an hour for revenge so said the stern old man reverting his eyes from the bloody corpse which lay at his feet a model of beauty and strength having taken one more anxious look he turned round and placed himself where he could best protect the lady of berkely not again turning his eyes on his sons body in the interim the combat continued without the least cessation on either side and without a decided advantage at length however fate seemed disposed to interfere the knight of fleming pushing fiercely forward and brought by chance almost close to the person of the lady margaret de hautlieu missed his blow and his foot sliding in the blood of the young victim dickson he fell before his antagonist and was in imminent danger of being at his mercy when margaret de hautlieu who inherited the soul of a warrior and besides was a very strong as well as an undaunted person seeing a mace of no great weight lying on the floor where it had been dropped by the fallen dickson it at the same instant caught her eye armed her hand and intercepted or struck down the sword of sir aymer de valence who would otherwise have remained the master of the day at that interesting moment fleming had more to do to avail himself of an unexpected chance of recovery than to make a commentary upon the manner in which it had been so singularly brought about he instantly recovered the advantage he had lost and was able in the ensuing close to trip up the feet of his antagonist who fell on the pavement while the voice of his conqueror if he could properly be termed such resounded through the church with the fatal words yield thee aymer de valence rescue or no rescue yield thee yield ye he added as he placed his sword to the throat of the fallen knight not to me but to this noble lady rescue or no rescue with a heavy heart the english knight perceived that he had lost so favourable an opportunity of acquiring fame and was obliged to submit to his destiny or be slain upon the spot there was only one consolation that no battle was ever more honourably sustained being gained as much by accident as by valour the fate of the protracted and desperate combat between douglas and de walton did not much longer remain in suspense indeed the number of conquests in single combat achieved by the douglas in these wars was so great as to make it doubtful whether he was not in personal strength and skill even a superior knight to bruce himself and he was at least acknowledged nearly his equal in the art of war so however it was that when three quarters of an hour had passed in hard contest douglas and de walton whose nerves were not actually of iron began to show some signs that their human bodies were feeling the effect of the dreadful exertion their blows began to be drawn more slowly and were parried with less celerity douglas seeing that the combat must soon come to an end generously made a signal intimating to his antagonist to hold his hand for an instant brave de walton he said there is no mortal quarrel between us and you must be sensible that in this passage of arms douglas though he is only worth his sword and his cloak has abstained from taking a decisive advantage when the chance of arms has more than once offered it my fathers house the broad domains around it the dwelling and the graves of my ancestors form a reasonable reward for a knight to fight for and call upon me in an imperative voice the prosecute to strife which has such an object while you are as welcome to the noble lady in all honour and safety as if you had received her from the hands of king edward himself and i give you my word that the utmost honours which can attend a prisoner and a careful absence of every thing like injury or insult shall attend de walton when he yields up the castle as well as his sword to james of douglas it is the fate to which i am perhaps doomed replied sir john de walton but never will i voluntarily embrace it and never shall it be said that my own tongue saving in the last extremity pronounced upon me the fatal sentence to sink the point of my own sword pembroke is upon the march with his whole army to rescue the garrison of douglas i hear the tramp of his horses feet even now and i will maintain my ground while i am within reach of support nor do i fear that the breath which now begins to fail will not last long enough to uphold the struggle till the arrival of the expected succour come on then and treat me not as a child but as one who whether i stand or fall fears not to encounter the utmost force of my knightly antagonist so be it then said douglas a darksome hue like the lurid colour of the thundercloud changing his brow as he spoke intimating that he meditated a speedy end to the contest when just as the noise of horses feet drew nigh a welsh knight known as such by the diminutive size of his steed his naked limbs and his bloody spear called out loudly to the combatants to hold their hands is pembroke near said de walton no nearer than loudon hill said the prestantin but i bring his commands to john de walton i stand ready to obey them through every danger answered the knight woe is me said the welshman that my mouth should bring to the ears of so brave a man tidings so unwelcome the earl of pembroke yesterday received information that the castle of douglas was attacked by the son of the deceased earl and the whole inhabitants of the district pembroke on hearing this resolved to march to your support noble knight with all the forces he had at his disposal he did so and accordingly entertained every assurance of relieving the castle when unexpectedly he met on loudon hill a body of men of no very inferior force to his own and having at their head that famous bruce whom the scottish rebels acknowledge as their king he marched instantly to the attack swearing he would not even draw a comb through his grey beard until he had rid england of his recurring plague but the fate of war was against us he stopt here for lack of breath i thought so exclaimed douglas robert bruce will now sleep at night since he has paid home pembroke for the slaughter of his friends and the dispersion of his army at methuen wood his men are indeed accustomed to meet with dangers and to conquer them those who follow him have been trained under wallace besides being partakers of the perils of bruce himself it was thought that the waves had swallowed them when they shipped themselves from the west but know that the bruce was determined with the present reviving spring to awaken his pretensions and that he retires not from scotland again while he lives and while a single lord remains to set his foot by his sovereign in spite of all the power which has been so feloniously employed against him it is even too true said the welshman meredith although it is said by a proud scotchman the earl of pembroke completely defeated is unable to stir from ayr towards which he has retreated with great loss and he sends his instructions to sir john de walton to make the best terms he can for the surrender of the castle of douglas and trust nothing to his support the scottish who heard this unexpected news joined in a shout so loud and energetic that the ruins of the ancient church seemed actually to rock and threaten to fall on the heads of those who were crowded within it the brow of de walton was overclouded at the news of pembrokes defeat although in some respects it placed him at liberty to take measures for the safety of the lady of berkely he could not however claim the same honourable terms which had been offered to him by douglas before the news of the battle of loudon hill had arrived noble knight he said it is entirely at your pleasure to dictate the terms of surrender of your paternal castle nor have i a right to claim from you those conditions which a little while since your generosity put in my offer but i submit to my fate and upon whatever terms you think fit to grant me i must be content to offer to surrender to you the weapon of which i now put the point in the earth in evidence that i will never more direct it against you until a fair ransom shall place it once more at my own disposal god forbid answered the noble james of douglas that i should take such advantage of the bravest knight out of not a few who have found me work in battle i will take example from the knight of fleming who has gallantly bestowed his captive in guerdon upon a noble damsel here present and in like manner i transfer my claim upon the person of the redoubted knight of walton to the high and noble lady augusta berkely who i hope will not scorn to accept from the douglas a gift which the chance of war has thrown into his hands sir john de walton on hearing this unexpected decision looked up like the traveller who discovers the beams of the sun breaking through and dispersing the tempest which has accompanied him for a whole morning the lady of berkely recollected what became her rank and showed her sense of the douglass chivalry hastily wiping off the tears which had unwillingly flowed to her eyes while her lovers safety and her own were resting on the precarious issue of a desperate combat she assumed the look proper to a heroine of that age who did not feel averse to accept the importance which was conceded to her by the general voice of the chivalry of the period stepping forward bearing her person gracefully yet modestly in the attitude of a lady accustomed to be looked to in difficulties like the present she addressed the audience in a tone which might not have misbecome the goddess of battle dispersing her influence at the close of a field covered with the dead and the dying the noble douglas she said shall not pass without a prize from the field which he has so nobly won this rich string of brilliants which my ancestor won from the sultan of trebisond itself a prize of battle will be honoured by sustaining under the douglass armour a lock of hair of the fortunate lady whom the victorious lord has adopted for his guide in chivalry and if the douglas till he shall adorn it with that lock will permit the honoured lock of hair which it now bears to retain its station she on whose head it grew will hold it as a signal that poor augusta de berkely is pardoned for having gaged any mortal man in strife with the knight of douglas womans love replied the douglas shall not divorce this locket from my bosom which i will keep till the last day of my life as emblematic of female worth and female virtue and not to encroach upon the valued and honoured province of sir john de walton be it known to all men that whoever shall say that the lady augusta of berkely has in this entangled matter acted otherwise than becomes the noblest of her sex he will do well to be ready to maintain such a proposition with his lance against james of douglas in a fair field this speech was heard with approbation on all sides and the news brought by meredith of the defeat of the earl of pembroke and his subsequent retreat reconciled the fiercest of the english soldiers to the surrender of douglas castle the necessary conditions were speedily agreed on which put the scottish in possession of this stronghold together with the stores both of arms and ammunition of every kind which it contained the garrison had it to boast that they obtained a free passage with their horses and arms to return by the shortest and safest route to the marches of england without either suffering or inflicting damage margaret of hautlieu was not behind in acting a generous part the gallant knight of valence was allowed to accompany his friend de walton and the lady augusta to england and without ransom the venerable prelate of glasgow seeing what appeared at one time likely to end in a general conflict terminate so auspiciously for his country contented himself with bestowing his blessing on the assembled multitude and retiring with those who came to assist in the service of the day this surrender of douglas castle upon the palm sunday of th march was the beginning of a career of conquest which was uninterrupted in which the greater part of the strengths and fortresses of scotland were yielded to those who asserted the liberty of their country until the crowning mercy was gained in the celebrated field of bannockburn where the english sustained a defeat more disastrous than is mentioned upon any other occasion in their annals little need be said of the fate of the persons of this story king edward was greatly enraged at sir john de walton for having surrendered the castle of douglas securing at the same time his own object the envied hand of the heiress of berkely the knights to whom he referred the matter as a subject of enquiry gave it nevertheless as their opinion that de walton was void of all censure having discharged his duty in its fullest extent till the commands of his superior officer obliged him to surrender tho dangerous castle a singular renewal of intercourse took place many months afterwards between margaret of hautlieu and her lover sir malcolm fleming the use which the lady made of her freedom and of the doom of the scottish parliament which put her in possession of her fathers inheritance was to follow her adventurous spirit through dangers not usually encountered by those of her sex and the lady of hautlieu was not only a daring follower of the chase but it was said that she was even not daunted in the battlefield she remained faithful to the political principles which she had adopted at an early period and it seemed as if she had formed the gallant resolution of shaking the god cupid from her horses mane if not treading him beneath her horses feet the fleming although he had vanished from the neighbourhood of the counties of lanark and ayr made an attempt to state his apology to the lady de hautlieu herself who returned his letter unopened and remained to all appearance resolved never again to enter upon the topic of their original engagement it chanced however at a later period of the war with england while fleming was one night travelling upon the border after the ordinary fashion of one who sought adventures a waitingmaid equipped in a fantastic habit asked the protection of his arm in the name of her lady who late in the evening had been made captive she said by certain illdisposed caitiffs who were carrying her by force through the forest the flemings lance was of course in its rest and woe betide the faitour whose lot it was to encounter its thrust the first fell incapable of further combat and another of the felons encountered the same fate with little more resistance the lady released from the discourteous cord which restrained her liberty did not hesitate to join company with the brave knight by whom she had been rescued and although the darkness did not permit her to recognise her old lover in her liberator yet she could not but lend a willing ear to the conversation with which he entertained her as they proceeded on the way he spoke of the fallen caitiffs as being englishmen who found a pleasure in exercising oppression and barbarities upon the wandering damsels of scotland and whose cause therefore the champions of that country were bound to avenge while the blood throbbed in their veins he spoke of the injustice of the national quarrel which had afforded a pretence for such deliberate oppression and the lady who herself had suffered so much by the interference of the english in the affairs of scotland readily acquiesced in the sentiments which he expressed on a subject which she had so much reason for regarding as an afflicting one her answer was given in the spirit of a person who would not hesitate if the times should call for such an example to defend even with her hand the rights which she asserted with her tongue pleased with the sentiments which she expressed and recognising in her voice that secret charm which once impressed upon the human heart is rarely wrought out of the remembrance by a long train of subsequent events he almost persuaded himself that the tones were familiar to him and had at one time formed the key to his innermost affections in proceeding on their journey the knights troubled state of mind was augmented instead of being diminished the scenes of his earliest youth were recalled by circumstances so slight as would in ordinary cases have produced no effect whatever the sentiments appeared similar to those which his life had been devoted to enforce and he half persuaded himself that the dawn of day was to be to him the beginning of a fortune equally singular and extraordinary in the midst of this anxiety sir malcolm fleming had no anticipation that the lady whom he had heretofore rejected was again thrown into his path after years of absence still less when daylight gave him a partial view of his fair companions countenance was he prepared to believe that he was once again to term himself the champion of margaret de hautlieu but it was so the lady on that direful morning when she retired from the church of douglas had not resolved indeed what lady ever did to renounce without some struggle the beauties which she had once possessed a long process of time employed under skilful hands had succeeded in obliterating the scars which remained as the marks of her fall these were now considerably effaced and the lost organ of sight no longer appeared so great a blemish concealed as it was by a black ribbon and the arts of the tirewoman who made it her business to shadow it over by a lock of hair in a word he saw the same margaret de hautlieu with no very different style of expression from that which her face partaking of the high and passionate character of her soul had always presented it seemed to both therefore that their fate by bringing them together after a separation which appeared so decisive had intimated its fiat that their fortunes were inseparable from each other by the time that the summer sun had climbed high in the heavens the two travellers rode apart from their retinue conversing together with an eagerness which marked the important matters of discussion between them and in a short time it was made generally known through scotland that sir malcolm fleming and the lady margaret de hautlieu were to be united at the court of the good king robert and the husband invested with the honours of biggar and cumbernauld an earldom so long known in the family of fleming the gentle reader is acquainted that these are in all probability the last tales which it will be the lot of the author to submit to the public he is now on the eve of visiting foreign parts a ship of war is commissioned by its royal master to carry the author of waverley to climates in which he may possibly obtain such a restoration of health as may serve him to spin his thread to an end in his own country had he continued to prosecute his usual literary labours it seems indeed probable that at the term of years he has already attained the bowl to use the pathetic language of scripture would have been broken at the fountain and little can one who has enjoyed on the whole an uncommon share of the most inestimable of worldly blessings be entitled to complain that life advancing to its period should be attended with its usual proportions of shadows and storms they have affected him at least in no more painful manner than is inseparable from the discharge of this part of the debt of humanity of those whose relation to him in the ranks of life might have ensured him their sympathy under indisposition many are now no more and those who may yet follow in his wake are entitled to expect in bearing inevitable evils an example of firmness and patience more especially on the part of one who has enjoyed no small good fortune during the course of his pilgrimage the public have claims on his gratitude for which the author of waverley has no adequate means of expression but he may be permitted to hope that the powers of his mind such as they are may not have a different date from those of his body and that he may again meet his patronising friends if not exactly in his old fashion of literature at least in some branch which may not call forth the remark that superfluous lags the veteran on the stage abbotsford september end of castle dangerous my aunt margarets mirror introduction the species of publication which has come to be generally known by the title of annual being a miscellany of prose and verse equipped with numerous engravings and put forth every year about christmas had flourished for a long while in germany before it was imitated in this country by an enterprising bookseller a german by birth mr ackermann the rapid success of his work as is the custom of the time gave birth to a host of rivals and among others to an annual styled the keepsake the first volume of which appeared in and attracted much notice chiefly in consequence of the very uncommon splendour of its illustrative accompaniments the expenditure which the spirited proprietors lavished on this magnificent volume is understood to have been not less than from ten to twelve thousand pounds sterling various gentlemen of such literary reputation that any one might think it an honour to be associated with them had been announced as contributors to this annual before application was made to me to assist in it and i accordingly placed with much pleasure at the editors disposal a few fragments originally designed to have been worked into the chronicles of the canongate besides a ms drama the longneglected performance of my youthful days the house of aspen the keepsake for included however only three of these little prose tales of which the first in order was that entitled my aunt margarets mirror by way of introduction to this when now included in a general collection of my lucubrations i have only to say that it is a mere transcript or at least with very little embellishment of a story that i remembered being struck with in my childhood when told at the fireside by a lady of eminent virtues and no inconsiderable share of talent one of the ancient and honourable house of swinton she was a kind relation of my own and met her death in a manner so shocking being killed in a fit of insanity by a female attendant who had been attached to her person for half a lifetime that i cannot now recall her memory child as i was when the catastrophe occurred without a painful reawakening of perhaps the first images of horror that the scenes of real life stamped on my mind this good spinster had in her composition a strong vein of the superstitious and was pleased among other fancies to read alone in her chamber by a taper fixed in a candlestick which she had formed out of a human skull one night this strange piece of furniture acquired suddenly the power of locomotion and after performing some odd circles on her chimneypiece fairly leaped on the floor and continued to roll about the apartment mrs swinton calmly proceeded to the adjoining room for another light and had the satisfaction to penetrate the mystery on the spot rats abounded in the ancient building she inhabited and one of these had managed to ensconce itself within her favourite memento mori though thus endowed with a more than feminine share of nerve she entertained largely that belief in supernaturals which in those times was not considered as sitting ungracefully on the grave and aged of her condition and the story of the magic mirror was one for which she vouched with particular confidence alleging indeed that one of her own family had been an eye witness of the incidents recorded in it i tell the tale as it was told to me stories enow of much the same cast will present themselves to the recollection of such of my readers as have ever dabbled in a species of lore to which i certainly gave more hours at one period of my life than i should gain any credit by confessing august my aunt margarets mirror there are times when fancy plays her gambols in despite even of our watchful senses when in sooth substance seems shadow shadow substance seems when the broad palpabale and markd partition twixt that which is and is not seems dissolved as if the mental eye gaind power to gaze beyond the limits of the existing world such hours of shadowy dreams i better love than all the gross realities of life anonymous my aunt margaret was one of that respected sisterhood upon whom devolve all the trouble and solicitude incidental to the possession of children excepting only that which attends their entrance into the world we were a large family of very different dispositions and constitutions some were dull and peevish they were sent to aunt margaret to be amused some were rude romping and boisterous they were sent to aunt margaret to be kept quiet or rather that their noise might be removed out of hearing those who were indisposed were sent with the prospect of being nursed those who were stubborn with the hope of their being subdued by the kindness of aunt margarets discipline in short she had all the various duties of a mother without the credit and dignity of the maternal character the busy scene of her various cares is now over of the invalids and the robust the kind and the rough the peevish and pleased children who thronged her little parlour from morning to night not one now remains alive but myself who afflicted by early infirmity was one of the most delicate of her nurslings yet nevertheless have outlived them all it is still my custom and shall be so while i have the use of my limbs to visit my respected relation at least three times aweek her abode is about half a mile from the suburbs of the town in which i reside and is accessible not only by the highroad from which it stands at some distance but by means of a greensward footpath leading through some pretty meadows i have so little left to torment me in life that it is one of my greatest vexations to know that several of these sequestered fields have been devoted as sites for building in that which is nearest the town wheelbarrows have been at work for several weeks in such numbers that i verily believe its whole surface to the depth of at least eighteen inches was mounted in these monotrochs at the same moment and in the act of being transported from one place to another huge triangular piles of planks are also reared in different parts of the devoted messuage and a little group of trees that still grace the eastern end which rises in a gentle ascent have just received warning to quit expressed by a daub of white paint and are to give place to a curious grove of chimneys it would perhaps hurt others in my situation to reflect that this little range of pasturage once belonged to my father whose family was of some consideration in the world and was sold by patches to remedy distresses in which he involved himself in an attempt by commercial adventure to redeem his diminished fortune while the building scheme was in full operation this circumstance was often pointed out to me by the class of friends who are anxious that no part of your misfortunes should escape your observation such pastureground lying at the very towns end in turnips and potatoes the parks would bring l per acre and if leased for building oh it was a gold mine and all sold for an old song out of the ancient possessors hands my comforters cannot bring me to repine much on this subject if i could be allowed to look back on the past without interruption i could willingly give up the enjoyment of present income and the hope of future profit to those who have purchased what my father sold i regret the alteration of the ground only because it destroys associations and i would more willingly i think see the earls closes in the hands of strangers retaining their silvan appearance than know them for my own if torn up by agriculture or covered with buildings mine are the sensations of poor logan the horrid plough has rased the green where yet a child i strayd the axe has felld the hawthorn screen the schoolboys summer shade i hope however the threatened devastation will not be consummated in my day although the adventurous spirit of times short while since passed gave rise to the undertaking i have been encouraged to think that the subsequent changes have so far damped the spirit of speculation that the rest of the woodland footpath leading to aunt margarets retreat will be left undisturbed for her time and mine i am interested in this for every step of the way after i have passed through the green already mentioned has for me something of early remembrance there is the stile at which i can recollect a cross childsmaid upbraiding me with my infirmity as she lifted me coarsely and carelessly over the flinty steps which my brothers traversed with shout and bound i remember the suppressed bitterness of the moment and conscious of my own inferiority the feeling of envy with which i regarded the easy movements and elastic steps of my more happily formed brethren alas these goodly barks have all perished on lifes wide ocean and only that which seemed so little seaworthy as the naval phrase goes has reached the port when the tempest is over then there is the pool where manoeuvring our little navy constructed out of the broad water flags my elder brother fell in and was scarce saved from the watery element to die under nelsons banner there is the hazel copse also in which my brother henry used to gather nuts thinking little that he was to die in an indian jungle in quest of rupees there is so much more of remembrance about the little walk that as i stop rest on my crutchheaded cane and look round with that species of comparison between the thing i was and that which i now am it almost induces me to doubt my own identity until i find myself in face of the honeysuckle porch of aunt margarets dwelling with its irregularity of front and its odd projecting latticed windows where the workmen seem to have made a study that no one of them should resemble another in form size or in the oldfashioned stone entablature and labels which adorn them this tenement once the manor house of earls closes we still retain a slight hold upon for in some family arrangements it had been settled upon aunt margaret during the term of her life upon this frail tenure depends in a great measure the last shadow of the family of bothwell of earls closes and their last slight connection with their paternal inheritance the only representative will then be an infirm old man moving not unwillingly to the grave which has devoured all that were dear to his aifections when i have indulged such thoughts for a minute or two i enter the mansion which is said to have been the gatehouse only of the original building and find one being on whom time seems to have made little impression for the aunt margaret of today bears the same proportional ago to the aunt margaret of my early youth that the boy of ten years old does to the man of byr lady some fiftysix years the old ladys invariable costume has doubtless some share in confirming one in the opinion that time has stood still with aunt margaret the brown or chocolatecoloured silk gown with ruffles of the same stuff at the elbow within which are others of mechlin lace the black silk gloves or mitts the white hair combed back upon a roll and the cap of spotless cambric which closes around the venerable countenance as they were not the costume of so neither were they that of they are altogether a style peculiar to the individual aunt margaret there she still sits as she sat thirty years since with her wheel or the stocking which she works by the fire in winter and by the window in summer or perhaps venturing as far as the porch in an unusually fine summer evening her frame like some wellconstructed piece of mechanics still performs the operations for which it had seemed destined going its round with an activity which is gradually diminished yet indicating no probability that it will soon come to a period the solicitude and affection which had made aunt margaret the willing slave to the inflictions of a whole nursery have now for their object the health and comfort of one old and infirm man the last remaining relative of her family and the only one who can still find interest in the traditional stores which she hoards as some miser hides the gold which he desires that no one should enjoy after his death my conversation with aunt margaret generally relates little either to the present or to the future for the passing day we possess as much as we require and we neither of us wish for more and for that which is to follow we have on this side of the grave neither hopes nor fears nor anxiety we therefore naturally look back to the past and forget the present fallen fortunes and declined importance of our family in recalling the hours when it was wealthy and prosperous with this slight introduction the reader will know as much of aunt margaret and her nephew as is necessary to comprehend the following conversation and narrative last week when late in a summer evening i went to call on the old lady to whom my reader is now introduced i was received by her with all her usual affection and benignity while at the same time she seemed abstracted and disposed to silence i asked her the reason they have been clearing out the old chapel she said john clayhudgeons having it seems discovered that the stuff within being i suppose the remains of our ancestors was excellent for topdressing the meadows here i started up with more alacrity than i have displayed for some years but sat down while my aunt added laying her hand upon my sleeve the chapel has been long considered as common ground my dear and used for a penfold and what objection can we have to the man for employing what is his own to his own profit besides i did speak to him and he very readily and civilly promised that if he found bones or monuments they should be carefully respected and reinstated and what more could i ask so the first stone they found bore the name of margaret bothwell and i have caused it to be laid carefully aside as i think it betokens death and having served my namesake two hundred years it has just been cast up in time to do me the same good turn my house has been long put in order as far as the small earthly concerns require it but who shall say that their account with heaven is sufficiently revised after what you have said aunt i replied perhaps i ought to take my hat and go away and so i should but that there is on this occasion a little alloy mingled with our devotion to think of death at all times is a duty to suppose it nearer from the finding of an old gravestone is superstition and you with your strong useful common sense which was so long the prop of a fallen family are the last person whom i should have suspected of such weakness neither would i have deserved your suspicions kinsman answered aunt margaret if we were speaking of any incident occurring in the actual business of human life but for all this i have a sense of superstition about me which i do not wish to part with it is a feeling which separates me from this age and links me with that to which i am hastening and even when it seems as now to lead me to the brink of the grave and bids me gaze on it i do not love that it should be dispelled it soothes my imagination without influencing my reason or conduct i profess my good lady replied i that had any one but you made such a declaration i should have thought it as capricious as that of the clergyman who without vindicating his false reading preferred from habits sake his old mumpsimus to the modern sumpsimus well answered my aunt i must explain my inconsistency in this particular by comparing it to another i am as you know a piece of that oldfashioned thing called a jacobite but i am so in sentiment and feeling only for a more loyal subject never joined in prayers for the health and wealth of george the fourth whom god long preserve but i dare say that kindhearted sovereign would not deem that an old woman did him much injury if she leaned back in her armchair just in such a twilight as this and thought of the highmettled men whose sense of duty called them to arms against his grandfather and how in a cause which they deemed that of their rightful prince and country they fought till their hands to the broadsword were glued they fought against fortune with hearts unsubdued do not come at such a moment when my head is full of plaids pibrochs and claymores and ask my reason to admit what i am afraid it cannot deny i mean that the public advantage peremptorily demanded that these things should cease to exist i cannot indeed refuse to allow the justice of your reasoning but yet being convinced against my will you will gain little by your motion you might as well read to an infatuated lover the catalogue of his mistresss imperfections for when he has been compelled to listen to the summary you will only get for answer that he loes her a the better i was not sorry to have changed the gloomy train of aunt margarets thoughts and replied in the same tone well i cant help being persuaded that our good king is the more sure of mrs bothwells loyal affection that he has the stuart right of birth as well as the act of succession in his favour perhaps my attachment were its source of consequence might be foumd warmer for the union of the rights you mention said aunt margaret but upon my word it would be as sincere if the kings right were founded only on the will of the nation as declared at the revolution i am none of your jure divino folk and a jacobite notwithstanding and a jacobite notwithstanding or rather i will give you leave to call me one of the party which in queen annes time were called whimsicals because they were sometimes operated upon by feelings sometimes by principle after all it is very hard that you will not allow an old woman to be as inconsistent in her political sentiments as mankind in general show themselves in all the various courses of life since you cannot point out one of them in which the passions and prejudices of those who pursue it are not perpetually carrying us away from the path which our reason points out true aunt but you are a wilful wanderer who should be forced back into the right path spare me i entreat you replied aunt margaret you remember the gaelic song though i dare say i mispronounce the words hatil mohatil na dowski mi i am asleep do not waken me i tell you kinsman that the sort of waking dreams which my imagination spins out in what your favourite wordsworth calls moods of my own mind are worth all the rest of my more active days then instead of looking forwards as i did in youth and forming for myself fairy palaces upon the verge of the grave i turn my eyes backward upon the days and manners of my better time and the sad yet soothing recollections come so close and interesting that i almost think it sacrilege to be wiser or more rational or less prejudiced than those to whom i looked up in my younger years i think i now understand what you mean i answered and can comprehend why you should occasionally prefer the twilight of illusion to the steady light of reason where there is no task she rejoined to be performed we may sit in the dark if we like it if we go to work we must ring for candles and amidst such shadowy and doubtful light continued i imagination frames her enchanted and enchanting visions and sometimes passes them upon the senses for reality yes said aunt margaret who is a wellread woman to those who resemble the translator of tasso prevailing poet whose undoubting mind believed the magic wonders which he sung it is not required for this purpose that you should be sensible of the painful horrors which an actual belief in such prodigies inflicts such a belief nowadays belongs only to fools and children it is not necessary that your ears should tingle and your complexion change like that of theodore at the approach of the spectral huntsman all that is indispensable for the enjoyment of the milder feeling of supernatural awe is that you should be susceptible of the slight shuddering which creeps over you when you hear a tale of terror that wellvouched tale which the narrator having first expressed his general disbelief of all such legendary lore selects and produces as having something in it which he has been always obliged to give up as inexplicable another symptom is a momentary hesitation to look round you when the interest of the narrative is at the highest and the third a desire to avoid looking into a mirror when you are alone in your chamber for the evening i mean such are signs which indicate the crisis when a female imagination is in due temperature to enjoy a ghost story i do not pretend to describe those which express the same disposition in a gentleman this last symptom dear aunt of shunning the mirror seems likely to be a rare occurrence amongst the fair sex you are a novice in toilet fashions my dear kinsman all women consult the lookingglass with anxiety before they go into company but when they return home the mirror has not the same charm the die has been castthe party has been successful or unsuccessful in the impression which she desired to make but without going deeper into the mysteries of the dressingtable i will tell you that i myself like many other honest folk do not like to see the blank black front of a large mirror in a room dimly lighted and where the reflection of the candle seems rather to lose itself in the deep obscurity of the glass than to be reflected back again into the apartment that space of inky darkness seems to be a field for fancy to play her revels in she may call up other features to meet us instead of the reflection of our own or as in the spells of halloween which we learned in childhood some unknown form may be seen peeping over our shoulder in short when i am in a ghostseeing humour i make my handmaiden draw the green curtains over the mirror before i go into the room so that she may have the first shock of the apparition if there be any to be seen but to tell you the truth this dislike to look into a mirror in particular times and places has i believe its original foundation in a story which came to me by tradition from my grandmother who was a party concerned in the scene of which i will now tell you the mirror chapter the first you are fond said my aunt of sketches of the society which has passed away i wish i could describe to you sir philip forester the chartered libertine of scottish good company about the end of the last century i never saw him indeed but my mothers traditions were full of his wit gallantry and dissipation this gay knight flourished about the end of the th and beginning of the th century he was the sir charles easy and the lovelace of his day and country renowned for the number of duels he had fought and the successful intrigues which he had carried on the supremacy which he had attained in the fashionable world was absolute and when we combine with it one or two anecdotes for which if laws were made for every degree he ought certainly to have been hanged the popularity of such a person really serves to show either that the present times are much more decent if not more virtuous than they formerly were or that high breeding then was of more difficult attainment than that which is now so called and consequently entitled the successful professor to a proportionable degree of plenary indulgences and privileges no beau of this day could have borne out so ugly a story as that of pretty peggy grindstone the millers daughter at sillermills it had wellnigh made work for the lord advocate but it hurt sir philip forester no more than the hail hurts the hearthstone he was as well received in society as ever and dined with the duke of a the day the poor girl was buried she died of heartbreak but that has nothing to do with my story now you must listen to a single word upon kith kin and ally i promise you i will not be prolix but it is necessary to the authenticity of my legend that you should know that sir philip forester with his handsome person elegant accomplishments and fashionable manners married the younger miss falconer of kings copland the elder sister of this lady had previously become the wife of my grandfather sir geoffrey bothwell and brought into our family a good fortune miss jemima or miss jemmie falconer as she was usually called had also about ten thousand pounds sterling then thought a very handsome portion indeed the two sisters were extremely different though each had their admirers while they remained single lady bothwell had some touch of the old kings copland blood about her she was bold though not to the degree of audacity ambitious and desirous to raise her house and family and was as has been said a considerable spur to my grandfather who was otherwise an indolent man but whom unless he has been slandered his ladys influence involved in some political matters which had been more wisely let alone she was a woman of high principle however and masculine good sense as some of her letters testify which are still in my wainscot cabinet jemmie falconer was the reverse of her sister in every respect her understanding did not reach above the ordinary pitch if indeed she could be said to have attained it her beauty while it lasted consisted in a great measure of delicacy of complexion and regularity of features without any peculiar force of expression even these charms faded under the sufferings attendant on an illsorted match she was passionately attached to her husband by whom she was treated with a callous yet polite indifference which to one whose heart was as tender as her judgment was weak was more painful perhaps than absolute illusage sir philip was a voluptuary that is a completely selfish egotist whose disposition and character resembled the rapier he wore polished keen and brilliant but inflexible and unpitying as he observed carefully all the usual forms towards his lady he had the art to deprive her even of the compassion of the world and useless and unavailing as that may be while actually possessed by the sufferer it is to a mind like lady foresters most painful to know she has it not the tattle of society did its best to place the peccant husband above the suffering wife some called her a poor spiritless thing and declared that with a little of her sisters spirit she might have brought to reason any sir philip whatsoever were it the termagant falconbridge himself but the greater part of their acquaintance affected candour and saw faults on both sides though in fact there only existed the oppressor and the oppressed the tone of such critics was to be sure no one will justify sir philip forester but then we all know sir philip and jemmie falconer might have known what she had to expect from the beginning what made her set her cap at sir philip he would never have looked at her if she had not thrown herself at his head with her poor ten thousand pounds i am sure if it is money he wanted she spoiled his market i know where sir philip could have done much better and then if she would have the man could not she try to make him more comfortable at home and have his friends oftener and not plague him with the squalling children and take care all was handsome and in good style about the house i declare i think sir philip would have made a very domestic man with a woman who knew how to manage him now these fair critics in raising their profound edifice of domestic felicity did not recollect that the cornerstone was wanting and that to receive good company with good cheer the means of the banquet ought to have been furnished by sir philip whose income dilapidated as it was was not equal to the display of hospitality required and at the same time to the supply of the good knights menus plaisirs so in spite of all that was so sagely suggested by female friends sir philip carried his goodhumour every where abroad and left at home a solitary mansion and a pining spouse at length inconvenienced in his money affairs and tired even of the short time which he spent in his own dull house sir philip forester determined to take a trip to the continent in the capacity of a volunteer it was then common for men of fashion to do so and our knight perhaps was of opinion that a touch of the military character just enough to exalt but not render pedantic his qualities as a beau garcon was necessary to maintain possession of the elevated situation which he held in the ranks of fashion sir philips resolution threw his wife into agonies of terror by which the worthy baronet was so much annoyed that contrary to his wont he took some trouble to soothe her apprehensions and once more brought her to shed tears in which sorrow was not altogether unmingled with pleasure lady bothwell asked as a favour sir philips permission to receive her sister and her family into her own house during his absence on the continent sir philip readily assented to a proposition which saved expense silenced the foolish people who might have talked of a deserted wife and family and gratified lady bothwell for whom he felt some respect as for one who often spoke to him always with freedom and sometimes with severity without being deterred either by his raillery or the prestige of his reputation a day or two before sir philips departure lady bothwell took the liberty of asking him in her sisters presence the direct question which his timid wife had often desired but never ventured to put to him pray sir philip what route do you take when you reach the continent i go from leith to helvoet by a packet with advices that i comprehend perfectly said lady bothwell dryly but you do not mean to remain long at helvoet i presume and i should like to know what is your next object you ask me my dear lady answered sir philip a question which i have not dared to ask myself the answer depends on the fate of war i shall of course go to headquarters wherever they may happen to be for the time deliver my letters of introduction learn as much of the noble art of war as may suffice a poor interloping amateur and then take a glance at the sort of thing of which we read so much in the gazette and i trust sir philip said lady bothwell that you will remember that you are a husband and a father and that though you think fit to indulge this military fancy you will not let it hurry you into dangers which it is certainly unnecessary for any save professional persons to encounter lady bothwell does me too much honour replied the adventurous knight in regarding such a circumstance with the slightest interest but to soothe your flattering anxiety i trust your ladyship will recollect that i cannot expose to hazard the venerable and paternal character which you so obligingly recommend to my protection without putting in some peril an honest fellow called philip forester with whom i have kept company for thirty years and with whom though some folk consider him a coxcomb i have not the least desire to part well sir philip you are the best judge of your own affairs i have little right to interfere you are not my husband god forbid said sir philip hastily instantly adding however god forbid that i should deprive my friend sir geoffrey of so inestimable a treasure but you are my sisters husband replied the lady and i suppose you are aware of her present distress of mind if hearing of nothing else from morning to night can make me aware of it said sir philip i should know something of the matter i do not pretend to reply to your wit sir philip answered lady bothwell but you must be sensible that all this distress is on account of apprehensions for your personal safety in that case i am surprised that lady bothwell at least should give herself so much trouble upon so insignificant a subject my sisters interest may account for my being anxious to learn something of sir philip foresters motions about which otherwise i know he would not wish me to concern myself i have a brothers safety too to be anxious for you mean major falconer your brother by the mothers side what can he possibly have to do with our present agreeable conversation you have had words together sir philip said lady bothwell naturally we are connections replied sir philip and as such have always had the usual intercourse that is an evasion of the subject answered the lady by words i mean angry words on the subject of your usage of your wife if replied sir philip forester you suppose major falconer simple enough to intrude his advice upon me lady bothwell in my domestic matters you are indeed warranted in believing that i might possibly be so far displeased with the interference as to request him to reserve his advice till it was asked and being on these terms you are going to join the very army in which my brother falconer is now serving no man knows the path of honour better than major falconer said sir philip an aspirant after fame like me cannot choose a better guide than his footsteps lady bothwell rose and went to the window the tears gushing from her eyes and this heartless raillery she said is all the consideration that is to be given to our apprehensions of a quarrel which may bring on the most terrible consequences good god of what can mens hearts be made who can thus dally with the agony of others sir philip forester was moved he laid aside the mocking tone in which he had hitherto spoken dear lady bothwell he said taking her reluctant hand we are both wrong you are too deeply serious i perhaps too little the dispute i had with major falconer was of no earthly consequence had any thing occurred betwixt us that ought to have been settled par voie du fait as we say in france neither of us are persons that are likely to postpone such a meeting permit me to say that were it generally known that you or my lady forester are apprehensive of such a catastrophe it might be the very means of bringing about what would not otherwise be likely to happen i know your good sense lady bothwell and that you will understand me when i say that really my affairs require my absence for some months this jemima cannot understand it is a perpetual recurrence of questions why can you not do this or that or the third thing and when you have proved to her that her expedients are totally ineffectual you have just to begin the whole round again now do you tell her dear lady bothwell that you are satisfied she is you must confess one of those persons with whom authority goes farther than reasoning do but repose a little confidence in me and you shall see how amply i will repay it lady bothwell shook her head as one but half satisfied how difficult it is to extend confidence when the basis on which it ought to rest has been so much shaken but i will do my best to make jemima easy and farther i can only say that for keeping your present purpose i hold you responsible both to god and man do not fear that i will deceive you said sir philip the safest conveyance to me will be through the general postoffice helvoetsluys where i will take care to leave orders for forwarding my letters as for falconer our only encounter will be over a bottle of burgundy so make yourself perfectly easy on his score lady bothwell could not make herself easy yet she was sensible that her sister hurt her own cause by taking on as the maidservants call it too vehemently and by showing before every stranger by manner and sometimes by words also a dissatisfaction with her husbands journey that was sure to come to his ears and equally certain to displease him but there was no help for this domestic dissension which ended only with the day of separation i am sorry i cannot tell with precision the year in which sir philip forester went over to flanders but it was one of those in which the campaign opened with extraordinary fury and many bloody though indecisive skirmishes were fought between the french on the one side and the allies on the other in all our modern improvements there are none perhaps greater than in the accuracy and speed with which intelligence is transmitted from any scene of action to those in this country whom it may concern during marlboroughs campaigns the sufferings of the many who had relations in or along with the army were greatly augmented by the suspense in which they were detained for weeks after they had heard of bloody battles in which in all probability those for whom their bosoms throbbed with anxiety had been personally engaged amongst those who were most agonized by this state of uncertainty was the i had almost said deserted wife of the gay sir philip forester a single letter had informed her of his arrival on the continent no others were received one notice occurred in the newspapers in which volunteer sir philip forester was mentioned as having been entrusted with a dangerous reconnoissance which he had executed with the greatest courage dexterity and intelligence and received the thanks of the commanding officer the sense of his having acquired distinction brought a momentary glow into the ladys pale cheek but it was instantly lost in ashen whiteness at the recollection of his danger after this they had no news whatever neither from sir philip nor even from their brother falconer the case of lady forester was not indeed different from that of hundreds in the same situation but a feeble mind is necessarily an irritable one and the suspense which some bear with constitutional indifference or philosophical resignation and some with a disposition to believe and hope the best was intolerable to lady forester at once solitary and sensitive lowspirited and devoid of strength of mind whether natural or acquired chapter the second as she received no farther news of sir philip whether directly or indirectly his unfortunate lady began now to feel a sort of consolation even in those careless habits which had so often given her pain he is so thoughtless she repeated a hundred times a day to her sister he never writes when things are going on smoothly it is his way had any thing happened he would have informed us lady bothwell listened to her sister without attempting to console her probably she might be of opinion that even the worst intelligence which could be received from flanders might not be without some touch of consolation and that the dowager lady forester if so she was doomed to be called might have a source of happiness unknown to the wife of the gayest and finest gentleman in scotland this conviction became stronger as they learned from inquiries made at headquarters that sir philip was no longer with the army though whether he had been taken or slain in some of those skirmishes which were perpetually occurring and in which he loved to distinguish himself or whether he had for some unknown reason or capricious change of mind voluntarily left the service none of his countrymen in the camp of the allies could form even a conjecture meantime his creditors at home became clamorous entered into possession of big property and threatened his person should he be rash enough to return to scotland these additional disadvantages aggravated lady bothwells displeasure against the fugitive husband while her sister saw nothing in any of them save what tended to increase her grief for the absence of him whom her imagination now represented as it had before marriage gallant gay and affectionate about this period there appeared in edinburgh a man of singular appearance and pretensions he was commonly called the paduan doctor from having received his education at that famous university he was supposed to possess some rare receipts in medicine with which it was affirmed he had wrought remarkable cures but though on the one hand the physicians of edinburgh termed him an empiric there were many persons and among them some of the clergy who while they admitted the truth of the cures and the force of his remedies alleged that doctor baptisti damiotti made use of charms and unlawful arts in order to obtain success in his practice the resorting to him was even solemnly preached against as a seeking of health from idols and a trusting to the help which was to come from egypt but the protection which the paduan doctor received from some friends of interest and consequence enabled him to set these imputations at defiance and to assume even in the city of edinburgh famed as it was for abhorrence of witches and necromancers the dangerous character of an expounder of futurity it was at length rumoured that for a certain gratification which of course was not an inconsiderable one doctor baptisti damiotti could tell the fate of the absent and even show his visitors the personal form of their absent friends and the action in which they were engaged at the moment this rumour came to the ears of lady forester who had reached that pitch of mental agony in which the sufferer will do any thing or endure any thing that suspense may be converted into certainty gentle and timid in most cases her state of mind made her equally obstinate and reckless and it was with no small surprise and alarm that her sister lady bothwell heard her express a resolution to visit this man of art and learn from him the fate of her husband lady bothwell remonstrated on the improbability that such pretensions as those of this foreigner could be founded on any thing but imposture i care not said the deserted wife what degree of ridicule i may incur if there be any one chance out of a hundred that i may obtain some certainty of my husbands fate i would not miss that chance for whatever else the world can offer me lady bothwell next urged the unlawfulness of resorting to such sources of forbidden knowledge sister replied the sufferer he who is dying of thirst cannot refrain from drinking poisoned water she who suffers under suspense must seek information even were the powers which offer it unhallowed and infernal i go to learn my fate alone and this very evening will i know it the sun that rises tomorrow shall find me if not more happy at least more resigned sister said lady bothwell if you are determined upon this wild step you shall not go alone if this man be an impostor you may be too much agitated by your feelings to detect his villany if which i cannot believe there be any truth in what he pretends you shall not be exposed alone to a communication of so extraordinary a nature i will go with you if indeed you determine to go but yet reconsider your project and renounce inquiries which cannot be prosecuted without guilt and perhaps without danger lady forester threw herself into her sisters arms and clasping her to her bosom thanked her a hundred times for the offer of her company while she declined with a melancholy gesture the friendly advice with which it was accompanied when the hour of twilight arrived which was the period when the paduan doctor was understood to receive the visits of those who came to consult with him the two ladies left their apartments in the canongate of edinburgh having their dress arranged like that of women of an inferior description and their plaids disposed around their faces as they were worn by the same class for in those days of aristocracy the quality of the wearer was generally indicated by the manner in which her plaid was disposed as well as by the fineness of its texture it was lady bothwell who had suggested this species of disguise partly to avoid observation as they should go to the conjurors house and partly in order to make trial of his penetration by appearing before him in a feigned character lady foresters servant of tried fidelity had been employed by her to propitiate the doctor by a suitable fee and a story intimating that a soldiers wife desired to know the fate of her husband a subject upon which in all probability the sage was very frequently consulted to the last moment when the palace clock struck eight lady bothwell earnestly watched her sister in hopes that she might retreat from her rash undertaking but as mildness and even timidity is capable at times of vehement and fixed purposes she found lady forester resolutely unmoved and determined when the moment of departure arrived ill satisfied with the expedition but determined not to leave her sister at such a crisis lady bothwell accompanied lady forester through more than one obscure street and lane the servant walking before and acting as their guide at length he suddenly turned into a narrow court and knocked at an arched door which seemed to belong to a building of some antiquity it opened though no one appeared to act as porter and the servant stepping aside from the entrance motioned the ladies to enter they had no sooner done so than it shut and excluded their guide the two ladies found themselves in a small vestibule illuminated by a dim lamp and having when the door was closed no communication with the external light or air the door of an inner apartment partly open was at the farther side of the vestibule we must not hesitate now jemima said lady bothwell and walked forwards into the inner room where surrounded by books maps philosophical utensils and other implements of peculiar shape and appearance they found the man of art there was nothing very peculiar in the italians appearance he had the dark complexion and marked features of his country seemed about fifty years old and was handsomely but plainly dressed in a full suit of black clothes which was then the universal costume of the medical profession large waxlights in silver sconces illuminated the apartment which was reasonably furnished he rose as the ladies entered and notwithstanding the inferiority of their dress received them with the marked respect due to their quality and which foreigners are usually punctilious in rendering to those to whom such honours are due lady bothwell endeavoured to maintain her proposed incognito and as the doctor ushered them to the upper end of the room made a motion declining his courtesy as unfitted for their condition we are poor people sir she said only my sisters distress has brought us to consult your worship whether he smiled as he interrupted her i am aware madam of your sisters distress and its cause i am aware also that i am honoured with a visit from two ladies of the highest consideration lady bothwell and lady forester if i could not distinguish them from the class of society which their present dress would indicate there would be small possibility of my being able to gratify them by giving the information which they come to seek i can easily understand said lady bothwell pardon my boldness to interrupt you milady cried the italian your ladyship was about to say that you could easily understand that i had got possession of your names by means of your domestic but in thinking so you do injustice to the fidelity of your servant and i may add to the skill of one who is also not less your humble servant baptisti damiotti i have no intention to do either sir said lady bothwell maintaining a tone of composure though somewhat surprised but the situation is something new to me if you know who we are you also know sir what brought us here curiosity to know the fate of a scottish gentleman of rank now or lately upon the continent answered the seer his name is il cavaliero philippo forester a gentleman who has the honour to be husband to this lady and with your ladyships permission for using plain language the misfortune not to value as it deserves that inestimable advantage lady forester sighed deeply and lady bothwell replied since you know our object without our telling it the only question that remains is whether you have the power to relieve my sisters anxiety i have madam answered the paduan scholar but there is still a previous inquiry have you the courage to behold with your own eyes what the cavaliero philippo forester is now doing or will you take it on my report that question my sister must answer for herself said lady bothwell with my own eyes will i endure to see whatever you have power to show me said lady forester with the same determined spirit which had stimulated her since her resolution was taken upon this subject there may be danger in it if gold can compensate the risk said lady forester taking out her purse i do not such things for the purpose of gain answered the foreigner i dare not turn my art to such a purpose if i take the gold of the wealthy it is but to bestow it on the poor nor do i ever accept more than the sum i have already received from your servant put up your purse madam an adept needs not your gold lady bothwell considering this rejection of her sisters offer as a mere trick of an empiric to induce her to press a larger sum upon him and willing that the scene should be commenced and ended offered some gold in turn observing that it was only to enlarge the sphere of his charity let lady bothwell enlarge the sphere of her own charity said the paduan not merely in giving of alms in which i know she is not deficient but in judging the character of others and let her oblige baptisti damiotti by believing him honest till she shall discover him to be a knave do not be surprised madam if i speak in answer to your thoughts rather than your expressions and tell me once more whether you have courage to look on what i am prepared to show i own sir said lady bothwell that your words strike me with some sense of fear but whatever my sister desires to witness i will not shrink from witnessing along with her nay the danger only consists in the risk of your resolution failing you the sight can only last for the space of seven minutes and should you interrupt the vision by speaking a single word not only would the charm be broken but some danger might result to the spectators but if you can remain steadily silent for the seven minutes your curiosity will be gratified without the slightest risk and for this i will engage my honour internally lady bothwell thought the security was but an indifferent one but she suppressed the suspicion as if she had believed that the adept whose dark features wore a halfformed smile could in reality read even her most secret reflections a solemn pause then ensued until lady forester gathered courage enough to reply to the physician as he termed himself that she would abide with firmness and silence the sight which he had promised to exhibit to them upon this he made them a low obeisance and saying he went to prepare matters to meet their wish left the apartment the two sisters hand in hand as if seeking by that close union to divert any danger which might threaten them sat down on two seats in immediate contact with each other jemima seeking support in the manly and habitual courage of lady bothwell and she on the other hand more agitated than she had expected endeavouring to fortify herself by the desperate resolution which circumstances had forced her sister to assume the one perhaps said to herself that her sister never feared anything and the other might reflect that what so feeble a minded woman as jemima did not fear could not properly be a subject of apprehension to a person of firmness and resolution like herself in a few moments the thoughts of both were diverted from their own situation by a strain of music so singularly sweet and solemn that while it seemed calculated to avert or dispel any feeling unconnected with its harmony increased at the same time the solemn excitation which the preceding interview was calculated to produce the music was that of some instrument with which they were unacquainted but circumstances afterwards led my ancestress to believe that it was that of the harmonica which she heard at a much later period in life when these heavenborn sounds had ceased a door opened in the upper end of the apartment and they saw damiotti standing at the head of two or three steps sign to them to advance his dress was so different from that which he had worn a few minutes before that they could hardly recognize him and the deadly paleness of his countenance and a certain rigidity of muscles like that of one whose mind is made up to some strange and daring action had totally changed the somewhat sarcastic expression with which he had previously regarded them both and particularly lady bothwell he was barefooted excepting a species of sandals in the antique fashion his legs were naked beneath the knees above them he wore hose and a doublet of dark crimson silk close to his body and over that a flowing loose robe something resembling a surplice of snowwhite linen his throat and neck were uncovered and his long straight black hair was carefully combed down at full length as the ladies approached at his bidding he showed no gesture of that ceremonious courtesy of which he had been formerly lavish on the contrary he made the signal of advance with an air of command and when arm in arm and with insecure steps the sisters approached the spot where he stood it was with a warning frown that he pressed his finger to his lips as if reiterating his condition of absolute silence while stalking before them he led the way into the next apartment this was a large room hung with black as if for a funeral at the upper end was a table or rather a species of altar covered with the same lugubrious colour on which lay divers objects resembling the usual implements of sorcery these objects were not indeed visible as they advanced into the apartment for the light which displayed them being only that of two expiring lamps was extremely faint the master to use the italian phrase for persons of this description approached the upper end of the room with a genuflexion like that of a catholic to the crucifix and at the same time crossed himself the ladies followed in silence and arm in arm two or three low broad steps led to a platform in front of the altar or what resembled such here the sage took his stand and placed the ladies beside him once more earnestly repeating by signs his injunctions of silence the italian then extending his bare arm from under his linen vestment pointed with his forefinger to five large flambeaux or torches placed on each side of the altar they took fire successively at the approach of his hand or rather of his finger and spread a strong light through the room by this the visitors could discern that on the seeming altar were disposed two naked swords laid crosswise a large open book which they conceived to be a copy of the holy scriptures but in a language to them unknown and beside this mysterious volume was placed a human skull but what struck the sisters most was a very tall and broad mirror which occupied all the space behind the altar and illuminated by the lighted torches reflected the mysterious articles which were laid upon it the master then placed himself between the two ladies and pointing to the mirror took each by the hand but without speaking a syllable they gazed intently on the polished and sable space to which he had directed their attention suddenly the surface assumed a new and singular appearance it no longer simply reflected the objects placed before it but as if it had selfcontained scenery of its own objects began to appear within it at first in a disorderly indistinct and miscellaneous manner like form arranging itself out of chaos at length in distinct and defined shape and symmetry it was thus that after some shifting of light and darkness over the face of the wonderful glass a long perspective of arches and columns began to arrange itself on its sides and a vaulted roof on the upper part of it till after many oscillations the whole vision gained a fixed and stationary appearance representing the interior of a foreign church the pillars were stately and hung with scutcheons the arches were lofty and magnificent the floor was lettered with funeral inscriptions but there were no separate shrines no images no display of chalice or crucifix on the altar it was therefore a protestant church upon the continent a clergyman dressed in the geneva gown and band stood by the communiontable and with the bible opened before him and his clerk awaiting in the background seemed prepared to perform some service of the church to which he belonged at length there entered the middle aisle of the building a numerous party which appeared to be a bridal one as a lady and gentleman walked first hand in hand followed by a large concourse of persons of both sexes gaily nay richly attired the bride whose features they could distinctly see seemed not more than sixteen years old and extremely beautiful the bridegroom for some seconds moved rather with his shoulder towards them and his face averted but his elegance of form and step struck the sisters at once with the same apprehension as he turned his face suddenly he was frightfully realized and they saw in the gay bridegroom before them sir philip forester his wife uttered an imperfect exclamation at the sound of which the whole scene stirred and seemed to separate i could compare it to nothing said lady bothwell while recounting the wonderful tale but to the dispersion of the reflection offered by a deep and calm pool when a stone is suddenly cast into it and the shadows become dissipated and broken the master pressed both the ladies hands severely as if to remind them of their promise and of the danger which they incurred the exclamation died away on lady foresters tongue without attaining perfect utterance and the scene in the glass after the fluctuation of a minute again resumed to the eye its former appearance of a real scene existing within the mirror as if represented in a picture save that the figures were moveable instead of being stationary the representation of sir philip forester now distinctly visible in form and feature was seen to lead on towards the clergyman that beautiful girl who advanced at once with diffidence and with a species of affectionate pride in the meantime and just as the clergyman had arranged the bridal company before him and seemed about to commence the service another group of persons of whom two or three were officers entered the church they moved at first forward as though they came to witness the bridal ceremony but suddenly one of the officers whose back was towards the spectators detached himself from his companions and rushed hastily towards the marriage party when the whole of them turned towards him as if attracted by some exclamation which had accompanied his advance suddenly the intruder drew his sword the bridegroom unsheathed his own and made towards him swords were also drawn by other individuals both of the marriage party and of those who had last entered they fell into a sort of confusion the clergyman and some elder and graver persons labouring apparently to keep the peace while the hotter spirits on both sides brandished their weapons but now the period of brief space during which the soothsayer as he pretended was permitted to exhibit his art was arrived the fumes again mixed together and dissolved gradually from observation the vaults and columns of the church rolled asunder and disappeared and the front of the mirror reflected nothing save the blazing torches and the melancholy apparatus placed on the altar or table before it the doctor led the ladies who greatly required his support into the apartment from whence they came where wine essences and other means of restoring suspended animation had been provided during his absence he motioned them to chairs which they occupied in silence lady forester in particular wringing her hands and casting her eyes up to heaven but without speaking a word as if the spell had been still before her eyes and what we have seen is even now acting said lady bothwell collecting herself with difficulty that answered baptisti damiotti i cannot justly or with certainty say but it is either now acting or has been acted during a short space before this it is the last remarkable transaction in which the cavalier forester has been engaged lady bothwell then expressed anxiety concerning her sister whose altered countenance and apparent unconsciousness of what passed around her excited her apprehensions how it might be possible to convey her home i have prepared for that answered the adept i have directed the servant to bring your equipage as near to this place as the narrowness of the street will permit fear not for your sister but give her when you return home this composing draught and she will be better to morrow morning few he added in a melancholy tone leave this house as well in health as they entered it such being the consequence of seeking knowledge by mysterious means i leave you to judge the condition of those who have the power of gratifying such irregular curiosity farewell and forget not the potion i will give her nothing that comes from you said lady bothwell i have seen enough of your art already perhaps you would poison us both to conceal your own necromancy but we are persons who want neither the means of making our wrongs known nor the assistance of friends to right them you have had no wrongs from me madam said the adept you sought one who is little grateful for such honour he seeks no one and only gives responses to those who invite and call upon him after all you have but learned a little sooner the evil which you must still be doomed to endure i hear your servants step at the door and will detain your ladyship and lady forester no longer the next packet from the continent will explain what you have partly witnessed let it not if i may advise pass too suddenly into your sisters hands so saying he bid lady bothwell goodnight she went lighted by the adept to the vestibule where he hastily threw a black cloak over his singular dress and opening the door intrusted his visitors to the care of the servant it was with difficulty that lady bothwell sustained her sister to the carriage though it was only twenty steps distant when they arrived at home lady forester required medical assistance the physician of the family attended and shook his head on feeling her pulse here has been he said a violent and sudden shock on the nerves i must know how it has happened lady bothwell admitted they had visited the conjuror and that lady forester had received some bad news respecting her husband sir philip that rascally quack would make my fortune were he to stay in edinburgh said the graduate this is the seventh nervous case i have heard of his making for me and all by effect of terror he next examined the composing draught which lady bothwell had unconsciously brought in her hand tasted it and pronounced it very germain to the matter and what would save an application to the apothecary he then paused and looking at lady bothwell very significantly at length added i suppose i must not ask your ladyship anything about this italian warlocks proceedings indeed doctor answered lady bothwell i consider what passed as confidential and though the man may be a rogue yet as we were fools enough to consult him we should i think be honest enough to keep his counsel may be a knave come said the doctor i am glad to hear your ladyship allows such a possibility in any thing that comes from italy what comes from italy may be as good as what conies from hanover doctor but you and i will remain good friends and that it may be so we will say nothing of whig and tory not i said the doctor receiving his fee and taking his hat a carolus serves my purpose as well as a willielmus but i should like to know why old lady saint ringans and all that set go about wasting their decayed lungs in puffing this foreign fellow ay you had best set him down a jesuit as scrub says on these terms they parted the poor patient whose nerves from an extraordinary state of tension had at length become relaxed in as extraordinary a degree continued to struggle with a sort of imbecility the growth of superstitious terror when the shocking tidings were brought from holland which fulfilled even her worst expectations they were sent by the celebrated earl of stair and contained the melancholy event of a duel betwixt sir philip forester and his wifes halfbrother captain falconer of the scotchdutch as they were then called in which the latter had been killed the cause of quarrel rendered the incident still more shocking it seemed that sir philip had left the army suddenly in consequence of being unable to pay a very considerable sum which he had lost to another volunteer at play he had changed his name and taken up his residence at rotterdam where he had insinuated himself into the good graces of an ancient and rich burgomaster and by his handsome person and graceful manners captivated the affections of his only child a very young person of great beauty and the heiress of much wealth delighted with the specious attractions of his proposed soninlaw the wealthy merchant whose idea of the british character was too high to admit of his taking any precaution to acquire evidence of his condition and circumstances gave his consent to the marriage it was about to be celebrated in the principal church of the city when it was interrupted by a singular occurrence captain falconer having been detached to rotterdam to bring up a part of the brigade of scottish auxiliaries who were in quarters there a person of consideration in the town to whom he had been formerly known proposed to him for amusement to go to the high church to see a countryman of his own married to the daughter of a wealthy burgomaster captain falconer went accordingly accompanied by his dutch acquaintance with a party of his friends and two or three officers of the scotch brigade his astonishment may be conceived when he saw his own brotherinlaw a married man on the point of leading to the altar the innocent and beautiful creature upon whom he was about to practise a base and unmanly deceit he proclaimed his villany on the spot and the marriage was interrupted of course but against the opinion of more thinking men who considered sir philip forester as having thrown himself out of the rank of men of honour captain falconer admitted him to the privilege of such accepted a challenge from him and in the rencounter received a mortal wound such are the ways of heaven mysterious in our eyes lady forester never recovered the shock of this dismal intelligence and did this tragedy said i take place exactly at the time when the scene in the mirror was exhibited it is hard to be obliged to maim ones story answered my aunt but to speak the truth it happened some days sooner than the apparition was exhibited and so there remained a possibility said i that by some secret and speedy communication the artist might have received early intelligence of that incident the incredulous pretended so replied my aunt what became of the adept demanded i why a warrant came down shortly afterwards to arrest him for high treason as an agent of the chevalier st george and lady bothwell recollecting the hints which had escaped the doctor an ardent friend of the protestant succession did then call to remembrance that this man was chiefly prone among the ancient matrons of her own political persuasion it certainly seemed probable that intelligence from the continent which could easily have been transmitted by an active and powerful agent might have enabled him to prepare such a scene of phantasmagoria as she had herself witnessed yet there were so many difficulties in assigning a natural explanation that to the day of her death she remained in great doubt on the subject and much disposed to cut the gordian knot by admitting the existence of supernatural agency but my dear aunt said i what became of the man of skill oh he was too good a fortuneteller not to be able to foresee that his own destiny would be tragical if he waited the arrival of the man with the silver greyhound upon his sleeve he made as we say a moonlight flitting and was nowhere to be seen or heard of some noise there was about papers or letters found in the house but it died away and doctor baptisti damiotti was soon as little talked of as galen or hippocrates and sir philip forester said i did he too vanish for ever from the public scene no replied my kind informer he was heard of once more and it was upon a remarkable occasion it is said that we scots when there was such a nation in existence have among our full peck of virtues one or two little barleycorns of vice in particular it is alleged that we rarely forgive and never forget any injuries received that we used to make an idol of our resentment as poor lady constance did of her grief and are addicted as burns says to nursing our wrath to keep it warm lady bothwell was not without this feeling and i believe nothing whatever scarce the restoration of the stuart line could have happened so delicious to her feelings as an opportunity of being revenged on sir philip forester for the deep and double injury which had deprived her of a sister and of a brother but nothing of him was heard or known till many a year had passed away at length it was on a fasterns een shrovetide assembly at which the whole fashion of edinburgh attended full and frequent and when lady bothwell had a seat amongst the lady patronesses that one of the attendants on the company whispered into her ear that a gentleman wished to speak with her in private in private and in an assemblyroom he must be mad tell him to call upon me tomorrow morning i said so my lady answered the man but he desired me to give you this paper she undid the billet which was curiously folded and sealed it only bore the words on business of life and death written in a hand which she had never seen before suddenly it occurred to her that it might concern the safety of some of her political friends she therefore followed the messenger to a small apartment where the refreshments were prepared and from which the general company was excluded she found an old man who at her approach rose up and bowed profoundly his appearance indicated a broken constitution and his dress though sedulously rendered conforming to the etiquette of a ballroom was worn and tarnished and hung in folds about his emaciated person lady bothwell was about to feel for her purse expecting to get rid of the supplicant at the expense of a little money but some fear of a mistake arrested her purpose she therefore gave the man leisure to explain himself i have the honour to speak with the lady bothwell i am lady bothwell allow me to say that this is no time or place for long explanations what are your commands with me your ladyship said the old man had once a sister true whom i loved as my own soul and a brother the bravest the kindest the most affectionate said lady bothwell both these beloved relatives you lost by the fault of an unfortunate man continued the stranger by the crime of an unnatural bloodyminded murderer said the lady i am answered replied the old man bowing as if to withdraw stop sir i command you said lady bothwell who are you that at such a place and time come to recall these horrible recollections i insist upon knowing i am one who intends lady bothwell no injury but on the contrary to offer her the means of doing a deed of christian charity which the world would wonder at and which heaven would reward but i find her in no temper for such a sacrifice as i was prepared to ask speak out sir what is your meaning said lady bothwell the wretch that has wronged you so deeply rejoined the stranger is now on his deathbed his days have been days of misery his nights have been sleepless hours of anguish yet he cannot die without your forgiveness his life has been an unremitting penance yet he dares not part from his burden while your curses load his soul tell him said lady bothwell sternly to ask pardon of that being whom he has so greatly offended not of an erring mortal like himself what could my forgiveness avail him much answered the old man it will be an earnest of that which he may then venture to ask from his creator lady and from yours remember lady bothwell you too have a deathbed to look forward to your soul may all human souls must feel the awe of facing the judgment seat with the wounds of an untented conscience raw and rankling what thought would it be then that should whisper i have given no mercy how then shall i ask it man whosoever thou mayst be replied lady bothwell urge me not so cruelly it would be but blasphemous hypocrisy lo utter with my lips the words which every throb of my heart protests against they would open the earth and give to light the wasted form of my sister the bloody form of my murdered brother forgive him never never great god cried the old man holding up his hands is it thus the worms which thou hast called out of dust obey the commands of their maker farewell proud and unforgiving woman exult that thou hast added to a death in want and pain the agonies of religious despair but never again mock heaven by petitioning for the pardon which thou host refused to grant he was turning from her stop she exclaimed i will try yes i will try to pardon him gracious lady said the old man you will relieve the overburdened soul which dare not sever itself from its sinful companion of earth without being at peace with you what do i know your forgiveness may perhaps preserve for penitence the dregs of a wretched life ha said the lady as a sudden light broke on her it is the villain himself and grasping sir philip forester for it was he and no other by the collar she raised a cry of murder murder seize the murderer at an exclamation so singular in such a place the company thronged into the apartment but sir philip forester was no longer there he had forcibly extricated himself from lady bothwells hold and had run out of the apartment which opened on the landingplace of the stair there seemed no escape in that direction for there were several persons coming up the steps and others descending but the unfortunate man was desperate he threw himself over the balustrade and alighted safely in the lobby though a leap of fifteen feet at least then dashed into the street and was lost in darkness some of the bothwell family made pursuit and had they come up with the fugitive they might have perhaps slain him for in those days mens blood ran warm in their veins but the police did not interfere the matter most criminal having happened long since and in a foreign land indeed it was always thought that this extraordinary scene originated in a hypocritical experiment by which sir philip desired to ascertain whether he might return to his native country in safety from the resentment of a family which he had injured so deeply as the result fell out so contrary to his wishes he is believed to have returned to the continent and there died in exile so closed the tale of the mysterious mirror the tapestried chamber or the lady in the sacque this is another little story from the keepsake of it was told to me many years ago by the late miss anna seward who among other accomplishments that rendered her an amusing inmate in a country house had that of recounting narratives of this sort with very considerable effect much greater indeed than any one would be apt to guess from the style of her written performances there are hours and moods when most people are not displeased to listen to such things and i have heard some of the greatest and wisest of my contemporaries take their share in telling them august the following narrative is given from the pen so far as memory permits in the same character in which it was presented to the authors ear nor has he claim to farther praise or to be more deeply censured than in proportion to the good or bad judgment which he has employed in selecting his materials as he has studiously avoided any attempt at ornament which might interfere with the simplicity of the tale at the same time it must be admitted that the particular class of stories which turns on the marvellous possesses a stronger influence when told than when committed to print the volume taken up at noonday though rehearsing the same incidents conveys a much more feeble impression than is achieved by the voice of the speaker on a circle of fireside auditors who hang upon the narrative as the narrator details the minute incidents which serve to give it authenticity and lowers his voice with an affectation of mystery while he approaches the fearful and wonderful part it was with such advantages that the present writer heard the following events related more than twenty years since by the celebrated miss seward of litchfield who to her numerous accomplishments added in a remarkable degree the power of narrative in private conversation in its present form the tale must necessarily lose all the interest which was attached to it by the flexible voice and intelligent features of the gifted narrator yet still read aloud to an undoubting audience by the doubtful light of the closing evening or in silence by a decaying taper and amidst the solitude of a halflighted apartment it may redeem its character as a good ghost story miss seward always affirmed that she had derived her information from an authentic source although she suppressed the names of the two persons chiefly concerned i will not avail myself of any particulars i may have since received concerning the localities of the detail but suffer them to rest under the same general description in which they were first related to me and for the same reason i will not add to or diminish the narrative by any circumstances whether more or less material but simply rehearse as i heard it a story of supernatural terror about the end of the american war when the officers of lord cornwalliss army which surrendered at yorktown and others who had been made prisoners during the impolitic and illfated controversy were returning to their own country to relate their adventures and repose themselves after their fatigues there was amongst them a general officer to whom miss s gave the name of browne but merely as i understood to save the inconvenience of introducing a nameless agent in the narrative he was an officer of merit as well as a gentleman of high consideration for family and attainments some business had carried general browne upon a tour through the western counties when in the conclusion of a morning stage he found himself in the vicinity of a small country town which presented a scene of uncommon beauty and of a character peculiarly english the little town with its stately church whose tower bore testimony to the devotion of ages long past lay amidst pasture and cornfields of small extent but bounded and divided with hedgerow timber of great age and size there were few marks of modern improvement the environs of the place intimated neither the solitude of decay nor the bustle of novelty the houses were old but in good repair and the beautiful little river murmured freely on its way to the left of the town neither restrained by a dam nor bordered by a towingpath upon a gentle eminence nearly a mile to the southward of the town were seen amongst many venerable oaks and tangled thickets the turrets of a castle as old as the wars of york and lancaster but which seemed to have received important alterations during the age of elizabeth and her successors it had not been a place of great size but whatever accommodation it formerly afforded was it must be supposed still to be obtained within its walls at least such was the inference which general browne drew from observing the smoke arise merrily from several of the ancient wreathed and carved chimneystalks the wall of the park ran alongside of the highway for two or three hundred yards and through the different points by which the eye found glimpses into the woodland scenery it seemed to be well stocked other points of view opened in succession now a full one of the front of the old castle and now a side glimpse at its particular towers the former rich in all the bizarrerie of the elizabethan school while the simple arid solid strength of other parts of the building seemed to show that they had been raised more for defence than ostentation delighted with the partial glimpses which he obtained of the castle through the woods and glades by which this ancient feudal fortress was surrounded our military traveller was determined to inquire whether it might not deserve a nearer view and whether it contained family pictures or other objects of curiosity worthy of a strangers visit when leaving the vicinity of the park he rolled through a clean and wellpaved street and stopped at the door of a wellfrequented inn before ordering horses to proceed on his journey general browne made inquiries concerning the proprietor of the chateau which had so attracted his admiration and was equally surprised and pleased at hearing in reply a nobleman named whom we shall call lord woodville how fortunate much of brownes early recollections both at school and at college had been connected with young woodville whom by a few questions he now ascertained to be the same with the owner of this fair domain he had been raised to the peerage by the decease of his father a few months before and as the general learned from the landlord the term of mourning being ended was now taking possession of his paternal estate in the jovial season of merry autumn accompanied by a select party of friends to enjoy the sports of a country famous for game this was delightful news to our traveller frank woodville had been richard brownes fag at eton and his chosen intimate at christ church their pleasures and their tasks had been the same and the honest soldiers heart warmed to find his early friend in possession of so delightful a residence and of an estate as the landlord assured him with a nod and a wink fully adequate to maintain and add to his dignity nothing was more natural than that the traveller should suspend a journey which there was nothing to render hurried to pay a visit to an old friend under such agreeable circumstances the fresh horses therefore had only the brief task of conveying the generals travelling carriage to woodville castle a porter admitted them at a modern gothic lodge built in that style to correspond with the castle itself and at the same time rang a bell to give warning of the approach of visitors apparently the sound of the bell had suspended the separation of the company bent on the various amusements of the morning for on entering the court of the chateau several young men were lounging about in their sporting dresses looking at and criticising the dogs which the keepers held in readiness to attend their pastime as general browne alighted the young lord came to the gate of the hall and for an instant gazed as at a stranger upon the countenance of his friend on which war with its fatigues and its wounds had made a great alteration but the uncertainty lasted no longer than till the visitor had spoken and the hearty greeting which followed was such as can only be exchanged betwixt those who have passed together the merry days of careless boyhood or early youth if i could have formed a wish my dear browne said lord woodville it would have been to have you here of all men upon this occasion which my friends are good enough to hold as a sort of holyday do not think you have been unwatched during the years you have been absent from us i have traced you through your dangers your triumphs your misfortunes and was delighted to see that whether in victory or defeat the name of my old friend was always distinguished with applause the general made a suitable reply and congratulated his friend on his new dignities and the possession of a place and domain so beautiful nay you have seen nothing of it as yet said lord woodville and i trust you do not mean to leave us till you are better acquainted with it it is true i confess that my present party is pretty large and the old house like other places of the kind does not possess so much accommodation as the extent of the outward walls appears to promise but we can give you a comfortable oldfashioned room and i venture to suppose that your campaigns have taught you to be glad of worse quarters the general shrugged his shoulders and laughed i presume he said the worst apartment in your chateau is considerably superior to the old tobaccocask in which i was fain to take up my nights lodging when i was in the bush as the virginians call it with the light corps there i lay like diogenes himself so delighted with my covering from the elements that i made a vain attempt to have it rolled on to my next quarters but my commander for the time would give way to no such luxurious provision and i took farewell of my beloved cask with tears in my eyes well then since you do not fear your quarters said lord woodville you will stay with me a week at least of guns dogs fishingrods flies and means of sport by sea and land we have enough and to spare you cannot pitch on an amusement but we will pitch on the means of pursuing it but if you prefer the gun and pointers i will go with you myself and see whether you have mended your shooting since you have been amongst the indians of the back settlements the general gladly accepted his friendly hosts proposal in all its points after a morning of manly exercise the company met at dinner where it was the delight of lord woodville to conduce to the display of the high properties of his recovered friend so as to recommend him to his guests most of whom were persons of distinction he led general browne to speak of the scenes he had witnessed and as every word marked alike the brave officer and the sensible man who retained possession of his cool judgment under the most imminent dangers the company looked upon the soldier with general respect as no one who had proved himself possessed of an uncommon portion of personal courage that attribute of all others of which every body desires to be thought possessed the day at woodville castle ended as usual in such mansions the hospitality stopped within the limits of good order music in which the young lord was a proficient succeeded to the circulation of the bottle cards and billiards for those who preferred such amusements were in readiness but the exercise of the morning required early hours and not long after eleven oclock the guests began to retire to their several apartments the young lord himself conducted his friend general browne to the chamber destined for him which answered the description he had given of it being comfortable but oldfashioned the bed was of the massive form used in the end of the seventeenth century and the curtains of faded silk heavily trimmed with tarnished gold but then the sheets pillows and blankets looked delightful to the campaigner when he thought of his mansion the cask there was an air of gloom in the tapestry hangings which with their wornout graces curtained the walls of the little chamber and gently undulated as the autumnal breeze found its way through the ancient latticewindow which pattered and whistled as the air gained entrance the toilet too with its mirror turbaned after the manner of the beginning of the century with a coiffure of murreycoloured silk and its hundred strangeshaped boxes providing for arrangements which had been obsolete for more than fifty years had an antique and in so far a melancholy aspect but nothing could blaze more brightly and cheerfully than the two large wax candles or if aught could rival them it was the flaming bickering fagots in the chimney that sent at once their gleam and their warmth through the snug apartment which notwithstanding the general antiquity of its appearance was not wanting in the least convenience that modern habits rendered either necessary or desirable this is an oldfashioned sleeping apartment general said the young lord but i hope you will find nothing that makes you envy your old tobaccocask i am not particular respecting my lodgings replied the general yet were i to make any choice i would prefer this chamber by many degrees to the gayer and more modern rooms of your family mansion believe me that when i unite its modern air of comfort with its venerable antiquity and recollect that it is your lordships property i shall feel in better quarters here than if i were in the best hotel london could afford i trust i have no doubt that you will find yourself as comfortable as i wish you my dear general said the young nobleman and once more bidding his guest goodnight he shook him by the hand and withdrew the general again looked round him and internally congratulating himself on his return to peaceful life the comforts of which were endeared by the recollection of the hardships and dangers he had lately sustained undressed himself and prepared himself for a luxurious nights rest here contrary to the custom of this species of tale we leave the general in possession of his apartment until the next morning the company assembled for breakfast at an early hour but without the appearance of general browne who seemed the guest that lord woodville was desirous of honouring above all whom his hospitality had assembled around him he more than once expressed surprise at the generals absence and at length sent a servant to make inquiry after him the man brought back information that general browne had been walking abroad since an early hour of the morning in defiance of the weather which was misty and ungenial the custom of a soldier said the young nobleman to his friends many of them acquire habitual vigilance and cannot sleep after the early hour at which their duty usually commands them to be alert yet the explanation which lord woodville thus offered to the company seemed hardly satisfactory to his own mind and it was in a fit of silence and abstraction that he awaited the return of the general it took place near an hour after the breakfast bell had rung he looked fatigued and feverish his hair the powdering and arrangement of which was at this time one of the most important occupations of a mans whole day and marked his fashion as much as in the present time the tying of a cravat or the want of one was dishevelled uncurled void of powder and dank with dew his clothes were huddled on with a careless negligence remarkable in a military man whose real or supposed duties are usually held to include some attention to the toilet and his looks were haggard and ghastly in a peculiar degree so you have stolen a march upon us this morning my dear general said lord woodville or you have not found your bed so much to your mind as i had hoped and you seemed to expect how did you rest last night oh excellently well remarkably well never better in my life said general browne rapidly and yet with an air of embarrassment which was obvious to his friend he then hastily swallowed a cup of tea and neglecting or refusing whatever else was offered seemed to fall into a fit of abstraction you will take the gun today general said his friend and host but had to repeat the question twice ere he received the abrupt answer no my lord i am sorry i cannot have the honour of spending another day with your lordship my post horses are ordered and will be here directly all who were present showed surprise and lord woodville immediately replied post horses my good friend what can you possibly want with them when you promised to stay with me quietly for at least a week i believe said the general obviously much embarrassed that i might in the pleasure of my first meeting with your lordship have said something about stopping here a few days but i have since found it altogether impossible that is very extraordinary answered the young nobleman you seemed quite disengaged yesterday and you cannot have had a summons today for our post has not come up from the town and therefore you cannot have received any letters general browne without giving any farther explanation muttered something of indispensable business and insisted on the absolute necessity of his departure in a manner which silenced all opposition on the part of his host who saw that his resolution was taken and forbore farther importunity at least however he said permit me my dear browne since go you will or must to show you the view from the terrace which the mist that is now rising will soon display he threw open a sash window and stepped down upon the terrace as he spoke the general followed him mechanically but seemed little to attend to what his host was saying as looking across an extended and rich prospect he pointed out the different objects worthy of observation thus they moved on till lord woodville had attained his purpose of drawing his guest entirely apart from the rest of the company when turning round upon him with an air of great solemnity he addressed him thus richard browne my old and very dear friend we are now alone let me conjure you to answer me upon the word of a friend and the honour of a soldier how did you in reality rest during last night most wretchedly indeed my lord answered the general in the same tone of solemnity so miserably that i would not run the risk of such a second night not only for all the lands belonging to this castle but for all the country which i see from this elevated point of view this is most extraordinary said the young lord as if speaking to himself then there must be something in the reports concerning that apartment again turning to the general he said for gods sake my dear friend be candid with me and let me know the disagreeable particulars which have befallen you under a roof where with consent of the owner you should have met nothing save comfort the general seemed distressed by this appeal and paused a moment before he replied my dear lord he at length said what happened to me last night is of a nature so peculiar and so unpleasant that i could hardly bring myself to detail it even to your lordship were it not that independent of my wish to gratify any request of yours i think that sincerity on my part may lead to some explanation about a circumstance equally painful and mysterious to others the communication i am about to make might place me in the light of a weakminded superstitious fool who suffered his own imagination to delude and bewilder him but you have known me in childhood and youth and will not suspect me of having adopted in manhood the feelings and frailties from which my early years were free here he paused and his friend replied do not doubt my perfect confidence in the truth of your communication however strange it may be replied lord woodville i know your firmness of disposition too well to suspect you could be made the object of imposition and am aware that your honour and your friendship will equally deter you from exaggerating whatever you may have witnessed well then said the general i will proceed with my story as well as i can relying upon your candour and yet distinctly feeling that i would rather face a battery than recall to my mind the odious recollections of last night he paused a second time and then perceiving that lord woodville remained silent and in an attitude of attention he commenced though not without obvious reluctance the history of his nights adventures in the tapestried chamber i undressed and went to bed so soon as your lordship left me yesterday evening but the wood in the chimney which nearly fronted my bed blazed brightly and cheerfully and aided by a hundred exciting recollections of my childhood and youth which had been recalled by the unexpected pleasure of meeting your lordship prevented me from falling immediately asleep i ought however to say that these reflections were all of a pleasant and agreeable kind grounded on a sense of having for a time exchanged the labour fatigues and dangers of my profession for the enjoyments of a peaceful life and the reunion of those friendly and affectionate ties which i had torn asunder at the rude summons of war while such pleasing reflections were stealing over my mind and gradually lulling me to slumber i was suddenly aroused by a sound like that of the rustling of a silken gown and the tapping of a pair of highheeled shoes as if a woman were walking in the apartment ere i could draw the curtain to see what the matter was the figure of a little woman passed between the bed and the fire the back of this form was turned to me and i could observe from the shoulders and neck it was that of an old woman whose dress was an oldfashioned gown which i think ladies call a sacque that is a sort of robe completely loose in the body but gathered into broad plaits upon the neck and shoulders which fall down to the ground and terminate in a species of train i thought the intrusion singular enough but never harboured for a moment the idea that what i saw was any thing more than the mortal form of some old woman about the establishment who had a fancy to dress like her grandmother and who having perhaps as your lordship mentioned that you were rather straitened for room been dislodged from her chamber for my accommodation had forgotten the circumstance and returned by twelve to her old haunt under this persuasion i moved myself in bed and coughed a little to make the intruder sensible of my being in possession of the premises she turned slowly round but gracious heaven my lord what a countenance did she display to me there was no longer any question what she was or any thought of her being a living being upon a face which wore the fixed features of a corpse were imprinted the traces of the vilest and most hideous passions which had animated her while she lived the body of some atrocious criminal seemed to have been given up from the grave and the soul restored from the penal fire in order to form for a space a union with the ancient accomplice of its guilt i started up in bed and sat upright supporting myself on my palms as i gazed on this horrible spectre the hag made as it seemed a single and swift stride to the bed where i lay and squatted herself down upon it in precisely the same attitude which i had assumed in the extremity of horror advancing her diabolical countenance within half a yard of mine with a grin which seemed to intimate the malice and the derision of an incarnate fiend here general browne stopped and wiped from his brow the cold perspiration with which the recollection of his horrible vision had covered it my lord he said i am no coward i have been in all the mortal dangers incidental to my profession and i may truly boast that no man ever knew richard browne dishonour the sword he wears but in these horrible circumstances under the eyes and as it seemed almost in the grasp of an incarnation of an evil spirit all firmness forsook me all manhood melted from me like wax in the furnace and i felt my hair individually bristle the current of my lifeblood ceased to flow and i sank back in a swoon as very a victim to panic terror as ever was a village girl or a child of ten years old how long i lay in this condition i cannot pretend to guess but i was roused by the castle clock striking one so loud that it seemed as if it were in the very room it was some time before i dared open my eyes lest they should again encounter the horrible spectacle when however i summoned courage to look up she was no longer visible my first idea was to pull my bell wake the servants and remove to a garret or a hayloft to be ensured against a second visitation nay i will confess the truth that my resolution was altered not by the shame of exposing myself but by the fear that as the bellcord hung by the chimney i might in making my way to it be again crossed by the fiendish hag who i figured to myself might be still lurking about some corner of the apartment i will not pretend to describe what hot and cold feverfits tormented me for the rest of the night through broken sleep weary vigils and that dubious state which forms the neutral ground between them a hundred terrible objects appeared to haunt me but there was the great difference betwixt the vision which i have described and those which followed that i knew the last to be deceptions of my own fancy and overexcited nerves day at last appeared and i rose from my bed ill in health and humiliated in mind i was ashamed of myself as a man and a soldier and still more so at feeling my own extreme desire to escape from the haunted apartment which however conquered all other considerations so that huddling on my clothes with the most careless haste i made my escape from your lordships mansion to seek in the open air some relief to my nervous system shaken as it was by this horrible encounter with a visitant for such i must believe her from the other world your lordship has now heard the cause of my discomposure and of my sudden desire to leave your hospitable castle in other places i trust we may often meet but god protect me from ever spending a second night under that roof strange as the generals tale was he spoke with such a deep air of conviction that it cut short all the usual commentaries which are made on such stories lord woodville never once asked him if he was sure he did not dream of the apparition or suggested any of the possibilities by which it is fashionable to explain supernatural appearances as wild vagaries of the fancy or deceptions of the optic nerves on the contrary he seemed deeply impressed with the truth and reality of what he had heard and after a considerable pause regretted with much appearance of sincerity that his early friend should in his house have suffered so severely i am the more sorry for your pain my dear browne he continued that it is the unhappy though most unexpected result of an experiment of my own you must know that for my father and grandfathers time at least the apartment which was assigned to you last night had been shut on account of reports that it was disturbed by supernatural sights and noises when i came a few weeks since into possession of the estate i thought the accommodation which the castle afforded for my friends was not extensive enough to permit the inhabitants of the invisible world to retain possession of a comfortable sleeping apartment i therefore caused the tapestried chamber as we call it to be opened and without destroying its air of antiquity i had such new articles of furniture placed in it as became the modern times yet as the opinion that the room was haunted very strongly prevailed among the domestics and was also known in the neighbourhood and to many of my friends i feared some prejudice might be entertained by the first occupant of the tapestried chamber which might tend to revive the evil report which it had laboured under and so disappoint my purpose of rendering it a useful part of the house i must confess my dear browne that your arrival yesterday agreeable to me for a thousand reasons besides seemed the most favourable opportunity of removing the unpleasant rumours which attached to the room since your courage was indubitable and your mind free of any pre occupation on the subject i could not therefore have chosen a more fitting subject for my experiment upon my life said general browne somewhat hastily i am infinitely obliged to your lordship very particularly indebted indeed i am likely to remember for some time the consequences of the experiment as your lordship is pleased to call it nay now you are unjust my dear friend said lord woodville you have only to reflect for a single moment in order to be convinced that i could not augur the possibility of the pain to which you have been so unhappily exposed i was yesterday morning a complete sceptic on the subject of supernatural appearances nay i am sure that had i told you what was said about that room those very reports would have induced you by your own choice to select it for your accommodation it was my misfortune perhaps my error but really cannot be termed my fault that you have been afflicted so strangely strangely indeed said the general resuming his good temper and i acknowledge that i have no right to be offended with your lordship for treating me like what i used to think myself a man of some firmness and courage but i see my post horses are arrived and i must not detain your lordship from your amusement nay my old friend said lord woodville since you cannot stay with us another day which indeed i can no longer urge give me at least half an hour more you used to love pictures and i have a gallery of portraits some of them by vandyke representing ancestry to whom this property and castle formerly belonged i think that several of them will strike you as possessing merit general browne accepted the invitation though somewhat unwillingly it was evident he was not to breathe freely or at ease till he left woodville castle far behind him he could not refuse his friends invitation however and the less so that he was a little ashamed of the peevishness which he had displayed towards his wellmeaning entertainer the general therefore followed lord woodville through several rooms into a long gallery hung with pictures which the latter pointed out to his guest telling the names and giving some account of the personages whose portraits presented themselves in progression general browne was but little interested in the details which these accounts conveyed to him they were indeed of the kind which are usually found in an old family gallery here was a cavalier who had ruined the estate in the royal cause there a fine lady who had reinstated it by contracting a match with a wealthy roundhead there hung a gallant who had been in danger for corresponding with the exiled court at st germains here one who had taken arms for william at the revolution and there a third that had thrown his weight alternately into the scale of whig and tory while lord woodville was cramming these words into his guests ear against the stomach of his sense they gained the middle of the gallery when he beheld general browne suddenly start and assume an attitude of the utmost surprise not unmixed with fear as his eyes were caught and suddenly riveted by a portrait of an old lady in a sacque the fashionable dress of the end of the seventeenth century there she is he exclaimed there she is in form and features though inferior in demoniac expression to the accursed hag who visited me last night if that be the case said the young nobleman there can remain no longer any doubt of the horrible reality of your apparition that is the picture of a wretched ancestress of mine of whose crimes a black and fearful catalogue is recorded in a family history in my charter chest the recital of them would be too horrible it is enough to say that in yon fatal apartment incest and unnatural murder were committed i will restore it to the solitude to which the better judgment of those who preceded me had consigned it and never shall any one so long as i can prevent it be exposed to a repetition of the supernatural horrors which could shake such courage as yours thus the friends who had met with such glee parted in a very different mood lord woodville to command the tapestried chamber to be unmantled and the door built up and general browne to seek in some less beautiful country and with some less dignified friend forgetfulness of the painful night which he had passed in woodville castle death of the lairds jock the manner in which this trifle was introduced at the time to mr fm reynolds editor of the keepsake of leaves no occasion for a preface august to the editor of the keepsake you have asked me sir to point out a subject for the pencil and i feel the difficulty of complying with your request although i am not certainly unaccustomed to literary composition or a total stranger to the stores of history and tradition which afford the best copies for the painters art but although sicut pictura poesis is an ancient and undisputed axiom although poetry and painting both address themselves to the same object of exciting the human imagination by presenting to it pleasing or sublime images of ideal scenes yet the one conveying itself through the ears to the understanding and the other applying itself only to the eyes the subjects which are best suited to the bard or taleteller are often totally unfit for painting where the artist must present in a single glance all that his art has power to tell us the artist can neither recapitulate the past nor intimate the future the single now is all which he can present and hence unquestionably many subjects which delight us in poetry or in narrative whether real or fictitious cannot with advantage be transferred to the canvass being in some degree aware of these difficulties though doubtless unacquainted both with their extent and the means by which they may be modified or surmounted i have nevertheless ventured to draw up the following traditional narrative as a story in which when the general details are known the interest is so much concentrated in one strong moment of agonizing passion that it can be understood and sympathized with at a single glance i therefore presume that it may be acceptable as a hint to some one among the numerous artists who have of late years distinguished themselves as rearing up and supporting the british school enough has been said and sung about the wellcontested ground the warlike borderland to render the habits of the tribes who inhabited them before the union of england and scotland familiar to most of your readers the rougher and sterner features of their character were softened by their attachment to the fine arts from which has arisen the saying that on the frontiers every dale had its battle and every river its song a rude species of chivalry was in constant use and single combats were practised as the amusement of the few intervals of truce which suspended the exercise of war the inveteracy of this custom may be inferred from the following incident bernard gilpin the apostle of the north the first who undertook to preach the protestant doctrines to the border dalesmen was surprised on entering one of their churches to see a gauntlet or mailglove hanging above the altar upon inquiring the meaning of a symbol so indecorous being displayed in that sacred place he was informed by the clerk that the glove was that of a famous swordsman who hung it there as an emblem of a general challenge and gage of battle to any who should dare to take the fatal token down reach it to me said the reverend churchman the clerk and sexton equally declined the perilous office and the good bernard gilpin was obliged to remove the glove with his own hands desiring those who were present to inform the champion that he and no other had possessed himself of the gage of defiance but the champion was as much ashamed to face bernard gilpin as the officials of the church had been to displace his pledge of combat the date of the following story is about the latter years of queen elizabeths reign and the events took place in liddesdale a hilly and pastoral district of roxburghshire which on a part of its boundary is divided from england only by a small river during the good old times of rugging and riving that is tugging and tearing under which term the disorderly doings of the warlike age are affectionately remembered this valley was principally cultivated by the sept or clan of the armstrongs the chief of this warlike race was the laird of mangertown at the period of which i speak the estate of mangertown with the power and dignity of chief was possessed by john armstrong a man of great size strength and courage while his father was alive he was distinguished from others of his clan who bore the same name by the epithet of the lairds jock that is to say the lairds son jock or jack this name he distinguished by so many bold and desperate achievements that he retained it even after his fathers death and is mentioned under it both in authentic records and in tradition some of his feats are recorded in the minstrelsy of the scottish border and others mentioned in contemporary chronicles at the species of singular combat which we have described the lairds jock was unrivalled and no champion of cumberland westmoreland or northumberland could endure the sway of the huge twohanded sword which he wielded and which few others could even lift this awful sword as the common people term it was as dear to him as durindana or fushberta to their respective masters and was nearly as formidable to his enemies as those renowned falchions proved to the foes of christendom the weapon had been bequeathed to him by a celebrated english outlaw named hobbie noble who having committed some deed for which he was in danger from justice fled to liddesdale and became a follower or rather a brotherinarms to the renowned lairds jock till venturing into england with a small escort a faithless guide and with a light singlehanded sword instead of his ponderous brand hobbie noble attacked by superior numbers was made prisoner and executed with this weapon and by means of his own strength and address the lairds jock maintained the reputation of the best swordsman on the border side and defeated or slew many who ventured to dispute with him the formidable title but years pass on with the strong and the brave as with the feeble and the timid in process of time the lairds jock grew incapable of wielding his weapon and finally of all active exertion even of the most ordinary kind the disabled champion became at length totally bed ridden and entirely dependent for his comfort on the pious duties of an only daughter his perpetual attendant and companion besides this dutiful child the lairds jock had an only son upon whom devolved the perilous task of leading the clan to battle and maintaining the warlike renown of his native country which was now disputed by the english upon many occasions the young armstrong was active brave and strong and brought home from dangerous adventures many tokens of decided success still the ancient chief conceived as it would seem that his son was scarce yet entitled by age and experience to be entrusted with the twohanded sword by the use of which he had himself been so dreadfully distinguished at length an english champion one of the name of foster if i rightly recollect had the audacity to send a challenge to the best swordsman in liddesdale and young armstrong burning for chivalrous distinction accepted the challenge the heart of the disabled old man swelled with joy when he heard that the challenge was passed and accepted and the meeting fixed at a neutral spot used as the place of rencontre upon such occasions and which he himself had distinguished by numerous victories he exulted so much in the conquest which he anticipated that to nerve his son to still bolder exertions he conferred upon him as champion of his clan and province the celebrated weapon which he had hitherto retained in his own custody this was not all when the day of combat arrived the lairds jock in spite of his daughters affectionate remonstrances determined though he had not left his bed for two years to be a personal witness of the duel his will was still a law to his people who bore him on their shoulders wrapped in plaids and blankets to the spot where the combat was to take place and seated him on a fragment of rock which is still called the lairds jocks stone there he remained with eyes fixed on the lists or barrier within which the champions were about to meet his daughter having done all she could for his accommodation stood motionless beside him divided between anxiety for his health and for the event of the combat to her beloved brother ere yet the fight began the old men gazed on their chief now seen for the first time after several years and sadly compared his altered features and wasted frame with the paragon of strength and manly beauty which they once remembered the young men gazed on his large form and powerful make as upon some antediluvian giant who had survived the destruction of the flood but the sound of the trumpets on both sides recalled the attention of every one to the lists surrounded as they were by numbers of both nations eager to witness the event of the day the combatants met it is needless to describe the struggle the scottish champion fell foster placing his foot on his antagonist seized on the redoubted sword so precious in the eyes of its aged owner and brandished it over his head as a trophy of his conquest the english shouted in triumph but the despairing cry of the aged champion who saw his country dishonoured and his sword long the terror of their race in possession of an englishman was heard high above the acclamations of victory he seemed for an instant animated by all his wonted power for he started from the rock on which he sat and while the garments with which he had been invested fell from his wasted frame and showed the ruins of his strength he tossed his arms wildly to heaven and uttered a cry of indignation horror and despair which tradition says was heard to a preternatural distance and resembled the cry of a dying lion more than a human sound his friends received him in their arms as he sank utterly exhausted by the effort and bore him back to his castle in mute sorrow while his daughter at once wept for her brother and endeavoured to mitigate and soothe the despair of her father but this was impossible the old mans only tie to life was rent rudely asunder and his heart had broken with it the death of his son had no part in his sorrow if he thought of him at all it was as the degenerate boy through whom the honour of his country and clan had been lost and he died in the course of three days never even mentioning his name but pouring out uninterrupted lamentations for the loss of his sword i conceive that the instant when the disabled chief was roused into a last exertion by the agony of the moment is favourable to the object of a painter he might obtain the full advantage of contrasting the form of the rugged old man in the extremity of furious despair with the softness and beauty of the female form the fatal field might be thrown into perspective so as to give full effect to these two principal figures and with the single explanation that the piece represented a soldier beholding his son slain and the honour of his country lost the picture would be sufficiently intelligible at the first glance if it was thought necessary to show more clearly the nature of the conflict it might be indicated by the pennon of saint george being displayed at one end of the lists and that of saint andrew at the other i remain sir your obedient servant the author of waverley end of the waverley novels
