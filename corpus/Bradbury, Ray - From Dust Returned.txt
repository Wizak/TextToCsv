 ray bradbury from the dust returned long before the dust witch who traveled with darks pandemonium shows there was another born into death more than two thousand years earlier three hundred years before the crown of thorns the gethsemane garden and the empty tomb by born into death i mean the original skinandbones of nef grandmother to nefertiti beautiful long before the birth into life of the handsome princess whose oneeyed bust resides in world museums purchasable for a few dollars plus thirty pounds of synthetic marble this dust witch this royal mummy drifted on a dark boat past the empty mount of the sermon scraped over the rock at plymouth and landsailed to little fort in upper illinois surviving grants twilight assaults and lees pale dawn retreats one family owned their ancestor this particular egyptian mummy this great times twentytwo greats grandma they shipped her over land in a thin stone sarcophagus from which she was evicted when the tomb was needed for family baths stashed from room to room this small hemprope tobaccoleafbrown ancestral relic was lifted light as balsa wood to the upper attics where she was covered smothered then ignored by a family eager for survival and forgetful of unremembered deaths leftovers abandoned to attic silence and the drift of golden pollens on the air sucking in darkness as sustenance breathing out only quiet and serenity this ancient visitor waited for someone to pull aside the accumulated love letters toys melted candles and candelabra tattered skirts corsets and headlined papers from wars wonthenlost in instantly neglectful pasts the day for her rebirth came one hundred years after the shot that killed lincoln and stilled history nef from the mysterious isle arose into the light because someone had come and leafed through dug and tossed aside until just her head her face her sewnshut eyes were framed in autumn book leaves legal tracts and jackstraw mousebones and it was timothy light son of jonathan and priscilla dark who found and stared down upon her who are you he cried as if an answer were expected why are you here he asked and reply the old lost woman did i she whispered timothy stiffened am murmured the dust in the old womans lips what timothy bent so the dust touched his ear nef came the filtering blowing whisper behind the sewnshut eyes and the dry riverbed mouth nef timothy had heard the name remembered the name from ten years before when he was three your whispered the crumbs of sand falling from the edges of her mouth long she murmured lost she whispered an ces tor cant be issssss said the faint crack beginning to appear in the basrelief mouth no not so loud whispered her voice a ventriloquists thrownsyllables from two thousand years of quiet echoes you will shatter me and indeed platelets of dry sand fell from her bandaged shoulders hieroglyphs tattered on her breastplate how did you get here said timothy at last rather she said ask who called you here who he shouted softly she said who he said softly i said the dust witch nobody called and yet you heard the old woman spoke more clearly now with many syllables and many words look a tiny spiral of dust brushed along her ciphered bosom where gods of life and death posed as stiffly as tall rows of ancient corn and wheat timothys eyes grew wide well whispered her voice that he touched the face of a child sprang up in a field of holy beasts me indeed then it wasnt just me searching i was meant to find you why be cause it is the end the slow words fell like golden crumbs from her lips a rabbit thumped and ran in timothys chest end of what one of the sewn eyelids of the ancient woman gave the merest crack open to show a crystal gleam tucked within timothy glanced up at the attic beams where that gleam touched its light this he said our place yesssss came the whisper she sewed one eyelid back up but opened the other with light everyone in it meaning her fingers trembling across the pictographs on her bosom touched like a spider here then there as she whispered this timothy responded uncle einar he who has wings ive flown with him fortunate child and this my sister cecy she also flies with no wings she sends her mind out like ghosts which enters peoples ears to look out their eyes fortunate girl and this the spider fingers trembled there was no symbol where she pointed ah timothy laughed my cousin ran invisible doesnt need to fly can go anywhere and no one knows fortunate man and this and this and yet again her dry finger moved and scratched and timothy named all of the uncles and aunts and cousins and nieces and nephews who had lived in this house forever or a hundred years give or take bad weather storms or war there were thirty rooms and each more filled with cobweb and nightbloom and sneezes of ectoplasms that posed in mirror to be blown away when deaths head moths or funeral dragonflies sewed the air and flung the shutters wide to let the dark spill in timothy named each hieroglyphic face and the ancient woman gave the merest nod of her dusty head as her fingers lay on a final hieroglyph do i touch the maelstrom of darkness she asked this house yes and it was so there lay this very house embossed with lapis lazuli and trimmed with amber and gold as it must have been when lincoln went unheard at gettysburg and as he gazed the bright embossments began to shiver and flake an earthquake shook the frames and blinded the golden windows tonight mourned the dust turned in on itself but cried timothy after so long years why now it is the age of discovery and revelations the pictures that fly through the air the sounds that blow in the winds things seen by many things heard by all travelers on the road by the tens of millions no escape we have been found by the words in the air and the pictures sent on light beams into rooms where children and childrens parents sit while medusa with insect antennae coifs tells all and seeks punishment for what no reason is needed it is just the revelation of the hour the meaningless alarms and excursions of the week the panic of the single night no one asks but death and destruction are delivered as the children sit with their parents behind them frozen in an arctic spell of unwanted gossip and unneeded slander no matter the dumb will speak the stupid will assume and we are destroyed destroyed she echoed and the house on her bosom and the house beams above the boy shook waiting for more quakes the floods will soon arrive inundations tidal waters of men what have we done nothing we have survived all and those that come to drown us are envious of our lives for so many centuries because we are different we must be washed away hist and again her hieroglyphs shook and the attic sighed and creaked like a ship in a rising sea what can we do timothy asked escape to all directions they cannot follow so many flights the house must be vacant by midnight when they come with torches torches isnt it always fire and torches torches and fire yes timothy felt his tongue move stunned with remembrance i have seen films poor running people people running after and torches and fire well then call your sister cecy must warn all the rest this i have done cried a voice from nowhere cecy she is with us husked the old woman yes ive heard it all said the voice from the beams the window the closets the downward stairs i am in every room in every thought in every head the bureaus are being ransacked and the luggage packed long before midnight the house will be empty a bird unseen brushed timothys eyelids and ears and settled behind his gaze to blink out at nef indeed the beautiful one is here said cecy using timothys throat and mouth nonsense would you hear another reason why the weather will change and the floods will come indeed timothy felt the soft presence of his sister press against his windowed eyes eager for response tell us nef they hate me because i am the accumulation of the knowledge of death that knowledge is a burden to them instead of a proper responsibility can started timothy and cecy finished can death be remembered oh yes but only by the dead you the living are blind but we who have bathed in time and been reborn as children of the earth and inheritors of eternity drift gently in rivers of sand and streams of darkness knowing the bombardment from the stars whose emanations have taken millions of years to rain upon the land and seek us out in our plantations of eternally wrapped souls like great seeds beneath the marbled layers and the basrelief skeletons of reptile birds that fly on sandstone with wingspreads a million years wide and as deep as a single breath we are the keepers of time you who walk the earth know only the moment which is whisked away with your next exhalation because you move and live you cannot keep we are the granaries of dark remembrance our funerary jars keep not only our lights and silent hearts but our wells deeper than you can imagine where the subterrane of lost hours all the deaths that ever were the deaths on which mankind has built new tenements of flesh and ramparts of stone moving ever upward even as we sink down and down doused in twilights bandaged by midnights we accumulate we are wise with farewells would you not admit child that forty billion deaths are a great wisdom and those forty billion who shelf under the earth are a great gift to the living so that they might live i guess do not guess child know i will teach and that knowledge important to living because only death can set the world free to be born again that is your sweet burden and tonight is the night when your task begins now at which moment the bright medal in the center of her golden breast flared the light blazed up to swarm the ceiling like a thousand summer bees threatening by their very flight and friction to fire the dry beams the attic seemed to spin with the rasharound light and heat every slat shingle crossbeam groaned and expanded while timothy raised his arms and hands to ward off the swarms staring at the kindled bosom of nef fire he cried torches yes hissed the old old woman torches and fire nothing stays all bums and with this the architecture of the longbefore gettysburg appomattox house smoked on her breastplate nothing stays cried cecy everywhere at once like the fireflies and summer bees bumping to char the beams all goes and timothy blinked and bent to watch the winged man and the sleeping girl and the unseen uncle invisible save for his passing like the wind through clouds or snowstorms or wolves running in fields of black wheat or bats in wounded zigzag flights devouring the moon and a double dozen of other aunts and uncles and cousins striding the road away from town or soaring to lodge in trees a mile off and safe as the mob the torchlit madness flowed up old nefmums chest while off out the window you could see the real ones the mob with torches heading like a flow of lava on foot bike and car a storm of cries choking their throats even as timothy felt the floorboards shift like scales from which weights are dropped with seventy times a hundred pounds in flight they jumped overboard from porches the house skeleton shaken free grew tall as winds vacuumed the now empty rooms and flapped the ghost curtains and sucked the front door wide to welcome the torches and fire and the crazed mob in all goes cried cecy a final time and she abandoned their eyes and ears and bodies and minds and restored to her body below ran so lightly quickly her feet left no tread in the grass now said old nef you be my savior child lift and carry cant cried timothy i am dandelion seed and thistledown your breath will drift your heartbeat sustain me now and it was so with one exhalation a touch of his hands the wrapped gift from long before saviors and parted red seas arose on the air and seeing he could carry this parcel of dream and bones timothy wept and ran from a mile beyond the house which was now a pyre letting sparks and plumes darken the sky to stormcloud the moon timothy stopped under a tree where many of his cousins and perhaps cecy caught their breath even as a rickety jalopy braked and a farmer peered out at the distant blaze and the nearby child whats that he pointed his nose at the burning house wish i knew said timothy what you carrying boy the man scowled at the bindle under timothys elbow collect em said timothy old newspapers comic strips old magazines headlines heck some before the rough riders some before bull run trash and junk the bindle under his arm rustled in the night wind great junk swell trash just like me once the farmer laughed quietly no more and he drove away there was a tap at the door and dwight william alcott looked up from a display of photographs just sent on from some digs outside karnak he was feeling especially well fed visually or he would not have answered the tap he nodded which seemed signal enough for the door opened immediately and a bald head moved in i know this is curious said his assistant but there is a child here that is curious said dw alcott children do not usually come here he has no appointment no but he insists that after you see the gift he has for you youll make an appointment then an unusual way to make appointments mused alcott should i see this child a boy is it a brilliant boy so he tells me bearing an ancient treasure thats too much for me the curator laughed let him in i already am timothy half inside the door scuttled forward with a great rattling of stuffs under his arm sit down said dw alcott if you dont mind ill stand she might want two chairs sir however two chairs if you dont mind sir bring an extra chair smith yes sir and two chairs were brought and timothy lifted the long balsalight gift and placed it on both chairs where the bundled stuffs shown in a good light now young man timothy supplied the boy timothy im busy state your business please yes sir well two thousand four hundred years and million deaths sir my god thats quite a mouthful dw alcott waved at smith another chair the chair was brought now you really must sit down son timothy sat say that again id rather not sir it sounds like a lie and yet said dw alcott slowly why do i believe you i have that kind of face sir the curator of the museum leaned forward to study the pale and intense face of the boy by god he murmured you do and what have we here he went on nodding to what appeared to be a catafalque it looks like a bunch of old papers said the boy unblinking and looking only at the museum gentleman but its papyrus sir you know the name papyrus everyone knows that boys i suppose having to do with robbed tombs and tut boys know papyrus yes sir come look if you want the curator wanted for he was already on his feet he arrived to look down and probe as through a filing cabinet leaf by leaf of cured tobacco it almost seemed with here and there the head of a lion or the body of a hawk then his fingers riffled faster and faster and he gasped as if struck in the chest child he said and let out another breath where did you find these this not these sirs and i didnt find it it found me hide and seek in a way it said i heard then it wasnt hidden anymore my god gasped dw alcott using both hands now to open wounds of brittle stuff does this belong to you it works both ways sir it owns me i own it were family the curator glanced over at the boys eyes again he said i do believe thank god why do you thank god because if you didnt believe me id have to leave the boy edged away no no cried the curator no need but why do you speak as if this it owned you as if you are related because said timothy its nef sir nef timothy reached over and folded back a tissue of bandage from deep under the openings of papyrus the sewnshut eyes of the old old woman could be seen with a hidden creek of vision between the lids dust filtered from her lips nef sir said the boy mother of nefertiti the curator wandered back to his chair and reached for a crystal decanter do you drink wine boy not until today sir timothy sat for a long moment waiting until mr dw alcott handed him a small glass of wine they drank together and at last mr dw alcott said why have you brought this it her here its the only safe place in the world the curator nodded true are you offering he paused nef for sale no sir what do you want then just that if she stays here sir that once a day you talk to her embarrassed timothy looked at his shoes would you trust me to do that timothy timothy looked up oh yes sir if you promised then he went on raising his gaze to fix on the curator more than that listen to her she talks does she a lot sir is she talking now yes but you have to bend close im used to it now after a while you will be too the curator shut his eyes and listened there was a restle of ancient paper somewhere which wrinkled his face listening what he asked what is it she mainly says everything there is to say about death sir everything two thousand four hundred years like i said sir and million people who had to die so we can live thats a lot of dying yes sir but im glad what a terrible thing to say no sir because if they were alive we wouldnt be able to move or breathe i see what you mean she knows all that does she yes sir her daughter was the beautiful one who was there so she is the one who remembers the ghost that tells a flesh and soul complete history of the book of the dead i think so sir and one other thing added timothy and if you dont mind any time i want a visitors card so you can come visit any time after hours even i think that can be arranged son there will be papers to be signed of course and authentication carried out the boy nodded the man rose silly of me to ask is she still talking yes sir come close no closer the boy nudged the mans elbow gently far off near the temple of karnak the desert winds sighed far off between the paws of a great lion the dust settled listen said timothy
