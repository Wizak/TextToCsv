 chapter one helens story at the time of this story i was still living at my friend sherlock holmess flat in baker street in london very early one morning a young woman dressed in black came to see us she looked tired and unhappy and her face was very white im afraid afraid of death mr holmes she cried please help me im not thirty yet and look at my grey hair im so afraid just sit down and tell us your story said holmes kindly my name is helen stoner she began and i live with my stepfather dr grimesby roylott near a village in the country his family was once very rich but they had no money when my stepfather was born so he studied to be a doctor and went out to india he met and married my mother there when my sister julia and i were very young our father was dead you see your mother had some money perhaps asked sherlock holmes oh yes mother had a lot of money so my stepfather wasnt poor any more tell me more about him miss stoner said holmes well hes a violent man in india he once got angry with his indian servant and killed him he had to go to prison because of that and then we all came back to england mother died in an accident eight years ago so my stepfather got all her money but if julia or i marry he must pay us pounds every year and now you live with him in the country said holmes yes but he stays at home and never sees anybody mr holmes answered helen stoner hes more and more violent now and sometimes has fights with the people from the village everybodys afraid of him now and they run away when they see him and theyre also afraid of his indian wild animals which run freely around the garden a friend sends them to him from india and the animals are not the only wild things in the garden there are also gipsies my stepfather likes these wild people and they can come and go where they like poor julia and i had very unhappy lives we had no servants they always left because they were afraid of my stepfather and we had to do all the work in the house julia was only thirty when she died and her hair was already grey like my hair now when did she die asked sherlock holmes she died two years ago and thats why im here we never met anybody in the country but sometimes we visited some of my family who live near london there julia met a young man who asked to marry her my stepfather agreed but soon after this she died miss stoner put her hand over her eyes and cried for a minute sherlock holmes was listening with his eyes closed but now he opened them and looked at helen stoner tell me everything about her death he said i can remember it all very well it was a terrible time she answered our three bedrooms are all downstairs first there is my stepfathers room julias room is next to his and my room is next to julias the rooms all have windows on the garden side of the house and doors which open into the corridor one evening our stepfather was smoking his strong indian cigarettes in his room julia couldnt sleep because she could smell them in her room so she came into my room to talk to me before she went back to bed she said to me helen have you ever heard a whistle in the middle of the night i was surprised no i said its strange she said sometimes i hear a whistle but i dont know where it comes from why dont you hear it i laughed and said i sleep better than you do so julia went to her room and locked the door after her why did you lock your doors asked sherlock holmes we were afraid of the wild animals and the gipsies she answered please go on said holmes i couldnt sleep that night it was a very stormy night with a lot of wind and rain suddenly i heard a womans scream it was my sisters voice i ran into the corridor and just then i heard a whistle and a minute later the sound of falling metal i didnt know what it was i ran to my sisters door she opened it and fell to the ground her face was white and afraid and she was crying help me help me helen im ill im dying i put my arms around her and she cried out in a terrible voice helen oh my god helen it was the band the speckled band she wanted to say more but she couldnt i called my stepfather who tried to help her but we could do nothing and so my dear dear sister died are you sure about the whistle and the sound of falling metal asked holmes i think so answered helen but it was a very wild stormy night perhaps i made a mistake the police couldnt understand why my sister died her door was locked and nobody could get into her room they didnt find any poison in her body and what was the speckled band gipsies wear something like that round their necks i think she died because she was so afraid but i dont know what she was afraid of perhaps it was the gipsies what do you think mr holmes holmes thought for a minute hmm he said that is a difficult question but please go on that was two years ago helen stoner said i have been very lonely without my sister but a month ago a dear friend asked me to marry him my stepfather has agreed and so were going to marry soon but two days ago i had to move to my sisters old bedroom because some men are mending my bedroom wall and last night i heard that whistle again i ran out of the house immediately and came to london to ask for your help please help me mr holmes i dont want to die like julia we must move fast said holmes if we go to your house today can we look at these rooms but your stepfather must not know hes in london today so he wont see you oh thank you mr holmes i feel better already chapter two holmes and watson visit the house holmes went out for the morning but he came back at lunchtime we then went by train into the country and took a taxi to dr roylotts house you see said holmes to me our dangerous friend roylott needs the girls money because he only has pounds a year from his dead wife i found that out this morning but the gipsies the whistle the band they are more difficult to understand but i think i have an answer when we arrived helen stoner showed us the three bedrooms we saw her room first why are they mending your bedroom wall asked holmes theres nothing wrong with it youre right she said i think it was a plan to move me into my sisters room yes said holmes we went into julias room and holmes looked at the windows carefully nobody could come in from outside he said then he looked round the room why is that bellrope there just over the bed my stepfather put it there two years ago its for calling a servant but julia and i never used it because we didnt have any servants he also put in that airvent on the wall between his room and this one holmes pulled the rope but it doesnt work he said how strange and its just over the airvent that also is interesting why have an airvent on an inside wall airvents are usually on outside walls then we went into dr roylotts room holmes saw a large metal box near the wall my stepfather keeps business papers in there said helen does he keep a cat in there too asked holmes look there was some milk on a plate on top of the box now miss stoner he said i think your life is in danger tonight my friend watson and i must spend the night in your sisters room where you are sleeping at the moment helen stoner and i looked at him in surprise yes we must he went on well take a room in a hotel in the village when your stepfather goes to bed put a light in your sisters bedroom window and leave it open then go into your old room and well get into your sisters room through the window well wait for the sound of the whistle and the falling metal how did my sister die mr holmes do you know please tell me said helen she put her hand on sherlock holmess arm i must find out more before i tell you miss stoner now goodbye and dont be afraid replied sherlock holmes we walked to the village and holmes said to me tonight will be dangerous watson roylott is a very violent man but if i can help holmes i shall come with you i said thank you watson ill need your help did you see the bellrope and the airvent i knew about the airvent before we came of course there is a hole between the two rooms that explains why helens sister could smell dr roylotts cigarette my dear holmes how clever of you i cried and did you see the bed its fixed to the floor she cant move it it must stay under the rope which is near the airvent holmes i cried i begin to understand what a terrible crime yes this doctor is a very clever man but we can stop him i think watson chapter three death in the night that night we went back to the house when we saw helen stoners light holmes and i got in quietly through the window then we waited silently in the middle bedroom in the dark we waited for three hours and did not move suddenly we saw a light and heard a sound from dr roylotts room but nothing happened and again we waited in the dark then there was another sound a very quiet sound immediately holmes jumped up and hit the bellrope hard can you see it watson he shouted but i saw nothing there was a quiet whistle we both looked up at the airvent and suddenly we heard a terrible cry in the next room then the house was silent again what does it mean i asked my voice was shaking its finished answered holmes lets go and see we went into dr roylotts room the metal box was open roylott was sitting on a chair and his eyes were fixed on the airvent round his head was a strange yellow speckled band he was dead the band the speckled band said holmes very quietly the band moved and began to turn its head be careful watson its a snake an indian snake and its poison can kill very quickly holmes cried roylott died immediately we must put the snake back in its box very very carefully holmes took the snake and threw it into the metal box but how did you know about the snake holmes i asked at first watson i thought that it was the gipsies but then i understood i thought that perhaps something came through the airvent down the bellrope and on to the bed then there was the milk and of course snakes drink milk it was easy for the doctor to get indian animals and because he was a doctor he knew that this snakes poison is difficult to find in a dead body so every night he put the snake through the airvent and it went down the bellrope on to the bed of course nobody must see the snake so every night he whistled to call it back the sound of metal falling was the door of the metal box which was the snakes home perhaps the snake came through the airvent many times before it killed julia but in the end it killed her and helen too nearly died because of this snake but tonight when i hit the snake on the rope it was angry and went back through the airvent and so it killed the doctor im not sorry about that soon after this helen stoner married her young man and tried to forget the terrible deaths of her sister and stepfather but she never really forgot the speckled band the end
