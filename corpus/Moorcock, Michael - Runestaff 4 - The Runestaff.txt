warriors of ferocious courage and skill careless of their own lives corrupt of soul and mad of brain haters of all that was not in decay wielders of power without moralityforce without justice the barons of granbretan carried the standard of their king emperor huon across the continent of eu rope and made that continent their property carried the banner to west and east to other continents to which they also laid claim and it seemed that no force either natural or supernatural was strong enough to halt the insane and deadly tide indeed none now resisted them at all with chuckling pride and cold contempt they demanded whole nations as tribute and the tribute was paid in all the subdued lands few hoped of those fewer dared express hopeand among those few hardly a single soul possessed the courage to murmur the name symbolizing that hope the name was castle brass those who spoke the name understood its implications for castle brass was the only stronghold to remain unvanquished by the warlords of granbretan and castle brass housed heroes men who had fought the dark empire whose names were loathed and hated by the brooding baron meliadus grand con stable of the order of the wolf commander of the army of conquest for it was known that baron meliadus fought a private feud with those heroes particularly the legendary dorian hawkmoon von koln who was mar ried to the woman meliadus desired yis selda daughter of count brass of castle brass but castle brass had not defeated the armies of granbretan it had merely evaded them disappearing by means of a strange ancient crystal machine into another dimension of the earth where those heroes hawkmoon count brass huillam daverc oladahn of the bulgar mountains and their handful of kamargian menatarms now sheltered and most folk felt that the heroes of the kamarg had deserted them forever they did not blame them but their hope waned fainter with every day that passed and the heroes did not return in that other kamarg sundered from its original by mysterious dimension of time and space hawkmoon and the rest were faced with fresh problems for it seemed that the sorcererscientists of the dark empire were close to discovering means either of breaking through into their dimension or of recalling them the enigmatic warrior in jet and gold had sent hawkmoon and daverc on a quest to a strange new land to seek the legendary sword of the dawn which would be of aid to them in their struggle and which would in turn aid the runestaff which the warrior insisted hawkmoon manifestation of the champion eternal served having won the rosy sword hawkmoon was then informed he must travel by sea around the coast of amarehk to the city of dnark where the services of the blade were required but hawkmoon demurred he was anxious to return to the kamarg and see his beautiful wife yisselda again in a ship supplied by bewchard of narleen hawkmoon set sail for europe against the dictates of the warrior in jet and gold who had told him that his duty to the runestaff that mysterious arte fact said to control all human destinies was greater than his duty to his wife friends and adopted homeland with the foppish huil lam daverc by his side hawkmoon headed out to sea meanwhile in granbretan baron meliadus fumed at what he considered his kingemper ors foolishness in not allowing him to pur sue his vendetta against castle brass when shenegar trott count of sussex seemed to be favoured over him by a kingemperor growing steadily more mistrustful of his un stable conquistador meliadus became rebel lious pursuing his prey to the wastes of yel losing them and returning with redoubled hatred to londra there to scheme not only against the heroes of castle brass but also against his immortal ruler huon the king emperor the high history of the runestaff chapter one an episode in king huons throne room the vast doors parted and baron meliadus but lately returned from yel walked into the throne room of his kingemperor to report his failures and his dis coveries as meliadus entered the room whose roof seemed so tall as to be one with the heavens and whose walls were so distant as to seem to encompass an entire country his way was blocked by a double line of guards these guards members of the king emperors own order of the mantis and wearing the great jewelled insectmasks belonging to that order seemed reluctant to let him pass through meliadus controlled himself with difficulty and waited while the ranks drew back to admit him then he strode on into the hall of blazing colour whose galleries were hung with the gleaming banners of granbretans five hundred greatest families and whose walls were encrusted with a mosaic of precious gems de picting granbretans might and history along an aisle made up on either side by a thousand mantis warriors each statuestill towards the throne globe more than a mile distant halfway to the globe he abased himself in a some what peremptory fashion the solid black sphere seemed to shudder momentar ily as baron meliadus rose then the black became shot through with veins of scarlet and white which slowly spread through the darker shade until it had vanished altogether the mixture like milk and blood swirled and cleared to reveal a tiny foetuslike shape curled in the centre of the sphere from this twisted figure peered eyes that were hard black and sharp containing an oldindeed an immortalintelligence this was huon king emperor of granbretan and the dark empire grand constable of the order of the mantis wielder of absolute power over tens of millions of souls the ruler who would live forever and in whose name baron meli adus had conquered the whole of europe and beyond the voice of a golden youth now issued from the throne globe the golden youth to whom it had be longed had been dead a thousand years ah our impetuous baron meliadus again meliadus bowed and murmured your servant prince of all and what have you to report to us hasty lord success great emperor proof of my suspicions you have found the missing emissaries from asia communista i regret not noble sire baron meliadus did not know that it had been in this disguise that hawkmoon and daverc had penetrated the capital of the dark empire only flana mikosevaar who had helped them escape knew that then why are you here baron i discovered that hawkmoon whom i insist is still the greatest threat to our security has been visiting our island i went to yel and there found him and the trai tor huillam daverc as well as the magician mygan of llandar they know the secret of travelling through the dimensions baron meliadus did not mention that they had escaped from him before we could apprehend them they vanished before our eyes mighty monarch if they can come and go from our land at will surely it is plain that we can never be safe until they are destroyed i would suggest we begin immediately to direct all the efforts of our scientistsof taragorm and kalan in par ticularto finding these renegades and finishing them they threaten us from within baron meliadus what news of the emissaries from asiacommunista none so far mighty king emperor but a few guerillas baron meliadus this empire may contend with but if our shores are threatened by a force as great if not greater than our own by a force more over that is possessed of scientific secrets unknown to us that we may not survive you see the golden voice spoke with acid patience meliadus frowned we have no proof that such an invasion is planned monarch of the world agreed neither have we proof baron meliadus that hawkmoon and his band of terrorists have the power to do us any great harm streaks of ice blue sud denly appeared in the throne globes fluid great king emperor give me the time and the resources we are an expanding empire baron meliadus we wish to expand still further it would be pessimistic would it not to stand still that is not our way we are proud of our influence upon the earth we wish to ex tend it you seem uneager to carry out the principles of our ambition which is to spread a great laughing terror to the corners of the world you are becoming small minded we fear but by refusing to counter those subtle forces that might wreck our schemes prince of all we could betray our destiny also we resent dissension baron meliadus your personal hatred of hawkmoon and we have heard your desire for yisselda of brass represent dissension we have your selfinterest at heart baron for if you continue in this course we shall be obliged to elect another over you to dismiss you from our serviceaye even to dismiss you from your order instinctively baron meliaduss gauntleted hands leapt fearfully to his mask to be unmasked the greatest dis gracethe greatest horror of them all for that was what the threat implied to join the ranks of the lowest scum in londrathe caste of the unmasked ones meliadus shuddered and could hardly bring himself to speak at last he murmured i will reflect on your words emperor of the earth do so baron meliadus we would not wish to see such a great conqueror destroyed by a few clouded thoughts if you would regain all our favour you will find for us the means by which the asiacommunistan emissaries left baron meliadus fell to his knees his great wolfmask nodding his arms outspread thus the conqueror of eu rope abased himself before his lord but his brain flared with a dozen rebellious thoughts and he thanked the spirit of his order that the mask hid his face so that his fury did not show he backed away from the throne globe while the beady sardonic eyes of the king emperor regarded him huons prehensile tongue darted out to touch a jewel floating near the shrunken head and the milky fluid swirled flashed with rainbow colours then gradually turned black once more meliadus wheeled and began the long march back to the gigantic doors feeling that every eye behind the un moving mantis masks watched him with malevolent hu mour when he had passed through the doors he turned to the left and strode through the corridors of the twisted palace seeking the apartments of the countess flana mikosevaar of kanbery widow of asrovak mikosevaar the muskovian renegade who had once headed the vul ture legion countess flana not only was now titular head of the vulture legion but also cousin to the king emperorhis only surviving kin chapter two human thoughts of the countess flana the heron mask of spun gold lay on the lacquered table before her as she stared through the window over the curling crazy spires of the city of londra her pale beautiful face full of sadness and confusion as she moved the rich silks and jewels of her gown caught the light from the red sun she went to a closet and opened it there were the strange costumes she had kept since those two visitors had left her apartments so many days before the disguises that hawkmoon and daverc had used when posing as princes from asiacom munista now she wondered where they wereparticu larly daverc whom she knew loved her flana countess of kanbery had had a dozen hus bands and more lovers had disposed of them in one way or another as a woman might dispose of a useless pair of stockings she had never experienced love never had the emotion known to most others even the rulers of granbretan but somehow daverc that dandified renegade who claimed to be permanently ill had aroused these feelings in her perhaps she had remained so remote heretofore because she was sane while those surround ing her at court were not because she was gentle and ca pable of selfless love whereas the lords of the dark empire understood nothing of such feelings perhaps daverc gentle subtle sensitive had awakened her from an apathy induced not by lack of soul but by a greatness of soulsuch greatness that it could not bear to exist in the mad selfish perverse world of the court of king huon but now that the countess flana was awake she could not ignore the horror of her surroundings the despair she felt that her lover of a single night might never return that he might even be already dead she had taken to her apartments avoiding contact with the rest but while this ruse afforded her some sur cease from understanding of her circumstances it only allowed her sorrow silence in which to grow tears fell down flanas perfect cheeks and she stopped their flow with a scented silken scarf a maidservant entered the room and hesitated on the threshold automatically flana reached for her heron mask what is it the baron meliadus of kroiden my lady he says he has to speak with you a matter of paramount ur gency flana slipped her mask over her head and settled it on her shoulders she considered the girls words for a moment and then shrugged what did it matter if she saw meliadus for a few moments perhaps he had some news of daverc whom she knew he hated by subtle means she might discover what he knew but what if meliadus wished to make love to her as he had on previous occasions why she would turn him away as she had turned him away before she inclined the lovely heron mask a fraction admit the baron she said chapter three hawkmoon alters his course the great sails curved in the wind as the ship sped over the surface of the sea the sky was clear and the sea was calm a vast expanse of azure oars had been shipped and the helmsman now looked to the main deck for his course the bosun clad in orange and black climbed to the deck where hawkmoon stood staring across the ocean hawkmoons golden hair streamed in the wind and his cloak of winecoloured velvet whipped out behind him his handsome features were battlehardened and weather beaten and were only marred by the existence embedded in his forehead of a dull black stone grave ly he acknowledged the bosuns salute ive given orders to sail around the coast heading due east sir the bosun said who gave you that course bosun why nobody sir i just assumed that since we were heading for dnark we are not heading for dnark tell the helmsman but that strange warriorthe warrior in jet and gold you called himhe said he is not my master bosun nowe sail out to sea now for europe for europe sir you know that after you saved nar leen we would take you anywhere follow you anywhere but have you any understanding of the distances we must sail to reach europethe seas we should have to cross the storms aye i understand but we still sail for europe as you say sir frowning the bosun turned away to give his orders to the helmsman from his cabin below the main deck daverc now emerged and began to climb the ladder hawkmoon grinned at him did you sleep well friend daverc as well as possible aboard this rocking tub i am in clined to suffer from insomnia at the best of times hawkmoon but i snatched a few moments the most i suppose i may expect hawkmoon laughed when i looked in on you an hour ago you were snoring daverc raised his eyebrows so you heard me breathing heavily eh i tried to keep as quiet as pos sible but this cold of minecontracted since coming aboardis giving me a certain amount of difficulty he raised a tiny square of linen to the tip of his nose daverc was dressed in silk with a loose blue shirt flowing scarlet breeks a heavy broad leather belt sup porting his sword and a dirk around his bronzed throat was wound a long scarf of purple and his long hair was held back by a band matching his breeks his fine al most ascetic features bore their usual sardonic ex pression did i hear aright below daverc asked were you instructing the bosun to head for europe i was so you still intend to try to reach castle brass and forget what the warrior in jet and gold said of your destinythat it was to take that blade there daverc pointed to the great red broadsword at hawkmoons side to dnark thus serving the runestaff i owe allegiance to myself and my kin before i will serve an artefact in whose existence i gravely doubt you would not have believed before in the powers of the sword of the dawn daverc remarked wryly yet you saw it summon warriors from thin air to save our lives an obstinate look passed over hawkmoons features aye he agreed reluctantly but i still intend to re turn to castle brass if that is possible theres no telling if its in this dimension or an other i can only hope that it is in this dimension hawkmoon spoke with finality showing his un willingness to discuss the matter further daverc raised his eyebrows for a second time then descended to the deck and strolled along it whistling for five days they sailed on through the calm ocean every sail unfurled to give them maximum speed on the sixth day the bosun came up to hawkmoon who was standing in the prow of the ship and pointed ahead see the dark sky on the horizon sir were heading straight for a storm hawkmoon peered in the direction the bosun indi cated a storm you say yet it has a peculiar look to it aye sir shall i reef the sails no bosun we sail on until we have a better idea of what we are heading into as you say sir the bosun walked back down the deck shaking his head a few hours later the sky ahead became a lurid wall across the sea from horizon to horizon its predominant colours dark red and purple it towered upwards and yet the sky above them was as blue as it ever had been and the sea was perfectly calm only the wind had dropped slightly it was as if they sailed in a lake en closed on all sides by mountains whose peaks disap peared into the heavens the crew was disconcerted and there was a note of fear in the bosuns voice when he next confronted hawkmoon do we sail on sir i have never heard of such a phe nomenon as this before ive never experienced any thing like it the crews nervous sir and ill admit that i am also hawkmoon nodded sympathetically its peculiar right enough seeming to be more supernatural than natural thats what the crews saying sir hawkmoons own instinct was to press on and face whatever it was but he had a responsibility to the crew each member of which had volunteered to sail with him in gratitude for his ridding their home city narleen of the power of the pirate lords hawkmoon sighed very well bosun well take in all sail and wait the night with luck the phenomenon will have passed by morning the bosun was relieved thank you sir hawkmoon acknowledged his salute then turned to stare up at the huge walls were they cloud or were they something else a chill had come into the air and al though the sun still shone down its rays did not seem to touch the massed clouds all was still hawkmoon wondered if he had made a wise decision in heading away from dnark none to his knowledge save the ancients had ever sailed these oceans who was to tell what uncharted terrors in habited them night fell and in the distance the vast lurid walls could still be seen their dark reds and purples piercing the blackness of the night and yet the colours hardly seemed to have the usual properties of light hawkmoon began to feel perturbed in the morning the walls seemed to have drawn in much closer and the area of blue sea seemed much smaller hawkmoon wondered if they had not been caught in a trap set by giants clad in a thick cloak that did not keep out much of the chill he paced the deck at dawn daverc was next to emerge wearing at least three cloaks and shivering ostentatiously a fresh morning hawkmoon aye murmured the duke of koln what do you make of it daverc the frenchman shook his head its a grim sort of stuff isnt it here comes the bosun they both turned to greet the bosun he too was wrapped up heavily in a great leather cloak normally used for protection when sailing through a storm any thoughts on this bosun daverc asked the bosun shook his head and addressed hawkmoon the men say that whatever happens sir they are yours they will die in your service if necessary theyre in a gloomy mood i gather smiled daverc well whos to blame them who indeed sir the bosuns round honest face looked despairing shall i give the order to sail on sir it would be better than waiting here while the stuff closes in hawkmoon said let go the sails bosun the bosun shouted orders and men began to climb through the rigging letting down the sails and securing their lines gradually the sails filled and the ship began to move seemingly reluctantly towards the strange cliffs of clouds yet even as they moved forward the cliffs began to swirl and become agitated other darker colours crept in and a wailing noise drifted towards the ship from all sides the crew could barely contain its panic many men standing frozen in the rigging as they watched hawkmoon peered forward anxiously then instantly the walls had vanished hawkmoon gasped calm sea lay on all sides everything was as before the crew began to cheer but hawkmoon noticed that davercs face was bleak hawkmoon too felt that per haps the danger was not past he waited poised at the rail then from the sea erupted a huge beast the crews cheers changed to screams of fear other beasts began to emerge all around them gigan tic reptilian monsters with gaping red jaws and triple rows of teeth the water streaming from their scales and their blazing eyes full of mad rolling evil there was a deafening flapping noise and one by one the giant reptiles climbed into the air we are done for hawkmoon said daverc philo sophically as he drew his sword its a pity not to have had one last sight of castle brass nor one last kiss from the lips of those women we love hawkmoon barely heard him he was full of bitter ness at the fate which had decided he should meet his end in this wet and lonely place now none would know where or how he had died chapter four orland fank the shadows of the gigantic beasts swept back and forth over the deck and the noise of their wings filled the air looking upwards in cold detachment as a mon ster dropped towards him its maw distended the duke of koln knew his life had ended but then the monster had soared again having snapped once at the high mast nerves tense muscles taut dorian hawkmoon drew the sword of the dawn the blade which no other man could wield and live even this supernatural broadsword would be useless against the dreadful beasts they need not even attack the crew directly need only strike the ship a few blows to send those aboard to the bottom the ship rocked in the wind created by the vast wings and the air stank of their foetid breath daverc frowned why are they not attacking are they playing a game with us it seems likely hawkmoon spoke between clenched teeth maybe it pleases them to play with us for a while before destroying us as a great shadow descended daverc leapt up and slashed at a creature which had flapped into the air again before davercs feet returned to the deck he wrinkled his nose ugh the stink it can do my lungs no good now one by one each of the creatures descended and struck the ship a few thwacks with its leathery wings the ship shuddered men screamed as they were flung from the rigging to the deck hawkmoon and daverc staggered clinging to the rail to save themselves from toppling theyre turning the ship daverc cried in puzzle ment were being forced round hawkmoon stared grimly at the terrifying monsters and said nothing soon the ship had been turned by about eighty degrees then the beasts rose higher into the sky wheeling above the ship as if debating their next action hawkmoon looked at their eyes trying to discern intelligence there trying to discover some hint of their intentions but it was impossible the creatures began to flap away until they were far to sternward and then they began to come back in formation the beasts flapped their wings until such a wind was created that hawkmoon and daverc could no longer keep their footing and they were pressed down to the planks of the deck the sails of the ship bent in this wind and daverc cried out in astonishment theyre driving the ship the way they want it to go its incredible were heading towards amarehk hawkmoon said struggling to rise i wonder what can their diet be daverc shouted cer tainly they eat nothing intended to sweeten the breath phew hawkmoon grinned in spite of their plight the crew were now all huddled in the oarwells star ing up fearfully at the monstrous reptiles as they flapped overhead filling the sails with wind perhaps their nest is in this direction hawkmoon suggested perhaps their young are to be fed and they prefer live meat daverc looked offended what you say is likely friend hawkmoon but it was still tactless of you to sug gest it again hawkmoon gave a wry grin theres a chance if their nests are on land of get ting to grips with them he said on the open sea we had no chance of survival at all youre optimistic duke of koln for more than an hour the extraordinary reptiles pro pelled the ship over the water at breakneck speed then at last hawkmoon pointed ahead saying nothing an island exclaimed daverc you were right about that at any rate it was a small island apparently bare of vegetation its sides rising sharply to a peak as if the tip of a drowned mountain had not been entirely engulfed it was then that a fresh danger alerted hawkmoon rocks were heading straight for them crew to your positions helmsman but hawkmoon was al ready dashing for the helm had grabbed it was desper ately trying to save the ship from running aground daverc joined him lending his own strength to turn the craft the island loomed larger and larger and the sound of the surf boomed in their earsa drumbeat to herald disaster slowly the ship turned as the cliffs of the island tow ered over them and the spray drenched them but then they heard a terrible scraping sound which became a scream of tortured timbers and they knew that the rocks were ripping into the starboard side beneath the water line every man for himself hawkmoon cried and ran for the rail daverc closely behind him the ship lurched and reared like a living thing and all were flung back against the port rails of the craft bruised but still conscious hawkmoon and daverc pulled themselves to their feet hesitated for a moment then dived into the black and seething waters of the sea weighted by his great broadsword hawkmoon felt himself being dragged to the bottom through the swirl ing water he saw other shapes drifting and the noise of the surf was now dull in his ears but he would not re lease the sword of the dawn instead he fought to scab bard it and then use all his energy to strike up to the surface dragging the heavy blade with him at last he broke through the waves and got a dim im pression of the ship above him the sea seemed much calmer and eventually the wind dropped altogether the boom of the surf diminished to a whisper and a strange silence took the place of the cacophony of a few mo ments earlier hawkmoon headed for a flat rock reached it and dragged himself on to land then he looked back the reptilian monsters were still wheeling in the sky but so high they did not disturb the air with their wing beats suddenly they rose still higher hovered for a mo ment then dived headlong toward the sea one by one they struck the waves with a great smash ing noise the ship groaned as the wash hit it and hawkmoon was almost sluiced from his place of safety then the monsters were gone hawkmoon wiped water from his eyes and spat out the brine from his mouth what would they do next was it their intention to keep their prey alive to pick them off when they needed fresh meat there was no way of telling hawkmoon heard a cry and saw daverc and halfa dozen others come staggering along the rocks toward him daverc looked bewildered did you see the beasts leave hawkmoon aye will they be back i wonder daverc glanced grimly in the direction in which the beasts had disappeared he shrugged i suggest we strike inland saving what we can from the ship hawkmoon said how many of us left alive he turned enquiringly to the bosun who stood behind daverc most of us i think sir we were lucky look the bosun pointed beyond the ship to where the major part of the crew was assembling on the shore send some men back to her before she breaks up hawkmoon said rig lines to the shore and start get ting provisions to dry land as you say sir but what if the monsters return well have to deal with them when we see them hawkmoon said for several hours hawkmoon watched as everything possible was carried from the ship and piled on the rocks of the island can the ship be repaired do you think daverc asked maybe now that the sea is calm theres little chance of her breaking up but it will take time hawkmoon fingered the dull black stone in his forehead come daverc lets explore inland they began to climb up over the rocks heading up the slope to the summit of the island the place seemed completely devoid of life the best they could hope to find would be pools of fresh water and there might be shellfish on the shore it was a bleak place their hopes of survival if the ship could not be refloated seemed very slight particularly with the prospect of the mon sters returning they reached the summit at last and paused breath ing heavily from their exertions the other sides as barren as this daverc said ges turing downward i wonder he broke off and gasped by the eyes of berezenath a man hawkmoon looked in the direction daverc indicated sure enough a figure was strolling along the shore be low as they stared he looked up and waved cheerfully gesturing them towards him certain they were suffering hallucinations the two be gan slowly to climb down until they were close to the him he stood there fists on his hips feet wide apart grinning at them they paused the man was dressed in a peculiar and archaic fash ion over his brawny torso was stretched a jerkin of leather leaving his arms and chest bare he wore a woollen bonnet on his mop of red hair and a pheasants tailfeather was stuck jauntily into it his breeks were of a strange chequered design and he wore battered buckled boots on his feet secured over his back by a cord was a gigantic battleaxe its steel blade streaked with dirt and battered by much use his face was bony and red and his pale blue eyes were sardonic as he stared at them well nowyoud be the hawkmoon and the daverc he said in a strange accent i was told youd likely come and who are you sir daverc asked somewhat haughtily why im orland fank didnt you know orland fankhere at your service good sirs do you live on this island hawkmoon asked i have lived on it but not at the moment dont you know fank removed his bonnet and wiped his fore head with his arm im a travelling man these days like yourselves i understand and who told you of us hawkmoon asked ive a brother given to wearing somewhat fancy metal of black and gold the warrior in jet and gold hawkmoon ex claimed hes called some such foppish title i gather he would not have mentioned his rough and ready brother to you i dont doubt he did not who are you im called orland fank from skare braein the orkneys you know the orkneys hawkmoons hand went to his sword is that not part of granbretan island to the far north fank laughed tell an orkney man that he belongs to the dark empire and hell tear the throat from you with his teeth he gestured apologetically and as if in explanation said its the favourite way of dealing with a foe out there you know were not a sophisticated folk so the warrior in jet and gold is also from the orkneys daverc began save you no man him from the orkneys with his fancy suit of armour and his fine manner orland fank laughed heartily no hes no orkney man fank wiped tears of laughter from his eyes with his battered bonnet why should you think that you said he was your brother so he is spiritually you might say perhaps even physically ive forgotten its been many years you see since we first came together what brought you together a common cause you might say a shared ideal and would the runestaff be the source of that cause hawkmoon murmured his voice hardly louder than the whisper of the surf below them it might you seem closemouthed suddenly friend fank said daverc aye in orkney were a closemouthed folk smiled orland fank indeed im considered something of a babbler there he did not seem offended hawkmoon gestured behind him those monsters the strange clouds we saw earlier would that be to do with the runestaff i saw no monsters no clouds ive but recently ar rived here myself we were driven to this island by gigantic reptiles hawkmoon said and now i begin to see why they too served the runestaff i do not doubt thats as may be fank replied its not my business you see lord dorian was it the runestaff that caused our boat to be wrecked hawkmoon asked fiercely i could not say fank replied replacing his bonnet on his mop of red hair and scratching at his bony chin i only know that im here to give you a boat and tell you where you might find the nearest habitable land you have a boat for us daverc was astonished aye not a splendid one but a seaworthy craft none theless it should take the two of you we have a crew of fifty hawkmoons eyes blazed oh if the runestaff wishes me to serve it it should ar range things better all it has succeeded in doing so far is to anger me fiercely your anger will only weary you orland fank re plied mildly i had thought you bound for dnark in the runestaffs service my brother told me your brother insisted i go to dnark but i have other loyalties orland fankloyalties to the wife i have not seen for months to the fatherinlaw who awaits my return to my friends the folk of castle brass aye ive heard of them they are safe for the moment if that comforts you you know this for certain aye their lives are pretty much without event save for the trouble with one elvereza tozer tozer what of the renegade he has vanished from the komarg i gather or land fank made a flying gesture with his hand for where who knows they are well rid of tozer at any rate i do not know the man a talented playwright hawkmoon said with the morals of aof a a granbretanian offered fank exactly hawkmoon frowned then and stared hard at orland fank you would not deceive me my kin and friends are safe their security is not for the moment threatened hawkmoon sighed where is this boat and what of my crew i have some small skill as a shipwright ill help them mend their ship so that they can return to nar leen why cannot we go with them daverc asked i understood you were an impatient pair fank said innocently and that you would be off the island as soon as you could it will take many days to repair the large craft well take your little boat hawkmoon said it seems that if we did not the runestaffor whatever power it was that really sent us herewould see to it that we were further inconvenienced i understand that would be likely fank agreed smiling a little to himself and how will you leave the island if we take your boat daverc asked ill sail with the seamen of narleen i have a great deal of time to spare how far is it to the mainland hawkmoon asked and by what shall we sail have you a compass to lend us fank shrugged its of no great distance and youll not need a compass you need only wait for the right sort of wind what do you mean the winds in these parts are somewhat peculiar you will understand what i mean hawkmoon shrugged in resignation they followed as orland fank led the way around the shore it would seem that we are not quite as much the masters of our destinies as we should like murmured daverc sardonically as the small boat came in sight chapter five a city of glowing shadows hawkmoon lay scowling in the small boat and daverc whistled a tune as he stood in the prow the spray lashing his face for a whole day now the wind had guided the craft blowing them on what was plainly a particular course now i understand what fank meant about the wind growled hawkmoon this is no natural breeze i resent the feeling of being the puppet of some super natural agency daverc grinned and pointed ahead well perhaps well have a chance to voice our complaints to the agency itself seeland in sight hawkmoon rose reluctantly there were faint signs of land on the horizon and so we return to amarehk daverc laughed if only it were europe and yisselda were there hawkmoon sat down again or even londra and flana to comfort me daverc shrugged and began to cough theatrically still it is best this way lest she find herself pledged to a sick and dying creature gradually they made out features on the shoreline ir regular cliffs hills and beaches some trees then to the south they saw a peculiar aura of golden lightlight which throbbed as if in concert to a gigantic heart more disturbing phenomena daverc frowned the wind blew harder and the little boat turned toward the golden light and were heading directly for it groaned hawk moon i am becoming tired of such things now it was clear they sailed into a bay formed by the mainland and a long island jutting out between the two shores it was from the far end of this island that the golden light was pulsing the land on either side seemed pleasant consisting of beaches and wooded hills though there were no signs of habitation as they neared the source of the light it began to fade until only a faint glow filled the sky and the boats speed diminished they still sailed directly towards the light they saw it then and were amazed it was a city of such grace and beauty it robbed them of speech as huge as londra if not larger its buildings were symmetrical spires and domes and turrets all glow ing with the same strange light but coloured in delicate pale shades that lurked behind the goldpink yellow blue green violet and ceriselike a painting created in light and then washed with gold its magnificent beauty did not seem a proper habitation for human creatures but for gods now the ship sailed into a harbour stretching out from the city its quays shifting with the same subtle shades of the buildings it is like a dream hawkmoon murmured a dream of heaven davercs cynicism had van ished before the vision the little boat drifted to a set of steps that led down to the water which was dappled with the reflections of the colours and came to a halt daverc shrugged i suppose this is where we disem bark the boat could have borne us to a less pleasant place hawkmoon nodded gravely and then said are the rings of myggan still in your pouch daverc daverc patted his pouch they are safe why i wanted to know that if the danger was too great for us to face with our swords and there was time to use the rings we could use them daverc nodded his understanding and then his fore head creased strange that we did not think of using them on the island hawkmoons face showed his astonishment aye aye and then he pursed his lips in disgust doubt less that was the result of supernatural interference with our brains how i hate the supernatural daverc merrily put his fingers to his lips and put on an expression of mock disapproval what a thing to say in a city such as this ayewell i hope its inhabitants are as pleasant as its appearance if it has any inhabitants replied daverc glancing around him together they climbed the steps and reached the quayside the strange buildings were ahead of them and between the buildings ran wide streets lets enter the city hawkmoon said resolutely and find out why we have been taken here as soon as we can then perhaps we shall be allowed to return to castle brass entering the nearest street it seemed to them that the shadows cast by the buildings actually glowed with a life and a colour of their own at close hand the tall towers were hardly tangible and when hawkmoon reached out to touch one the substance of it was unlike anything he had touched before it was not stone and it was not tim ber not steel even for it gave slightly under his fingers and made them tingle he was also surprised by the warmth that ran through his arm and suffused his body he shook his head it is more like flesh than stone daverc reached out now and was equally astonished ayeor like vegetation of some kind organicliving stuff they moved on every so often the long streets would broaden out into squares they crossed the squares choosing another street at random looking up at the building which gave the appearance of infinite height which disappeared into the strange golden haze their voices were hushed they feared to disturb the silence of the great city have you noticed murmured hawkmoon that there are no windows and no doors daverc nodded i am certain that this city was not built for human useand that humans did not build it perhaps some beings created in the tragic millen nium hawkmoon suggested beings like the wraith folk of soryandum daverc nodded his head in agreement now ahead of them the strange shadows seemed to gather closer together and they passed into them an impression of great wellbeing overcoming them hawkmoon smiled in spite of his fears and daverc too answered his smile the glowing shadows swam around them hawkmoon began to wonder if perhaps these shadows were in fact the inhabitants of the city they passed out of the street and stood in a huge square without doubt the very centre of the city rising from the middle of this square was a cylindrical build ing in spite of being the largest building in the city it also seemed the most delicate its walls moved with coloured light and hawkmoon noticed something at its base look davercsteps leading to a door what should we do i wonder whispered his friend hawkmoon shrugged enter of course what have we to lose perhaps we shall discover the answer to that question within after you duke of koln the two mounted the steps and climbed until they reached the doorway it was relatively smallof human size in fact and within it they could see more of the glowing shadows hawkmoon stepped bravely forward with daverc im mediately behind him chapter six jehamia cohnahlias their feet seemed to sink into the floor and the glowing shadows wrapped themselves around them as they advanced into the scintillating darkness of the tower a sweet sound now filled the corridorsa gentle sound like an unearthly lullaby the music increased their sense of wellbeing they pressed deeper into the strangely organic construction and then suddenly they stood in a small room full of the same golden pulsing radiance they had seen earlier from the boat and the radiance came from a child he was a boy of oriental appearance with a soft brown skin clad in robes on to which jewels had been stitched so that the fabric was completely hid den he smiled and his smile matched the gentle radiance surrounding him it was impossible not to love him duke dorian hawkmoon von koln he said sweetly bowing his head and huillam daverc i have ad mired both your painting and your buildings sir daverc was astonished you know of those they are excellent why do you not do more daverc coughed in embarrassment ii lost the knack i suppose and then the war ah of course the dark empire that is why you are here i would gather so i am called jehamia cohnahlias the boy smiled again and that is the only direct information about myself i can offer you in case you were going to ask me anything further this city is called dnark and its in habitants are called in the outer world the great good ones you have encountered some of them already i be lieve the glowing shadows hawkmoon asked is that how you perceive them are they sentient hawkmoon queried they are indeed more than sentient perhaps and this city dnark hawkmoon said it is the leg endary city of the runestaff it is strange that all those legends should place its posi tion not on the continent of amarehk but in asiacom munista said daverc perhaps it is not a coincidence smiled the boy it is convenient to have such legends i understand jehamia cohnahlias smiled quietly you have come to see the runestaff i gather apparently said hawkmoon unable to feel anger in the presence of the child first the warrior in jet and gold told us to come here and then when we de murred we were introduced to his brotherone orland fank ah yes smiled jehamia cohnahlias orland fank i have a special affection for that particular servant of the runestaff well let us go he frowned slightly ah first you will want to refresh yourselves and meet a fellow traveller one who preceded you here by only a matter of hours do we know him i believe you have had some contact in the past the boy seemed almost to float down from his chair this way who can it be murmured daverc to hawkmoon who would we know who would come to dnark chapter seven a wellknown traveller they followed jehemia cohnahlias through the winding organic corridors of the building now they were lighter for the glowing shadowsthe great good ones as the boy had described themhad vanished pre sumably their task had been to help guide hawkmoon and daverc to the child at last they entered a larger hall in which had been set a long table presumably made of the same substance as the walls and benches also of the same stuff food had been laid on the tablerelatively simple fare fish bread and green vegetables but it was the figure at the far end of the hall who attracted their attention who made their hands go auto matically to their swords while their faces assumed ex pressions of angry astonishment it was hawkmoon who got the words out at last be tween clenched teeth shenegar trott the fat figure moved heavily towards them his plain silver mask apparently a parody of the features beneath it good afternoon gentlemen dorian hawkmoon and huillam daverc is it not hawkmoon turned to the boy do you realise who this creature is an explorer from europe he said he is the count of sussexone of king huons righthand men he has raped half europe he is second only to baron meliadus in the evil he has wrought come now trott said his voice soft and amused let us not begin by insulting each other we are on neutral ground here the issues of war are another mat ter since they do not at the moment concern us then i suggest we behave in a civilised mannerand not insult our young host here hawkmoon glowered how did you come to dnark count shenegar by ship duke of koln our baron kalanwhom i understand you have met trott chuckled as hawkmoon automatically put his hand to the black jewel kalan had earlier placed there he invented a new kind of engine to propel our ships at great speed over the sea based on the engine that gives power to our ornithopters i gather but more sophisticated i was commissioned by our wise king emperor to journey to amarahk there to make friendly advances to the powers dwelling here to discover their strengths and weaknesses before you attacked you mean hawkmoon shouted it is im possible to trust a servant of the dark empire the boy spread his hands and a look of sorrow crossed his face here in dnark we seek only equilib rium that after all is the goal and reason for existence of the runestaff which we are here to protect save your disputes i beg you for the battlefield and join to gether to eat the food we have prepared but i must warn you huillam daverc said in a lighter tone than hawkmoon had used that shenegar trott is not here to bring peace wherever he goes he brings evil and disruption be preparedfor he is con sidered to be the most cunning lord in all granbretan the boy seemed embarrassed and merely gestured again to the table please be seated and where is your fleet count shenegar daverc asked as he sat down on the bench and pulled a plate of fish towards him fleet trott replied innocently i did not mention a fleetonly my ship which is moored with its crew a few miles away from the city then it must be a large ship indeed murmured hawkmoon biting at a hunk of bread for it is unlike a count of the dark empire to make a journey un prepared for conquest you forget that we are scientists and scholars too in granbretan trott said as if mildly offended we seek knowledge and truth and reason why our whole inten tion in uniting the warring states of europe was to bring a rational peace to the world so that knowledge could progress the faster daverc coughed ostentatiously but said nothing trott now did something that in a dark empire noble was virtually unprecedented for he cheerfully pushed back his mask and began to eat in granbretan it was considered gross indecency both to display the face and to eat in public trott hawkmoon knew had always been thought eccentric in granbretan tolerated by the other nobles only by virtue of his vast private for tune his skill as a general and in spite of his flabby ap pearance a warrior of considerable personal courage the face revealed was the one caricatured on the mask it was white plump and intelligent the eyes were without expression but it was plain shenegar trott could put whatever expression he chose into them they ate in relative silence only the boy touched none of the food though he sat with them at length hawkmoon gestured to the counts bulky silver armour why do you travel in such heavy ac coutrement count shenegar if you are on a peaceful mission of exploration shenegar trott smiled whyhow was i to anticipate what dangers i should have to face in this strange city surely it is logical to travel wellprepared daverc changed the subject as if he realised they would receive nothing but smooth answers from the granbretanian how goes the war in europe he asked there is no war in europe trott answered no war then why should we be hereexiles from our own lands hawkmoon said there is no war because all of europe is now at peace under the patronage of our good king huon shenegar trott said and then he gave a faint winkal most a comradely winkwhich made it impossible for hawkmoon to reply save for the kamarg that is trott continued and that of course has vanished altogether my fellow peer baron meliadus was quite enraged by that im sure he was said hawkmoon and does he still continue his vendetta against us indeed he does in fact when i left londra he was in danger of becoming a laughing stock at court you seem to feel little affection for baron meliadus daverc suggested you understand me well count shenegar told him you see we are not all such insane and greedy men as you would think i have many disputes with baron meli adus though i am loyal to my motherland and my leader i do not agree with everything done in their namesindeed what i myself have done i follow my or ders i am a patriot shenegar trott shrugged his bulky shoulders i would prefer to stay at home reading and writing i was once thought a promising poet you know but now you write only epitaphsand those in blood and fire hawkmoon said count shenegar did not seem hurt instead he replied reasonably you have your point of view i have mine i believe in the ultimate sanity of our causethat the unification of the world is of maximum importance that personal ambitions no matter how noble must be sacri ficed to the larger principles that is the usual bland granbretanian answer hawkmoon said unconvinced it is the argument that meliadus used to count brass shortly before he attempt ed to rape and carry off his daughter yisselda i have already disassociated myself from baron meli adus count shenegar said every court must have its fool every great ideal must attract some who are mo tivated only by selfinterest shenegar trotts answers seemed more directed at the quietly listening boy than at hawkmoon and daverc themselves the meal finished trott pushed back his plate and resettled his silver mask over his face he turned to the boy i thank you sir for your hospitality nowyou promised me i might look upon and admire the runestaff it will give me great joy to stand before that legendary artefact hawkmoon and daverc glanced warningly at the boy but he did not appear to notice it is late now said jehemia cohnahlias we shall all visit the hall of the runestaff tomorrow meanwhile rest here through that little door he gestured across the room you will find sleeping accommodation i will call for you in the morning shenegar trott rose and bowed i thank you for your offer but my men will become agitated if i do not re turn to my ship tonight i will rejoin you here tomor row as you wish the boy said we would be grateful to you for your hospitality hawkmoon said but again let us warn you that shene gar trott may not be what he would have you believe you are admirable in your tenacity shenegar trott said he waved a gauntleted hand in a cheerful salute and strode jauntily from the hall i fear we shall sleep poorly knowing that our enemy is in dnark said daverc the boy smiled fear not the great good ones will help you rest and protect you from any harm goodnight gentlemen i shall see you tomorrow the boy walked lightly from the room and daverc and hawkmoon went to inspect the cubicles containing bunks and bedding that were let into the side of the walls shenegar trott means the boy harm hawkmoon said we had best make it our business to look after him if we can daverc replied goodnight hawkmoon after daverc had ducked into his cubicle hawkmoon entered his own it was full of glowing shadows and the soft music of the unearthly lullaby he had heard earlier almost immediately he was sound asleep chapter eight an ultimatum hawkmoon awoke late feeling thoroughly rested but then he noticed that the glowing shadows seemed agitated they had turned to a cold blue colour and were swirling around as if in fear hawkmoon rose quickly and buckled on his sword belt he frowned was the danger he had anticipated about to comeor had it come already the great good ones seemed incapable of human communication daverc came running into hawkmoons cubicle what do you think is the matter hawkmoon i do not know is shenegar trott scheming invasion is the boy in trouble all at once the glowing shadows had wrapped them selves chillingly around the two men and they felt them selves whisked from the cubicle through the room in which they had eaten and along the corridors at incred ible speed until they broke out of the building alto gether and were whirled upward into the golden light now the speed of the great good ones decreased and hawkmoon and daverc still breathless at the sudden action of the glowing shadows hovered in the air high above the main square daverc looked pale for his feet were planted on nothing and the glowing shadows seemed had taken on even less substance yet they did not fall down in the square tiny figures could be seen moving in towards the cylindrical tower it is an entire army hawkmoon gasped there must be thousands of them so much for shenegar trotts claims for the peaceful nature of his mission he has invaded dnark but why isnt it obvious to you my friend said daverc grimly he seeks the runestaff itself with that in his power he would doubtless rule the world but he does not know its location that is probably why he is attacking the tower seethere are warriors already inside surrounded by the flimsy shadows and with golden light on all sides the two men looked at the scene in dis may we must descend hawkmoon said finally but we are only two against a thousand daverc pointed out ayebut if the sword of the dawn will again sum mon the legion of the dawn then we might succeed against them hawkmoon reminded him as if they had understood his words the great good ones began to descend hawkmoon felt his heart enter his throat as they dropped rapidly towards the square now thickly clustered with masked dark empire war riorsmembers of the terrible falcon legion which like the vulture legion was a mercenary force made up of renegades who were if anything more evil than the native granbretanians had falcon eyes stared up in an ticipation of the feast of blood hawkmoon and daverc offered they had beaks ready to tear the flesh of the two enemies of the dark empire and their swords maces axes and spears were like talons poised to rend as the glowing shadows deposited daverc and the duke of koln near the entrance to the tower they just had time to draw their blades before the falcons at tacked but then shenegar trott appeared at the entrance of the tower and called to his men stop my falcons there is no need for bloodshed i have the boy hawkmoon and daverc saw him lift the child jehe mia cohnahlias by his robes and hold him struggling before them i know that this city is full of supernatural creatures who would seek to stop us the count announced and thus i have taken the liberty of insuring our safety while we are here if we are attacked if one of us is touched i shall slit the little boys throat from ear to ear shene gar trott chuckled i take this step only to avoid un pleasantness on all sides hawkmoon made to move to summon the legion of the dawn but trott wagged his finger chidingly would you be the cause of a childs death duke of koln glowering hawkmoon dropped his swordarm ad dressing the boy i warned you of his perfidy aye the boy struggled halfchoking in his robes i fear i should havepaid moreattention to you sir count shenegar laughed his mask flashing in the golden light nowtell me where the runestaff is kept the boy pointed back into the tower the hall of the runestaff is within show me shenegar trott turned to his men watch this pair id rather have them alive since the king emperor will be wellpleased if we can return with two as well as heroes of kamarg the runestaff if they move shout to me and ill take off an ear or two he drew his dirk and held it near the boys face most of youfollow me shenegar trott disappeared once more into the tower and six of the falcon warriors stayed to guard hawk moon and daverc while the rest followed their leader hawkmoon scowled if only the boy had paid heed to what we said he moved slightly and the falcons stirred warningly now how are we to save himand the runestafffrom trott suddenly the falcons looked upward in astonishment and davercs gaze followed theirs it seems we are to be rescued smiled daverc the glowing shadows were returning before the falcons could move or speak the shadows had wrapped themselves around the two men and were once again lifting them upwards disconcerted the falcons slashed at their feet as they ascended and then turned to run into the tower to warn their leader of what had happened higher and higher rose the great good ones carry ing hawkmoon and daverc with them into the golden haze that became a thick golden mist so that they could no longer see each other let alone the buildings of the city they seemed to travel for hours before they became aware of the golden mist thinning chapter nine the runestaff as the golden mist diminished hawkmoon blinked his eyes for they were now assailed by all manner of colourswaves and rays making strange configurations in the airand all emanating from a central source narrowing his eyes against the light he peered around him they hovered near the roof of a hall whose walls seemed constructed of sheets of translucent emer ald and onyx at the centre of the hall rose a dais reached by steps from all sides it was from the object on this dais that the configurations of light originated the patternsstars circles cones and more complex fig uresshifted constantly but their source was always the same it was a small staff about the length of a short sword of a dense black dull and apparently discoloured in a few places the discolorations were of a deep mottled blue could this be the runestaff hawkmoon wondered it seemed unimpressive for an object of such legendary powers he had imagined it taller than a man of bril liant coloursbut that thing he could carry in one hand suddenly from the side of the hall men thrust them selves in it was shenegar trott and his falcon legion the little boy still struggled in trotts grasp and now the laughter of the count of sussex began to fill the hall at last and it is mine even the king emperor will not dare to deny me anything once the runestaff itself is in my hands hawkmoon sniffed there was a fragrant bittersweet smell in the air and now a mellow humming sound filled the hall the great good ones began to lower himself and daverc until they stood high on the steps just below the runestaff and then count shenegar saw them how hawkmoon glared down at him raised his left arm to point directly at him release the child shenegar trott the count of sussex chuckled again recovering quickly from his astonishment first tell me how you arrived here before me by means of the help of the great good onesthose supernatural creatures you feared and we have other friends count shenegar trotts dirk leapt to within a hairsbreadth of the boys nose i would be a fool then to release my only chance of freedomnot to say success hawkmoon lifted up the sword of the dawn i warn you count this blade i bear is no ordinary instrument see how it glows with rosy light ayeit is very pretty but can it stop me before i pluck one of the boys eyes from his skull like a plum from the jar daverc glanced about the strange room at the con stantly changing patterns of light at the peculiar walls and the glowing shadows now high above and seemingly looking on its stalemate hawkmoon he murmured we can get no further help from the glowing shadows evidently they are powerless to take a part in human af fairs if youd release the boy id consider letting you leave dnark unharmed hawkmoon said shenegar trott laughed indeed and you would chase an army from the city you two we are not without allies hawkmoon reminded him possibly but i suggest you lay down your own swords and let me up to the runestaff there when i have that you may have the boy alive alive how can we trust shenegar trott of all men daverc said he will kill the boy and then dispose of us it is not the way of the nobles of granbretan to keep their word if only we had some guarantee whispered hawkmoon desperately at that moment a familiar voice spoke from behind them and they turned in surprise you have no choice but to release the child shene gar trott the voice boomed from within a helm of jet and gold aye my brother speaks the truth from the other side of the dais orland fank now emerged his gigantic waraxe on his leatherclad shoulder how did you get here hawkmoon asked in aston ishment i might ask the same grinned fank at least you now have friends with whom to debate this dilemma chapter ten spirit of the runestaff shenegar trott count of sussex chuckled again and shook his head well there are now four of you but it does not alter the situation a scrap i have thou sands at my back i have the boy you will kindly step aside gentlemen while i take the runestaff for my own orland fanks rawboned face split in a huge grin while the warrior in jet and gold merely shifted his ar moured feet a little hawkmoon and daverc look ques tioningly at them i think there is a weakness in your argument my friend said orland fank oh no sirthere is none shenegar trott began to move forward ayeid say that there was trott paused what is it then you are assuming you can hold yon boy are you not i could kill him before you could take him ayebut youre assuming the child has no means of escaping from you are you not he cant wriggle free shenegar trott held the child up by the slack of his garments and began to laugh loudly see and then the granbretanian yelled in astonishment as the boy seemed to flow from his grasp streaking out across the hall in a long strip of light his features still visible but oddly elongated the music swelled in the hall and the odour increased shenegar trott made ineffectual grabbing motions at the boys thinning substance but it was as impossible to grasp him as it was to grasp the glowing shadows now pulsing in the air above them by huons globehe is not human screamed trott in frustrated anger he is not human he did not claim to be orland fank said mildly and winked cheerfully at hawkmoon are you and your friend ready for a good fight we are grinned hawkmoon we are indeed now the boyor whatever it waswas stretching out over their heads to touch the runestaff the configura tions changed rapidly and many more of them filled the hall so that all their faces were crossed with shifting bars of colour orland fank watched this with great attention and it seemed that as the boy was actually absorbed into the runestaff the orkneymans face flooded with regret soon there was no trace of the boy in the hall and the runestaff glowed a brighter black seemed to have sen tience hawkmoon gasped who was he orland fank fank blinked who why the spirit of the runestaff he rarely materialises in human form you were es pecially honoured shenegar trott was screaming in fury then he broke off as a great voice boomed from the closed helm of the warrior in jet and gold now you must prepare your self for death count of sussex trott laughed crazily you are still mistaken there are four of youthousands of us you shall die and then i shall claim the runestaff the warrior turned to hawkmoon duke of koln would you care to summon some aid with pleasure grinned hawkmoon and he raised the rosy sword high in the air i summon the legion of the dawn a rosy light filled the hall flooding over the colourful patterns in the air and there stood a hundred fierce warriors framed each in his own scarlet aura the warriors had a barbaric appearance as if they came from an earlier more primitive age they bore great spiked clubs decorated with ornate carvings lances bound with tufts of dyed hair their brown bodies and faces were smeared with paint and clad in loincloths of bright stuff on their arms and legs were strapped wooden discs for protection their large black eyes were full of a remote sorrow and they gave voice to a mourn ful moaning dirge these were the warriors of the dawn even the hardened members of the falcon legion cried out in horror as the warriors appeared from nowhere shenegar trott took a step backward i would advise you to lay down your weapons and make yourselves our prisoners hawkmoon advised grimly trott shook his head never there are still more of us than there are of you then we must begin our battle hawkmoon said and he moved down the steps towards his enemies now shenegar trott drew his own great battleblade and dropped to a fighting position hawkmoon swung at him with the sword of the dawn but trott dodged aside swinging at hawkmoon and barely missing goug ing a line across his stomach hawkmoon was at a disad vantage for trott was fully armoured while hawkmoon wore only silk the dirge of the soldiers of the dawn changed to a great howl as they rushed down the steps behind hawkmoon and began to hack and stab about them with clubs and lances the fierce falcon fighters met them valiantly giving as good as they received but were plainly demoralised when they discovered that for every warrior of the dawn that they slew another appeared from nowhere to take his place daverc orland fank and the warrior in jet and gold moved more slowly down the steps swinging their blades in unison before them and driving back the fal cons with three pendulums of steel shenegar trott struck again at hawkmoon and ripped the sleeve of his shirt hawkmoon flung out his swordarm and the sword of the dawn met trotts mask denting it so that the features took on an even more gro tesque appearance but then as hawkmoon leapt backward poised to continue the fight he felt a sudden blow on the back of his head halfturned and saw a falcon warrior had struck him with the haft of an axe he tried to recover but then began to fall as he lost his senses he saw the warriors of dawn fade into oblivion desperately he tried to recover for the warriors of dawn it seemed could not exist unless he had control of his senses but it was too late as he fell to the steps he heard shenegar trott chuckling chapter eleven a brother slain hawkmoon heard the distant din of battle shook his head and peered through a haze of red and black he tried to rise but at least four corpses pinned him down his friends had taken good account of themselves struggling up he saw that shenegar trott had reached the runestaff and there stood the warrior in jet and gold evidently badly wounded hacked at by a hundred blades attempting to stop the granbretanian but shenegar trott raised a huge mace and brought it down on the warriors helm he staggered and the helm crumpled hawkmoon gathered his breath to cry hoarsely legion of the dawn return to me legion of the dawn at last the barbaric warriors reappeared lashing about them at the startled falcons hawkmoon staggered up the steps to the warriors aid unable to see if any of the others lived but then the huge weight of the jet and gold armour began to fall towards him knocking him backwards he support ed it as best he could but he knew by the feel of it that there was no life in the body within he forced back the visor weeping for the man he had never considered a friend until now curious to see the features of the one who had guided his destiny for so long but the visor would hardly move an inch shene gar trotts mace had buckled it so warrior the warrior is dead shenegar trott had flung off his mask and was reaching for the runestaff tri umphantly staring over his shoulder at hawkmoon as shall you be in a trice dorian hawkmoon with a shout of fury hawkmoon dropped the war riors corpse and flew up the steps towards his enemy disconcerted trott turned raising the mace again hawkmoon ducked the blow and closed with trott grappling with him on the topmost step while red car nage spread all around them as he struggled with the count he saw daverc half way up the steps his shirt a mass of bloody rags one arm limp at his side tackling five of the falcon war riorsand higher up orland fank was still alive whirl ing his battleaxe around his head and giving voice to a strange skirling cry trotts breath wheezed from between his fat lips and hawkmoon was astonished at his strength you will die hawkmoonyou must die if the runestaff is to be mine hawkmoon panted as he wrestled with the count it will never be yours it can be possessed by no man with a sudden heave he broke trotts guard and punched him full in the face the count screamed and came forward again but hawkmoon raised his booted foot and kicked him in the chest sending him reeling back against the dais then hawkmoon recovered his sword and when shenegar trott ran at him again blind with anger he ran directly on to the point of the sword of the dawn dying with an obscene curse on his lips and one last backward look at the runestaff hawkmoon tugged the sword free and looked about him his legion of the dawn were finishing their work clubbing down the last of the falcons and daverc and fank were leaning exhaustedly against the dais beneath the runestaff soon a few groans were cut short as spiked clubs fell on heads and then there was silence save for the faint melodic humming and the heavy breathing of the three survivors as the last granbretanian died the legion of the dawn vanished hawkmoon stared down at the fat corpse of shenegar trott and he frowned we have slain onebut if one has been sent here then others will follow dnark is no longer safe from the dark empire fank sniffed and wiped his nose with his forearm it is for you to make sure that dnark is safethat the rest of the world is safe hawkmoon smiled sardonically and how may i do that fank began to speak and then his eyes lighted on the huge corpse of the warrior in jet and gold and he gasped brother and began to stagger down the steps to drop his battle axe and gather the armoured figure in his arms brother he is dead hawkmoon said softly he died by shenegar trotts hand defending the runestaff i slew trott fank wept at length they stood together the three of them look ing about at the carnage the whole hall of the rune staff was full of corpses even the patterns in the air seemed to have taken on a reddish colouring and the bittersweet odour could not disguise the stink of death hawkmoon scabbarded the sword of the dawn what now i wonder he said weve done the work we were asked to do weve defended the runestaff suc cessfully now do we return to europe then a voice spoke from behind them it was the sweet voice of the child jehemia cohnahlias turning hawkmoon saw that he stood beside the runestaff holding it in one hand duke of koln you take what you have rightfully earned said the boy his slanting eyes full of warm hu mour you take the runestaff with you back to europe there to decide the destiny of the earth to europe i thought it could not be removed from its place you as the chosen one of the runestaff may take it the boy stretched out towards hawkmoon and in his hand was the runestaff defend it and pray it de fends you and how shall we use it daverc enquired as your standard let all men know that the runestaff rides with youthat the runestaff is on your side tell them that it was the baron meliadus who dared swear an oath on the runestaff and thus set into motion these events which will destroy completely one protagonist or the other whatever happens it will be fi nal carry your invasion to granbretan if you can or else die in the effort the last great battle between meli adus and hawkmoon is soon to be fought and over it the runestaff will preside hawkmoon mutely accepted the staff it felt cold dead and very heavy though the patterns still blazed about it put it inside your shirt or wrap it in a cloth ad vised the boy and none will observe those betraying forces until you should wish them revealed thank you said hawkmoon quietly the great good ones will help you return to your home the boy continued farewell hawkmoon farewell where do you go now where i belong and suddenly the boy began to change again turning into a streamer of golden light still bearing some sem blance of human shape pouring itself into the runestaff which immediately became warm vital and light in hawkmoons grasp with a slight shudder hawkmoon tucked the runestaff inside his shirt as they walked out of the hall daverc observed that orland fank was still weeping softly what disturbs you fank daverc asked do you still grieve for the man who was your brother ayebut i grieve for my son the more your son what of him orland fank jerked his thumb at hawkmoon who wandered behind his head bowed in thought he has him what do you mean fank sighed it must be i know that but still i am a man i can weep i speak of jehemia cohnahlias the boy the spirit of the runestaff aye he was my sonor myselfi have never quite understood these things book two as it is written those who swear by the runestaff must then benefit or suffer from the consequences of the fixed pattern of destiny that they set in motion and baron meliadus of kroiden had sworn such an oath had sworn vengeance against all of castle brass had sworn that yisselda count brasss daughter would be his on that day many months earlier he had fixed the pattern of fate a pattern that had involved him in strange destructive schemes that had in volved dorian hawkmoon in wild and un canny adventures in distant places and that was now nearing its terrible resolution the high history of the runestaff chapter one whispering in secret rooms the verandah overlooked the bloodred river tayme making its sluggish way through the very heart of londra between gloomy crazy towers above them the occasional ornithopter a bright bird of metal clanked past and on the river the barges of bronze and ebony carried cargo to and from the coast those cargoes were rich full of stolen goods and stolen men women and children brought as slaves to londra an awning of heavy purple velvet hung with tassels of scarlet silk protected the occupants of the veranda from view from above and the awnings shadow made it im possible for them to be seen from the river a table of brass and two golden chairs upholstered in blue plush stood on the verandah a richly decorated platinum tray on the table bore a wine jug of dark green glass and two matching goblets on either side of the door leading on to the verandah stood a naked girl with face breasts and genitals heavily rouged anyone familiar with the court of londra would have recog nised the slave girls as belonging to baron meliadus of kroiden for he had only female slaves and their only livery was the rouge he insisted they wear of the girls who stared fixedly out at the river one was a blonde al most certainly from koln in germany the barons pos session by right of conquest the other girl was dark doubtless from some province in the middle east baron meliadus had added by means of a bloodied sword to his estates in one golden chair sat a woman clad from head to foot in rich brocade and wearing a silver mask deli cately fashioned to resemble a heron next to her sat a figure dressed in bulky black leather his shoulders crowned by a huge mask representing a black snarling wolf he inserted a golden tube into his goblet and stuck the other end through a tiny aperture in the mask sucking slowly at the wine there was silence between the pair and the only sound came from beyond the verandahfrom the wake of the barges slapping at the wall from a distant tower as someone screamed and laughed at once from an orni thopter high above its metal wings flapping slowly as it sought to land on the flat top of one of the towers and then at length the figure in the wolf mask began to speak in a low thrilling voice the other figure did not move its head or appear to hear but continued to stare out over the blood red water whose strange colour was attributed to the effluvia which poured from outlets near its bed you are under some slight suspicion yourself you know flana king huon thinks you might have had something to do with the mysterious madness which overwhelmed the guards the night the asiacommu nistans escaped doubtless i am not helping my own cause by seeing you thus but i think only of our be loved homelandonly of the glory of granbretan the speaker paused as if expecting a reply he re ceived none it is plain flana that the present situation of the court is not in the best interests of the empire i delight in eccentricity of course as a true son of granbretan but there is a difference between eccentricity and senil ity you take my meaning flana mikosevaar said nothing i am suggesting continued the other that we need a new ruleran empress there is only one alive who is a direct blood relative of huononly one all would ac cept as rightful liege legal inheritor to the throne of the dark empire again no reply the figure in the wolf mask bent forward flana the heron mask turned to regard the snarling wolf visage flanayou could be queenempress of granbretan with myself as regent we could ensure the security of our nation and our territories make granbretan greater make the whole world ours and what would be done with the world once we owned it meliadus for the first time flana mikose vaar spoke enjoy it flana use it cannot one tire of rape and murder of torture and destruction meliadus seemed puzzled by her comment one can become bored by anything of course but there are other thingsthere are kalans experimentsand tar agorms for that matter with the resources of the world at their disposal our scientists could make anything why they could build us ships to sail through space as the ancients did we could journey to new worlds and conquer thempitting wits and skill against a universe granbretans adventure could last a million years and is adventure and sensation all we should seek meliadus ayewhy not all is chaos there is no meaning to existence there is only one advantage to living ones life and that is to discover all the sensations the human mind and body is capable of feeling that will take at least a million years surely flana nodded that is our creed true she ap peared to sigh therefore i suppose i can agree to your plans meliadus for what you suggest i do is doubtless no more boring than anything else she shrugged very well i will be your queen when you need me and if huon discovers our perfidy why it will be a re lief to die slightly unnerved by this meliadus rose from the table you will say nothing to anyone until the time comes flana i will say nothing good now i must visit kalan he is attracted to my scheme since it means more scope for his experiments if we succeed taragorm too is with me you trust taragorm your rivalry is wellknown aye i hate taragorm it is true and he hates me but it is a mellow sort of hatred now for youll remem ber that our rivalry began over taragorms marriage to my sister whom i had previously intended to wed my self but my sister compromised herselfwith a jackass i heardand taragorm discovered it whereupon as you no doubt heard my sister had her slaves slaughter her and the ass in some strange manner taragorm and i disposed of the slaves jointly and during that episode we rediscovered something of our old comradeship my brotherinlaw may be trusted he feels huon hampers his researches too much all this time their voices had not risen above a mur mur so that even the slavegirls by the door could not hear them meliadus bowed to flana snapped his fingers at the girls so that they ran to prepare his litter and carry him back through the corridors to his own home and left flana continued to stare out over the water hardly thinking of meliaduss scheme but dreaming instead of the handsome daverc and of days in the future when they might meet again and daverc would take her away from londra and all its intriguestake her per haps to his own rural estates in france which she if she were queen would be able to give back to him perhaps there would be an advantage to her becom ing queen empress then that way she could choose her husband and that husband would be of course daverc she could pardon him for his crimes against granbretan perhaps even pardon his companions hawkmoon and the rest but no meliadus might agree to davrecs reprieve he would not agree to sparing all the rest perhaps her scheme was foolish she sighed she did not altogether care there was even doubt that daverc was still alive in the meantime she saw no reason for not taking at least a passive part in meliaduss treason although even she had some inkling of the awful conse quences of failure of the magnitude of meliaduss scheme he must be desperate indeed to consider over throwing his hereditary ruler in all the two thousand years of his rule no granbretanian had previously dared think of deposing huon flana did not even know if it were possible she shuddered if she were made queen she would not choose immortalityparticularly if it meant becom ing a wizened thing like huon chapter two conversation beside the mentality machine kalan of vitall fingered his serpent mask with pale old hands on which the veins stood out resem bling themselves so many curling blue snakes ahead was the main laboratorya great lowceilinged hall in which many experiments were being performed by men dressed in the uniforms and masks of the order of the serpent of which baron kalan was grand constable strange machines gave off stranger sounds and stenches and miniature coloured lightnings flashed and cracked around them so that the entire area resembled some hell ish workshop presided over by devils here and there human beings of both sexes and varying ages had been strapped out or fitted into machines as the scientists tested their experiments on the human mind and body most had been silenced in some way but a few screamed or moaned or cried out in peculiar insane voices often to the annoyance of the distracted scientists who would stuff rags into the mouths or sever vocal chords or find some other swift method of achieving a measure of quiet while they worked kalan put one hand on meliaduss shoulder and pointed to a machine standing unattended nearby youll remember the mentality machine the one we used to test hawkmoons mind aye meliadus grumbled thats the one led you to believe we could trust hawkmoon we reckoned without factors we could not antici pate kalan said by way of defence well that is not why i mentioned my little invention i was asked to use it this morning by whom by the king emperor himself he summoned me to the throne room and told me he wished to test a mem ber of the court who who dyou think my lord myself meliadus spoke with outrage exactly i think he suspects your loyalty in some way lord baron how much do you think not much all that appears to be in huons mind is that you may be concentrating too much on your per sonal schemes and not enough on the interests of his own plans i think he would merely like to know how strong your loyalty is and if you have given up your per sonal plans do you intend to obey his orders kalan kalan shrugged do you suggest i ignore them nobut what shall we do i will have to put you in the mentality machine of course but i think i can obtain the results that would be most in our interest kalan chuckled a hollow whis per of sound from within his mask shall we begin me liadus meliadus moved reluctantly forward looking ner vously at the gleaming machine of red and blue metal with its mysterious projections its heavy jointed arms and attachments of unknown application its main fea ture however was the huge bell hanging above the rest of the machine depending from an intricate scaffold kalan threw a switch and gestured apologetically we once kept this machine in a hall of its own but space has become so limited of late that is one of my chief complaints we are asked for so much and given so little room in which to achieve it from the machine came a sound like the breathing of some gigantic beast meliadus took a step backward kalan chuckled again and signalled for serpentmasked servitors to come to help him operate the device if you will kindly stand beneath the bell meliadus we will lower it at once kalan suggested slowly suspiciously meliadus took his place the bell began to descend until it had covered him its fleshy sides writhing until they had moulded themselves com pletely to his body then meliadus felt as if hot wires had been inserted into his skull and that they were probing into his brain he tried to yell but was muffled hallucinations beganvisions and memories of his past lifemainly of battles and bloodshed though the hated face of dorian hawkmoon twisted into a million fearful shapes swam often before his eyes as did the sweetly beautiful face of the woman he desired above every thing yisselda of brass gradually through an eternity his whole life began to be built up until he had recalled all that had ever happened to him everything he had ever thought or dreamed of not sequentially but in or der of importance riding over everything was his desire for yisselda his hatred of hawkmoon and his schemes for ousting huon from power then the bell was rising and meliadus looked once again upon the mask of kalan meliadus felt mentally purged and in high spirits well kalan what did you discover nothing at this stage that i did not already know the full results will take an hour or two to process he giggled the emperor would be much amused to see them aye he will not see them i hope he will see something meliadus that will show that your hatred for hawkmoon is diminishing and that your love for the emperor is abiding and deep do not they tell us that love and hate are close together therefore your hatred of huon will become love with a little doc toring on my part good now let us discuss the rest of our project first we must find a way of bringing castle brass back to this dimensionor else of finding a way through ourselves secondly we must discover a means of reactivating the black jewel in hawkmoons skull and thus getting him into our power again lastly we must devise weapons and so forth to enable us to overcome huons forces kalan nodded of course there are already the new engines i invented for the ships the ships that trott left with aye the engines drive vessels faster and farther than anything ever before invented trotts ships are the only ones so far equipped with them trott should be reporting to us soon where did he go i am not sure only he and king huon knewbut it must have been a good distance awayseveral thousand miles at the least perhaps to asiacommunista that seems likely meliadus agreed still let us forget trott and discuss the details of our plan tar agorm also is working on a device which might help us reach castle brass perhaps it would be best for taragorm to concen trate on that line of research since it is his speciality while i try to find a means of activating the black jewel kalan suggested perhaps murmured meliadus first i think i will consult my brotherinlaw ill leave you now and return shortly with that meliadus summoned his slaves who brought his litter he climbed into it waved farewell to kalan and directed the girls to take him to the palace of time chapter three taragorm of the palace of time in taragorms strange palace shaped like a gigan tic clock the air was full of clanks and whirrs and the whistling of pendula and balance wheels and taragorm in his huge clock mask which told the time as accurately as the other clocks in the palace took meliaduss arm and guided him through the hall of the pendulum where a short distance above meliaduss head the huge brass bob made to resemble an ornate blazing sun flung its fifty ton weight back and forth across the hall well brother meliadus shouted above the noise you sent me a message that you said i would be pleased to hear but the message only told me to come to see you aye i felt it best to tell you in private come tar agorm led meliadus through a short passage and into a small room in which stood only one ancient clock tar agorm closed the door and there was relative silence he indicated the clock it is probably the oldest clock in the world brothera grandfather it was called and it was made by thomas tompion i have not heard the name a master craftsmanthe greatest of his age he lived well before the onset of the tragic millennium indeed and has this something to do with your message of course not taragorm clapped his hands and a side door opened a lean ragged figure stepped through his face covered by a cracked plain leather mask he bowed extravagantly to meliadus who is this it is elvereza tozer brother you remember the name of course the man who stole mygans ring and then vanished exactly tell my brother baron meliadus where you have been master tozer again tozer bowed and then sat himself down on the edge of the table spreading his arms wide why ive been to castle brass my lord suddenly meliadus sprang across the room to grab the startled tozer by the slack of his shirt youve been where he growled ccastle bbrass your honour meliadus shook tozer lifting him clear of the ground how i reached the place by accidenti was captured by hawkmoon of kolni was held prisonermy ring taken from mewithout ring could not remainescapedar rived bback here tozer gasped in fright he brought some information with him thats more interesting taragorm said tell him tozer the machine which protects themwhich keeps them in that other dimensionits in the dungeons of the castlekept carefully protected a crystal thing they got from a place called soryandum it took them there and it ensures their safety taragorm laughed it is true meliadus ive tested him a dozen times ive heard of this crystal machine but did not suspect it existed still and with the rest of the information tozer has given me i think i can achieve some results you can get us through to castle brass oh much more convenient than that brother within a short time i am fairly certain that i will bring castle brass back to us meliadus looked silently at taragorm for a moment and then began to laugh his laughter was so great then that it threatened to drown the noise of the clocks at last at last thank you brother thank you master tozer destiny is patently upon my side chapter four a mission for meliadus it was on the following day however that melia dus was summoned to king huons throne room as he made his way to the palace meliadus scowled in concentration had kalan betrayed him had the scientist told king huon the true results of the mental ity machines test or had king huon guessed for him self after all the monarch was immortal he had lived for two thousand years and had doubtless learned much were kalans faked records too clumsy to deceive huon meliadus felt panic rise within him was this the end of everything when he arrived in the throne room would huon order the mantis guard to destroy him the great gates swung open the mantis warriors con fronted him at the far end was the throne globe black and mysterious meliadus began to walk towards the throne globe eventually he reached it and bowed before it but for a long while it remained solid mysterious black was huon playing with him at length it began to swirl dark blue then green then pink and then white revealing the foetus shape with its sharp malevolent eyes staring down at meliadus baron noblest of rulers we are pleased with you meliadus looked up in astonishment great em peror we are pleased with you and we wish to honour you noble prince you know of course that shenegar trott left on a special expedition i do mighty monarch and you know where he went i do not light of the universe he went to amarehk there to discover what he could about the continentto see if we should meet resistance if we landed a force there it would seem then that he did meet resistance im mortal ruler aye he should have reported back a week or more ago we are concerned you think he is dead noble emperor we should like to discover thatand also discover who slew him if that is the case baron meliadus we wish to entrust you with the second expedition at first meliadus was filled with fury meliadus play second to that fat buffoon trott meliadus waste time questing about on the coasts of a continent in the hope of discovering trotts droppings he would have none of it he would attack the throne globe now if that senile fool above him would not be sure to have him cut down in an instant he swallowed his temper and a new scheme began to form in his skull i am honoured king of all he said with mock hu mility do i choose my crews if you wish then ill take men who i can be sure of members of the order of the wolf and the order of the vulture but these are not sailors they are not even ma rines the vultures have sailors among them emperor of the world and those are the men i will select as you say baron meliadus meliadus was astonished to discover trott had sailed to amarehk it made him even more resentfulhuon had entrusted the court of sussex with an assignment rightfully his another score to settle he told himself he was glad now that he had bided his time and ac ceptedor appeared to have acceptedthe kings orders his opportunity in fact seemed to have been handed to him by the creature he now considered to be his arch enemy after hawkmoon meliadus pretended to think for a moment if you believe the vultures to be untrustworthy monarch of space and time then may i suggest i take with me their chief their chief asrovak mikosevaar is deadkilled by hawkmoon but his widow inherited the constabulary flana a woman aye great emperor she will control them i would not have thought that the countess of kan bery could control a rabbit she is so vague but if that is your wish my lord then so be it for a further hour they discussed the details of the plan and the king gave meliadus all possible informa tion relating to trotts first expedition then meliadus left his hidden eyes full of triumph chapter five the fleet at deauvere overlooked by the turreted city of deauvere flanked on three sides by quays of scarlet stone the small fleet lay at anchor in a livid sea on the wide roofs of the buildings stood thousands of ornithopters fanci fully fashioned to resemble birds and mythical beasts their wings folded and in the streets below their pilots swaggered in masks of crow and owl mingling with the sailors in their fish and sea serpent helms and the in fantry and cavalrypig skull hound goat and bull who were preparing to cross the channel not by ship but by the famed silver bridge across the sea which could be seen on the other side of the city its great curve disappearing into the distance all delicate and shining and loaded constantly with traffic coming to and from the continent the menowar in the harbour were crowded with soldiers clad in wolf and vulture helms and armed to the teeth with swords spears bows quivers of arrows and flame lances and the flagship bore the banners both of the grand constable of the order of the wolf and of the grand constable of the order of vulture which had once been simply the vulture legion but which had been raised to the status of an order by king huon for the fighting it had done in europe and to honour the death of its bloodthirsty chieftain asrovak mikosevaar the ships themselves were remarkable in that they had no sails but were instead mounted with huge pad dlewheels at their sterns they were built of a mixture of wood and metalthe wood ornately carved and the metal wrought in baroque designs there were panels in their sides each carrying an intricate painting depicting some earlier sea victory for granbretan gilded figure heads decorated the forward parts of the ships represent ing the terrifying ancient gods of granbretanjhone jhorg phowl rhunga who were said to have ruled the land before the tragic millenniumchirshil the howl ing god bjrin adass the singing god jeajee blad the groaning god jhim slas the weeping god and aral vilsn the roaring god supreme god father of skvese and blansacredid the gods of doom and chaos the aral vilsn was the flagship and on the flagships bridge stood the brooding figure of baron meliadus beside him countess flana mikosevaar below the bridge in wolf and vulture masks the captains of the ships began to assemble having been summoned to the flagship by meliadus they looked up expectantly as meliadus cleared his throat you are doubtless wondering about our destination gentlemenand wondering too about the nature of these strange ships we sail in the ships are no mys terythey are equipped with engines similar to those powering our ornithopters and are the invention of that genius of granbretan baron kalan of vitall they can bear us swifter than sail across continents of water and do not need to wait on the will of the wind as to our destination that i will reveal in private this ship is the aral vilsn named after the supreme god of an cient granbretan who made this nation into what she is today her sister ships are the skvese and the blan sacredid which are the old words for doom and for chaos but they are also the sons of aral vilsn and represent the glory of granbretan the old dark glory the gloomy glory the bloody and terrible glory of our land a glory of which i am sure you are all rightly proud meliadus paused would you see it lost gentle men the answer roared back no no by aral vilsn by skvese and blansacredidno no and would you do anything to make sure that gran bretan retained her black might and her lunatic glory aye aye aye and would you all unite with me in an insane ad venture such as those embarked upon by aral vilsn and his peers aye tell us what is it tell us you would not shrink from it you would follow it through to the end aye shouted more than a score of voices then follow me to my cabin and i will detail the plan but be warned once you have entered that cabin you will have to follow me forever any who holds back will not leave the cabin alive then meliadus swung down from the bridge and strode into his cabin below it he was followed by every one of the captains who stood before him and every one of them was to leave the cabin alive baron meliadus stood before them his dark cabin lighted only by a dim lamp there were maps on his table but he did not consult them he spoke in a low vibrant voice to his men i shall not waste time further gentlemen but will tell you at once the nature of this adventure we are embarking upon treason he cleared his throat we are about to rebel against our hereditary ruler huon the king emperor there were many gasps from around the cabin as the wolf and vulture masks stared intently at baron melia dus king huon is insane meliadus told them quickly it is not personal ambition drives me to this scheme but a love for our nation huon is madhis two thou sand years of life has clouded his brain rather than given him wisdom he is trying to make us expand too rapidly this expedition for instance was to go to amarehk to see if the land could be conquered while we have barely crushed the whole middle east and there are still parts of muskovia that are not entirely ours and you would rule in huons place eh baron a vulture captain suggested cynically meliadus shook his head not at all flana mikose vaar would be your queen vulture and wolf would take the place of the mantis in the royal favour yours would be the supreme orders but the vultures are a mercenary order a wolf captain pointed out meliadus shrugged they have proved loyal to gran bretan and it could be argued that many of our own orders are moribund that fresh blood is needed in the dark empire another vulture captain spoke thoughtfully so flana would be our queen empressand you baron regent and consort i shall marry flana and aid her rule you would be the king emperor in all but name said the same vulture captain i would be powerful it is truebut flana is of the royal blood not i she is your queen empress by right of ancestry i shall be merely supreme warlord and leave the other affairs of state to herfor wars my life gentlemen and i seek only to improve the manner in which our wars are conducted the captains seemed satisfied meliadus continued so instead of sailing to amarehk on the morning tide we sail around the coast a little biding our time then make for the tayme estuary sail ing upriver to londra and arriving in the heart of the city before anyone can guess our intent but huon is wellprotected his palace is impossible to storm there will be legions in the city loyal to him surely said another wolf captain we will have allies in the city many of the legions will be with us taragorm is on our side and he is he reditary commander of several thousand warriors since his cousins death the order of the ferret is a small one to be sure but it has many legions in londra while other legions are in europe defending our possessions all the nobles likely to remain loyal to huon are abroad at this moment it is a perfect time to strike baron ka lan is also with ushe can aid us with new weapons and his serpents to operate them if we achieve a swift vic toryor at least make quick gainsthen it is likely that many others will join us for few will discover love for king huon once flana is on the throne i feel a loyalty for king huon admitted a wolf captain it is bred into us and so is a loyalty to the spirit of aral vilsnto all that granbretan stands for is that not a loyalty even more deeply bred into us the captain deliberated for a moment before nod ding ayeyou are right with a new ruler of the blood royal on the throne then perhaps our whole greatness will come to us oh it will it will promised meliadus fiercely his black eyes gleaming from his snarling helm chapter six the return to castle brass in the great hall of castle brass yisselda count brasss daughter wept and wept she wept for joy hardly able to believe that the man before her was her husband whom she loved with such passion hardly daring to touch him lest he prove a phantom hawkmoon laughed and strode forward put ting his arms around her and kissing at her tears then she too began to laugh her face becoming radiant oh dorian dorian we feared you killed in gran bretan hawkmoon grinned considering everything gran bretan was the safest place we saw in our travels is that not so daverc daverc coughed into his kerchief ayeand maybe the healthiest too the thin and kindlyfaced bowgentle shook his head in mild astonishment but how did you return from amarekh in that dimension to the kamarg in this hawkmoon shrugged his shoulders ask me not sir bowgentle the great good ones brought us here that is all i know the journey was swift taking but a few minutes the great good ones never heard of em count brass spoke gruffly stroking his red moustachios and try ing to hide the tears in his eyes spirits of some sort eh aye of some sort father hawkmoon stretched out his hand to his fatherinlaw you are looking well count brass your hairs as red as ever thats not a sign of youth count brass complained thats rust im rotting here while you enjoy yourself chasing about the world oladahn the little son of a giantess of the bulgar mountains stepped shyly forward im glad to see you back friend hawkmoon and in good health it seems he grinned offering hawkmoon a goblet of wine heredrink this as a welcome cup hawkmoon smiled back and accepted the goblet quaffing it in a single draft thanks friend oladahn hows it with you boring we are all boredand afraid you would not return well i am back and i think i have enough stories of my adventures to dispel your boredom for a few hours and i have news of a mission for us all which will bring you relief from the inactivity you have been suffering tell us count brass roared for all our sakestell us at once hawkmoon laughed easily ayebut give me a mo ment to look at my wife he turned and stared into yis seldas eyes and he saw that they were now perturbed what is it yisselda i see something in your manner said she some thing that tells me my lord that you are soon to risk your life again perhaps if it must be then it must be she took a deep breath and smiled at him but it will not be tonight i hope nor for several nights we have many plans to make aye she said softly glancing at the stones of the hall and i have much to tell you count brass stepped forward gesturing to the far end of the hall where the servants were laying the table with food lets eat we have saved our best for this home coming later as they sat with full bellies by the fire and bowgentle had finished recounting now tozer had sud denly vanished hawkmoon showed them the sword of the dawn and the runestaff which he drew from his shirt at once the hall was illuminated with whirling flames making patterns in the air and the strange bitter sweet scent filled the hall the others looked at the thing in silent awe until hawkmoon replaced it that is our standard my friends that is what we now serve when we go out to fight the whole dark empire oladahn scratched at the fur on his face the whole dark empire eh hawkmoon smiled gently aye are there not several million warriors on the side of granbretan bowgentle asked innocently there are several million i believe and we have about five hundred kamargians left at castle brass murmured count brass wiping his lips on his sleeve and giving a mock frown let me compute that daverc now spoke we have more than five hundred you forget the legion of the dawn he pointed at hawkmoons sword which lay scabbarded beside his chair how many in that mysterious legion oladahn asked i do not knowperhaps an infinite number perhaps not say a thousand count brass mused to be con servative of course making fifteen hundred warriors against several million supplied daverc aye several million equipped with all the resources of the dark empire including scientific knowledge we cannot match we have the red amulet and the rings of mygan hawkmoon reminded him ah yes those count brass seemed to scowl we have those too and we have right on our sideis that an asset duke dorian perhaps but if we use the rings of mygan to take us back to our own dimension and we fight a couple of small battles dose to home freeing the oppressed we can begin to raise some kind of peasant army a peasant army you say hm hawkmoon sighed i know it seems impossible odds count brass then count brass suddenly broke into a beaming golden smile thats right lad youve guessed what do you mean theyre just the sort of odds i like ill get the maps and we can begin to plan our initial campaigns while count brass was away oladahn said to hawkmoon elvereza tozer could have returned to londra and revealed our plans and our position we are very vulnerable at this moment friend hawkmoon count brass came back with the maps now lets see an hour later hawkmoon got up and took yisseldas hand bid goodnight to his friends and followed his wife to their apartments five hours later they were still awake lying in each others arms it was then that she told him they were to have a child he accepted the news in silence merely kissed her and held her closer but when she was asleep he got up and went to the window staring out over the reeds and lagoons of the kamarg thinking to himself that now he had something even more important to fight for than an ideal he hoped he would live to see his child he hoped his child would be born even if he did not live chapter seven the beasts begin to squabble meliadus smiled behind his mask and his hand tightened on flana mikosevaars shoulder as the towers of londra came in sight upriver it is going so well he murmured soon my dear you will be queen they do not suspect they cannot suspect there has been no uprising such as this for hundreds of centuries they are unprepared how they will curse the architects who sited the barracks on the waterfront he laughed softly flana was tired of the thrumming of the engines and the rumble of the paddle wheel as it pushed the ship along one of the virtues of a sailing ship she now real ised was that it was silent these noisy things would not be allowed in sight of londra once their purpose was served and she ruled but the irritation was slight and the decision unimportant again she turned her thoughts inward and forgot meliadus forgot that the only reason she had agreed to his plan was because she did not care what became of her she was thinking again of daverc the captains on board the leading ships knew what to do as well as kalans engines they were now equipped with kalans flame cannon and they knew their tar getsthe military barracks of the orders of the pig and the rat and the fly and others lining the river close to the outskirts of londra softly baron meliadus instructed his ships captain to raise the appropriate colour the flag that would give the signal to begin the bombardment londra was silent and still in the morning as gloomy as ever as darkly bizarre as usual with her crazy towers leaning into the sky like the clutching fingers of a mil lion madmen it was early none but the slaves would be awake none that is save taragorm and kalan waiting for the sounds of strife so that they could move their men into position the intention was to slay as many as possible then drive the rest towards the palace bottling them in containing them so that they should have not several ob jectives but by the afternoon one meliadus knew that even if they succeeded in this plan the real fighting would begin with the attack on the palace and they would be hard put to take it before reinforcements arrived meliaduss breathing quickened his eyes gleamed from the bronze snouts of the cannon flame spewed shrieking towards the unsuspecting barracks within the first few seconds the morning air was split by a tremen dous explosion as the first of the buildings blew up what luck meliadus exclaimed this is a splendid omen i had not thought to have such success so soon a second explosiona barracks on the other side of the waterand from the remaining buildings ran terri fied men some so alarmed that they had even left their masks behind as they scurried out the flame cannon caught them burning them to cinders their yells and screams echoed among the sleeping towers of londra the first warning most of the citizens had had wolf mask turned to vulture helm in expressions of silent satisfaction as they witnessed the carnage on the banks pigs and rats scuttled for coverflies flung themselves behind the nearest buildings and the few who had managed to bring flame lances with them opened fire the beasts had begun to squabble it was part of that pattern of destiny fixed by melia dus when on leaving castle brass in disgrace he had called upon the runestaff yet none could say how finally that pattern would resolve itself and who would be the ultimate victor huon meliadus or hawkmoon chapter eight taragorms invention by mid morning the barracks had been completely wiped out and the survivors were fighting in the streets near the centre of the city they had been reinforced with several thousand mantis warriors it was probable that huon still had no idea of what was really happen ing perhaps he thought the attack was by asiacommu nistans disguised as granbretanians meliadus smiled as he disembarked with flana mikosevaar and made his way to the palace of time on foot flanked by a dozen vultures and wolves the surprise had been complete his men had remained in the few open streets and had not ventured into the maze of corridors linking most of the towers as the warriors had emerged meliaduss men had picked them off now they were bottling them in for there were few windows from which huons sol diers could fight windows were not a feature of lon dras architecture for the granbretanians had little liking for fresh air or daylight what windows there were tended to be placed so high as to be useless to snipers even the ornithopters unequipped for fighting in a city such as londra were proving to be a smaller threat than meliadus had anticipated he was well pleased as he entered the palace of time and discovered taragorm in a small chamber brother our plans go wellbetter than i had ex pected aye answered taragorm with a nod to flana to whom like meliadus he had been married for a short time my ferrets have hardly needed to do anything as yet but doubtless theyll be useful in flushing out those who stay in the tunnels i plan to use them to come up on the enemy from behind as soon as we have properly located the main pockets meliadus nodded his approval but you sent a mes sage for me to meet you here why is that i believe i have discovered the means of bringing your friends of castle brass back to their natural envi ronment taragorm murmured his voice full of quiet satisfaction meliadus gave a deep groan and it was a moment be fore flana realised he was voicing his extreme pleasure oh taragorm at last the rabbits are mine taragorm laughed i am not entirely certain that my machine will work but i feel it might since it is based on an old formula i discovered in the same book as the one which mentioned the crystal machine of soryan dum would you care to see it aye lead me to it brother i beg you this way taragorm led meliadus and flana through two short corridors full of the noise of clocks and arrived at last outside a low door which he opened with a small key in here he took a torch from the bracket outside and used it to light the dungeon he had opened there it is on roughly the same level as the crystal machine at castle brass its voice can carry through the dimensions i hear nothing meliadus said with some disappoint ment you hear nothing because there is nothing to hear in this dimension but it makes a goodly sound i guarantee in some other space and time meliadus moved towards the object it was like a great brass skeleton clock the size of a man its pendu lum swung beneath it working the escapement lever moving the hands it had springs and cogs and looked in every respect like an ordinary clock made huge on its back was mounted a gonglike affair with a striking arm even as they watched the hands touched the halfhour and the arm moved slowly up to fall suddenly upon the gong they could see the gong vibrating but did not hear a whisper of sound incredible whispered meliadus but how does it work i have still to adjust it a little to ensure that it is op erating in exactly the correct dimension of space and time which with the help of tozer i have managed to locate when midnight comes our friends at castle brass should experience something of an unwelcome surprise meliadus sighed with pleasure oh noble brother you shall be the richest and most honoured man in the empire taragorms weird clock mask bowed slightly in recogni tion of meliaduss promise it is only fitting he mur mured but i thank you brother you are sure it will work if it does not then i shall not be the richest and most honoured man in the empire taragorm said with some humour doubtless in fact you shall see to it that i am rewarded in a less pleasant fashion meliadus flung his arms around his brotherinlaws shoulders do not speak of such a thing brother oh do not speak of it chapter nine huon confers with his captains well well gentlemen some sort of civil distur bance we gather the golden voice came from the wizened throat and the sharp black eyes darted this way and that at the gathered masks before them it is treason noble monarch a mantis mask said his uniform was untidy and his mask singed by a flame lance civil war great emperor another emphasised and very nearly a fait accompli murmured the man next to him almost to himself we were totally unprepared excellent ruler indeed you were gentlemen we blame you alland ourselves we were deceived the eyes moved more slowly over the assembled cap tains and is kalan amongst you he is not grand sire and taragorm purred the sweet voice taragorm is not present king of all so and some thought you saw meliadus on the flagship with countess flana magnificent emperor that is logical yes we have been very much de ceived but no matterthe palace is well defended we assume only a very large force could possibly hope to take it lord of the world but perhaps they have a very large force and if they have kalan and taragorm with them they have other powers were we prepared for siege captain huon addressed the captain of the mantis guard who bowed his head after a fashion excellent prince but such a thing is without precedent indeed it is perhaps we should seek reinforcements then from the continent said a captain all the loyal barons are thereadaz promp brenal farun shenegar trott shenegar trott is not on the continent king huon said politely jerek nankenseen mygel hoist yes yes yeswe know the names of our barons but can we be sure that these are loyal i would assume so great king emperor for their men perished today if they were in league with melia dus they would have given him those loyal to their or der surely your guess is probably accurate very wellrecall the lords of granbretan tell them to bring all available troops to squash this uprising as quickly as possible tell them that it is inconvenient to us the messenger had best leave from the roof of the palace we understand that several ornithopters are available from somewhere muffled and distant there was a roar as if from a flame cannon and the throne room seemed to tremble very slightly extremely inconvenient sighed the king emperor what did you estimate as meliaduss gains in the past hour almost the entire city save the palace excellent monarch i always knew he was the best of my generals chapter ten almost midnight baron meliadus sat in his own chambers watching the fires of the city he especially enjoyed the spectacle of an ornithopter crashing in flames over the palace the night sky was clear and the stars were bright it was an exceptionally pleasant evening to make it perfect he had a quartette of girl slaves once wellknown musi cians in their own lands play him the music of londen johne granbretans finest composer the counterpoint of explosions of screams and the clash of metal was exquisite to meliaduss ear he sipped his wine and consulted his maps humming to the music there was a knock on his door and a slave opened it his chief of infantry vrasla beli entered and bowed captain beli i must report sir that we are becoming very short of men we have achieved a miracle on very few sir but we cannot ensure our gains without reinforcements ei ther that or we must regroup or leave the city altogether and choose the ground on which we fightis that it captain beli exactly sir meliadus rubbed at his mask there are detachments of wolves vultures and even ferrets on the mainland perhaps if they were recalled would there be time sir well we should have to make time captain aye sir offer all prisoners a change of mask meliadus sug gested they can see that we are winning and might wish to join a new order beli saluted king huons palace is superbly defend ed sir and it will be superbly taken captain i am sure the music of johne continued and the firing contin ued and meliadus felt sure that all was going perfectly it would take time to capture the palace but he was confident that it would be taken huon destroyed flana put in his place and meliadus the most powerful man in the land he glanced at the clock on the wall it was nearing eleven oclock he got up and clapped his hands silenc ing the girls fetch my litter he ordered i journey to the palace of time the same four girls returned with his litter and he climbed in to sink among the cushions as they moved slowly along the corridors meliadus could still hear the music of the flame cannon the shouts of men in conflict admittedly victory had not yet been accomplished and even if he slew king huon there might be barons who would not accept flana as queen empress he would need a few months in which to con solidatebut it would help if he could unite them all into turning then hatred against the kamarg and castle brass hurry he called to the naked girls faster we must not be late if taragorms machine worked then he would have the double advantage of being able to reach his enemies and unite his nation meliadus sighed with pleasure everything was work ing so perfectly book three and now the resolution was imminent the heroes of the kamarg plotted in castle brassbaron meliadus plotted in taragorms palace of timethe king emperor huon plotted in his throne roomand all the plots that were made began to influence each other the runestaff too centrepiece of the drama was beginning to exert its influence upon the players and now the dark empire was divideddivided because of meliaduss hatred of hawkmoon whom he had planned to use as his puppet but who had been strong enough to turn against him perhaps it was thenwhen meliadus had chosen hawkmoon to use against castle brassthat the rune staff had made its first move it was a tightly woven dramaso tightly woven that certain threads were close to snapping the high history of the runestaff chapter one the striking of the clock there was a chill in the air hawkmoon drew his heavy cloak about him and turned his sombre head to regard his comrades each face looked at the table the fire in the hall was burning low but the objects on the table could be clearly seen first there was the red amulet its ruddy light stain ing their faces as if with blood this was hawkmoons strength giving its owner more than natural energy then there were the crystal rings of mygan which could transport those who wore them through the di mensions these were their passports back to their own space and time beside the rings was the scabbarded sword of the dawn in this lay hawkmoons army and finally wrapped in a length of cloth there was the runestaff hawkmoons standard and his hope count brass cleared his throat even with all these powerful objects can we defeat an empire as great as granbretan we have the security of our castle oladahn remind ed him from it we can go through the dimensions at will and return at will by this means we can fight a pro longed guerilla action until we have worn down the en emys resistance count brass nodded what you say is true but i am still doubtful with respect sir you are used to fighting classic bat tles daverc reminded him davercs pale face was framed by the collar of a dark leather cloak and you would be happier with a direct confrontation drawn up in ranks of lancers archers cavalry infantry and so on but we have not the men to fight such battles we must strike from the dark thereforefrom behind from cover at least initially you are right i suppose daverc count brass sighed bowgentle poured wine for them all perhaps we should get to our beds my friends there is more plan ning to do and we should be fresh hawkmoon strode to the far end of the table where the maps had been laid out he rubbed at the black jewel in his forehead aye we must plan our first cam paigns carefully he studied the map of the kamarg there is a chance there is a permanent camp surround ing the place where castle brass stoodperhaps waiting for its return but did you not feel that perhaps meliaduss power is waning daverc said shenegar trott seemed to think so if that is the case hawkmoon agreed then it is possible that meliaduss legions are now deployed else where since there seems to be some sort of contention at the court of londra as to whether we are very impor tant as a threat or not bowgentle made a movement to speak but then cocked his head to one side now they all felt a slight tremor run through the floor its damned cold count brass grumbled and went to the fire to fling on another log sparks flew and the log caught quickly the flames sending red shadows skip ping through the hall count brass had wrapped his bulllike body in a simple woollen robe and now he tugged at this as if regretting he had not worn some thing more substantial he glanced at the rack at the far end of the hall the rack contained spears bows ar rows maces swordsand his own broadsword and his armour of brass his great bronzed face was clouded again a tremor shook the building and the arms deco rating the walls rattled hawkmoon glanced at bowgentle noticing in the phi losophers eyes the same sense of inexplicable doom he felt a mild earthquake perhaps perhaps murmured bowgentle plainly uncon vinced now they heard a sounda distant sound like the booming of a gong so low as to be almost inaudible they rushed to the doors of the hall and count brass hesitated for a moment before flinging them open and looking up at the night they sky was black but the clouds seemed dark blue swirling in considerable agitation as if the dome of the sky were about to crack the reverberation came again this time plainly au dible the voice of a huge low bell or a gong it hummed in their ears it is like being in the belltower of the castle as the clock strikes bowgentle said his eyes full of alarm every face was paleevery face tense hawkmoon be gan to stride back into the hall walking with arm out stretched towards the sword of the dawn daverc called to him what do you suspect hawkmoon some kind of attack by the dark empire by the dark empireor by something supernatural hawkmoon answered a third stroke sounded filling the night echoing over the flat marshes of the kamarg over the lagoons and the reeds flamingoes disturbed by the noise began to squawk from the darkness a fourth followed louder stilla great booming bell of doom a fifth and count brass went to the rack and took up his broadsword a sixth daverc covered his ears as the sound in creased this is sure to bring on at least a mild mi graine he complained languidly a seventh yisselda ran down the stairs in her night clothes what is it dorian fatherwhats the sound it is like the striking of a clock it threatens to burst my eardrums oladahn looked up gloomily it seems to me that it threatens our very existence he said though i do not know why i think that a seventh stroke sounded and plaster fell from the ceiling as the castle shook to its foundations we had better close the doors count brass said as the echo died sufficiently for him to make himself heard slowly they moved inside and hawkmoon helped count brass push the doors together and replace the heavy iron bar an eighth stroke filled the hall and made them all press their palms to their ears a huge shield there since time immemorial clattered from the wall fell to the flagstones and rolled about noisily until it crashed to rest near the table in panic the servants came running into the hall a ninth stroke and windows cracked the glass splin tering this time hawkmoon felt as if he were on a ship at sea that had struck suddenly a hidden reef for the whole castle shuddered and they were flung about yis selda began to fall but hawkmoon managed to save her hanging on to a pillar to stop himself from top pling the sound made him feel sick and his vision was blurred for the tenth time the great gong reverberated as if the whole world shook as if the universe itself were filled with the sound signalling the end of everything bowgentle keeled over and fell upon the flagstones in a faint oladahn reeled about his palms pressing at his head he collapsed to the floor hawkmoon clung to yis selda grimly barely able to retain his grip he was filled with nausea and his head pounded count brass and daverc had staggered across the room to the table and were hanging on to it as it shook the stroke died hawkmoon heard daverc call hawkmoonlook at this supporting yisselda hawkmoon managed to reach the table and stared down at the rings of mygan he gasped every one of the crystals had shattered so much for our scheme of guerilla raids daverc said hoarsely so much perhaps for all our schemes the eleventh stroke sounded it was deeper and louder than the one before and the whole castle shud dered and flung them to the floor hawkmoon screamed in pain as the sound roared in his skull and seemed to sear his brain but he could not hear his scream above the noise everything was shaking and he rolled about on the floor at the mercy of whatever force it was mak ing the castle quake as it faded he crawled on his hands and knees towards yisselda desperately trying to reach her tears of pain streamed down his face and he knew by the warmth that his ears were bleeding dimly he saw count brass trying to rise by clutching at the table the counts ears gouted gore that matched his hair we are destroyed he heard the old man say destroyed by some cowardly enemy we cannot even see destroyed by a force against which our swords are useless hawkmoon continued to crawl towards yisselda who lay prone on the floor now the twelfth stroke sounded louder and more ter rible than the rest the stones of the castle threatened to crack the wood of the table split and the thing col lapsed with a crash flagstones suddenly broke in twain or shattered to fragments the castle was tossed like a cork in a gale and hawkmoon roared with pain as the tears in his eyes were now replaced with blood as the veins in his body threatened to burst then the deep note was counterpointed by anothera highpitched screamand colours began to flood the hall first came violet then purple then black a mil lion tiny bells seemed to ring in unison and this time it was possible to locate the sound as it came from below them from the dungeons weakly hawkmoon attempted to rise and then fell face down on the stones the note boomed gradually away the colours began to fade the ringing sound sub sided quite suddenly so there was silence chapter two the blackened marsh the crystal is destroyed hawkmoon shook his head and blinked his eyes eh the crystal is destroyed daverc knelt beside him trying to help him to his feet yisselda hawkmoon said how is she no worse than you we have put her to bed the crystal is destroyed hawkmoon dug dried blood from ears and nostrils you mean the rings of mygan daverctell him more clearly it was bowgentles voice tell him that the machine of the wraith folk is broken broken hawkmoon heaved himself to his feet was that the final shattering sound i heard that was it now count brass stood nearby leaning wearily on a table and mopping at his face the vibra tions destroyed the crystals then hawkmoon glanced questioningly at count brass who nodded ayewere back in our own dimension and not under attack it does not seem so hawkmoon took a deep breath and began to walk slowly to the main doors of the hall painfully he drew back the iron bar and tugged the doors open it was still night the stars in the sky remained the same but the swirling blue clouds had vanished and there was an uncanny silence hanging over the area a strange smell in the air but no flamingoes squawked no wind sighed through the reeds slowly thoughtfully hawkmoon closed the doors again where are the legions daverc asked one would have thought they were waiting for usat least a few hawkmoon frowned well have to wait until morn ing before we can guess the answer to that perhaps they are out there planning to take us by surprise do you think that sound was sent by the dark em pire oladahn asked without doubt count brass answered they have succeeded in their object they have brought us back to our own dimension he sniffed the air i wish i could identify that smell daverc was sorting things from the wreckage of the table it is a miracle that we are alive he said aye said hawkmoon that noise seemed to affect inanimate things worse than us two of the older servants are dead count brass said quietly their hearts could not stand it i suppose they are being buried now in case it is not possible in the morning in the inner courtyard what of the castle oladahn asked count brass shrugged its hard to tell ive been down to the dungeons the crystal machine is com pletely smashed and some of the stonework is cracked but this is a strong old castle she seems to have fared not too badly no window glass of course no glass of any sort intact otherwise he shrugged as if his be loved castle had ceased to matter to him otherwise we are still standing as firm as we did before lets hope so murmured daverc he held the sword of the dawn by its scabbard and the red amulet by its chain he offered them to hawkmoon youd best don these for it is certain that you will soon have need of them hawkmoon put the amulet around his neck and buckled the scabbard to his belt then he stopped and picked up the swaddled runestaff this does not seem to be bringing us the luck i had hoped he said and sighed dawn came at last it came slowly and it came grey and chill the horizon white as an old corpse and the clouds the colour of bone five heroes watched it rise they stood outside the gates of castle brass on the hill and their hands were on their swords their grips tightening as they saw the scene below it was the kamarg they had left but it was a kamarg wasted by war the smell they had spoken of earlier was the smell of carnage of a burnt land for as far as they could see all was black ruin the marshes and lagoons had all been dried up by the fire of the flame cannon the flamingoes the horses and the bulls had been de stroyed or fled the watchtowers which had guarded the borders were flattened it seemed as if the whole world were a sea of grey ash it is all gone said count brass in a low voice all gone my beloved kamarg my people my animals i was their elected lord guardian and i failed in my task now there is nothing to live for save vengeance let me reach the gates of londra and see the city taken then i will die but not before chapter three dark empire carnage by the time they reached the borders of the ka marg hawkmoon and oladahn were covered from head to foot in clinging ash which stung their nostrils and was harsh in their throats their horses too were cov ered in the stuff and their eyes were as red as their riders now the sea of ash gave way to sparse yellow grassland and still they had found no sign of the legions of the dark empire a little watery sunshine broke through the layers of cloud as hawkmoon drew his horse to a halt and consult ed his map he pointed due east the village of verlin lies yonder lets ride cautiously and see if granbre tanian troops still occupy it the village came in sight at last and when he saw it hawkmoon began to gallop faster oladahn called from behind him what is it duke dorian what has happened hawkmoon did not reply for as they neared the vil lage it could be seen that half the buildings lay in ruins that corpses choked the streets and still no sign of the dark empire troops many of the buildings had been blackened by flame lance fire and some of the corpses had been slain by same lances here and there lay the body of a granbre tanian an armoured figure with its mask tilting skyward they were all wolves here by the look of it hawkmoon murmured meliaduss men it seems they fell upon the villagers and the villagers attacked them back seethat wolf was stabbed by a reaping hook that one died from the blow of the spade still in his neck maybe the villagers rose up against them oladahn suggested and the wolves retaliated then why did they leave the village hawkmoon pointed out they were garrisoned here they guided their horses over the bodies of the fallen the stink of death was still heavy in the air it was plain that this carnage had been wreaked only recently hawkmoon pointed out gutted stores and the corpses of cattle horses even dogs they left nothing alive nothing which could be used for food it is as if they were in retreat from some more powerful enemy who is more powerful than the dark empire oladahn said with a shudder have we some new en emy to face friend hawkmoon i hope not yet this sight is puzzling and disgusting oladahn added there were not only men dead in the streets but children too and every woman young or old bore signs of having been raped before she had been slain mostly by means of a cut throat for the granbretanian soldiery liked to slay their victims as they raped them hawkmoon sighed it is the sign of the dark empire everywhere you venture he looked up bending his head to catch a small sound carried on the chill wind a cry someone still lives perhaps he turned his horse and followed the sound until he entered a sidestreet here a door had been broken open and a girls body lay half in the doorway half in the street the cry was stronger hawkmoon dismounted and walked cautiously towards the house it came from the girl quickly he knelt down and raised her in his arms she was almost naked her body covered with a few strips of torn clothing there was a red line across her throat as if a blunt dagger had been drawn across it she was about fifteen with tangled fair hair and glazed blue eyes her body was a mass of blueblack bruises she gasped as hawkmoon lifted her hawkmoon lowered her gently and went to his saddle returning with a flask of wine he put the flask to her lips and she drank gasping her eyes suddenly widening in alarm do not fear hawkmoon said softly i am an en emy of the dark empire and you live hawkmoon smiled sardonically ayei live i am dorian hawkmoon the duke of koln hawkmoon von koln but we thought you deador flown forever well i have returned and your village shall be re venged i swear what happened here i am not altogether sure my lord save that the beasts of the dark empire intended to leave none alive she looked up suddenly my father and mother my sister hawkmoon glanced inside the house and shuddered dead he said it had been an understatement they had been disgustingly mutilated he picked up the girl as she sobbed and took her to his horse i will carry you back to castle brass he said chapter four new helms she lay in the softest bed in castle brass tended by bowgentle comforted by yisselda and hawkmoon who sat beside her bed but she was dying she was dying not from her injuries but from sorrow she wished to die they respected that wish for several months she murmured the wolf troops occupied our village they took everything while we starved we heard that they were part of an army left to guard the kamarg though we could not think what there was to guard of that wasteland they were awaiting our return most likely hawk moon told her that would seem likely the girl said gravely she continued then yesterday an ornithopter ar rived at the village and its pilot went straight to the commander of the garrison we heard it rumoured that the soldiers were being recalled to londra and we were overjoyed an hour later the soldiers of the garrison fell upon the village killing looting raping they had or ders to leave nothing alive so that when they returned they would not meet resistance so that any others who came upon the village should not find food an hour af terwards they were gone so they plan to return hawkmoon mused but i wonder why they left some invading enemy perhaps bowgentle suggest ed bathing the girls brow that was my guessand yet it does not seem to fit hawkmoon sighed it is puzzlingfrightening that we know so little there came a knock upon the door and daverc en tered an old friend is here hawkmoon an old friend who the orkneymanorland fank hawkmoon rose perhaps he can enlighten us as he walked towards the door bowgentle spoke qui etly the girl is dead duke dorian she knows she will be avenged hawkmoon said flatly and he left to descend the stairs to the hall something is in the wind i agree friend orland fank was saying to count brass as they stood together beside the fire he waved his hand as hawkmoon joined them and how dyou fare duke dorian well enough in the circumstances do you know why the legions are leaving master fank i was telling the good count brass here that i do not ah and i thought you omniscient master fank fank grinned sheepishly tugging off his bonnet to wipe his face with it i still need time to gather in formation and ive been busy the while since you left dnark ive brought gifts for all the heroes of castle brass you are kind theyre not from me you understand but from well the runestaff i suppose ill give you them later theyve little practical use you might think but then its hard to say what is practical and what is not in the fight against the dark empire hawkmoon turned to daverc what did you dis cover on your ride much the same as you daverc replied razed vil lages all the inhabitants hastily slain signs of an over swift departure on the part of the troops i gather that there are still some garrisons in the large towns but they are skeleton staffedmainly artillery and no cavalry at all this seems insane murmured count brass if they are insane then we may yet take advantage of their lack of rationality hawkmoon said with a grim smile well spoken duke dorian fank clapped his red brawny hand on hawkmoons shoulder now can i bring in the gifts by all means master fank lend me a couple of servants to help if you will for theres six of em and theyre powerful heavy i brought them on two horses a few moments later the servants came in each hold ing two wrapped objects one in each hand fank him self brought in the remaining two he laid them on the flagstones at their feet open them gentlemen hawkmoon bent and pulled back the cloth that wrapped one of the gifts he blinked as the light struck his eyes and he saw his own face reflected perfectly back at him he was puzzled dragging off the rest of the cloth to stare in astonishment at the object before him the others too were murmuring in surprise the objects were battle helmets designed to cover the whole head and rest on the shoulders the metal of their manufacture was unfamiliar but it was polished more finely than the finest mirror hawkmoon had ever seen with the exception of two eye slits the fronts of the helms were completely smooth without decoration of any sort so that whoever stared at them saw a com plete image of himself the backs were crested in the same metal with clean simple decoration it struck hawkmoon how useful they could be in battle for the enemy would be confused by his own reflection would have the impression that he was fighting himself hawkmoon laughed aloud why whoever invented these must be a genius they are the finest helms i have ever seen try them on fank said grinning back youll find they fit well they are the runestaffs answer to the beast masks of the dark empire how do we know which is ours count brass said you will know fank told him the one you have opened the one with the crest the colour of brass count brass smiled and lifted the helm to place it upon his shoulders hawkmoon looked at him and saw his own face the dull black jewel in the centre of his forehead staring back in amused surprise hawkmoon lifted his helm over his head his had a golden crest now when he turned to regard count brass it seemed at first that the counts helm gave no reflection until hawkmoon realised that there were an infinity of reflec tions the others had put their helms on their shoulders davercs had a blue crest and oladahns a scarlet one they laughed with pleasure a goodly gift master fank hawkmoon said remov ing his helmet an excellent gift but what of the other two helms fank smiled mysteriously ahah yesthey would be for those who would desire them for yourself not for myself noi must admit i tend to disdain armour it is cumbersome stuff and it makes it harder for me to wield my old battleaxe here he jerked his thumb behind him at the axe secured by a cord on his back then who are the other two helms for count brass said removing his own helm you will know when you know fank said and then it will seem obvious to you how are the folk of castle brass faring you mean the villagers of the hill hawkmoon said well some of them were slain by the striking of the great gong recalling us to our own dimension a few buildings fell but all in all they survived well enough the remaining kamargian cavalry has survived about five hundred men said daverc our army aye fank said with a sidelong glance at the frenchman aye well i must be away about my business and what business would that be master fank oladahn asked fank paused in the orkneys my friend we are not asking of each others business he said chidingly thank you for the gifts oladahn said with a bow and forgive my curiosity i accept your apology fank said before you leave master fank i thank you on be half of us all for these welcome gifts count brass told him and could we bother you with a final question you are all prone to too much questioning in my own opinion fank said but then were closemouthed in the orkneys ask away friend and ill do my level best to answer if the question is not too personal do you know how the crystal machine came to be shattered count brass asked what caused it i would gather that lord taragorm master of the palace of time in londra discovered the means of breaking your machine once he understood its source he has many old texts which would tell him such things doubtless he built a clock whose striking would travel through the dimensions and be of such a pitch and volume as to shatter the crystal it was i believe the one remedy of the enemies of the folk of soryandum who gave you the machine so it was the dark empire brought us back hawk moon said but if that was so then why were they not waiting for us perhaps a domestic crisis of some sort orland fank said we shall see farewell my friends i have the feeling we will meet again shortly chapter five five heroes and a heroine as the gates closed behind fank bowgentle de scended the stairs and there was an odd expression on his kindly features he walked stiffly and his eyes had a distant look what is it bowgentle count brass said in concern moving forward to grip his old friend by the arm you seem disturbed bowgentle shook his head not disturbedresolute i have reached a decision it is many years since i have wielded a weapon larger than a pen borne anything weightier than a difficult problem in philosophy now i will bear arms against londra i will ride with you when you set out against the dark empire but bowgentle hawkmoon said you are not a warrior you comfort us sustain us with your kindness and your wisdom all these things give us strength and are as useful as any comrade in arms ayebut this fight will be the last fight win or lose bowgentle reminded him if you do not return then youll have no need of wisdomand if you do return youll have but little inclination to seek my advice for youll be the men who broke the dark empire so i will take up a blade one of yonder mirror helms will fit me i know the one with the black crest he stood aside as bowgentle went to the helm and picked it up slowly he lowered it over his head it fitted perfectly reflected in the helm they could see what bowgentle sawtheir own faces at once admiring and grim daverc was the first to step forward with his hand outstretched very well bowgentle it will be a pleasure to ride with someone of sophisticated wit for a change hawkmoon frowned it is agreed if you wish to bowgentle we shall all be happier for your riding with us but who is the other helm for i wonder it is for me the voice was low firm sweet hawkmoon turned slowly to stare at his wife no it is not for you yisselda how can you be sure well look at itthe helm with the white crest is it not smaller than the others suitable for a boyor a woman aye hawkmoon answered reluctantly and am i not count brasss daughter you are and cannot i ride as well as any of you you can and did i not fight in the bullring as a girland win honour there and did i not train with the guardians of the kamarg in the arts of the axe the sword and the same lance father it is true she was proficient in all these arts count brass said soberly but proficiency is not all that is re quired of a warrior am i not strong ayefor a woman answered the lord of castle brass soft and as strong as silk i believe a local poet said he glanced sardonically at bowgentle who blushed is it stamina then that i lack yisselda asked her eyes flashing with a mixture of defiance and humour noyou have more than enough stamina hawk moon said courage do i lack courage there is none more courageous than you my child count brass agreed then what quality do i lack that a warrior has hawkmoon shrugged his shoulders none yisselda save that you are a woman andand and women do not fight they merely remain at the fireside to mourn their lost kin is that it or welcome them back or welcome them back well i have no patience with that scheme of things why should i remain behind at castle brass who will protect me we will leave guards a few guardsguards you will need in your battle you know very well that you will want every man with you aye thats true hawkmoon said but there is one other factor yisselda do you forget that you carry our child i do not forget i carry our child aye and ill carry it into battlefor if we are defeated there will be noth ing for it to inherit save disasterand if we win then it will know the thrill of victory even before it comes into the world but if we are all slainthen we shall die to gether ill not be hawkmoons widow and ill not bear hawkmoons orphan i will not be safe at castle brass alone dorian ill ride with you she went to the mir ror helm with the white crest and she picked it up she drew it over her head and spread her soft arms tri umphantly seeit fits perfectly it was plainly made for me we will ride together the six of us and lead the kamar gians against the massed might of the dark empirefive heroesand i hope one heroine so be it murmured hawkmoon moving forward to embrace his wife so be it chapter six a new ally the wolves and the vultures had fought their way back from the continent and were now pouring into lon dra coming into londra too were the flies the rats the goats and the hounds and all the other bloodthirsty beasts of granbretan from a high tower now his command headquarters meliadus of kroiden watched them arrive flooding in by every gate and battling as they came one group puzzled him and he strained his eyes to see it better it was a large detachment of troops riding under a black and white striped banner signifying neutrality the ban ner carried beside it now became easier to see meliadus frowned the banner was that of adaz promp grand con stable of the order of the hound did the neutral flag mean that he had not yet decided on whose side to fight or did it mean he planned a complicated trick meliadus rubbed his lips thoughtfully with adaz promp on his side he could begin an assault on the palace itself he reached for his wolf helm and stroked the metal head for the past few days as the battle for londra had reached deadlock meliadus had become pensivethe more so because he did not know if taragorms device had succeeded and brought castle brass back to its own dimension his earlier good humour based on his success in the initial fighting had been replaced by a nervousness resulting from several uncertainties the door opened automatically meliadus reached for his helm donning it as he turned ah its you flana what do you want taragorm is here taragorm eh has he something positive to tell me the clock mask appeared behind flanas heron mask i had hoped that you would have some positive news brother taragorm said acidly after all we have made no great gains for the past few days the reinforcements are arriving meliadus said pet ulantly waving his gauntletted hand at the window wolves and vultures pouring inand even some fer rets ayereinforcements for huon tooand seemingly in larger numbers than ours kalan should have his new weapons ready soon meliadus said defensively they will give us an ad vantage if they work taragorm spoke sardonically i am beginning to wonder if i have not made a mistake join ing you you struck too impetuously brother we must not quarrel or were finished there is no time now aye that ill grant you if huon wins were all doomed huon will not win we need a million men to attack the palace and succeed well find a million men if only we can make a little headway others will come over to our side taragorm ignored this statement and turned instead to flana it is a shame flana you would have made a beautiful queen she will still make a queen meliadus said savagely restraining himself from striking taragorm your pessimism amounts to treachery taragorm and will you slay me for my treachery brother with all my knowledge only i know all the secrets of time meliadus shrugged of course i will not slay you let us cease this arguing and concentrate instead on win ning the palace bored by the quarrel flana left the room i must see kalan meliadus said he has suffered a setback having to remove all his equipment to a new site so hastily come taragorm well visit him to gether they summoned their litters climbed in and had their slaves carry them through the dimly lit corridors of the tower down twisting ramps to the rooms kalan had adapted as laboratories a door opened and foulsmell ing heat struck their bodies meliadus could feel it through his mask he coughed as he left his litter and walked into the chamber where kalan stood his scrawny body naked to the waist and only his mask on his head supervising the serpentmasked scientists who toiled for him kalan greeted them impatiently what do you want i have no time for conversation we wondered what progress you were making baron meliadus yelled over the boiling sound good progress i hope the facilities are ridiculously primitive the weapon is almost ready taragorm glanced at the tangle of tubes and wires from which all the noise and heat and stink was issuing thats a weapon it will be it will be what will it do bring me men to mount it on our roof and ill show you in a few hours meliadus nodded very well you realise what de pends on your success kalan aye that i do im beginning to curse myself for joining you meliadus but im in with you now and can only continue please leaveill send word when the weapons ready meliadus and taragorm walked back through the cor ridors their litters following behind i hope kalan has not lost all sanity taragorm said icily for if he has that thing might destroy us or destroy nothing meliadus said gloomily now who is the pessimist brother returning to his apartments meliadus discovered that he had a visitor a fat visitor clad in gaudy silkcov ered armour with a brightly painted helm representing a savage and grinning hound baron adaz promp said flana mikosevaar emerg ing from another room he arrived shortly after you left meliadus baron meliadus said bowing formally i am honoured adaz promps smooth tones came from the helm what are the issues meliadus what are the goals the issuesour plans of conquest the goalsto put a more rational monarch on the throne of granbretan one who will respect the advice of experienced warriors such as ourselves respect your advice you mean promp chuckled well i have to admit that i thought you insane my lord not huon your pursuing this wild vendetta against hawkmoon and castle brass for instance i sus pected that it was motivated only by your private lust and vengeance you no longer believe that i do not care i am beginning to share your opinion that they represent the greatest danger to granbretan and that they should be exterminated before we think of anything else why have you changed your mind adaz meliadus leaned forward eagerly why you have some evidence not known to me more a suspicion or two adaz promp said slowly fatly a hint of this a hint of that what sort of hints a ship we encountered and boarded in the northern seas as we were returning from scandia to answer our emperors call a rumour from france nothing more what of the ship what ship was it one like those anchored on the river only much largerwith the strange contraption on its arse and no sails it was battered drifting and had two men aboard both wounded they died before we could transfer them to our own vessel shenegar trotts ship from amarehk ayethats what they told us but what has it to do with hawkmoon it appears they met hawkmoon in amarehk it seems they received their wounds from hawkmoon in some bloody battle in a city called dnark according to these menand they were ravingthe issue of the dis pute was the runestaff itself and hawkmoon won the dispute indeed he did there were two thousand of them we were toldtrotts men that isand only four including hawkmoon against them and hawkmoon won ayeaided by supernatural warriors according to he who lived long enough to babble the tale it all sounds like truth mixed with fantasy but it is plain that hawkmoon defeated a force much larger than his own and that he personally slew shenegar trott it does seem also that he has certain scientific powers at his disposal of which we know little this is confirmed by the manner in which they managed to escape from us the last time which brings me to my second tale picked up from one of your own wolves as we marched to lon dra whats that he had heard that castle brass has reappeared that hawkmoon and the rest took a town to the north of the kamarg and destroyed every man of ours occupying it its a rumour and hard to believe where could hawk moon have raised an army at such short notice such rumours are common in times of war melia dus mused but it is possible you believe hawkmoon a larger threat than huon thought its a guessbut i feel its an informed one im mo tivated by other considerations meliadus i think that the sooner we end this fight the better for if hawkmoon has an armyrecruited perhaps in amarehkthen the sooner we should clear it up im with you meliadus i can put half a million hounds at your disposal within the next day have you enough now to take the palace with those that i command possibly with artillery cover that you shall have meliadus pumped promps hand oh baron adaz i believe we shall have victory by the morrow but how many of us will be alive to see it i wonder promp said to take the palace will cost a few thousand livesperhaps even a few hundred thousand it will be worth it baron believe me meliaduss spirits were rising at the prospect of victory over huon but mainly he gloated that he might soon have hawkmoon in his power againparticularly if ka lan could really find a way of reactivating the black jewel as he had promised he would chapter seven the battle for huons palace meliadus watched them mount the contraption on the roof of his headquarters they were high above the streets and close to the palace where the fighting raged promp had not yet brought up his hounds but was wait ing to see what kalans machine would do before he made an open attack on the palace gates the huge building seemed capable of withstanding any attackit looked as if it could survive the end of the world it rose tier upon magnificent tier into the lowering sky flanked by four vast towers glowing with a peculiar golden light encrusted with grotesque basreliefs depict ing granbretans ancient glory shining with a million clashing colours protected by gigantic gates of steel thirty foot thick the palace appeared to look down con temptuously at the embattled factions even meliadus felt momentary doubt as he stared at it then returned his attention to kalans weapon from the mass of wires and tubes projected a great funnel like the bell of a monstrous trumpet and this was turned toward the palace walls crowded with hosts of soldiers primarily of the orders of the mantis the pig and the fly outside the city the ranks of other orders were preparing to assault meliaduss forces from the rear and he knew the time element was crucial that if he won a victory at the palace gates others would come over to his side it is ready kalan told him then use it meliadus growled use it on the troops manning the walls kalan nodded and his serpents trained the weapon kalan stepped forward and seized a great lever he turned his masked face to the lurid skies as if in prayer then he pulled the lever down the machine trembled steam rose from it it rum bled and quivered and roared and from the trumpet grew a gigantic pulsing green bubble that gave off in tense heat the thing broke loose from the muzzle of the weapon and began to move slowly down towards the walls fascinated meliadus watched it drift watched it reach the wall and settle upon a score of warriors with satisfaction he heard their screams break off as they writhed in the hot green stuff and then vanished com pletely the ball of green heat began to roll along the wall gobbling its human prey until suddenly it burst and green liquid boiled down the sides of the wall in viscous streamers it has broken it does not work meliadus yelled in rage patience meliadus kalan shouted his men were repositioning the weapon by a few degrees watch again he pulled down the lever again the machine shook and hissed and slowly another gigantic green bubble formed at its snout the bubble drifted to the wall rolled over another group of men and rolled again this one rolled longer until there was hardly a warrior left on the wall when it eventually burst now we send them over the wall kalan chuckled and pulled the lever once more this time he did not wait as one boiling green bubble left the muzzle he would bring another into being until at least a score of the things had drifted over the walls and into the court yard beyond he worked furiously totally absorbed in his work as the machine shuddered and hissed and threw off almost unbearable heat that mixture will corrode anything kalan yelled excitedly anything he paused for a moment to point look what it is doing to the walls sure enough the viscous stuff was eating its way into the stone huge pieces of highly decorated rock fell into the street below forcing the attackers to back off the mixture ate through the stone as boiling oil might eat through ice leaving huge jagged gaps in the defences but how will our men get through meliadus com plained that stuff will not care what it eats have no fear kalan chuckled the mixture only has a potency of a few minutes again he pulled the lever sending another huge green bubble of heat over the wall as he did so a whole section of the wall near the gates collapsed completely and when the smoke from the rubble cleared meliadus could see that there was now a way through he was elated a sudden whine now came from kalans machine and kalan began to fiddle with the improved controls leaping about from part to part giving hasty directions to his men taragorm emerged on the roof and saluted meliadus i underestimated kalan i see he moved towards the serpent scientist congratulations kalan kalan was waving his arms and screaming with pleasure you see taragorm you see herewhy dont you try it you merely depress this lever taragorm gripped the lever in both hands his clock mask turning to look at the wall through which it was now possible to see huons troops retreating into the palace itself pursued by the rolling spheres of death but then suddenly from the palace a flame cannon roared huons men had at last succeeded in positioning their artillery within the palace itself several bolts of fire shot over their heads and others splashed harmlessly on the walls below kalan chuckled in triumph those things are useless against my weapon aim it at them taragorm send a bubblethere and his finger stabbed towards the windows where the guns were positioned taragorm seemed as absorbed in the machine as ka lan and it amused meliadus to watch the two scientists playing like schoolboys with a new toy he felt in a tolerant mood now it was obvious kalans weapon was turning the battle in his favour it was time to join adaz promp and lead in the troops he descended the steps that took him to the interior of the tower and called for his litter once in it he leaned back comfortably feeling already a certain sweet triumph then overhead he heard a mighty explosion that shook the whole tower he leapt from his litter and be gan to run back the way he had come as he neared the roof he was driven back by an intense heat and saw ka lan his mask twisted and buckled staggering through the steam towards him get back kalan screamed the machine exploded i was near the entrance or i should have been killed its spilling my mixture all over the tower get away or well all be eaten by the stuff taragorm meliadus said what of taragorm there can be nothing left of him kalan said quicklywell have to leave the tower as fast as we can hurry meliadus taragorm dead and so soon after he had served my purpose meliadus followed kalan down the ramps i had known he would give me trouble after huon was defeated i had wondered how to cope with him but now my problem is solved my poor brother meliadus roared with laughter as he ran chapter eight flana observes the battle from the safety of her own tower flana mikose vaar watched the soldiers pour through the breached wall of the palace as the tower which had lately been meliaduss headquarters toppled tilted and fell with a crash upon the lower sections of the city for a moment she had thought meliadus destroyed when the tower fell but now she could see his banner leading the warriors into battle she also saw the banner of adaz promp beside it and knew that wolf and hound traditional rivals attacked king huon together she sighed the noise of the battle had intensified and she could find no escape from it the flamecannon vainly attempted to shorten range to fire down into the courtyard at the warriors as they rushed towards the great gates of the palace in which the green bubbles had eaten gaping holes but the artillery was useless it had been positioned anticipating a long siege and now it could not be moved down in time a few flame lances fired from the broken gates but no large artillery the sound of the battle seemed to fade as did the sight of it as flana thought again of daverc and won dered if he would come adaz promps news had raised her hopes for if hawkmoon were alive then daverc was likely to be also but would she ever see daverc would he die in some skirmish vainly attempting to resist the might of granbretan even if he did not die at once he was des tined to live the life of a hunted bandit for none could ever hope to do battle with the dark empire and succeed she supposed that hawkmoon daverc and the rest would die on some distant battlefield they might reach the coast before they were destroyed but they could not possibly come close to her for the sea sep arated them and the silver bridge across the sea would not be open to the kamargian guerillas flana considered taking her own life but it did not seem worth it at present when all hope was gone then she would kill herself but not before and if she were queen she would have some power there was a slight chance that meliadus would spare daverc for daverc in some ways was the least of meliaduss hates though the frenchman was considered a traitor she heard a great shout go up and looked again towards the palace meliadus and adaz promp were riding into castle huon victory was clearly in sight chapter nine the slaying of king hum baron meliadus rode his black charger full tilt through the echoing corridors of king huons palace he had been here many times before and always in hu mility or apparent humility now his snarling wolf visor was proud and a battlecry roared from meliaduss throat as he drove his way through the mantis guards whom once he had been forced to fear he struck about him with the great black broadsword he had wielded so well in huons service he made his horse rear and its hooves which had trampled the ground of a score of conquered lands struck down on insect helms and made long necks snap meliadus laughed meliadus roared meliadus gal loped for the throne room where the remnants of the defenders were gathering he saw them at the far end of the corridor attempting to bring up a flame cannon with a dozen mounted wolves behind him he did not pause but struck directly at the cannon before its sur prised operators could move six heads flew from their necks in as many seconds and all the artillerymen were dead flame lance beams shrieked around the black wolf helm but meliadus ignored them the eyes of his horse were red with battlemadness and it plunged forward at the foe meliadus pressed back the mantis guards hacking them down they died convinced that he had supernat ural powers but it was wild energy the elation of war driving me liadus of kroiden through the massive gates of the throne room to find the few remaining guards in con fusion all possible men had been used to defend the gates now as the mantis warriors advanced cautiously spears outraised meliadus shouted his laughter at them and rode through them before they could move gal loping towards the throne globe where earlier he had crawled the black globe shimmered and gradually the wizened shape of the immortal king emperor became visible the little foetus shape wriggled like a mal formed fish dashing back and forth across the confining bowl that was its life it was undefended it was helpless it had never believed that it would need to protect itself against such treachery even it in all its two thousand years of wisdom had not been able to conceive that a granbretanian noble would turn against his hereditary ruler meliadus there was fear in the golden voice meliadusyou are insane listenit is your king em peror speaking to you i order you to leave this place to withdraw your troops to swear your loyalty to me meli adus the black eyes once so sardonic were now full of ani mal fear the prehensile tongue flickered like that of a snake the enfeebled useless hands and feet flapped meliadus shaking with triumphant laughter meliadus drew back his great broadsword and struck at the throne globe he felt a shock run the length of his body as the blade crashed into the globe there was a white ex plosion a wailing cry a sound of shards falling to the floor and the splattering of fluid against meliaduss body he blinked his eyes expecting to look down upon the twisted tiny frame of his slain king emperor he says nothing but deep blackness his laughter changed to a scream of terror by huons teeth i am blind chapter ten the heroes ride out the fort burns well said oladahn turning back in his saddle to look for the last time upon the garrison it had contained a force of rat infantry but now not one lived save the commander who would take his time in dying for the citizens of the town had crucified him on the scaffold where he had crucified so many of their husbands wives and children six mirror helms now looked forward to the horizon as hawkmoon yisselda count brass daverc oladahn and bowgentle rode away from the town at the head of five hundred kamargian name lancers their first encounter since leaving kamarg had been a complete victory with surprise on their side they had wiped out the skeleton garrison in less than half an hour feeling little elation but with no sense of exhaustion hawkmoon led his comrades on towards the next town where they had heard they might find more granbre tanians to kill but then he reined his horse as he saw a rider gal loping towards them and realised that it was orland fank his battleaxe bouncing on his brawny back greetings friends i have some news for youan ex planation the beasts have fallen upon each other there is civil war in granbretan londra itself is the main battleground with baron meliadus in arms against king huon thousands have been slain so far so that is why there are so few here hawkmoon said removing his mirror helm and wiping his forehead with a silken kerchief he had worn armour rarely in the past months and he had not yet got used to the dis comfort they have all been recalled to defend king huon or to fight with meliadus it is to our advantage dont you think i do count brass broke in gruffly his voice more excited than usual for that means they are killing each other and improving the odds a little in our favour while they battle we move swiftly to the silver bridge crossing it and reaching the very shores of granbretan herself luck is with us master fank luckor fateor destiny fank said lightly call it what you will then had we best not ride swiftly to the sea yis selda said aye hawkmoon said swiftlyto take advantage of their confusion a sensible idea fank nodded and being a sensi ble man myself i believe i will ride with you you are most welcome master fank chapter eleven news of several sorts meliadus lay gasping on the stretcher as kalan bent over him probing at his blind eyes with his instru ments his voice was a mixture of pain and fury what is it kalan he groaned why am i blind simply the intensity of the light released during the explosion kalan said your sight should be restored in a day or so in a day or so i need to see i need to consolidate my gains i need to make sure that there are no counter plots hatched against me i need to convince the other barons to swear loyalty to flana now and then to find out what hawkmoon is up to my plansmy plansare they to be all destroyed most of the barons have decided to support your cause kalan told him there is little they can do only jerek nankenseen and the flies represent a serious threat and brenal farnu is with himbut farnu virtu ally has no order left most of the rats died in the early fighting adaz promp is even now chasing rats and flies from the city no rats left said meliadus suddenly thoughtful how many dead in all dyou think kalan about half the fighting men of granbretan half have i destroyed half our warriors half our strength was it not worth it for the victory you have won meliaduss blind face stared up at the ceiling ayei suppose so now he sat upright on the stretcher but i must jus tify the deaths of those who fell kalan i did it for granbretanto rid the world of hawkmoon and the scum from castle brass i must succeed or kalan i can not justify weakening the dark empires fighting force to such a degree have no fear on that score kalan told him with a faint smile for i have been working on another of my machines a new weapon an old one made to function again what is that kalan chuckled the machine of the black jewel baron meliadus hawkmoon shall soon feel the power of the black jewel as it begins to eat his brain a slow satisfied smile crossed meliaduss lips oh kalanat last kalan pressed meliadus back against the stretcher he began to rub ointment on the barons blind eyes rest now and dream of your revenge old friend we shall en joy it together kalan looked up suddenly a courier had entered the small room what is it what news the courier was panting i have come from the mainland your excellency i have news of hawkmoon and his men what of them again meliadus rose up from the stretcher the ointment dripping down his cheeks care less that a minion should see him unmasked what of hawkmoon they ride for the silver bridge my lord they plan to invade granbretan meliadus was in credulous how many men have they what is the size of their army five hundred horsemen my lord meliadus began to laugh chapter twelve the new queen kalan led meliadus up the steps towards a throne now replacing the sinister globe on the throne sat flana mikosevaar in a jewelled heron mask a crown upon her head the robes of state upon her body and before flana mikosevaar kneeled all those nobles loyal to her behold meliadus said in a voice booming coarse and proud through the vast hall your new queen un der queen flana you will be greatgreater than you have dreamed under queen flana a new age will blooman age of laughing madness and roaring plea sure the sort of pleasure we of granbretan hold dear the world shall be our toy the ceremony progressed with each noble in turn swearing his allegiance to queen flana and when at length it was finished baron meliadus spoke again where is adaz promp chief warlord of the armies of granbretan promp spoke up here i am my lord and i thank you for the honour you do me this was the first time meliadus had mentioned promps rewardcommand over all other commanders save meliadus himself will you report how the rebels fare adaz promp there are few left my lord those flies we have not swatted are dispersed and their grand constable jerek nankenseen is dead i slew him myself brenal farnu and the few remaining rats have bolted into holes somewhere in sussex and will soon be flushed out all others have united in their loyalty to queen flana that is satisfactory adaz promp and i am pleased and what of hawkmoons laughable force does it still progress towards us so our ornithopter scouts report my lord they will soon be ready to cross the silver bridge meliadus chuckled let them cross let them come at least half the distance then we shall wipe them out ka lan how do you manage with the machine it is almost ready my lord good now we must set off for deauvere to wel come hawkmoon and his friends come my captains come and meliadus was led back down the steps by kalan and along the hall until he came to the great gatesthe gates guarded not by mantis warriors but by wolves and vultures meliadus regretted he could not see them and thus savour his triumph the more after the doors had closed behind him flana sat frozen on her throne and thought of daverc she had tried to speak of him to meliadus but he had not heard her would he be killed she wondered she thought also of what had befallen her alone among the nobles of granbretan save shenegar trott she had read many old texts some of which were legends and alleged histories of the years before the tragic millennium she believed whatever became of herself and meliadus that she now presided over a court entering its last stages of decadence the wars of expan sion the internal strifeall were signs of a nation in its death throes and though that death might not come for another two hundred years or five hundred or a thou sand she knew that the dark empire was doomed she prayed that something better would emerge to take its place chapter thirteen what do you see meliadus held the reins of his heralds horse you must not leave me boy you must tell me what you see and i must plan the battle accordingly i will tell you my lord good are the troops all assembled they are my lord they await your signal and is that cur hawkmoon in sight yet figures have been seen riding towards us across the silver bridge they will ride directly into our ranks unless they flee meliadus grunted they will not fleenot hawk moonnot now can you see them yet i see a flash like silverlike a heliograph signal onetwothree fourfivesix the sun makes them shine so six silver mirrors i wonder what it can mean the sun on polished spears i think not my lord well we shall soon know yes my lord what now now i see six riders my lord at the head of a mass of cavalry each rider is crowned with flashing silver why my lord it is their helmets that shine are they wellpolished then they are helms they cover their faces ii can hardly bear to look upon them they are so bright strange still doubtless the helmets will break quickly enough beneath our weapons you have told them that hawkmoon must be taken alive but they can kill the rest i have my lord good and i told them what you saidthat if hawkmoon should clutch at his head and begin to act strangely they should tell you at once excellent meliadus chuckled excellent i shall have my vengeance either way they have almost reached the end of the bridge my lord they have seen us but they are not stopping then give the signal to charge meliadus said blow your trumpet herald are they charging herald they are my lord and what now have the armies met they have engaged my lord and what is happening i ami am uncertain my lordwhat with the flash ing of those helmets and somethere is a peculiar red light spreading over the scenethere seem to be more men in hawkmoons army than we at first thought in fantryand some cavalry by huons teethi beg your pardon my lordby flanas breasts they are the strangest warriors i have ever seen what do they look like barbaricprimitiveand yet so fierce they are driv ing into our forces like a coals through cream what it cannot be we have five thousand troops and they have five hundred all the reports confirmed that number there are more than five hundred my lord many more have all the scouts lied then or are we all going mad these barbarian warriors they must have come with hawkmoon from amarehk what now what now are our forces rallying they are not my lord what are they doing then they are falling back my lord retreating impossible they appear to be falling back rapidly my lord those that live what do you mean how many remain of our five thousand i would say about five hundred infantry my lord and a scattered hundred of cavalry tell the pilot of my ornithopter to prepare his machine herald i will my lord is the pilot ready to fly herald he is my lord and what of hawkmoon and his band what of the men in the silver helms they are pursuing the remains of our force my lord i have been deceived in some way herald as you say my lord there are many dead but now the barbarian warriors slaughter the infantry only the cavalry escape i cannot believe it o curse this blindness i feel as if i dreamt i will lead you to the ornithopter my lord thank you herald no pilotto londra hurry i must consider fresh plans as the ornithopter beat its way up into the pale blue sky meliadus felt a great silver flash pass across his eyes and he blinked looking down and he could see he could see the six flashing helmets the herald had men tioned he could see the slaughtered legions he had known would destroy hawkmoons force he saw the re mains of his cavalry scurrying wildly for their lives and he heard distant laughter he recognised as belonging to his most hated enemy he shook his fist hawkmoon hawkmoon silver flashed as a helmet turned to look upward no matter what tricks you use hawkmoon you will perish by the night i know you will i know he looked again seething as hawkmoon laughed on he looked for the barbarians who had routed his sol diers they had vanished it was a nightmare he thought or had the herald been in league with hawkmoon or were hawkmoons barbarians invisible to his eyes meliadus rubbed at his face perhaps the blindness so recently left him was still troubling him in some ob scure form perhaps the barbarians were on another part of the field but no there were no barbarians hurry pilot he called through the sound of the metallic wings flapping at the air hurrywe must re turn to londra as fast as we can meliadus began to think that hawkmoons defeat was not going to be as easy as he had guessed but then he remembered kalan and the machine of the black jewel and he smiled chapter fourteen the power returns slightly overawed by a victory in which they had lost only twelve killed and twenty slightly wounded the six removed their mirror helms and stared after the re treating horsemen they were not expecting the legion of the dawn count brass smiled unprepared they were startled and could hardly resist but they will be better prepared by the time we reach londra aye hawkmoon said and meliadus will put a good many more warriors in the field next time he fingered the red amulet about his throat and glanced at yisselda who was shaking out her blonde hair you fought well my lord she said you fought like a hundred men that is because this amulet gives me the strength of fifty men and your love gives me the strength of another fifty he smiled she laughed lightly you never flattered me so dur ing our courtship perhaps it is because i have come to love you even more than before he replied daverc cleared his throat wed best camp a mile or two on away from all this death ill tend to the wounded bowgentle said and turned his horse back to where the kamargian cavalry were grouped squatting beside their horses and talking among themselves you did well lads count brass called back it is like the old days eh when we fought across europe now we fight to save europe hawkmoon started to speak and then gave a terrible shriek the helmet fell from his grasp and he pressed both hands to his head his eyes rolling in pain and hor ror he swayed in his shadow and would have fallen had not oladahn caught him what is it duke dorian oladahn asked in alarm why do you cry my love yisselda dismounted swiftly helping oladahn support him through clenched teeth and pale lips hawkmoon managed to utter a few words the jewel the black jewelit is gnawing at my brain again i the power has returned i he swayed and fell into their arms his limbs swinging loosely and his face a terrible white as his hands dropped from his head they saw he spoke truth the black jewel was crawling with life it had regained its malevolent lustre oladahn is he dead yisselda cried in panic the little man shook his head nohe lives but for how long i cannot tell bowgentle sir bowgentle come quickly bowgentle hurried up and took hawkmoon in his arms this was not the first time he had seen the duke of koln thus he shook his head i can try to work a temporary remedy but i have not the materials that i had at castle brass in panic yisselda and oladahn and later count brass and daverc watched bowgentle work and at last hawkmoon stirred opening his eyes the jewel he said i dreamt it was eating my brain again so it will if we cannot find a way of blocking it soon murmured bowgentle the power has gone for the moment but we do not know when it will return again and in what force hawkmoon hauled himself to his feet he was pale and could hardly stand we must press on thento londra while there is time if there is time aye if there is time chapter fifteen the gates of londra the troops were massed outside the gates of lon dra as the six riders mounted the crest of the hill at the head of their cavalry hawkmoon ill with pain fingered the red amulet this alone was keeping him alive helping him fight the power of the black jewel somewhere in the city kalan was operating the machine that fed life to the jewel to reach kalan he had to take the city had to beat the multitude of warriors that with meliadus at their had now awaited them hawkmoon did not hesitate he knew he could not hesitate for every second of his life was precious he drew the rosy sword of the dawn and gave the order to charge gradually the kamargian cavalry topped the hill and began to thunder down on a force many times their number flame lances spat from the granbretanian ranks and were answered by the fire of the kamargians hawkmoon judged the moment right and flung his swordarm sky ward the legion of the dawn i summon the legion of the dawn and then he groaned as the pain filled his skull and he felt the heat of the jewel in his forehead yisselda beside him had time to cry out are you all right my love but he could not give an answer and then they were in the thick of the battle hawkmoons eyes were so glazed with pain he could hardly see the enemy could not tell at first if the legion of the dawn had materialised but there they were now their rosy auras lighting the sky he felt the power of the red amulet fill him as it fought the power of the black jewel and he felt his strength gradually returning but how long would it last now he was in the middle of a mass of fearcrazed horses striking about him at vulture helmeted warriors who bore longhandled maces with heads like the stretched claws of hunting birds he blocked a blow and struck back his great sword cutting through the war riors armour and into his chest he swung in the saddle to take another foe in the neck ducked a whistling mace and stabbed its owner in the groin the fight was noisy and the fighting hot and hysteri cal the air stank of fear and hawkmoon had soon de cided that this was the worst battle he had ever fought for in their shock at the appearance of the legion of the dawn the dark empire warriors had lost their nerve and were fighting wildly had broken their ranks had abandoned their commanders hawkmoon knew that it was to be a messy fight and one in which there would be few left alive at the end he began to suspect that he would not see the finish for the pain in his skull was growing stronger again oladahn died unseen by his comrades lonely and without dignity hacked to pieces by a dozen war axes wielded by pig infantry but count brass died in this manner he encountered three barons adaz promp mygel hoist and saka gerden the latter of the order of the bull they recognised him not by his helm which was plain save for its crest but by his body and his armour of brass and they rode at him in a packhound goat and bullwith their swords raised to chop him down but count brass looking up from the body of his last opponent who had slain his steed and thus left the count on foot saw the three barons riding down on him and took his broadsword in both hands and as their horses reached him he swung the sword cutting the legs of the horses from under them so that each baron was flung forward over his horses head and landed in the churned mud of the battlefield whereupon count brass dispatched adaz promo in a very undignified posi tion in the rear lopped off the head of mygel hoist as the goat baron begged to be spared and by this time had only the bull saka gerden to deal with baron saka had time to get to his feet and assume a decent fighting stance though he shook his head several times as count brasss mirror mask blinded him upon seeing this count brass ripped off his silver helm and threw it to one side displaying his bristling red hair and moustache in all its pride and battleanger i took two in an un fair manner growled the count so it is only fair to give you the chance to slay me saka gerden charged like the fierce bull of his order and count brass sidestepped him bringing his sword around in a swing to split saka gerdens helm down the middle and split saka gerdens skull also as the baron fell the count smiled and a spear was driven completely through his neck by a goat rider even then count brass turned wrenching the spear from his assailants grasp and flung his broadsword to catch the goat in the throat thus giving as good as he had received that was how count brass died orland fank saw it happen he had left the party be fore the battle but had joined them later and had done considerable damage with his battleaxe he saw how count brass died it was at about the moment when the dark empire forces lacking three of their leaders began to regroup closer to the gates and were only stopped from retreating behind the gates by baron meliadus who was most fearsome in his black armour his black wolf helm and his great black broadsword but then even baron meliadus was pressed back as hawkmoon yisselda daverc bowgentle and orland fank led their few surviving kamargians and the strange dirgecalling legion of the dawn against the beasts of granbretan there was no time to close the gates before the heroes of the kamarg had entered the city and baron meliadus realised he had always estimated hawkmoons power cor rectly and only now overconfident had underestimated it there was nothing for it but to bring up as many reinforcements as possible and get kalan to increase the power of the black jewel then his heart lifted he saw hawkmoon sway in his saddle his hands going to the silver helm saw the strange man in the bonnet and the chequered breeks grasp him and then reach behind him for the roll of cloth attached to his saddle fank murmured to hawkmoon try to listen man will you it is time to use the runestaff time to bring out our standard do it now hawkmoon or youll live less than a minute morel hawkmoon felt the power gnawing at his brain like a rat in a cage but he grasped the runestaff as fank handed it to him raised it high in his left hand and saw the waves and rays begin to fill the air around him fank yelled the runestaff i the runestaff we fight for the runestaff and fank laughed and laughed as the granbretanians fell back in fear so demoralised now in spite of their numbers that hawkmoon already felt the victor but baron meliadus was not prepared to be the con quered he screamed at his men that is nothing it is only an object it cannot harm you you foolstake them then the heroes of the kamarg rode forward with hawkmoon swaying in his saddle managing to bear the runestaff aloft through the gates of londra and into the city where still there were a million men to stop them now as if in a dream hawkmoon led his supernatu ral legion against the enemy the sword of the dawn in one hand and the runestaff in the other guiding his horse with his knees the press was so solid as pig and goat infantry tried to tear them from their saddles they could hardly move at all hawkmoon saw one of the mirrorhelmed figures fighting valiantly as a dozen beasts dragged it from its horse and he feared it was yisselda energy flooded into him and he turned trying to reach his comrade but an other mirrorhelmed horseman was already there hack ing about it and he realised it had not been yisselda in peril but bowgentle and that yisselda had come to his rescue to no avail bowgentle disappeared and the weapons of the beasts of the coats and the pigs and the hounds rose and fell above his body until eventually one held aloft a bloodied silver helmheld it aloft only for a mo ment for then yisseldas slim sword had sliced off the wrist so that blood fountained from the arm another searing charge of pain kalan was increasing the power hawkmoon gasped and his vision dimmed but he managed to protect himself from the weapons whistling around him managed to hold up the runestaff still as his vision cleared for the moment he saw that daverc was leaping his horse through the granbretan ians his sword whirling in all directions as he cut a road through them then hawkmoon realised where daverc was going to the palaceto reach the woman he loved queen flana and this is how daverc died daverc managed somehow to reach the palace which was still in the halfruined condition it had been in after meliadus had taken it so he was able to ride through the breach in the wall and dismount at the outer steps to run at the guards on the door they had flame lances he had only a sword he flung himself flat as the flames shrieked past his head rolled over to take cover in a ditch cut by the green fluid from one of kalans bubbles and found a flame lance there which he poked over the edge and used to cut down all the guards before they could know what had happened daverc sprang up he began to run through the tall corridors his boots echoing loudly he ran until at last he came to the doors of the throne room where a score of guards saw him and turned their weapons upon him but he used his own flame lance again and cut them down being singed only slightly in his right shoulder he pushed open the doors a crack and looked into the throne room a mile away was the dais but he could not see if flana sat on it otherwise the hall was empty daverc began to run towards the distant throne and he shouted her name as he ran flana flana flana had been daydreaming on her throne and looked up to see the tiny figure advancing she heard her name taken up by a thousand echoes in the huge hall flana flana flana and she recognised the voice but thought that she had probably not yet woken up the figure came closer and it had a helmet that shone like polished silver like a mirror but the bodywas the body not recognisable huillam she murmured uncertainly huillam daverc flana the figure wrenched off its mask and flung it from him so that it clattered across the great marble floor flana huillam she stood up and began to descend the steps towards him he opened his arms smiling with joy but they never touched in life again for a flame beam descended like a stroke of lightning from a gallery high above and burned off his face so that he screamed in ag ony and fell to his knees burned into his back so that he slumped forward and died at her feet while she sobbed great strangled sobs that shook her body and a voice of a guard from the gallery called in great selfapproval you are safe now madam chapter sixteen the final fight the dark empire forces were still swarming from every rathole in their maze city and hawkmoon noted with despair that the legion of the dawn was getting thinner now when a warrior was slain another did not always take his place around him the air was full of the bittersweet scent of the runestaff and strange patterns in the air then as hawkmoon saw meliadus a wave of pain gnawed again at his brain and he fell from his horse meliadus dismounted from his black charger and walked slowly towards hawkmoon the runestaff had fallen from his hand and the sword of the dawn was only loosely held hawkmoon stirred groaning around him the battle still raged but it did not seem to be anything to do with him he felt the energy leaving him felt the pain in creasing opened his eyes and saw meliadus ap proaching the helm snarling as if in triumph hawk moons throat was dry and he tried to move tried to reach the runestaff which lay on the cobbles of the street meliadus said softly ah hawkmoon at last and you are in pain i see you are weak i see my only dis appointment is that you will not live to witness your ultimate defeat and yisselda in my power meliadus spoke almost with pity with concern can you not rise hawkmoon is the jewel eating your brain behind that silver mask of yours shall i let it finish you or shall i give myself the pleasure can you answer hawkmoon would you care to beg for mercy hawkmoon grabbed convulsively for the runestaff his hand went around it and tightened almost immedi ately power seemed to flow into himnot much but enough to enable him to stagger to his feet and stand there swaying his body was bowed his breathing came in great panting sobs he stared blearily at meliadus as the baron lifted his sword to finish him hawkmoon tried to raise his own sword but failed meliadus hesitated so you cannot fight i grieve for you hawkmoon he reached forward give me that little staff hawkmoon it was upon it i swore my oath of vengeance upon castle brass and my vengeance is al most complete now let me hold it hawkmoon hawkmoon took two staggering paces backward shak ing his head unable to speak for the weakness in his body hawkmoongive it to me youshallnothaveit croaked the duke of koln then i shall have to kill you first meliadus raised his battle blade the runestaff suddenly pulsed with brighter light and meliadus stared full into his own wolfhelmed eyes as hawkmoons mask reflected his image back it startled meliadus he hesitated and hawkmoon drawing further energy from the runestaff raised his sword knowing he had only enough strength for one blow and that blow must slay the man who stood transfixed before him mesmerised by his own image and hawkmoon brought up the sword of the dawn and he brought it down again and meliadus gave a great agonised cry as the blade bit through his shoulder bone and down into his heart and his last words which came with his last painful breath were curse the runestaff i it has brought ruin upon gran bretan and hawkmoon collapsed to the ground knowing that now he would die that yisselda would die and that orland fank would die for there were few kamarg warriors left and the dark empire soldiers were many chapter seventeen the sad queen hawkmoon awoke in alarm staring full into the serpent mask of baron kalan of vitall he sprang up right on the bench groping for a weapon kalan shrugged turning to the group of people who stood in the shadows i told you i could do it his brain is restored his energy is restored his whole foolish personality is restored and now queen flana i would beg your permission to continue with what i was doing when you interrupted me hawkmoon recognised the heron mask it nodded once and kalan shuffled into the next room and care fully closed the door the figures stepped forward and hawkmoon saw with joy that one of them was yis selda he hugged her in his arms and kissed her soft cheek oh i feared that kalan would trick us she said it was queen flana who found you after she had ordered her troops to cease fighting we were the last alive or land fank and i and we thought you dead but kalan brought you back to life removed the jewel from your skull and dismantled the machine so that none may ever fear the power of the black jewel again and what business did you interrupt him in queen flana hawkmoon asked why was he so disgruntled he was about to kill himself flana said flatly i threatened to keep him alive forever if he did not do what he did daverc hawkmoon said puzzled where is daverc dead said the sad queen in the same flat voice slain in the throne room by an overzealous guard hawkmoons joy turned to gloom and are they all dead thencount brass oladahn bowgentle aye said orland fank but they died for a great cause and they freed millions from slavery until this day europe has known only strife now perhaps people will seek peace for they can see where strife leads count brass wished for peace in europe more than anything hawkmoon said but i wish he could have lived to see it perhaps his grandson will see it yisselda said you need fear nothing from granbretan as long as i am queen flana told them i intend to leave londra dismantled and meanwhile make my own town of kan bery the capital the wealth of londrawhich is almost certainly greater than all the wealth of the rest of the worldshall be used in rebuilding the towns of europe in restocking the farms of making good as best we can the evil we have done she drew off her mask revealing that great sad beautiful head and also i shall abol ish the wearing of masks orland fank seemed sceptical but he said nothing the power of granbretan is broken for ever he said and the runestaffs work is done he patted the bun dle under his arm im taking the sword of the dawn the red amulet and the runestaff itself into safekeep ing but if there should ever come a time friend hawk moon when you have a mutual need to rejoin each other then you shall rejoin each other i promise i hope the time does not come orland fank fank sighed the world does not change dorian hawkmoon there is merely the occasional shift in equi librium and if that shift goes too far in one direction then the runestaff attempts to right it perhaps the days of extremes are over for a century or two i do not know hawkmoon laughed but you shouldyou are omni scient fank smiled not i my friend but that which i servethe runestaff your sonjehemiah cohnahlias ah theres the mystery even the runestaff will not answer fank rubbed his long nose and looked at them over it well ill say farewell whats left of you you fought well and you fought for justice justice hawkmoon called after him as he left the room is there such a thing it can be manufactured in small quantities fank told him but we have to work hard fight well and use great wisdom to produce just a tiny amount aye hawkmoon nodded perhaps you are right fank laughed i know i am right and then he was gone and his voice came back to hawkmoon with just one last observation justice is not the law it is not order as human beings normally speak of it it is equi librium the correction of the balance remember that sir champion eternal hawkmoon put his arm around yisseldas shoulders aye i will he murmured and now we return to castle brass to make the springs flow again to bring back the reeds and the lagoons to bring back the bulls and the horses and the flamingoes to make it our ka marg once more and the power of the dark empire will never threaten it again queen flana smiled hawkmoon nodded i am sure of that but if some other evil should come to castle brass i shall be ready for it no matter how powerful it shall be or in what form it will come the world is still wild the justice fank spoke of has hardly been manufactured at all we must try to see that we can make a little more farewell flana flana watched them leave and she was weeping the end of the high history of the runestaff
