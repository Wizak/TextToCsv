 whispers and lies she said her name was alison simms the name tumbled slowly almost languorously from her lips the way honey slides from the blade of a knife her voice was soft tentative slightly girlish although her handshake was firm and she looked me straight in the eye i liked that i liked her i decided almost on the spot although im the first to admit that im not always the best judge of character still my first impression of the amazingly tall young woman with the shoulderlength strawberryblond curls who stood tightly clasping my hand in the living room of my small twobedroom home was positive and first impressions are lasting impressions as my mother used to say this is a real pretty house alison said her head nodding up and down as if agreeing with her own assessment her eyes darting appreciatively between the overstuffed sofa and the two delicate queen anne chairs the cushioned valances framing the windows and the sculpted area rug lying across the light hardwood floor i love pink and mauve together its my favorite color combination then she smiled this enormous wide slightly goofy smile that made me want to smile right back i always wanted a pink and mauve wedding i had to laugh it seemed such a wonderfully strange thing to say to someone youd just met she laughed with me and i motioned toward the sofa for her to sit down she immediately sank into the deep downfilled cushions her blue sundress all but disappearing inside the swirl of pink and mauve fabric flowers and crossed one long skinny leg over the other the rest of her body folding itself artfully around her knees as she leaned toward me i perched on the edge of the striped queen anne chair directly across from her thinking that she reminded me of a pretty pink flamingo a real one not one of those awful plastic things you see stabbed into peoples front lawns youre very tall i commented lamely thinking shed probably heard that remark all her life five feet ten inches she acknowledged graciously i look taller yes you do i agreed although at barely five feet four inches everyone looks tall to me do you mind my asking how old you are twentyeight a slight blush suddenly scraped her cheeks i look younger yes you do i said again youre lucky ive always looked my age how old are you that is if you dont mind take a guess the sudden intensity of her gaze caught me offguard she scrutinized me as if i were an exotic specimen in a lab trapped between two tiny pieces of glass under an invisible microscope her clear green eyes burrowed into my tired brown ones then moved across my face examining each telltale line weighing the evidence of my years i have few illusions i saw myself exactly the way i knew she must a reasonably attractive woman with good cheekbones large breasts and a bad haircut i dont know she said forty exactly i laughed told you we fell silent frozen in the warmth of the afternoon sun that surrounded us like a spotlight highlighting small flecks of dust that danced in the air between us like hundreds of tiny insects she smiled folded her hands together in her lap the fingers of one hand playing carelessly with the fingers of the other she wore no rings of any kind and no polish although her nails were long and caredfor i could tell she was nervous she wanted me to like her did you have any trouble finding the house i asked no your directions were great east on atlantic south on seventh avenue past the white church between second and third street no problem at all except for the traffic i didnt realize that delray was such a busy place well its november i reminded her the snowbirds are starting to arrive snowbirds tourists i explained youre obviously new to florida she looked toward her sandaled feet i like this rug youre very brave to have a white carpet in the living room not really i dont do much entertaining i guess your job keeps you pretty busy i always thought it would be so great to be a nurse she offered it must be very rewarding i laughed rewarding is not exactly the word i would use what word would you use she seemed genuinely curious something i found both refreshing and endearing it had been so long since anyone had expressed any real interest in me that i guess i was flattered but there was also something so touchingly naive about the question that i wanted to cross over to where she sat and hug her as a mother hugs her child and tell her that it was all right she didnt have to work so hard that the tiny cottage behind my house was hers to occupy that the decision had been made the minute she walked through my front door what word would i use to describe the nursing profession i repeated mulling over several possibilities exhausting i said finally exacting infuriating good words i laughed again as i seemed to have done often in the short amount of time shed been in my home it would be nice having someone around who made me laugh i remember thinking what sort of work do you do i asked alison stood up walked to the window and stared out at the wide street lined with several varieties of shady palms bettye mccoy third wife of richard mccoy and some thirty years his junior not an unusual occurrence in south florida was being pulled along the sidewalk by her two small white dogs she was dressed from head to toe in beige armani and in her free hand she carried a small white plastic bag full of dog poop a fashion irony seemingly lost on the third mrs mccoy oh would you just look at that arent they just the sweetest things what are they poodles bichons i said coming up beside her the top of my head in line with the bottom of her chin the bimbos of the canine world it was alisons turn to laugh the sound filled the room danced between us like the flecks of dust in the afternoon sun they sure are cute though dont you think cute is not exactly the word i would use i told her consciously echoing my earlier remark she smiled conspiratorially what word would you use let me see i said warming to the game yappy pesky destructive destructive how could anything that sweet be destructive one of her dogs got into my garden a few months back dug up all my hibiscus trust me it was neither sweet nor cute i backed away from the window catching sight as i did so of a mans silhouette among the many outside shadows on the opposite corner of the street is someone waiting for you for me no why i edged forward to have a better look but the man if hed existed at all had taken his shadow and disappeared i looked down the street but there was no one there i thought i saw someone standing under that tree over there i pointed with my chin i dont see anyone well im sure it was nothing would you like some coffee id love some she followed me through the small dining area that stood perpendicular to the living room and into the predominantly white kitchen at the back of the house oh would you just look at these she exclaimed with obvious delight gliding toward the rows of shelves that lined the wall beside the small breakfast nook her arms extended fingers fluttering eagerly in the air what are these where did you get them my eyes quickly scanned the sixtyfive china heads that gazed at us from five rows of wooden shelves theyre called ladies head vases i explained my mother used to collect them theyre from the fifties mostly made in japan they have holes in the tops of their heads for flowers i guess although they dont hold a lot when they first came out they were worth maybe a couple of dollars and now apparently theyre quite valuable collectibles i believe is the word they use and what word would you use she waited eagerly a mischievous smile twisting her full lips this way and that i didnt have to think very hard junk i said concisely i think theyre great she protested just look at the eyelashes on this one oh and the earrings on this one and the tiny string of pearls oh and look at this one dont you just love the expression on her face she lifted one of the heads gingerly into her hands the china figurine was about six inches tall with arched painted eyebrows and pursed red lips her light brown curls peeking out from under a pink and white turban a pink rose at her throat shes not as ornate as some of the others but she has such a superior look about her you know like some snooty society matron looking down her nose at the rest of us actually she looks like my mother i said the china head almost slipped through alisons fingers oh my god im so sorry she quickly returned the head vase to its original position on the shelf between two doeeyed girls with ribbons in their hair i didnt mean i laughed its interesting you picked that one it was her favorite what do you take in your coffee cream three sugars she asked as if she werent sure her eyes still on the china heads i poured us each a mug of the coffee id been brewing since shed phoned from the hospital said shed seen my notice posted to the bulletin board at one of the nurses stations and could she come over as soon as possible does your mother still collect she died five years ago im so sorry me too i miss her its why i havent been able to sell off any of her friends how about a piece of cranberryandpumpkin cake i asked changing the subject for fear of getting maudlin i just made it this morning you can bake now im really impressed im absolutely hopeless in the kitchen your mother never taught you to cook we werent on the best of terms alison smiled although unlike her other smiles this one seemed more forced than genuine anyway id love a piece of cake cranberries are one of my very favorite things in the whole world again i laughed i dont think ive ever met anyone who felt so passionately about cranberries could you hand me a knife i motioned toward a group of knives slid into the artfully arranged slots of a triangular chunk of wood that sat on the far end of the white tile countertop alison pulled out the top one a footlong monster with a tapered twoinch blade whoa i said overkill dont you think she turned the knife over slowly in her hand studying her reflection in the wellsharpened blade gingerly running her finger along its side temporarily lost in thought then she caught me looking at her and quickly replaced the knife with one of the smaller ones watching intently as the knife sliced effortlessly through the large bundt cake then it was my turn to watch as she wolfed it down complimenting me all the while on its texture its lightness its taste she finished it quickly her entire focus on what she was doing like a child maybe i should have been more suspicious or at the very least more wary especially after the experience with my last tenant but likely it was precisely that experience that made me so susceptible to alisons girlish charm i wanted really wanted to believe she was exactly as she presented herself a somewhat naive lovely sweet young woman sweet i think now sweet is not exactly the word i would use how could anything that sweet be destructive shed asked why wasnt i listening youve obviously never had a problem with your weight i observed as her fingers pressed down on several errant crumbs scattered across her plate before lifting them to her mouth if anything i have trouble keeping pounds on she said i was always teased about it kids used to say things like skinny minny she grows like a weed and i was the last girl in my class to get boobs such as they are so i took a lot of flak for that now suddenly everybody wants to be thin only im still catching flak people accuse me of being anorexic you should hear the things they say people can be very insensitive i agreed whered you go to school nowhere special i wasnt a very good student i dropped out of college in my first year to do what lets see i worked in a bank for a while sold mens socks was a hostess in a restaurant a receptionist in a hair salon stuff like that i never have any trouble finding a job do you think i could have some more coffee i poured her a second cup again adding cream and three heaping teaspoons of sugar would you like to see the cottage instantly she was on her feet downing the coffee in one seamless gulp wiping her lips with the back of her hand cant wait i just know its going to be beautiful she followed me to the back door an eager puppy nipping at my heels your notice said six hundred a month right will that be a problem i require first and last months rent up front no problem i intend to start looking for a job as soon as i get settled and even if i dont find something right away my grandmother left me some money when she died so im actually in pretty good shape financially speaking she added softly strawberryblond hair curling softly around the long oval of her face i had hair like that once i thought tucking several wayward waves of auburn hair behind one ear my last tenant was several months behind in her rent when she took off thats why i have to ask oh i understand completely we crossed the small patch of lawn that separated the tiny cottage from the main house i fished inside my jean pocket for the key to the front door the heat of her gaze on my back rendering me unusually clumsy so that the key fell from my hand and bounced on the grass alison immediately bent to pick it up her fingers grazing mine as she returned it to the palm of my hand i pushed open the cottage door and stood back to let her come inside a long sigh escaped her full lips its even more beautiful than i thought it was going to be its like magic alison danced around the tiny room in small graceful circles head arched back arms outstretched as if she could somehow capture the magic draw it to her she doesnt realize she is the magic i thought suddenly aware of how much id wanted her to like it how much i wanted her to stay im so glad you kept the same colors as the main house she was saying briefly alighting like a butterfly on the small love seat the large chair the bentwood rocker in the corner she admired the rug mauve and white flowers woven into a pale pink background and the framed prints on the wall a group of degas dancers preening backstage before a recital monets cathedral at sunset mary cassatts loving portrait of a mother and her child the other rooms are back here i opened the double set of french doors to reveal a tidy arrangement of galley kitchen bathroom and bedroom its perfect its absolutely perfect she bounced up and down on the double bed running eager palms across the antique white bedspread before catching her reflection in the mirror above the white wicker dresser and instantly assuming a more ladylike demeanor i love everything its exactly the way i would have decorated it exactly i used to live here i told her not sure why i hadnt confided anything of the sort to my last tenant my mother lived in the main house i lived back here a little halfsmile played nervously with the corners of alisons lips does this mean we have a deal you can move in whenever youre ready she jumped to her feet im ready right now all i have to do is go back to the motel and pack my suitcase i can be back within the hour i nodded only now becoming aware of the speed at which things had progressed there was so much i didnt know about her there were so many things we had yet to discuss we probably should talk about a few of the rules i sidestepped rules no smoking no loud parties no roommates no problem she said eagerly i dont smoke i dont party i dont know anyone i dropped the key into her waiting palm watched her fingers fold tightly over it thank you so much still clutching the key she reached into her purse and counted out twelve crisp bills proudly handing them over printed them fresh this morning she said with a selfconscious smile i tried not to look shocked by the unexpected display of cash would you like to come over for dinner after you get settled i heard myself ask the invitation probably surprising me more than it did her id like that very much after she was gone i sat in the living room of the main house marveling at my actions i terry painter supposedly mature adult who had spent my entire forty years being sensible and organized and anything but impulsive had just rented out the small cottage behind my house to a virtual stranger a young woman with no references beyond an ingratiating manner and a goofy smile with no job and a purse full of cash what really did i know about her nothing not where she came from not what had brought her to delray not how long she was planning to stay not even what shed been doing at the hospital when she saw my notice nothing really except her name she said her name was alison simms at the time of course i had no reason to doubt her she arrived for dinner at exactly seven oclock wearing a pair of black cotton pants and a sleeveless black sweater with her hair pulled dramatically back and twisted into a long braid so that she looked like an extended exclamation point she was carrying a bouquet of freshly cut flowers in one hand and a bottle of red wine in the other its an italian amarone alison announced proudly then rolled her eyes not that i know anything about wine but the man in the liquor store assured me it was a very good year she smiled her lightly glossed lips overtaking the entire bottom half of her face her mouth opening to reveal an acre of perfect teeth my own lips immediately curled into a heartfelt smile of their own although they stopped short of exposing the gentle overbite that not even years of expensive orthodontics had been able to correct completely my mother had always claimed the overbite was the result of a stubborn childhood habit of sucking on the middle and fourth fingers of my left hand while simultaneously rubbing my nose with the tattered remains of a favorite baby blanket but since my mother had virtually the same overbite im inclined to believe this aesthetic deficiency is more genetic than willful alison followed me through the living and dining rooms into the kitchen where i unwrapped the flowers and filled a tall crystal vase with water can i do anything to help eager eyes ferreted into each corner of the room as if memorizing each detail just pull up a chair keep me company i quickly deposited the flowers in the vase of lukewarm water sniffing at the small pink roses the delicate white daisies the sprays of purple wildflowers theyre beautiful thank you so much my pleasure dinner smells wonderful its nothing fancy i quickly demurred just chicken you eat chicken dont you i eat everything put food in front of me and its gone within seconds im the worlds fastest eater i smiled as i recalled the way shed demolished the piece of cranberryandpumpkin cake id given her that afternoon had it only been a matter of hours ago that wed met for some reason it seemed as if wed known each other all our lives that despite the difference in our ages wed been friends forever i had to remind myself how little i actually knew about her so tell me more about yourself i said casually searching through the kitchen drawers for a corkscrew not much to tell she sank into one of the wicker chairs at the round glass kitchen table although her posture remained erect even alert as if she were afraid of getting too comfortable where are you from i wasnt trying to pry i was just curious the way one is usually curious about a new acquaintance i sensed a certain wariness on her part to talk about herself or maybe i didnt sense anything at all maybe the small talk we made in my kitchen that night before dinner was nothing more than it appeared to be two people slowly and cautiously getting to know one another asking normal questions not overanalyzing the responses moving from one topic to the next without any particular plan no hidden agendas at least there were no hidden agendas on my part chicago alison answered really i love chicago where exactly suburbs she said vaguely how about you are you a native floridian i shook my head we moved here from baltimore when i was fifteen my father was in the waterproofing business he thought florida was the natural place to be what with all the hurricanes and everything alisons green eyes widened in alarm dont worry hurricane season is over i laughed finally locating the corkscrew at the back of the cutlery drawer thats the thing about florida i mused out loud on the surface everything is so beautiful so perfect paradise but if you look a little closer youll see the deadly alligator lurking just below the waters smooth surface youll see the poisonous snake slithering through the emerald green grass youll hear the distant hurricane whispering through the leaves alison smiled the warmth of that smile filling the room like steam from a kettle i could listen to you talk all night i waved the compliment aside using my fingers as a fan as if trying to protect myself from the heat knowing me i probably blushed have you actually seen a hurricane alison leaned forward in her chair several i struggled to open the bottle of amarone without breaking the cork in two it had been a long time since id had to open a bottle of wine i rarely entertained and id never been much of a drinker all it took was one glass of wine to start my head spinning hurricane andrew was the worst of course that one was something else makes you really respect mother nature when you witness something like that up close what words would you use to describe it she asked picking up the thread of our earlier game terrifying i answered quickly ferocious i paused twisting the corkscrew gently to the right gradually feeling the cork surrender begin its slow slide up the neck of the dark green bottle i admit to being suffused with an almost childish sense of pride and accomplishment as i lifted the vanquished cork into the air magnificent ill get the glasses alison was on her feet and in the dining room before i had time to tell her where the glasses were theyre in the cabinet i called after her unnecessarily it was almost as if she already knew where to look found them she returned with two longstemmed crystal goblets holding out first one then the other as i filled each about a quarter of the way theyre beautiful everything you have is so beautiful cheers i said clicking my glass gently against hers marveling at the deep red of the wine what are we drinking to good health the nurse in me responded immediately and good friends she added shyly to new friends i amended slightly lifting my glass to my mouth the rich aroma filling my head before id tasted a single drop new beginnings alison whispered her face disappearing into the roundness of the glass as she took a long slow sip of the wine mmm this is yummy what do you think i quickly mulled over the adjectives experts generally employed when describing fine wine fullbodied buttery fruity occasionally even whimsical never yummy what did they know i thought rolling the wine around in my mouth the way id seen men do in fancy restaurants feeling the flavor burst against my tongue yummy is the perfect word i agreed after swallowing perfectly yummy again the grin that transformed her face engulfing her cheeks and swallowing her nose so that it looked as if her eyes themselves were smiling she took another long sip then another i followed her lead and before long it was time to refill our glasses this time i filled them almost halfway so what brought you from chicago to delray i asked i was looking for a change she might have stopped had it not been for the obvious questions on my face i dont know exactly she stared absently at the rows of ladies head vases on the shelves i guess i didnt particularly feel like going through another chicago winter and i had this friend whod moved to delray a few years back i thought i could come down here and look her up did you did i what look her up alison looked confused as if unsure exactly what her answer should be thats the problem with lying a good liar is always one step ahead shes always anticipating answering one question with an ear to the next shes on constant alert always ready with a facile reply of course all a bad liar needs is an easy mark i tried finding her alison said after a pause that lasted perhaps a beat too long thats what i was doing at the hospital when i saw your notice the words flowed easier now shed written that she was working at this private hospital called mission care in delray so i figured id surprise her maybe take her to lunch see if she was looking for a roommate but personnel said she left a long time ago alison shrugged beautifully carved shoulders lifted up then down luckily i saw your notice whats your friends name if shes a nurse maybe i can find out where she went shes not a nurse alison said quickly she was a secretary or something whats her name i repeated i can ask around when i get to work tomorrow see if anyone knows where she went dont bother alison ran a distracted finger along the rim of her wineglass the glass made a slight purring sound as if responding to a lovers gentle caress we werent that close and yet you left your home and traveled halfway across the country alison shrugged her name is rita bishop you know her doesnt sound familiar she took a deep breath her shoulders relaxed i never liked the name rita do you like it its not one of my favorites i admitted allowing myself to be steered gently offcourse what are your favorites i dont think i ever really thought about it i like kelly alison said and samantha i think if i ever have a daughter ill name her one of those and joseph if i have a boy or maybe max you have it all planned out she stared thoughtfully into her goblet for several long seconds before taking another sip do you have any children the question echoed against the side of the glass barely escaped into the surrounding air no im afraid i never married you dont have to get married to have babies maybe not today i agreed but when i was growing up in baltimore trust me it wasnt done i opened the oven door felt a warm rush of fragrant steam in my face anyway i hope youre hungry because this chicken is ready to be devoured lets eat alison said with a wide smile alison was right she was the fastest eater id ever seen within minutes everything on her plate roast chicken mashed potatoes pureed carrots multiple stalks of asparagus had disappeared id barely swallowed my first forkful of chicken and she was already helping herself to seconds this is so delicious you are the best cook ever she pronounced her mouth full im glad you like everything too bad i didnt bring another bottle of wine alison gave one of her rare frowns glancing past the tapered white candles in the middle of the dining room table toward the now empty bottle of amarone good thing you didnt my shift starts at six in the morning im supposed to be able to stand up straight what made you decide to be a nurse alison finished off what little wine clung to the sides of her glass i lost my father and a favorite aunt to cancer before either reached fifty i explained trying not to see their ravaged faces in the bottom of my glass i felt so helpless and i didnt like that so i decided to go into medicine my mother didnt have the money to send me to medical school and i didnt have the grades for a full scholarship so being a doctor was out i settled for the next best thing and i love it even though its exhausting exacting and infuriating alison laughed as she gently tossed my earlier words back at me even though i repeated and being a nurse meant i was able to care for my mother after her stroke that i was able to keep her at home that she died in her own bed not in some sterile hospital room is that why you never got married alison asked because you were busy taking care of your mother no i cant really blame her for that although i guess i can try i said with a laugh i think i just assumed there was all this time that eventually id meet someone fall in love get married have a couple of beautiful babies live happily ever after standard fantasy it just didnt work out that way there was never anyone special not special enough i guess well times not up yet you never know im forty i reminded her i know so what about you no special someone in chicago waiting for you to come home she shook her head no not really she volunteered nothing further how did your parents feel about you moving so far away alison stopped eating lay her fork neatly across her plate these dishes are really neat i like the pattern its pretty but it doesnt interfere with the food you know what i mean strangely enough i did your parents dont know where you are do they i asked tentatively not wanting to trespass beyond invisible boundaries but eager to know more ill call them after i find a job she said confirming my suspicions wont they be worried i doubt it she paused flipped her braid from one shoulder to the other as youve probably figured out we werent on the best of terms she paused her eyes darting back and forth as if reading from an invisible text unfortunately i had this older brother who was absolutely perfect star forward of the basketball team in high school champion swimmer in college graduated summa cum laude from brown and here i was this tall skinny kid who was constantly tripping over her big clumsy feet no way i could ever measure up so at some point i stopped trying i turned into this major brat insisted on doing my own thing positive i had all the answers you know the type typical teenager by the sound of it large green eyes radiated gratitude thank you but i dont think typical is the word they would use and what word would they use sad grin widened into a smile as her eyes scanned the ceiling for proper adjectives impossible she said after a brief pause incorrigible in trouble all the time she continued with a laugh the words running together as one they were always kicking me out of the house i left for good the day i turned eighteen and did what got married you got married when you were eighteen what can i say she shrugged standard fantasy i nodded understanding and reached for the bread basket accidentally knocking my fork into my lap where it deposited a large gob of gravy on my white pants before bouncing to the floor alison immediately rescued the fork and ran to the kitchen for some soda water while i scrambled to my feet instantly feeling the effect of so many glasses of wine slowly cautiously i walked into the living room trying to remember the last time a few glasses of wine had left me so inebriated i approached the window and leaned my forehead against the cool glass thats when i saw him he was standing across the street as still as the majestic royal palm he was leaning against and even though it was too dark to make out who it was i knew from his posture that he was staring at the house i squinted into the darkness tried to gather the light from the streetlamps into a spotlight and shine it on his face but the effect was something less than i bargained for and the man almost disappeared in the resultant blur not a good idea i muttered deciding to confront the man directly ask him what he was doing standing there in the dark staring at my house i stumbled toward the front door pulled it open you there i called out pointing an accusing finger at the night there was no one there i craned my neck peered into the stubborn darkness twisted my head from left to right followed the road to the corner and back i strained my ears for the sound of footsteps in hasty retreat heard nothing in the time it had taken for me to get from the window to the door the man had vanished if hed been there at all i thought recalling the apparition i thought id seen earlier what are you doing alison asked coming up behind me i felt her breath on the back of my neck just needed some fresh air are you okay a bit too okay did you put something in my drink i joked as alison closed the front door then led me back into the living room where she sat me down on one of the queen anne chairs and began dabbing at the gravy stain on my pant leg with a wet cloth until i felt the dampness clear to my skin i reached down stilled her hand it lingered on my thigh stains gone she was instantly on her feet sorry there i go again everything in extremes thats the only way i seem to operate sorry why are you apologizing i asked genuinely curious you didnt do anything wrong i didnt thats a relief she laughed sank down into the other chair her face flushed what happened with your marriage i asked gently fighting a gnawing unease in my gut a sensation that was undoubtedly trying to warn me that alison simms might not be the charmingly uncomplicated young woman shed first appeared to be when id handed over the keys to the cottage at the back of my house what usually happens when you get married at eighteen she said simply lowering her gaze to mine no trace of a smile it didnt work out im sorry me too we tried we really did we split up and got back together a whole bunch of times even after our divorce was final she impatiently pushed the stray hairs away from her forehead sometimes its hard to stay away from someone even when you know theyre all wrong for you and thats why you came to florida maybe she acknowledged then flashed the glorious smile that obliterated all traces of sadness or selfdoubt whats for dessert i was fifteen when i lost my virginity alison was saying pouring herself a second small glass of baileys irish cream we were sitting on the living room floor our backs against the furniture our legs splayed out carelessly in front of us like two abandoned rag dolls alison had insisted on cleaning up after dinner washing and drying the dishes by hand before returning everything to its proper place while i sat at the kitchen table and watched marveling at the deftness of her touch the speed with which she worked the instinctive way she seemed to know where everything belonged almost as if shed been in the house before shed found the baileys at the back of the dining room cabinet when she was returning the wineglasses to their shelf id forgotten i even had it i dont know why we chose the floor over the sofa probably alison simply plopped herself down and i followed suit the same way with the baileys id certainly had no intention of having any more to drink but suddenly the delicately sculpted liqueur glass was in my hand and alison was pouring and i was drinking and there you have it i suppose i could have said no but the truth is i was having too good a time you have to remember that my days were normally spent in the company of people who were old ill or in some form of acute distress alison was so young so vibrant so alive she infused me with a sense of such profound wellbeing that whatever niggling doubts or petty reservations i may have had flew out the window along with my common sense simply put i was reluctant to see her leave and if drinking a second glass of baileys would prolong the evening then a second glass of baileys it would be i eagerly proffered my glass for more she promptly filled it i probably shouldnt have told you that she said youll think im a slut it took me a minute to realize that she was referring to her lost virginity of course i dont think youre a slut i said adamantly as relief washed across alisons face like a paintbrush almost as if shed been waiting for me to exonerate her to forgive her the sins of her sometimes errant past besides ive got you beat i offered trying to make her feel better to prove i was hardly one to sit in judgment what do you mean she leaned forward lowered her glass to the carpet it disappeared inside the pink petal of a woven flower i was only fourteen when i lost mine i whispered guiltily as if my mother might still be listening from the upstairs bedroom get out i dont believe you its true i found myself eager to convince her to show her that she wasnt the only one with a past with skeletons in her closet however small and insubstantial they might be maybe i even wanted to shock her just a little to prove to her and to myself that i was more than i appeared at first glance that underneath my middleaged exterior beat the heart of a wild child or maybe i was just drunk his name was roger stillman i continued without prodding conjuring up the image of the lanky young man with light brown hair and large hazel eyes whod seduced me with ridiculous ease back when i was in the ninth grade he was two grades ahead of me at school so of course i was monstrously flattered that he even talked to me he asked me to the movies and i lied to my parents about where i was going because my mother had decreed i was too young to date so i said i was going to a friends house to study for a test and instead i met roger at the movie theater i remember it was one of the james bond movies dont ask me which one and i was very excited because id never seen a james bond movie before not that i saw much of that one either i recalled remembering rogers tobaccoscented breath on my neck as id tried to follow the movies convoluted plot his lips grazing the side of my ear as id strained to make sense of all the double entendres his hand sliding down my shoulder to the tops of my breasts as james coaxed yet another willing female into his bed we left before the movie finished roger had a car i shrugged as if that said it all whatever happened to roger he dumped me no surprises there alisons face registered her displeasure were you heartbroken devastated as only a fourteenyearold girl can be especially after he bragged about his conquest to the entire school he didnt i laughed at alisons spontaneous outburst of indignation he did roger im afraid was a rat of the first order and whatever happened to the rat i have no idea we moved to florida the next year and i never saw him again i shook my head watched the room spin god i havent thought about any of that in so long thats one of the amazing things about being young what is you think youll never get over something and then the next minute youve forgotten all about it alison smiled twisted her head across the top of her spine stretching her swanlike neck until the muscles groaned and released everything has such urgency everything is so important and you think you have so much time i said almost forgetting i was speaking out loud as i watched her mesmerized by the motion anyone interesting on the horizon alison rolled her head from side to side not really well theres this man i confided although id had no intention of doing so until i heard the words leave my mouth josh wylie his mother is a patient at the hospital alisons head returned to the middle of her shoulders she said nothing simply sat and waited for me to continue thats it i said he comes up once a week from miami to see her weve only spoken a few times but he seems very nice and and you wouldnt mind getting to know him alison said finishing my sentence for me i nodded deciding that was a mistake when the room continued bouncing around me like a rubber ball reluctantly i struggled to my feet i think im going to have to call it a night alison was immediately at my side her hand warm on my arm she seemed steady as if the alcohol hadnt affected her at all are you all right fine i said though i wasnt the floor kept shifting and i had to balance against the side of the sofa to keep from falling over i made an exaggerated show of checking my watch but the numbers danced randomly across the dial and i couldnt tell the small hand from the large its late i said anyway and i have to be up very early i hope i didnt overstay my welcome you didnt youre sure quite sure i had a really nice evening i suddenly had the strange sensation that she was about to kiss me goodnight well do it again soon i said lowering my head and leading alison through the living and dining rooms to the kitchen where i promptly walked into the table and all but fell into her arms youre sure youre okay she asked as i struggled to recapture my balance if not my dignity maybe i should stay and make sure you get into bed all right im fine really im fine i repeated before she could ask again alison was half out the door when she stopped suddenly reached into the left pocket of her black pants and spun around the motion left me reeling i just remembered i found this she held out her hand even with my head spinning and my focus blurred i recognized the tiny gold heart at the center of the slender golden thread in alisons open hand where did you get this i reached for it watching it unravel the delicate necklace hung from my fingers like a forgotten strand of tinsel on a discarded christmas tree i found it under my bed alison said unconsciously assuming ownership of the contents of the cottage why were you looking under the bed surprisingly alison blushed bright red she shuffled uneasily from one foot to the other the first time id seen her look truly uncomfortable in her own skin when she finally answered me i thought i must have misunderstood what did you say looking for bogeymen she repeated sheepishly lifting her eyes to mine with obvious reluctance bogeymen i know its ridiculous but i cant help myself ive been doing it ever since i was a little girl and my brother convinced me there was a monster hiding underneath my bed who was going to eat me as soon as i fell asleep you check underneath the bed for bogeymen i repeated thoroughly if inexplicably charmed by the notion i check the closets too just in case do you ever find anyone not so far she laughed held out the necklace for me to take here before i forget and take it home with me its not mine i took a step back almost tripping over my own feet and watching the room rotate ninety degrees sixtyfive ladies head vases tilted on their shelves it belonged to erica hollander my last tenant the one who still owes you several months rent the one and only then id say it belongs to you now again alison tried to hand over the necklace you keep it i wanted nothing more to do with erica hollander oh i couldnt alison said but her fist was already closing around it finders keepers come on take it its very you alison required no further coaxing it is isnt it she laughed wrapping the thin chain around her neck in one fluid gesture securing the tiny clasp with ease how does it look like it belongs there alison patted the heart at her throat strained to see her reflection in the darkness of the kitchen window i love it wear it in good health you dont think shell come back for it do you it was my turn to laugh just let her try anyway its late i have to get some sleep good night alison leaned forward kissed my cheek her hair smelled of strawberries her skin of baby powder like a newborn baby i thought with a smile thanks again she said for everything my pleasure i opened the back door and took a quick glance around there was no one waiting no one watching i breathed a sigh of relief and waited until alison was safely inside the cottage before closing the kitchen door my hand brushed against the spot on my cheek where alisons lips had grazed as i pictured her walking through the small living area to the bedroom at the back in my minds eye i watched her kneel to look under the bed then check the closet for any stray monsters who might be lurking i thought absently of the man id seen standing in front of the house had there been anyone there and had he been watching me or alison such a sweet girl i remember thinking so childlike so innocent not so innocent i reminded myself as i painstakingly made my way up the stairs to my bedroom a teenage hellion married at eighteen divorced soon after not to mention she could hold her liquor with the best of them i vaguely remember getting undressed and into my nightgown actually i remember this only because i put the nightgown on backward the first time and had to take it off and put it on again i dont remember washing my face or brushing my teeth although im sure i did i do remember the way my bare toes sank into the ivory broadloom as i walked toward my bed as if i were wading through thick clumps of mud i remember the heaviness in my thighs as if my legs had been anchored to the floor the queensize bed that sat in the middle of the room seemed miles away it took forever to reach it a colossal effort was required for my arms to pull down the bulky white comforter i remember watching it billow around me like a collapsing parachute as i climbed underneath the covers i remember the pillow reaching up to catch my head before it fell i expected to fall asleep immediately thats the way it always is in the movies people drink too much they get dizzy and disoriented they pass out sometimes they get sick first but i didnt get sick and i didnt pass out i just lay there my head spinning in the darkness knowing i had to get up in a matter of hours desperate for a sleep that stubbornly refused to come i flipped from my left side to my right tried lying on my back and even my stomach before i gave up and returned to my original position i brought my knees to my chest threw one leg atop the other twisted my body into shapes that would have made a contortionist proud nothing worked i thought of taking a sleeping pill and was almost half out of bed before i remembered it was a mistake to mix pills and alcohol in any event it was too late for sedatives by the time they took effect my alarm clock would be shaking me awake and id spend most of the next day in a dreary fog like the worst kind of rainy day i thought of reading but id been struggling with the book on my night table for weeks and still hadnt made it past the fourth chapter besides my brain was as tired as my eyes and trying to digest anything at this hour would be an exercise in frustration and futility no i decided i had no choice but to lie there in bed and wait patiently for sleep to come it didnt half an hour later i was still waiting i took several long deep breaths and improvised a half dozen yoga exercises id seen illustrated in a magazine although i had no idea if i was doing them correctly the hospital offered yoga classes but id never quite gotten around to signing up just as id never quite gotten around to trying pilates or transcendental meditation or sending away for the abdoer i saw regularly advertised on tv i made a silent vow to do all those things first thing in the morning if only i could fall asleep right now no deal i thought of turning on the television across from my bed undoubtedly there was a rerun of law and order on somewhere but decided against it choosing to replay alisons visit instead what on earth had possessed me to tell her the things i had information id never shared with anyone before roger stillman for gods sake where had that come from i hadnt even thought of him since id left baltimore and what had she really told me that shed lost her virginity at fifteen what else not much i realized alison may have opened memorys floodgates but shed remained resolutely outside them no i was the one whod rushed eagerly inside throwing caution and good sense to the wind that was one of the more interesting things about alison i decided as a low buzz settled behind my ears she only seemed to be confiding in you what she was really doing was getting you to confide in her thats what i was thinking when i finally fell asleep i dont remember drifting off i do remember dreaming nothing substantial or particularly meaningful silly little vignettes roger stillman imitating james bond in the backseat of his car josh wylies mother smiling at me from her hospital bed asking me to put the bouquet of yellow and orange roses her son had brought with him from miami into a vase my mother warning me i hadnt set my alarm clock it was this realization that i hadnt in fact remembered to set my alarm that woke me up at two minutes past four in the morning sent me stretching toward the night table at the side of my bed my hands reached out in the semidarkness my eyes opening only with the greatest reluctance as my fingers searched for the clock radio it was at that moment that i saw the tall figure at the foot of my bed at first i thought it must be some sort of apparition a trick my winesaturated brain was playing on my senses perhaps a dream that had failed to disperse upon waking a haunting mixture of moonlight and shadows it was only when the figure moved that i understood it was real and i screamed the scream sliced through the darkness like a blade through flesh scraping at the surrounding air leaving it tattered and bleeding that this insane inhuman sound could emanate from my body scared me almost as much as the figure moving slowly toward me and i screamed again im so sorry a voice was whimpering im so sorry im not sure exactly when i realized the stranger in my room was alison whether it was the sound of her voice or the glint of the small gold heart at her throat she was holding her head as if shed been struck and swaying from side to side as if she were a tree being buffeted by the wind im so sorry she kept repeating im so sorry what are you doing here i finally managed to get out swallowing another scream that was rising in my throat and stretching toward the lamp at the side of my bed no she cried please dont turn it on i froze not sure what to do next what are you doing here im so sorry i didnt mean to wake you up what are you doing here i repeated over the loud pounding of my heart my head she started pulling at her hair as if trying to pull it out by the roots im having a migraine i climbed out of bed took several tentative steps toward her a migraine i guess all that red wine must have triggered something she stopped as if unable to continue i reached her side put my arm around her lowered her to the side of my bed she was wearing a long white cotton nightgown not unlike my own and her hair hung loose and free around a face wet with tears how did you get in the house i asked the door wasnt locked thats impossible i always lock it although id been pretty woozy i reminded myself it was possible id forgotten to lock the door just as id forgotten to set the alarm clock it was open i knocked first you didnt answer thats when i tried the door i was hoping i could find something in your medicine cabinet without waking you up im so sorry i glanced toward the bathroom the strongest thing i have is extrastrength tylenol alison nodded as if to say anything was better than nothing i left her sitting on the edge of my bed while i ran into the bathroom and ferreted through the mostly useless items on the shelves of the medicine cabinet until i found the small bottle of pills i shook four into the palm of my hand filled a glass full of water and returned with them to my bedroom take these i instructed ill try to get you something stronger in the morning ill be dead by morning she said and tried to laugh but the laugh detoured into a moan as she swallowed the pills and buried her head against my shoulder trying to block out what little light there was in the room thatll teach both of us i heard myself say in my mothers voice as i stroked her arm rocked her gently back and forth like a baby youll sleep here tonight alison offered no resistance as i led her around the side of the bed pulled the covers around her what about you she asked her eyes closed the question an obvious afterthought ill sleep in the other room i said but already alison had pulled the comforter up over her head and the only signs i had that she was there were a few strands of strawberryblond hair that curled over the top of my pillow like a question mark alison was still sleeping when i left the house the next morning i thought of waking her up ushering her back to her own bed but she looked so peaceful lying there so vulnerable her soft blush of strawberry blond hair in marked contrast to her skins still ghostly pallor that i hated to disturb her my experience with migraine sufferers was that like most drunks they needed twentyfour hours to sleep it off i did the math decided there was a good chance alison would still be sleeping when i arrived back home at four oclock that afternoon what was the point in waking her looking back this was undoubtedly a mistake although not my first mistake where alison was concerned and certainly not my last no it was only one of many errors in judgment i made about the girl who called herself alison simms but hindsight is easy of course it was stupid to allow a virtual stranger to stay unattended in my house of course i was asking for trouble all i can say in my defense is that it didnt feel that way at the time at barely am with maybe a total of four hours of sleep leaving alison alone in the house that morning felt natural and right what was there to worry about after all that shed abscond with my ancient nineteeninch tv that shed commandeer a wheelbarrow to cart away my mothers collection of china head vases perhaps hold a garage sale on my front lawn that id come back to find the house and cottage burned to the ground maybe i should have been more careful more circumspect less trusting but i wasnt besides what is it they say about letting sleeping dogs lie anyway i left alison sleeping in my bed like goldilocks i remember thinking chuckling as i tiptoed down the stairs in my clunky white nurses shoes opening and closing the front door as silently as possible my car a fiveyearold black nissan was parked in the driveway beside the house i cast a desultory glance down the empty street hearing the faint hum of traffic several blocks away the city was waking up i thought wishing i could trade my polyester white uniform for my white cotton nightgown and crawl back into bed luckily i wasnt as tired as id feared i might be in fact i was feeling surprisingly well i backed the car onto the street opening the windows to let in the cool morning air november is a lovely time of year in south florida the temperature usually stays on the comfortable side of eighty the oppressive humidity of the summer months is pretty much gone the threat of extreme weather is over instead the sky provides a continually shifting combination of sun and clouds along with the occasional burst of welcome rain and we get more than our fair share of absolutely flawless afternoons days when the sun sits high in a borderless panorama of shiny kodacolor blue today looked as if it might be that kind of day maybe when i got home id see if alison was feeling well enough to go for a walk on the beach theres nothing like the ocean to heal the spirit and calm the troubled soul maybe it could work its magic on a migraine headache i thought glancing up at my bedroom window for a minute i thought i saw the curtains move and i hit the brake inched my face closer to the glass of the cars front window but on closer inspection it appeared id been mistaken that it was only the outside shadows of nearby trees that were dancing against my bedroom window creating the illusion of movement from inside the house i sat watching the window for several seconds listening to the whispering of the palm fronds in the breeze the curtains at my bedroom window hung undisturbed my foot transferred from brake to gas pedal and i proceeded slowly for several blocks along seventh avenue until i reached atlantic where i turned left the normally congested main thoroughfare of delray is largely empty at this hour of the morning one of the few perks of having to be at work so early and i had an unencumbered view of the many smart shops galleries and restaurants that had redefined the city in recent years to the surprise of many myself included delray had become something of a hot spot a destination as opposed to a drivethrough i loved the unexpected changes the aura of excitement even if i was rarely part of it alison i knew instinctively would love it here i passed the tennis center on the north side of atlantic where every spring they hold the citrix open past the old school square on the northwest corner of atlantic and swinton continued on past the south county courthouse and the delray beach fire station on my left i took the underpass at i to jog road then headed south five minutes later i was at the hospital mission care is a small private health facility housed in a fivestory building painted bubum pink that specializes in chronic care the majority of patients are elderly and in considerable distress and as a result theyre often angry and upset who can blame them they know they arent going to get better that theyre never going home that this is in fact their final resting place some have been here for years lying in their narrow beds blank eyes staring at blank ceilings waiting for the nurse to bathe them or adjust their position longing for visitors who rarely come silently praying for death while stubbornly clinging to life it must be so depressing people are always saying to me to be constantly surrounded by the sick and the dying and sometimes i admit it is its never easy to watch people suffer to comfort a young woman stricken by ms in the prime of her life to tend to a comatose child who will never wake up to try calming an old man with alzheimers as he shouts obscenities at the son he no longer remembers and yet some moments make it all worthwhile moments when the most banal act of kindness is rewarded by a smile so blinding it brings tears to your eyes or by a whispered thankyou so sincere it makes you go weak at the knees this is why i became a nurse i understand in moments like these and if that makes me a hopeless romantic or a silly sentimentalist so be it probably it is this quality that makes me such an easy target i suffer from anne franks delusion that people are basically good at heart i parked my car in the staff parking lot at the front of the hospital and made my way through the lobby past the gift shop and pharmacy that wouldnt be open for another few hours to the coffee shop that was already busy i waited in line for a cup of tasteless black coffee and a fatfree cranberrystudded muffin i thought of alison how much she loved cranberries i had a recipe at the back of one of my drawers for bananacranberry muffins i decided to make a batch when i got home the administration offices were closed till nine and i made a mental note to stop by later to inquire about alisons friend rita bishop even though alison had told me not to bother i thought it might be worth a try rita might have left a forwarding address one of the secretaries might know where shed gone id already finished my coffee and was halfway through my muffin when the doors of the excruciatingly slowmoving elevator finally opened onto the fourth floor the nurses station was already buzzing whats up i asked margot king a heavyset woman with copperorange hair and blue contact lenses margot had been a nurse at mission care for more than ten years and during that decade the color of her eyes had changed almost as often as the color of her hair the only constant was the color of her uniform which was a crisp alpine white and the color of her skin which was a wondrous ebony black rape victim margot said her voice a whisper a rape victim whyd they bring her here the rape was three months ago guy beat her with a baseball bat left her for dead shes been in a coma ever since doesnt look like shes going home anytime soon her family decided to bring her here when delray medical center needed the bed how old i asked bracing myself nineteen i sighed my shoulders collapsing as if someone had jumped on them from a great height any more pleasant surprises same old same old mrs wylies been asking for you already since five oclock wheres my terry wheres my terry margot repeated in myra wylies frail voice ill look in on her i started down the hall stopped is caroline here yet not till eleven she gets migraines doesnt she oh yeah she suffers real bad from those damn things when she gets in will you tell her i need to see her problems a friend i said continuing down the peach colored hall toward myra wylies room i slowly pushed open the door and peeked my head through in case the frail eightyseven yearold woman fighting both chronic leukemia and congenital heart disease might have drifted back to sleep terry myra wylies voice wafted up from the center of her hospital bed quivering into the air like smoke from a cigarette theres my terry i approached the bed patted the bony hand beneath the sterile white sheets smiled at the graying face with the watery blue eyes how are you today myra wonderful she said the same thing she said every time i asked and i laughed she laughed too although the sound was weak and segued quickly into a cough still in those few seconds i saw traces of the beautiful vibrant woman myra wylie had been before her body began its slow insidious betrayal i could also make out the face of her son josh in the sculpted lines of her cheekbones the soft bow of her lips josh wylie would be a very handsome old man i couldnt help but think as i pulled up a chair and sat down beside his mother i understand youve been asking for me i was thinking maybe we could do something different with my hair next time we wash it i smoothed the fine gray hair away from her face with my fingers what style do you think youd like i dont know something more with it with it maybe a bob a bob i fluffed out the fragile wisps of hair that framed myras face her skin was sinking the heavy lines around her eyes and mouth becoming folds caving in around her slowly the living tissue was morphing into a death mask how much longer did she have a bob i repeated sure why not myra smiled that cute little nurse with all the freckles was in last night the young one whats her name sally yes sally she brought me my medicine and we got to talking and she asked me how old i was you should have seen the look on her face when i told her im seventyseven i searched myras eyes for signs she was teasing saw none myra i told her gently youre not seventyseven im not youre eightyseven eightyseven there was a long pause as myras trembling hand reached for her heart thats a shock i laughed stroked her shoulder are you sure thats what it says on your chart but we can check with your son next time he visits i think thats a good idea myras eyes fluttered to a close her voice growing faint because i think there has to be some mistake well ask josh on friday i eased out of my chair and walked to the door when i turned back to check on her she was sound asleep the rest of the morning was uneventful i tended to patients fed them their breakfast and lunch changed soiled sheets helped those who could still walk to the bathroom i looked in on sheena oconnor the nineteenyearold rape victim whod been transferred from delray medical center filling the room with idle chatter as i surveyed the scars and bruises that made a mockery of her once innocent face but if she heard me she gave no sign normally i eat lunch in the hospital cafeteria the food is surprisingly good and you cant beat the price but today i was anxious to check on alison i thought of phoning but i didnt want to wake her in case she was still sleeping and besides i didnt think shed answer my phone so armed with two imitrex tablets id bought from caroline id give them to you but theyre so damned expensive and the names of several doctors in the area i thought alison should contact i used my lunch hour to drive home and see how she was doing pulling into my driveway i saw a young man with a baseball cap pulled low on his forehead lurking behind a corner tree in almost the same spot where id seen the man yesterday but by the time i parked my car and came back to look he was gone i looked down the street in time to see him disappear around the corner and thought momentarily of going after him luckily i was distracted by the sound of barking dogs and i turned back toward my house bettye mccoy was standing beside a neighbors prized rosebush pretending not to notice that one of her dogs was peeing all over it i thought of asking her if shed noticed any suspicious strangers in the area but decided against it bettye mccoy had barely acknowledged my existence ever since id chased one of her precious bichons out of my yard with a broomstick i slipped my shoes off at the front door silently cursing the slight creaking noise the door made as i closed it determining to oil it when i got home at the end of my shift the house was eerily quiet except for the gentle hum of the air conditioner a quick look around told me everything was in its correct place nothing had been disturbed i tiptoed up the stairs to my bedroom coughed quietly so as not to scare alison if she was awake then opened the door the curtains were still pulled so it took me a few seconds to determine that the room was empty and the bed neatly made goldilocks was no longer sleeping in my bed alison i called out checking the bathroom and the second bedroom before heading back downstairs alison she was gone alison i called out again at the door to her cottage knocking gently no one answered i tried peering in the windows but i saw nothing nor could i hear anyone moving around inside was it possible alison had felt well enough to go out or was she lying on her bathroom floor her head pressed against the cold tiles for relief too sick and weak to respond to my knock despite common sense telling me i was overreacting i returned to the front door and knocked more forcefully alison i called loudly alison its terry are you all right i waited only thirty more seconds before letting myself in alison i called again once inside i knew the cottage was empty the minute i crossed the threshold but still i persisted repeatedly calling out alisons name as i inched toward the bedroom the clothes shed worn last night lay in a careless diagonal across the bedroom floor discarded and abandoned where they fell the bed was unmade and redolent with her scent a potent mix of strawberries and baby powder still clinging to the rumpled sheets and crumpled pillows but alison herself was nowhere to be seen im embarrassed to say i actually checked underneath the bed did i think the dreaded bogeyman had surfaced snatched alison while she lay sleeping i dont know what i thought nor do i know what possessed me to check the small walkin closet did i think she was hiding inside truth to tell i dont know what i was thinking probably i wasnt thinking at all alison had little in the way of clothes a few dresses including the blue sundress shed worn at our first meeting several pairs of jeans a white blouse a black leather jacket perhaps half a dozen tshirts were stacked in one corner of the long builtin shelf some lacy underwear crammed into the other wellworn blackandwhite sneakers sat beside a pair of obviously new silver slingback heels i lifted one shoe into my hand wondering how anyone managed to walk in those damn things i hadnt worn a heel that high in well id never worn a heel that high i realized glancing toward my stockinged feet reaching down before i was even aware of what i was doing and slipping on first one shoe then the other it was at that moment standing there in alisons sexy shoes that i heard movement in the next room and felt the vibration of footsteps as they drew near i froze not sure what to do it was one thing to tell alison that id been so concerned about her health id felt entitled to invade her privacy but how was i going to explain being discovered in her closet teetering precariously in her new silver slingback highheeled shoes for one insane second i actually thought of clicking those heels together and reciting theres no place like home theres no place like home in hopes that like dorothy in the wizard of oz i would be transported miraculously back to my own living room or kansas for that matter anywhere but here i thought feeling alisons presence in the doorway im so sorry i said waiting for her to appear please forgive me except no one was there there was only me and my overactive imagination not to mention my guilt for being where i didnt belong i stood in the closet wobbling in those outrageous three inch heels waiting for my heartbeat to return to normal some criminal id make i thought kicking off the shoes and returning them to their place beside the tiredlooking sneakers at that point i should have gotten the hell out of there alison was obviously feeling better there was no need to be concerned certainly no reason for me to be standing in the middle of what was now after all her place and i was on my way out i really was when i saw it her journal it was lying open on the top of the white wicker dresser as if waiting to be read almost as if alison had left it that way deliberately as if shed been expecting me to drop by i tried not to notice it tried to walk by it without stopping to look without stooping to look i should probably say but the damn thing drew me like a magnet almost against my will i found my eyes dipping through the dramatic swirls and loops of alisons elaborate scrawl as if on some wild visual rollercoaster ride sunday november well i did it im actually here i stopped slammed the journal shut then realized it had been open when i found it and quickly rifled through the pages looking for the last entry thursday october lance says im crazy he says to remember what happened last time friday october im getting nervous maybe this isnt such a good idea after all sunday october lance keeps warning me against getting too attached maybe hes right maybe this whole plan is just too crazy back to the last entry without allowing my eyes to settle the words to sink in sunday november well i did it im actually here im living in the cottage behind her house and shes even invited me over for dinner she seems nice if not exactly what i was expecting what did that mean what had she been expecting wed spoken for less than a minute on the phone scarcely enough time to form any impressions at all lance says im crazy he says to remember what happened last time were these entries somehow related im doing it again i said out loud letting my imagination get the better of me the snatches id read in alisons journal could mean anything or nothing the discomfort i was feeling had more to do with my own guilt for snooping through alisons personal belongings than it did with her innocent scribblings i pulled away from the diary as if it were a hissing snake and i did nothing not then not later not even after i returned home at the end of my shift and stopped by to see how alison was doing and she told me that aside from a brief walk around the block shed spent pretty much the whole day in bed i left her with the imitrex a list of doctors in the area and some homemade chicken soup deciding to be pleasant but to keep my distance not allow myself to get too attached as the mysterious lance would undoubtedly advise and somehow i managed to convince myself that as long as alison paid her rent on time and followed my rules everything would be fine by friday i had all but forgotten the diary one of the other nurses was sick with a nasty flu so id volunteered to take her shift as well as my own on both wednesday and thursday and as a result i didnt see alison at all i did receive a lovely note from her thanking me for dinner and apologizing profusely for being such a nuisance she assured me she was feeling much better and suggested going to a movie on the weekend if i had any free time i didnt respond deciding to plead exhaustion if and when we actually connected if i turned down enough such overtures i reasoned alison would get the message and our relationship would revert to what it should have been in the first place landlord and tenant id been too hasty in allowing alison into my life what are you thinking about dear the voice beside me asked with marked concern hmm what sorry i said returning to the present casting unwanted memories aside returning my full attention to the withered old woman connected to life by a series of tubes that forcefed nutrients into her collapsing veins myra wylies eyes radiated quiet curiosity you were a million miles away sorry did i hurt you my hands dropped from the iv id been adjusting no dear you couldnt hurt me if you tried stop apologizing is everything all right everythings fine i secured the blanket at her toes youre doing remarkably well i meant with you is everything all right with you everythings fine i repeated as if trying to reassure myself as well you can talk to me you know if you have a problem i smiled gratefully i appreciate that i mean it i know you do you look like you have very deep thoughts myra wylie remarked and i laughed out loud dont laugh josh thinks so too i felt my pulse quicken your son thinks i have deep thoughts thats what he said last time he was here i felt almost ridiculously flattered like a teenage girl whos just found out the silly boy she has a crush on feels the same way about her i checked my watch noted the trembling in my fingers well its almost noon he should be here any minute he thinks youre very nice was i mistaken or was there a playful glint in myras watery eyes oh he does does he josh deserves someone nice myra was saying almost to herself hes divorced you know ive told you about that havent i i nodded eager for more details but careful to look only mildly curious she left him for her aerobics instructor can you imagine stupid woman myra wylies frail shoulders stiffened with righteous indignation destroys the family breaks my sons heart and for what so she can march off into the sunset with some musclebound bodybuilder ten years her junior who dumps her less than six months later what did she expect and of course now she sees the error of her ways now she wants him back but josh is too smart for that thank god hell never let that woman back into his life myras voice began breaking up like a bad radio signal then dissolved into a worrisome combination of coughs and wheezes take deep breaths i cautioned watching myras breathing gradually return to normal thats better you shouldnt let yourself get so upset its not worth it its all over now theyre divorced he will never let that woman back into his life never i repeated he deserves someone nice absolutely someone like you myra said then you like children dont you i love children i followed her eyes to the two silverframed pictures of her smiling grandchildren that sat on the movable nightstand beside her bed of course theyre older now than when these pictures were taken jillian is fifteen and trevor is almost twelve i know weve met i reminded her theyre lovely children they went through hell after jan left im sure it wasnt easy its never easy to lose your mother i remember thinking no matter how old you are no matter what the circumstances a mother is a mother is a mother i thought and almost laughed so much for the depth of my thoughts i should get going is there anything i can do for you before your son gets here comb my hair a little if you dont mind it will be my pleasure i ran a gentle comb across myras scalp watching the delicate strands of gray hair immediately fall back into place as if untouched you were right about the bob its very becoming you think so a smile eager as a childs spread across her face now all the nurses are asking me to cut their hair they say i missed my calling i dont think you miss a thing myra reached out to squeeze my hand ill be back to say hello to your son i said with a wink terry she called as i was about to leave the room i swiveled around as she brought her fingers to her lips maybe a little lipstick i started back toward the bed no not me she said quickly y i laughed shaking my head as i returned to the door i was still laughing as i stepped into the hall and saw alison standing in front of the nurses station terry alison rushed forward to greet me arms extended face flushed with pride she was wearing her blue sundress and her hair fell in lush tendrils around her shoulders erica hollanders necklace hung around her neck the tiny gold heart resting at her collarbone as if it had been there all her life alison what are you doing here i looked toward margot and caroline both of whom were busy behind the long curving desk of the nurses station margot on the phone caroline entering notes in a patients chart they glanced in our direction pretending not to be paying attention i did it i did it alison was jumping up and down like a small child i brought my finger to my lips in a silent signal for her to settle down and lower her voice did what i got a job she squealed unable to contain herself at the lorelli gallery on atlantic avenue four days a week some saturdays some evenings shift work she said beaming like you thats great i heard myself say her enthusiasm catchy despite my effort to remain detached what exactly will you be doing selling mostly of course i dont know much about art but fern said shed teach me everything i need to know ferns my boss fern lorelli she seems very nice do you know her i started to shake my head but alison had already moved on i told her i didnt know much about art because i figured i should be honest right i didnt want her to give me the job under false pretenses i mean shed find out soon enough anyway right but she said not to worry shed handle the art that i should stick mostly to the jewelry and gift items they sell although if i do manage to sell one of the paintings id get a commission five percent isnt that great its great i agreed some of those paintings sell for thousands of dollars so thatd be fantastic if i sold one of them but mostly ill be behind the cash register me and this other girl who works there denise nickson i think her name is shes ferns niece and what else oh i get twelve dollars an hour and i start on monday isnt that great its great i said again i couldnt wait to tell you so i came right over congratulations can i take you to lunch lunch to celebrate my treat i shifted uneasily from one foot to the other technically i was on my lunch break right now and my stomach had been making hungry noises for the past hour i cant things are so busy here today dinner then i cant im working a double shift tomorrow night she persisted thats even better its a saturday so you can sleep in the next morning youre not busy tomorrow night are you no i said realizing that alison wouldnt settle for less than a definite date even if she had to go through every day from now till christmas but really it isnt necessary for you to take me out of course it is alison insisted besides i want to to thank you for all youve done for me i havent done anything are you kidding you gave me the best place in the whole wide world to live you cooked me dinner you made me feel welcome you even took care of me when i got sick i owe you big time terry painter you dont owe me anything but the rent i said struggling to keep my distance feeling myself sway reluctantly back into her orbit falling under her spell you gave me the best place in the whole wide world to live who says things like that how could you not be charmed besides what was i so worried about what could i possibly have to fear especially from someone like alison even assuming the worst that she was some sort of clever con artist what could she possibly be after i had little in the way of material goods my small house its tiny adjacent cottage negligible savings my mothers silly collection of ladies head vases so what small potatoes all of it this was florida for heavens sake forty minutes north were the oceanside mansions of palm beach and hobe sound forty minutes south were the palatial homes of miamis infamous south beach florida was synonymous with money with wealthy old men just waiting to be taken advantage of by beautiful young girls hell its what was keeping them alive it didnt make sense that alison would waste her time with me i realize now that there are times when our brains will simply not allow us to accept the evidence our own eyes present that the desire for selfdelusion outweighs the instinct for selfpreservation that no matter how old we are or how wise we think weve become we are never really convinced of our own mortality besides since when do things have to make sense so are we on alisons big loopy grin widened with expectation were on i heard myself reply great she spun around in a full circle the skirt of her sundress swirling around her knees anywhere in particular youd like to go i shook my head surprise me she rubbed the gold heart at her throat i love surprises as if on cue the fire alarm sounded it turned out to be a false alarm but in the few minutes it took to make sure everything was okay chaos reigned when i returned to the nurses station after reassuring several panicky patients that the hospital was not about to become a blazing inferno alison was gone everybody okay margot asked mr austin said fire or no fire he wasnt going anywhere without his teeth i laughed picturing the feisty old man in room pretty girl you were talking to earlier margot remarked my new tenant really well i hope you have better luck this time around the next hour passed in relative calm there were no more fire alarms no unexpected visitors after a brief lunch in the cafeteria i kept busy checking pulses delivering pain medication helping patients to and from the bathroom comforting them as they railed against their fate at some point i found myself at the door to sheena oconnors room i hesitated briefly then pushed the door open and stepped inside the teenager lay in the middle of her bed staring at the ceiling with eyes wide with terror was she seeing the man whod raped and beaten her senseless then left her for dead i approached the bed reached out and touched her hand but if she felt my touch at all she gave no sign its okay i whispered youre safe now i pulled up a chair sat down beside her the words to an old irish lullaby suddenly dancing inside my head it took a few seconds for me to find the tune and next thing i knew i was singing softly gently as one sings to a newborn baby tooralooraloora tooralooralie i dont know what made me think of that particular song i couldnt remember my mother ever singing it to me maybe it was the name oconnor maybe i thought sheenas mother might have sung it to her that the song might stir something deep in the girls subconscious remind her of a time when she felt secure and protected a time when no harm could befall her tooralooraloora i sang my voice gaining strength with each repetition of the simple sounds tooralooralie sheena remained motionless tooralooraloora thats an irish lullaby and its a very lovely one a mans voice said from the doorway i recognized the voice without having to turn around i swallowed the sounds in my throat and willed my face not to betray me as i turned toward the doorway josh wylie tall and almost carelessly handsome with saltandpepper hair and his mothers blue eyes stood watching me how long have you been standing there long enough to realize you have a beautiful voice i gripped the railing at sheenas bedside to steady myself as i rose to my feet thank you i walked across the room my heart wobbling although my feet were surprisingly steady josh wylie backed into the hallway as i approached and i shut the door to sheenas room behind me whats the matter with her josh asked as we started down the corridor i related the gruesome details of the assault shes in a coma her eyes are open but she doesnt see anything will she be that way forever nobody knows what a shame josh shook his head sadly so hows my mother doing he smiled a warm upturn of his lips that underlined the sparkle in his eyes i understand you cut her hair just a few snips here and there she seems to like it shes crazy about it shes crazy about you josh emphasized thinks youre the greatest thing since sliced bread the feelings mutual thinks i should take you out to lunch the next time i visit what lunch next friday if youre free if youre hungry im always hungry i said grateful when he laughed lunch next friday sounds great i thought of alison two surprising invitations in one day okay then next friday it is we reached the nurses station till then i leave my mother in your capable and creative hands drive carefully i called as josh stepped inside the waiting elevator and no uniform this isnt a business lunch he waved as the elevator door drew slowly closed this isnt a business lunch i repeated silently mentally raiding my closet trying to decide what to wear wondering whether to splurge on a new outfit it was only then that i became aware of a slight commotion behind me problems i asked spinning around on my heels seeing margot and caroline making exaggerated sweeps of the desk with their hands and eyes carolines wallet is missing from her purse margot said i came around to the inside of the nurses station began my own head sweep youre sure its not in a pocket somewhere ive looked everywhere caroline moaned brushing chinlength brown hair away from her long face emptying the contents of her purse onto the floor at the best of times caroline looked vaguely depressed now she looked positively distraught maybe you left it in another purse i did that once i offered gamely although id never done any such thing no i had it with me this morning i know because i bought a cup of coffee and a danish downstairs maybe you left it on the counter after you paid caroline shook her head im sure i put it back in my purse she looked up and down the corridor tears filling her dejected brown eyes damn it i had over a hundred dollars in there i thought of alison shed been here when the fire alarm had sounded and the nursing station had been left temporarily unattended and shed been gone by the time everything had settled down was it possible shed helped herself to carolines wallet why would i think that surely it was much more logical to assume that caroline had left her wallet in the cafeteria i think you should call downstairs i advised opening and closing drawers checking each small compartment behind the desk then peeking into my own purse to make sure nothing was missing ill call the cafeteria caroline agreed grudgingly but i know its not there somebody took it somebody took it saturday night the phone rang just as i was stepping out of the shower i wrapped one large white towel around my body threw another one across my shoulders and padded across my bedroom floor toward the phone wondering if alison was calling to cancel our dinner i lifted the phone to my ear and pushed my wet hair away from my cheek hello id like to speak to erica hollander the male voice announced without further preamble it took half a second for the name to register on my brain erica hollander is no longer my tenant i said coolly my eyes following several wayward trickles of water as they ran down my legs to the ivory carpet anxiety simultaneously trickled through my insides do you know where i can reach her the voice carried traces of a soft southern twang i didnt think id heard it before im afraid i have no idea where she is when did she leave i thought back to the last time id seen erica it was the end of august she didnt leave a forwarding address she didnt leave a thing and that includes the two months rent she owed me whos calling the answer to my question was a resounding click in my ear i dropped the receiver into its carriage then plopped down on my bed taking a series of long deep breaths trying to push unpleasant memories of erica hollander out of my head but she was as stubborn in her absence as shed been in her presence and she refused to be so easily dismissed erica hollander was young like alison and like alison willowy and tall though not quite as tall not quite as willowy her hair was a luxurious dark brown and hung straight to her shoulders and she was continually tossing it from side to side the way you see them do in those annoying television commercials that equate a good shampoo with a good orgasm but her face while pretty enough in a certain light hovered perilously close to plain only her nose a nose that was long and thin and veered suddenly to the left gave her any character at all it was her one distinguishing feature of course she hated it im saving up to have it done shed told me on more than one occasion your nose is beautiful id assured her ever the mother hen its awful im saving up to have it done id listened to her whine about her nose id listened to her brag about her boyfriend charlies so handsome charlies so smart who was spending a year working in tokyo id listened when she stopped bragging and started whining charlie didnt call this week charlie better watch his step and id reserved judgment when she got involved with some guy shed met at elwoods a wellknown biker hangout on atlantic avenue id even lent her money to buy a used portable computer all because i thought we were friends it never occurred to me that shed skip out in the middle of the night still owing me for the computer not to mention several months in back rent smart handsome charlie in tokyo couldnt accept that his girlfriend had dumped him as unceremoniously as shed dumped me and had plagued me with increasingly unpleasant phone calls from japan demanding to know her whereabouts hed even notified the police who basically corroborated my story but even that wasnt enough to satisfy him hed continued harassing me longdistance until id threatened to call his employer and then suddenly the phone calls stopped until tonight i shook my head amazed that though erica hollander had been gone for almost three months she was still causing me grief shed been my first tenant and id vowed after shed taken off my last what had happened to change my mind truth be told i missed having someone around i dont have a lot of friends there are my coworkers women like margot and caroline but we rarely socialize away from the hospital caroline has a demanding husband and margot has four kids to look after and ive always been a little reserved this shyness coupled with my tendency to throw myself into my work has made it hard for me to meet new people plus my mother was sick for so long before she died and between caring for my patients at the hospital and caring for her at home well there are only so many hours in a day besides something insidious happens to women in our society when they turn forty especially if theyre not married we get lost in a heavy freefloating haze it becomes difficult to see us people know were there its just that weve become a little fuzzy so blurred around the edges weve begun blending into the surrounding scenery its not that were invisible exactly people actually step around us to avoid confronting us but the truth is we are no longer seen and if you arent seen you arent heard thats what happens to women over forty we lose our voice maybe thats why we seem so angry maybe its not hormones after all maybe we just want someone to pay attention anyway i started thinking about how nice it had been when erica hollander had first moved in how much fun it had been having someone around even if we didnt see each other all that much i dont know somehow just the fact that someone was sharing my space had made me feel less alone so i decided to try it again what is it they say about second marriages that theyre a triumph of hope over experience at any rate i was determined not to make the same mistakes the second time around thats why id decided against advertising for a tenant in the newspaper choosing instead to post a number of discreet notices around the hospital i reasoned that this way i was more likely to attract someone older more responsible maybe a professional perhaps even a woman like myself instead i got alison the phone rang bringing me back to the present i became aware of the air conditioner blowing against the back of my neck like a lovers cool breath i shuddered with the chill hi its me alison chirped as i lifted the receiver to my ear didnt you hear me knock the towel at my breast came loose and fell to the floor as i rose to my feet what no where are you at your kitchen door im on my cell is everything all right fine im just running a little late can i pick you up in ten minutes no problem securing my towel around me i walked to my bedroom window and watched from behind the white lace curtain as alison ambled back toward the cottage she was wearing a slinky navy dress i didnt remember seeing in her closet and her silver slingback shoes which she had no trouble walking in at all i watched as she tucked her cell phone inside the silver purse dangling from her shoulder only to withdraw it again almost immediately several loose bills escaping their cramped confines and wafting toward the ground alison immediately scooped up the money and stuffed it back inside her small silver bag i quickly recalled the handful of bills alison had given me for first and last months rent then found myself thinking about the that had gone missing from carolines purse was it possible alison had taken it thats ridiculous i said out loud watching alison punch a series of numbers into her cell phone alison had no need to steal money from strangers i watched her whisper something into the receiver then laugh suddenly she spun around almost as if shed known i was watching her i flattened myself against the wall and didnt move again until i heard the cottage door open and close fifteen minutes later i was at her door wearing a calflength pale yellow sleeveless dress with a pronounced decolletage that id bought a year ago but had never had the nerve to wear sorry i took so long i couldnt get my hair to sit right you look fabulous alison regarded me with the practiced eye of women who are used to looking in mirrors you just need a little trim she announced after a pause i could do it for you dont forget i worked for a few months in a hairdressing salon you were a receptionist i reminded her she laughed yeah but i watched and i learned and im really pretty good you want me to give it a try after dinner i thought of the improvised bob id given myra wylie earlier in the week was i as brave as she was where are you taking me its this new place right across from the lorelli gallery i already called them and said wed be a bit late the restaurant was called barringtons and like many restaurants in south florida it was much bigger on the inside than it appeared from the street the main room was decorated like a french bistro lots of tiffany lamps and leadedglass windows along with toulouse lautrec posters of dancers from the moulin rouge suspended from pale yellow walls that were an exact and unfortunate match with my dress were it not for my ample cleavage i might have vanished altogether the waiter brought over a basket of bread the wine list and two large menus before reciting by heart the list of the nights specials his eyes moved back and forth between alisons face and my chest together i remember thinking we could rule the world dolphin alison wailed in horror at one of the waiters suggestions not flipper i explained quickly this dolphins a fish not a mammal its sometimes called mahi mahi i like the sound of that much better hows the salmon i asked tasty the waiter said looking at alison but kind of boring he said looking at me what about the swordfish alison asked wonderful the waiter enthused they grill it in a light dijon mustard sauce and it comes with sauteed vegetables and little red potatoes sounds great ill have that ill have the salmon i offered risking the young mans scorn daring to be dull some wine alison motioned to me with her hand as if giving me the floor some wine she repeated i think ill skip the wine tonight you cant skip the wine this is a celebration we have to have wine remember what happened last time i cautioned she looked confused as if shed forgotten all about her recent migraine well have white wine not red she pronounced upon reflection that should be all right the waiter pointed out the choice of wines and alison followed his recommendation something from chile i believe it was good and it was cold and it quickly gave me a pleasant buzz service was slow and id already finished my glass by the time the food arrived alison poured me another and i didnt object although i noticed shed only taken a few sips of her own drink ooh this is yummy delicious she enthused biting into the swordfish hows yours yummy i laughed at the sound so did you see your friend this week alison asked suddenly my friend josh wylie alison stole a look around the crowded restaurant as if he might be there as if she might recognize him if he were the salmon stuck in my throat how do you know about josh wylie alison swallowed one forkful of swordfish then another you told me about him i did dinner at your house i asked if you were interested in anyone and you said there was this guy she lowered her voice her eyes doing another slow spin around the room josh wylie whose mother is one of your patients right she popped two small potatoes into her mouth speared another forkful of fish right so did you see him yes i did as a matter of fact hes taking me to lunch next friday alisons eyes widened with delight way to go terry i laughed its not a big deal i cautioned as much to myself as to alison he probably just wants to talk about his mother if he wanted to talk about his mother hed do it in the waiting room trust me hes interested i shrugged hoping she was right well see alison waved my hesitation aside youll have to tell me all about it she clapped her hands together as if congratulating me for a job well done then finished off the last of her swordfish in three quick swallows this is so exciting i cant wait till next friday i dont remember much else about the meal except that alison insisted on ordering dessert and that i ate more than i should have come on i remember her saying as she pushed the large piece of bananacream cake toward me you only live once after dinner alison was eager to show me the lorelli gallery she grabbed my hand and all but pulled me across the busy street i heard a car whiz by behind me felt its exhaust on my bare calves watch where youre going lady the driver yelled out be careful alison admonished as if id been crossing the street all by myself on weekends the gallery stayed open till ten oclock hoping to attract tourists and passersby i counted four people inside the welllit store including the spikehaired young woman behind the counter the walls were covered with colorful paintings mostly by artists i didnt recognize although there was a typical motherwell painting of a woman with large red lips and a prominent nipple and three paintings of pears were stacked one on top of the other by an artist whose name i could never remember no matter how many times i saw his work i found my attention drawn to a small rectangular painting of a woman her face hidden behind a large hat as she sunned herself on a pink sandy beach thats my favorite alison said then lowered her voice it would go great in your living room dont you think on the wall behind the sofa its beautiful alison pulled me toward the center of the room almost knocking over a sculpture of a large fiberglass frog whoops she giggled isnt that the most hideous thing youve ever seen i agreed it was fern says she cant keep the damn things in the store they sell so fast can you believe it denise hi she continued in the same breath this is terry painter my landlady my friend she added with a smile the girl behind the counter looked up from the fashion magazine she was perusing extraordinary violet eyes overwhelming the rest of her small face nice to meet you she said her voice surprisingly husky the words emerging slowly from between small but full lips as if she werent quite sure whether meeting me was nice or not she was dressed all in black which made her look thinner than she already was although her breasts were high and disproportionately large for her narrow frame i dont think theyre real alison would later say im wondering how much that painting is i said glancing toward the painting of the girl on the pink sandy beach her face hidden by her widebrimmed hat denise raised bored violet eyes to the far wall then she reached under the counter and pulled out a plasticcovered sheet of paper to scan the typed list that ones fifteen hundred dollars the wall behind the sofa in your living room alison said again what do you think i think you dont start work till monday i reminded her alisons face broke into a wide smile im gonna be great at this arent i i laughed directing my attention to the display of jewelry in the glass counter that occupied the middle of the store i found myself staring at a pair of long silver earrings in the shape of cupids arent those great alison knew exactly what pair i was looking at how much are these she poked at the glass above the earrings denise opened the back of the case lifted the earrings out held them toward me deep purple nails protruded over the ends of long tapered fingers two hundred dollars i backed away lifted my hands in the air too rich for my blood alison quickly scooped up the earrings nonsense shell take them no i countered two hundred dollars is way too much my treat what no yes alison gently removed the thin gold loops i was wearing and replaced them with the long silver cupids you gave me a heart she said patting the tiny gold heart at her throat now its my turn its hardly the same thing i wont take no for an answer besides i get an employee discount how much with my discount she asked denise the young woman shrugged take them theyre yours fernll never miss them what do you mean i asked immediately preparing to take them off shes just kidding alison said already returning several loose bills to her purse she quickly ushered me to the front of the store ferns her aunt she reminded me as if this should be explanation enough does she know her niece is a thief dont worry ill settle with fern on monday you promise alison smiled tucked my hair behind my ears to better admire my new earrings i promise dont you look lovely myra wylie lifted her head from the pillow gnarled fingers like turkey claws beckoning me toward her bed i ran selfconscious hands across the front of my yellow dress as i approached myra had asked to see what id be wearing for lunch with her son so id used her bathroom to change out of my nurses uniform and into my street clothes id decided on the same dress id worn to dinner with alison the previous week thank you dear myra lowered her head back to the pillow although her eyes remained on me it was very sweet of you to show me your dress i get a taste of what i missed by not having had a daughter that former daughterinlaw of mine was for the birds she was no fun at all but you me i prompted eager to hear more youre very good to me why wouldnt i be people arent always kind myra said her eyes on some distant memory you make it very easy i told her truthfully pulling up a chair and sitting down beside her stealing a glance at my watch it was almost twelvethirty dont worry myra said with a knowing smile he wont be late i leaned forward pretended to be tucking in the blue cotton sheet that served as a bedspread those are lovely myra said are they new her bony fingers were twisting toward the dangling cupids at my ears yes they are a friend gave them to me i wondered if alison had settled with her boss as shed promised a boyfriend worry clouded myras eyes like fresh cataracts no actually they were a gift from my new tenant again i pictured alison shed started work on monday and except for one quick call to say she was loving every minute of her new job i hadnt spoken to her all week besides im a little old for boyfriends dont you think were never too old for boyfriends whats this about boyfriends the male voice boomed from the doorway there he is myra said all girlish flutter how are you darling she held out her arms i stepped out of the way and watched josh fold inside them perfect he said looking right at me was the traffic bad it was miserable you should take the turnpike yes i should he straightened up and smiled at me we have this same discussion every week you should listen to your mother i told him yes i should doesnt terry look beautiful myra asked i looked to the floor to hide the blush i could feel spreading across my face not because i was embarrassed by the compliment but because id been thinking exactly the same thing about her son i dont think id realized before how deep were the dimples at his cheeks how pronounced the muscles that bulged beneath his shortsleeved shirt it was all i could do to keep from crossing my legs and screaming out loud i hadnt felt this way in years she looks very beautiful josh dutifully replied do you like her earrings josh lifted his fingers to my ear his hand grazing the side of my cheek i like them very much i felt a rush of heat as if hed struck a match held it against my flesh youre a troublemaker you know that i told myra who looked inordinately pleased with herself you ready josh asked i nodded i expect a full report after lunch myra called after us ill take notes i called back as josh ushered me into the hall how would you like to have lunch by the ocean he asked you read my mind we went to luna rosa an upscale eatery located on south ocean boulevard directly across from the beach the restaurant was one of my favorites an easy walk from my house although josh had no way of knowing that hed reserved a table outside and we sat along the narrow sidewalk soaking in the ocean air and watching the constant parade of people pass by our chairs so tell me when did all this happen joshs voice rose easily above the conflicting sounds of surf and automobiles when did what happen i watched a young woman in a turquoise thong bikini as she ran barefoot across the road then disappeared into a burst of sunlight josh waved large expressive hands into the air th the delray i remember was all pineapple fields and jungle i laughed you dont get out much do you i guess not delrays changed a lot in the past ten years i felt an unexpected surge of pride weve just been awarded our second allamerican city designation by the national civic league and a few years back we were named the bestrun town in florida i smiled how do you like them pineapples he laughed his eyes on mine looks like i should visit more often im sure your mother would like that and you i grabbed my ice water took a long sip id like that too the waiter approached with our orders crab cakes for josh a seafood salad for me your mothers quite a character i said taking a mouthful of calamari seeking safer ground id never been a good flirt and i was even worse when it came to playing games i tended to blurt out whatever thought was on the tip of my tongue yes she is shes filled you in on the sordid family history i take it she told me youre divorced im sure her description was considerably more colorful than that maybe just a little i took another sip of ice water sensibly id declined joshs offer of a glass of wine it was important to keep a clear head to stay in control besides i had barely an hour before i had to be back at work i leaned back in the uncomfortable folding chair listened to the sound of the waves somersaulting toward the shore echoing the tumult taking place inside my body god what was the matter with me i hadnt felt so overwhelmed so smitten so damn girlish since i was fourteen years old i wanted to grab josh wylie by the collar of his white linen shirt and yank him across the table i havent had sex in five years i wanted to shout can we just skip all this verbal foreplay and get on with the real thing but of course i didnt i just sat there smiling at him my mother would have been proud she tells me you never married josh said cutting into his crab cakes unaware of the more interesting conversation taking place inside my head shes right hard to believe really why because youre a beautiful intelligent woman and i would have thought some guy would have snapped you up long ago you would have thought i agreed with a laugh you have something against marriage not a thing i wondered why i always seemed to be explaining my single status as i told alison it wasnt any conscious decision on my part whos alison what oh my new tenant any regrets regrets about alison josh smiled about life in general i released a long deep breath a few you a few we finished the rest of our meal talking easily laughing often as the waves swept our unspoken regrets back and forth along the waters edge after lunch josh removed his socks and shoes and rolled his black linen trousers up around his knees while i slipped off my sandals and we walked along the beach the ocean repeatedly rushed toward us only to pull away upon contact like an eager lover tormented by second thoughts it charged only to retreat it seduced you with its monstrous beauty then abandoned you breathless and alone on the shore the eternal dance i thought the water cold as it licked at my toes arent we just the luckiest people alive josh said with an appreciative laugh we are i pushed my face toward the sky squinting into the sun i remember when i was a kid he continued my father used to take me to the beach every saturday afternoon while my mother was having her hair done youre from florida originally i wasnt sure why i asked that i already knew everything there was to know about joshs background that hed been born in boynton beach weighing a hefty nine pounds two ounces that his parents had lived at hibiscus drive all their married life that his mother had continued to live there after her husbands death a decade ago that shed refused her sons offer to move her down to miami so that she could be closer to her grandchildren that shed continued to live in that little house she loved until she got too sick to look after it anymore that shed personally selected mission care over fancier facilities in miami insisting that she got nosebleeds south of delray that her son drove up at least once a week to see her that he was still reeling from his divorce after seventeen years of marriage to his college sweetheart that he was the single father of two lovely but confused children that he was lonely that he deserved a second chance at happiness that i was more than prepared to provide him with that chance that i was completely out of my mind i thought realizing that i hadnt heard a single word hed said in the last two minutes what was the matter with me was i so starved for male companionship that a pleasant lunch instantly spawned fantasies of happily ever after i needed to slow down calm down cool down before i ruined everything deliberately i allowed myself to be distracted by the sight of two boys maybe five or six years old in matching bright red bathing suits tumbling over each other as they rolled like runaway logs into the water before disappearing underneath a succession of increasingly large waves i looked around the crowded beach an elderly couple was relaxing under a redand whitestriped umbrella a young man was erecting a sand castle with his toddler son two teenagers carelessly tossed a neonpink frisbee back and forth a middleaged woman her large stomach protruding over a tiny bikini bottom swung her arms with careless abandon as she marched along beside the ocean a younger woman was soaking up the sun breast implants proudly pointing toward the cloudless sky no one was supervising the two boys i realized holding my breath as the boys heads appeared above the water only to disappear again under the next big wave do you see anyone watching those boys i asked josh hard pellets of sunshine bouncing off my eyes as i continued scanning the beach joshs eyes joined in the search im sure theres someone he said unconvincingly as one of the youngsters began waving his arms in the air a fresh wave immediately slapped them down this wave was immediately followed by a much larger one a small voice rode the wave to shore help the voice cried wobbling like unsteady knees on a surfboard help i echoed loudly motioning frantically to the lifeguard farther down the beach but he was busy chatting up a teenage girl in a blackandwhite string bikini the girls long lean legs stretching all the way up to her baseball cap ive had nightmares about drowning all my life maybe because i never learned how to swim i couldnt just stand there waiting for disaster to strike i had to do something we have to do something i shouted as josh raced toward the lifeguard help help the small voice pleaded now joined by a second voice more plaintive than the first their cries skipped along the surface of the water like a stone only to disappear beneath yet another rush of deadly white foam somebody do something i shouted at the people around me but although a small crowd was starting to gather nobody moved without further thought i dropped my purse and shoes to the sand and jumped into the surf after the boys the cold water reaching between my thighs and whipping my dress around my legs an unexpected undertow suddenly anchored my legs to the sand and i struggled to maintain my balance my hands circling my body like rusty propellers help the boys continued crying their heads bobbing like apples in a bucket as i resolutely pushed myself forward only to feel my legs collapse beneath me like the folding chair id been sitting on only moments before im coming i called out the bitter taste of salt washing over my tongue as the ocean spilled into my mouth hang on i urged as the ground under my toes suddenly disappeared as if id stepped off a steep cliff and i fought to keep my head above water my hands reached blindly for something to grab on to accidentally smacking against what felt like a rock but proved to be a small head hair curled between my fingers like seaweed whether through determination good fortune or just plain dumb luck i managed to get my hands around first one boy then the other and somehow catapulted their kicking frames toward the shore in time for anxious arms to reach them i heard a series of excited highpitched exhortations didnt i tell you to stay put until i got back look at you you almost drowned and then the water once again wrapped itself around my torso like a hungry boa constrictor and carried me back out to sea so this is what it feels like to drown i remember thinking as the water covered my head like a heavy blanket sneaking into all my private cavities an impatient lover who would no longer be denied terry the water whispered seductively then louder more insistent terry terry terry the voice exploded in my ear as determined hands reached under my arms to pull me toward the sky my head burst through the surface of the water like a fist through glass my god are you all right strong arms pushed me toward the shore where i collapsed onto my hands and knees water clung to my eyes like shards of glass and i struggled to open them slivers of breath escaped my lungs in a series of short painful spasms are you all right joshs face formed around the edges of the words i nodded coughed sucked furiously at the air the boys theyre fine thank god joshs fingers pushed the hair out of my eyes smoothed the water from my cheeks youre a hero terry painter im an idiot i muttered i cant swim so i noticed youre not supposed to go in the water without a bathing suit a little girl admonished from somewhere beside me i looked down at my once seductive dress now wrapped around me like a bruised yellow tent look at me i wailed i look like an overripe banana josh laughed good enough to eat i thought i heard him say although in the ensuing commotion i couldnt be sure a crowd was gathering unfamiliar voices were exclaiming their gratitude strange hands were patting my back way to go someone enthused in passing are you okay a young woman asked long legs approaching cautiously i recognized the blackandwhite string bikini and the baseball cap knew she was the girl id seen earlier talking to the lifeguard im fine i noted the lifeguard was standing directly behind her and that he was suitably tall blond and muscular the expression on his bland bronzed face wavered between gratitude and resentment i just wanted to thank you the girl continued those are my brothers my mother would have killed me if anything had happened to them you should keep a closer eye on them she nodded glanced up the beach to where the boys were wrestling in the sand yeah well i told them her voice disappeared into a passing breeze anyway thanks again she looked past me at josh you interested in a job the lifeguard joked uneasily just do yours i told him but he was already backing away and he dismissed my admonishment with a wave of his hand as if swatting at a pesky insect my purse i said suddenly remembering id dropped it on the shore my shoes right here josh lifted them into the air like a proud fisherman displaying his catch of the day my god look at you i exclaimed realizing he was almost as wet as i was were quite a pair he said leaning his face toward mine i held my breath didnt move was he going to kiss me a clump of hair promptly fell into my eyes and i brushed it aside impatiently feeling particles of sand attach themselves to my eyelashes like globs of errant mascara great i thought trying to picture myself through his eyes a regular beauty queen i could almost hear my mother say terry a familiar voice asked from miles above my head i looked up shielded my eyes alison loomed between me and the sun like a giant eclipse terry she said again crouching down beside me my god i cant believe its you alison what are you doing here i have the day off whats going on somebody said you saved two little boys from drowning she was magnificent josh said proudly until i almost drowned myself my god are you all right shes magnificent josh repeated extending his hand toward alison im josh wylie by the way alison took his hand shook it vigorously alison simms alisons my new tenant i qualified pleasure to meet you alison you too almost reluctantly she relinquished his hand so has terry invited you over for thanksgiving yet alison terrys only the best cook in the whole wide world youre not busy are you well no but good then its settled dont worry terry alison cautioned ill help im not sure exactly what happened after that i remember wanting to wring alisons lovely swanlike neck i also wanted to throw my arms around her and jump up and down with joy at any rate perhaps sensing my ambivalence alison muttered something about meeting with me later to discuss all the necessary details then made a hasty retreat disappearing into a swirl of pink sand josh drove me to my house waiting in the car while i ran upstairs toweldried my hair and changed out of my wet clothes then he drove me back to work neither one of us said anything until he pulled up in front of the hospital then we turned simultaneously toward one another josh terry you dont have to come to dinner on thanksgiving you dont have to invite me no id love to invite you then id love to come really jans taking the kids that night so i have no particular plans well it wouldnt be anything fancy i dont need fancy if i have the best cook in the whole wide world i laughed well that might be a slight exaggeration shes quite a character isnt she yes she is a real whirling dervish slightly fey very charming charming fey i think now not the words i would use to describe her what words would you use i hear alison whisper slyly in my ear youll explain to my mother why i didnt come back to see her josh asked indicating his wet clothes can i leave out the part where i almost drowned josh laughed what time next thursday i quickly mulled over everything i had to do to prepare it had been years since id cooked anyone thanksgiving dinner i couldnt remember the last time id bought a turkey its not something you normally buy when youre cooking for one seven oclock seven oclock he repeated im thankful already i stepped out of the car and skipped up the hospitals front steps turning back as i pulled open the door my hero i thought watching josh drive away my head pleasantly dizzy with anticipation the sound of the surf still ringing in my ears okay so are you ready for your whole new look alison wearing blue shorts a white halter top and hotpink nail polish on her bare toes stood outside my kitchen door her arms loaded with an interesting array of bottles and tubes her hair was pulled back into a ponytail she looked about twelve my own hair was freshly washed as per her instructions and wrapped in a white towel that matched my white terrycloth robe whats all this i stepped back to let her inside creams oils emulsions she deposited the various items on my kitchen table and arranged them to her satisfaction whats an emulsion anyway i thought back to my years at nursing school any colloidal suspension of one liquid in another liquid i said almost by rote startled by how easily such longforgotten nuggets resurfaced colloidal a colloid is a gelatinous substance which when dissolved in a liquid will not diffuse readily through either vegetable or animal membranes alison looked at me as if i were some new form of alien species could you try that again its a liquid preparation thats the color and consistency of milk i said plainly she smiled lifted a mediumsized glass bottle of white cream into her hands that would be this one how can you buy products when you dont know what they are nobody knows what they are thats why they cost so much i laughed thinking she was probably right what else have you got here lets see theres a porepurifying microbead face wash and an alpha hydroxy exfoliating peeloff masque thats masque spelled with a que which means its really expensive then theres a botanical gentle facialbuffing cream another botanical cream with collagen and woodmallow whats that never mind she said in the same breath then we have a soothing eyecontour mask this one spelled with a k so its probably not as good a milky refiner not to be confused with the aforementioned milky emulsion an oilfree moisturizing lotion and a tube of concentrated apricot oil did you happen to catch my casual use of the word aforementioned i did were you impressed i was good she dug into the rightside pocket of her blue shorts pulled out several small bottles of nail polish very cherry and luscious lilac your choice from her leftside pocket emerged cotton balls emery boards and assorted tiny implements of torture then she reached behind her and extricated a large pair of scissors from her back pocket waving them before my eyes like a magic wand for madames new do im not so sure about that i wavered pulling the towel off my head dont worry im not going to do anything drastic just even it up a bit maybe take an inch off the bottom you said you have cucumbers in the fridge i told her trying to keep up with the conversation good then what say we get started what could i do alison was so enthusiastic so confident so persuasive i really didnt have a choice you want to be gorgeous for thanksgiving dont you i can still hear her ask and the truth was i did want to be gorgeous for thanksgiving i wanted to be dropdead knockemdownanddragemout gorgeous for thanksgiving for josh not that you arent gorgeous already alison had quickly amended all week id been walking around in a stupid haze singing along with the radio humming merrily offkey as i doled out medications even waving a pleasant hello to bettye mccoy as she hurried those overgrown furballs past my house and why all because some guy i liked had been nice to me no more than nice interested interested in me hes only using you i could almost hear my mother say hell break your heart yes he probably will i agreed but i didnt care it didnt matter that josh was still carrying a torch for his exwife that he had two kids and a dying mother that a serious involvement was probably the last thing he was looking for it didnt matter that wed had only one real date a lunch date at that and that id almost drowned during it what mattered was that he was interested good enough to eat hed said i felt an almost forgotten tingle between my legs what do you really know about this man my mother asked not much i was forced to admit that didnt matter either josh wylie could have been an ax murderer for all i cared sadistic killer or not he made me feel things i hadnt felt in years he resurrected emotions so long and deeply repressed id forgotten i had them at forty i felt like one of those silly teenage girls you see giggling in the mall with her friends and then he said and then he said i was fourteen again in love with roger stillman and look what happened there my mother reminded me well do your hair first alison was saying now a comb appearing from out of nowhere to drag the wet tangles of my hair across my ears and forehead alison sat me down and knelt in front of me her palm turning my chin from one side to the other as she studied my face she smiled as if privy to my innermost thoughts could she see josh wylie in the reflection of my eyes i heard the scissors felt the blades snipping at the air around my head moving closer ill clean up later she announced as i felt first one tug then another and watched in horror as several wet clumps of hair fell to the white tile of the kitchen floor oh god i moaned close your eyes alison instructed have faith with my eyes closed the sound of cutting was even more intense it was as if those scissors were slicing through all my protective outer layers snipping away my secrets sapping my strength samson and delilah i thought dramatically taking a series of long deep breaths deciding to roll with the punches go with the flow ill wait till after your facial to blow it dry properly we can go into the living room now she instructed as i stepped over the hair lying across the white tiles like a small area rug dont look she said as a shudder shook my shoulders have faith trust me id already laid a bedsheet across the living room sofa in preparation for my night at the spa as alison had laughingly referred to it and now i stood paralyzed in front of it waiting for alison to tell me what to do okay lie down with your head at this end and your feet here thats good i want you to be really comfortable youre going to enjoy this alison said as if she wasnt sure now you get cozy and ill bring all the stuff i need in here the cucumber slices are in the fridge i reminded her closing my eyes my fingers darting about my neck feeling for hair you didnt have to slice them alison called back from the kitchen i would have done that i heard her rifling around in the fridge heard the tap running listened to the sounds of cupboard doors opening and closing what was she looking for in less than a minute alison was back well start with the exfoliating masque is that with a que or a k she laughed the expensive one oh good okay so close your eyes relax think pleasant thoughts i felt something cold and slimy being spread across my face like molasses on a slice of bread this might feel a bit weird as it starts to harden feels weird now you wont be able to talk she warned slathering the product around the outlines of my lips so its best if you stay still did i have a choice already it felt as if my face were encased in cement a death mask i remember thinking death masque i amended and might have laughed were it not for the stiffening of the muscles around my mouth for how long i asked through barely parted lips twenty minutes twenty minutes i opened my eyes started to sit up firm hands settled me back down relax the night is young and were just getting started close your eyes im going to put the cucumbers on them what are the cucumbers for i asked although i was no longer able to pronounce the hard cs and the noun emerged as more of a verbal blur than an actual word they reduce swelling what kind of nurse are you that you dont know that she teased then keep still it was a rhetorical question she fitted the cucumber slices gently into the empty circles around my eyes instantly the room darkened as if i were wearing sunglasses you like that word rhetorical good word i managed to say without moving my mouth im trying to learn three new words every day oh that was an easy one yeah its kind of fun i just open up the dictionary and point to a word and if i dont know what it means i write it down and memorize the definition such as well lets see today i learned three very interesting words ineffable which means incapable of being expressed or described like ineffable happiness you know so great you cant describe it thats one then theres epiphany which was a real shock because i thought i knew what that one meant but i was wrong i was really wrong do you know what it means a revelation of some sort i managed to squeeze out although the effort required all my concentration an epiphany is the sudden intuitive perception or insight into the reality or essential meaning of something she recited then paused i could feel her shaking her head do you want to know what i thought it meant i nodded my chin careful not to disturb the cucumbers at my eyes promise you wont laugh i grunted i couldnt have laughed if id tried well i saw this movie on tv when i was a kid it was about a man who for some unknown reason turned into a chicken and it was called epiphany so i assumed that an epiphany was when someone changed into a chicken i actually grew up believing that god can you imagine if id tried to use it in a conversation i shook my head albeit gently there was something so vulnerable about her something so terribly raw as if she were sitting there with all her nerve endings exposed i wished i could take her in my arms and comfort her like the big overgrown child she was whats the third word i asked instead meros its a flat surface between two channels of a triglyph whats a triglyph i have no idea she laughed i only do three words remember now thats enough talking i want you to relax and just enjoy being pampered something tells me you dont pamper yourself nearly enough she was right being pampered was new to me id worked hard all my life first at school then at my chosen profession and even at home looking after my mother in some ways i was grateful that i hadnt had an easy ride that my mother hadnt spoiled me more it made me that much more appreciative of the things i did have more sensitive and caring toward others okay alison was saying so while this masque hardens im going to start on your pedicure ill be right back take deep breaths let your whole body relax a sudden silence filled the room i heard her moving about the kitchen what was she doing i wondered taking one deep breath then another feeling the tension of the day seep slowly from my limbs you have really strong toenails alisons fingers suddenly pulled on the big toe of my right foot i realized i hadnt heard her come back into the room was it possible id fallen asleep for how long im going to cut them now so try not to move my feet squirmed under her touch dont move she warned again i heard the rapid snipping of the nail clippers as her fingers flitted expertly from one toe to the next this little piggy went to market i recited silently then stopped because i couldnt remember what had happened to the next little piggy now comes the best part she announced gently massaging my tired feet with lotion the smell of apricots drifted toward my nostrils feels good huh feels wonderful i agreed although im not sure i said the words out loud why terry painter i think youre actually beginning to enjoy this i nodded tried to smile felt tiny fissures at my cheeks as if my flesh had turned to stone my husband used to give the best foot massages alison said although from the sudden faraway tone in her voice i knew she was speaking more to herself than to me its probably why i married him certainly it would explain why i kept going back to him he had the best hands once he started massaging my feet i was a goner i understood what she meant alison had obviously learned a great deal from her former spouse her hands were magic in less than two minutes i too was a goner i still miss him alison continued i know i shouldnt but i cant help myself hes so cute you should see him all the girls take one look at him and faint dead away which of course was part of the problem he had no willpower whatsoever course neither did i hed cheat on me and id swear there was no way i was going to forgive him no way i was ever going to take his sorry ass back and then there hed be one night standing at my door and hed look so damn good and of course id let him in were just gonna talk id say and hed agree and wed go sit on the sofa and the next minute hed start rubbing my feet and that was that back to square one i thought i should probably comment assure her she wasnt the only woman in the world to fall for the wrong guy or to forgive him too many times but the truth was that even had my face been free of its cosmetic constraints i couldnt have found the strength to speak her littlegirl voice was like a lullaby singing me to sleep i breathed deeply the room growing ever darker as i drifted in and out of consciousness the next thing i remember was the sound of footsteps overhead i opened my eyes found myself staring at the white underside of two slices of cucumber i removed them my eyes adjusting quickly to the surrounding darkness i felt my face still hidden beneath a layer of hard alpha hydroxy when had alison turned off the light how long had i been asleep again i heard the sound of movement overhead the opening and closing of drawers was she in my bedroom i wondered pushing myself to my feet and turning on the nearby lamp what was she doing bright red toenails winked at me from beside the soft white cotton balls wedged between each toe very cherry i remembered as i walked on my heels toward the stairs she was in the guest room standing in front of the bookshelf that occupied most of the wall opposite the old burgundy velvet sofa bed her back was to me obviously she hadnt heard me come up what are you doing i asked the masque around my mouth cracking like glass alison spun around the book in her hand dropping to the floor landing on her toes she gasped although im not sure whether it was from pain or surprise oh my god you scared me what are you doing i asked again the cracks in my masque lengthening reaching for my eyes hesitation flickered briefly across her face like a candle flame caught in an unexpected breeze well first i came up to look for these she said recovering quickly as she pulled a pair of tweezers from her pocket i realized i forgot mine and you were snoring away it was so cute i didnt want to wake you up i figured you must have a pair somewhere but i had to go through practically every drawer in the bathroom till i found them why dont you keep them in the medicine cabinet like everyone else i thought i did i answered lamely she shook her head they were next to your hot rollers underneath the sink she returned my tweezers to her pocket and then i was on my way back downstairs when i saw all the books and i thought id take a second and look up word number four in the dictionary she bent down to retrieve the large book with its glossy redandyellow cover held it up for me to see a triglyph is a structural member of a doric frieze she announced triumphantly please dont ask me what a doric frieze is it was then that i caught sight of my reflection in the window and saw my newly shorn hair sticking out at weird angles from around my mummified face oh god i look like the bogeyman alison winced dont even joke about that she replaced the book on the shelf laced her arm through mine lets get that masque off your face we still have lots more to do i think ive had about all the pampering i can take nonsense im just getting started i took thanksgiving off this was unusual because since my mothers death five years ago id worked every thanksgiving in fact i worked every holiday and that included christmas day and new years eve why not i reasoned unlike margot and caroline i had no family waiting for me at home no one to bemoan my absence or complain they didnt see enough of me and the residents of mission care still needed looking after holiday or not it was truly sad how few visitors some of them received how perfunctory many of those visits were if i could make the holidays less lonely for these people many of whom id come to like and admire then i was more than happy to do it besides it was a tradeoff i was doing it as much for me as for them i didnt want to spend the holidays alone any more than they did but this thanksgiving was different i wasnt going to be alone i was having a dinner party a slightly bigger dinner party than id first anticipated aside from josh and alison the guest list now included alisons coworker denise nickson alison had asked if we could include her and although i was reluctant i didnt really trust denise after the incident with the earrings alison assured me that she was smart funny and basically good at heart so against my better judgment i agreed to include her besides with denise around to talk to alison i reasoned id have more time to concentrate on josh something smells absolutely fabulous alison swept into the kitchen from the dining room where shed been setting the table she was wearing her blue sundress and her hair secured behind one ear by a delicate blue dragonfly clip hung in a wondrous rush around her shoulders on her feet were her silver slingback shoes i still couldnt look at them without feeling a jolt of anxiety this turkey is going to be yummy delicious i hope youre right what else can i do to help the tables set wait till you see it it looks like something out of gourmet magazine i put the roses josh sent in the middle between the candles i blushed and turned back toward the stove pretended to be watching the pot of small red potatoes that were boiling at a brisk and steady pace believe it or not no one had ever sent me flowers before i think were all set to go i said running through my mental checklist turkey stuffing marshmallowcovered yams small red potatoes homemade cranberry sauce a pearandwalnut salad with gorgonzola dressing we have enough food for an army alison remarked throwing her hands into the air as if she were tossing confetti it was a gesture of pure joy and it made me laugh out loud youre so pretty when you laugh alison said i smiled my appreciation thinking that if i looked especially nice tonight it was all because of her not only was the haircut shed given me the best most flattering haircut id ever had it fell about my face in soft amber waves that stopped just below my chin but my skin still glowed from the facial shed administered and the makeup shed selected and meticulously applied several hours earlier had somehow managed to be both dramatic and natural my fingernails matched my toenails very cherry going very well with my navy slacks and newly purchased white silk shirt my silver cupid earrings dangled from my ears tonight i told myself was going to be a very special night the doorbell rang my god i said what time is it alison checked her watch only sixthirty somebodys very anxious to get here big eyes widened in anticipation do i really look okay i pulled my blueandwhitecheckered apron up over my head careful not to disturb my hair ran my tongue across the muted red of my lips you look fantastic just relax take a deep breath i took one deep breath then another for good luck before proceeding out of the kitchen even before i reached the front door i could hear giggling from outside clearly it was denise and not josh whod been anxious to get here just as clearly she wasnt alone had she and josh arrived at the same time i wondered pulling open the door denise wearing a pink tshirt with orange letters that said dump him and a pair of tight black jeans her dark hair spiking rudely around the pale triangle of her face was standing on the outside landing skinny arms wrapped around an equally scrawny young man with short brown hair light brown eyes and a strong hawklike nose the face was vaguely sinister although it softened a bit when he smiled still he filled me with unease were here denise announced gaily i know were early but she laughed as if shed said something funny this is kc she said and laughed again was she drunk i wondered high casey kc the young man explained biting off each letter he was about the same age as alison i estimated short for kenneth charles but nobody ever calls me that i nodded wondered who he was and what he was doing in my house denise alison asked from behind me hi you denise pushed past me into the living room of my home wow nice house alison meet kc casey kc the young man explained again short for kenneth charles but nobody ever calls him that i added thinking he must get awfully tired of having to explain himself i didnt realize you were bringing a date alison said nervous eyes flitting in my direction is it a problem i just assumed it would be all right everybody always makes way too much food on thanksgiving if its a problem the young man interjected quickly i can go i dont want to put anybody out no i heard myself say denise is right theres more than enough food we cant very well toss you out on the street on thanksgiving can we i wasnt being especially magnanimous it was more that i suddenly decided josh might be more comfortable if another man was present ill set another place alison volunteered disappearing into the dining room as i ushered denise and kc toward the sofa and chairs can i get you something to drink i offered vodka denise asked beer asked kc i had neither so they settled for white wine we sat in my living room sipping on our drinks alison and i were sticking to water for the time being and making awkward conversation denise seemed neither particularly smart nor funny and kc who said little had a way of looking right through you even in repose that was quite unsettling tonight is going to be a disaster i thought almost praying josh would call to cancel so whered you two meet alison asked at the store denise shrugged her eyes zeroing in on the large painting of lush pink and red peonies that hung on the wall across from the sofa thats a nice painting thank you i dont usually like stuff like that you know flowers and fruit and stuff still life i said yeah i usually dont like it i like art with more of an edge you know but this is kinda nice whered you get it it was my mothers yeah and what you inherited it after she died denise was seemingly oblivious to the fact this might be none of her business along with the house and everything i said nothing not sure how to respond ive been trying to talk terry into buying that painting of the woman with the large sun hat on the beach alison chipped in as if aware of my discomfort youre an only child denise pressed ignoring her yes im afraid so no youre lucky denise protested i have two sisters we hate each others guts and alison has a brother she never talks to what about you kc you have any brothers or sisters you cant stand one of each he said and where are they tonight i asked back in houston i guess i didnt know you were from texas denise said ive always wanted to go to texas it doesnt sound like youve known each other very long i remarked we met last night denise giggled the incongruously childish sound emerging from between deeppurple lips actually id seen him in the store a few times but we didnt talk until last night i thought you looked familiar alison suddenly exclaimed you were in on monday you asked about the frog sculpture kc looked vaguely embarrassed i was trying to pick you up he admitted with a laugh oh nice talk denise said and what it didnt work so you came back last night and hit on me it doesnt mean i dont love you kc said with a sly grin denise laughed isnt he cute i think hes so cute she reached over scraped clawlike fingers across his skinny thigh the thing about art she continued as if this were the most logical of continua her eyes back on the floral painting is that its such a lie dont you think im not sure i follow i answered take these flowers denise said or the woman with the hat on the beach i mean when have you ever seen flowers this big and lush in real life or sand that pink it doesnt exist it exists in the artists imagination i argued my point exactly just because art is subjective doesnt make it a lie sometimes an artists interpretation of something is ultimately more real than the thing itself the artist is forcing you to view the subject in a new and different light to arrive at a greater truth denise waved my theories away with a careless hand the wine sloshed around in her glass veering dangerously toward the rim artists distort they enhance they leave things out she shrugged that makes them liars in my book you got something against liars kc asked i heard a car pull into the driveway listened to the sound of footsteps on the outside path was already on my feet when the doorbell rang i couldnt help but notice the look of anticipation on alisons face as i walked to the door you look great she called after me giving me two encouraging thumbsup i laughed and opened the door then had to lean against it in case my legs gave out and i fell over the large leafy plant to my right josh wylie was wearing a blue silk shirt and carrying a bottle of dom perignon he looked absolutely gorgeous and it was all i could do to keep from throwing myself into his arms calm down i told myself youre forty years old not fourteen relax take deep breaths am i late josh asked as i closed the door after him then stood rooted to the floor as if id been planted no youre perfect perfectly on time i qualified quickly letting go of the doorframe and accepting the bottle of dom perignon you didnt have to bring champagne your flowers were more than enough ooh champagne denise was suddenly at my side lifting the bottle from my hands im denise and i love champagne she extended her free hand denise nickson this is josh wylie i said denise works in the gallery with alison alison waved hello from the sofa its my aunts gallery denise explained so im kind of a partowner i guess this is my friend kc nice to meet you casey kc we corrected in unison stands for kenneth charles he said but nobody calls him that alison said you must get awfully tired of having to explain that to everyone josh said and i smiled hearing my own thoughts resonating through his words what can i say about that night my initial reservations were quickly dispelled in a wave of champagne and friendly banter despite the disparity in our ages and interests the five of us made for a lively and interesting group the food was delicious the conversation effortless the mood relaxed and happy so what exactly does an investment counselor do denise asked josh at one point the cranberry sauce on her fork competing with the stubborn purple of her lips and dont say he counsels people on their investments im afraid theres not much else i can say josh demurred are you counseling terry on her investments kc asked i laughed first id have to have some money to invest oh come on you must have lots of money kicking around denise protested i mean you work you own your own house you have a tenant plus im sure you have a nice pension which i dont collect till i retire i told her a slight twinge of discomfort worming its way into my gut how had we come to be discussing my finances what about you kc josh asked what is it you do computer programmer kc helped himself to another slice of turkey another heaping spoonful of yams another job ill never understand denise said do you have a computer terry no i answered ive never really needed one how can you survive without email youd be surprised what you can survive without i stared into my lap trying not to picture josh slamming me against the wall of my bedroom eager fingers unbuttoning my blouse you have no relatives across the country you need to keep in touch with denise asked i shook my head caught sight of kc as he leaned forward cold eyes focused on me intently snake eyes i thought with a shudder okay so what are we all thankful for alison suddenly asked three things everybody oh god denise groaned this is so oprah you first kc alison instructed three things youre thankful for kc lifted his glass into the air good food good champagne he smiled snake eyes slithering between alison and denise bad women they laughed denise denise made a face that said this sort of game was beneath her but that shed indulge us anyway because she was such a good sport lets see im thankful the gallery was closed today and i didnt have to work im thankful my aunt is visiting her daughter in new york and i didnt have to spend thanksgiving with her and she looked directly at me im thankful youre as good a cook as alison said you were amen to that josh said raising his glass in a toast okay josh alison directed your turn josh paused as if giving the matter careful thought im thankful for my children im thankful for the wonderful care my mother gets each day and for that and for tonight im especially thankful to and for our lovely hostess thank you terry painter youre a godsend thank you i whispered dangerously close to tears im thankful for terry too alison said as i felt my cheeks grow warm thankful thats shes given me a place to stay and welcomed me so warmly into her life secondly im thankful for my instincts that told me to come here in the first place and thirdly im thankful for the chance ive been given to start over again arent you a little young to be starting over josh asked your turn alison blushed swiveled toward me im thankful for my health i began denise groaned thats like wishing for world peace and im thankful for all your kind words i continued ignoring her i looked from alison to josh then back to alison and im thankful for new friends and new opportunities i consider myself very lucky were the lucky ones alison said does anyone here believe in god denise asked suddenly and then everybody was speaking at once as the conversation veered from philosophic to sophomoric to downright moronic and then back again not surprisingly alison was among the believers surprisingly so was denise kc was an atheist josh an agnostic as for me id always wanted to believe and on a good day i did today i decided perhaps prematurely had been a good day at ten oclock josh announced it was time for him to be heading back to miami he was right it was time to call it a night wed polished off the homemade pumpkin pie drunk all the champagne finished the last of the baileys alison had cleared the table handwashed the dishes and led us in an impromptu game of charades which shed handily won im very good at games shed said proudly ill walk you to your car i told josh feeling a slight twinge in my stomach like a poke in the ribs as i rose from the living room sofa and followed him to the door nice meeting you josh denise called after him see you again soon i hope alison said kc said nothing although i detected a slight nod of his head that meant either goodbye or that he was too drunk to do more no one else made a move to leave clearly josh and i were the only two people in the room who understood the value of timing the warm air embraced us like a lazy lover as we stepped outside and gazed up at a sky heavy with stars the smell of the ocean filtered through the night air like silver threads through a dark tapestry lingering like an expensive perfume beautiful night i remarked walking beside josh to his car lovely evening all around im so glad you could make it so am i he looked down the empty street feel like taking a little walk just to the corner he added when i hesitated im not sure why i hesitated in truth i wanted nothing more than to prolong my time with josh for as long as humanly possible probably i was leery of leaving my other guests alone in the house for too long sure i heard myself say ignoring my concerns falling into step beside him my arm brushed against his i felt a jolt like a small but potent electrical charge shoot through my body i was hoping for a few minutes alone with you josh said do you want to talk about your mother he laughed stopped walking you think i want to get you alone so i can talk about my mother i looked toward the sidewalk afraid i was so transparent my thoughts were visible on my forehead i felt his hand at my chin a succession of increasingly powerful shocks raising my eyes back to his as i watched his face tilt toward mine if he gets any closer i thought hes liable to be electrocuted id really like to kiss you right now he said a loud sigh escaped my lips as he moved closer my heart was pounding right through my clothes like a baby kicking in its mothers womb except it wasnt my heart i realized with a sudden gasp it was my stomach and it wasnt passion it was pain my god was i going to be sick was he going to kiss me and then shrink back in horror while i threw up all over him certainly that was one way of ensuring tonight would be a night to remember i decided as his lips settled gently on mine very nice he whispered kissing away my fears his arms wrapping around me like a cloak instantly i relaxed come back into the house i wanted to say come back and tell the others they have to leave stay and make love to me all night you can drive back to miami in the morning except of course i said no such thing instead i kissed him again and again then stood there grinning like an idiot until it became obvious he wasnt going to kiss me anymore and we turned back walking hand in hand toward his car my mind racing with my heart my intestines doing a slow rope burn against the inside of my stomach i was thinking that it doesnt matter how old we are fourteen or forty were ageless when it comes to love thanks again for a wonderful evening josh said when we reached his car thank you for the champagne and the roses im glad you liked them theyre beautiful so are you he kissed me again this time on the cheek his eyelashes fluttering against my skin like butterfly wings ill see you next week he said climbing into his car i watched in silence as he backed his car onto the street heading toward atlantic avenue when he reached the stop sign at the corner he waved without looking back as if he knew i was still watching him i waved back but by then he was already halfway down the next block it took several minutes before i was able to move truthfully it was as much the tingling on my lips and cheek as the renewed cramping in my gut that rendered me immobile too much rich food and excitement for an old lady i decided when i was finally able to put one foot in front of the other i returned to the house prepared to tell the others that the party was officially over but my living room was empty had everyone cleared out while i was gone it was then i heard the sound of careless laughter bouncing above my head like a rubber ball what were they doing upstairs i wondered temporarily forgetting about the pains in my stomach alison i called from the foot of the stairs immediately alisons head popped into view at the top of the landing josh leave what are you doing up there i asked ignoring her question denise suddenly appeared beside alison my fault i asked for a tour of the house theres not much to see i watched the two young women make their way down the stairs kc nipping at their heels like a large uncoordinated golden retriever its like a little dollhouse denise pronounced im sorry alison whispered in my ear she was up the stairs before i could stop her whatever annoyance i was feeling was replaced by a sharp jab to my solar plexus i grimaced grabbed my side something wrong alison asked i shook my head i think i should have skipped that second helping of pie i muttered hoping i wouldnt have to say more okay guys alison announced immediately partys over time to pack it in we said our goodbyes at the front door alison kissed me on the cheek i think denise hugged me kc mumbled something about being slightly inebriated then almost fell into the leafy branches of the large white oleander that sat to the right of the front door then they were gone and the house was quiet save for the whispering of the leaves surprisingly i had no trouble falling asleep my stomach seemed to settle down the minute everyone left so i attributed the discomfort to all the excitement the elaborate dinner a house full of new people my first kiss in forever josh josh josh yes i said in alisons voice then again watching her clap her hands together and jump up and down with glee yes yes yes and then i must have fallen asleep because the next thing i knew i was dreaming wild dreams crazy dreams dreams where i was running around the house in helpless circles trying to find alison to warn her of danger although the danger was nonspecific undefined at one point i was climbing up the stairs when kc jumped out at me from the shadows long legs flying karatestyle through the air toward my stomach i gasped doubled forward in my bed barely made it to the bathroom where i threw up copiously and repeatedly but even a thorough purging of the nights dinner provided little relief i sat on the tile floor my head spinning painful spasms shooting through my body like pinballs wondering whether it was possible i was having an attack of appendicitis unlikely i knew it was much more likely to be a simple case of overindulgence or perhaps even food poisoning i wondered if any of my guests had gotten sick oh god poor josh i thought pushing myself to my feet and creeping slowly my back hunched like a doddering old woman toward my bedroom window i pulled back the lace curtains stared at the cottage behind my house surprised to see the lights still on i glanced at the clock beside my bed it was almost three in the morning awfully late for alison to be up was she sick as well i pulled on my housecoat and gingerly made my way down the stairs i unlocked the kitchen door and tiptoed outside the grass cool on my bare feet a sudden rush of nausea almost overwhelmed me and i gulped frantically at the fresh air until the feeling subsided i took several long deep breaths before continuing toward the cottage door it was then i heard the sound of laughter from inside the cottage clearly alison wasnt sick nor was she alone i returned to the house relieved that alison was okay that it appeared no one else had gotten sick my reputation as a cook was safe i thought and might have laughed had it not been for the renewed spasms that catapulted me toward the kitchen sink dozens of ceramic eyes looked down disapprovingly from the shelves above my head the pitiless blank stares of the china ladies passing silent judgment on my condition serves you right the women shouted through pouting painted lips thatll teach you to have too good a time i was halfway up the stairs when the phone rang who would be calling me at this hour i wondered moving as quickly as my stomach would permit alison had she seen me outside the cottage door i pushed my bent frame toward the phone beside my bed answered it at the start of its fifth ring hello have a nice evening the voice asked not alison a man who is this i have a message for you from erica hollander what she says you better watch your step who is this the phone went dead in my hands hello hello i slammed down the receiver too angry to speak too weak to try i fell back on the bed hands shaking heart pounding my brain alternating between trying to place the voice and to put it out of my mind altogether what did his strange message mean of course sleep was no longer an option i spent the balance of the night rolling from one side of the bed to the other either too hot or too cold my teeth chattering or my forehead bathed in sweat my arms securing the blankets tightly under my chin my feet kicking them angrily back to the foot of the bed for hours i lay on my back observing the moonlight slither through the lace of my curtains watching the darkness bleed from the sky until it grew light whenever it looked as if i might be granted a few minutes respite a notquitefamiliar voice would sneak up beside me and whisper in my ear i have a message for you from erica hollander she says you better watch your step at around eight oclock i pushed myself out of bed i was still nauseous and weak but at least my stomach was no longer threatening to burst from my body my forehead felt a little warm to the touch and my hands were still trembling i decided to make some tea maybe eat a piece of toast although at the thought of food my stomach lurched maybe just tea i decided about to head downstairs when i heard voices outside my window i shuffled toward the sound and pulled back the curtains careful to stay out of sight alison was standing in the open doorway of the cottage talking to denise both still dressed in last nights clothes denise was doing most of the talking although i couldnt make out what she was saying the look on alisons face however told me she was paying close attention come on sleepyhead denise suddenly shouted toward the inside of the cottage time to get your bony ass out of there seconds later kc stood in the doorway his shirt hung open and his blue jeans rode dangerously low on his skinny hips emphasizing the line of dark hair that spiraled from the center of his bare chest down past his belly button then disappeared beneath the buckle of his black leather belt his short brown hair was matted and uncombed and sleep clung to his eyes as carelessly as the halfsmoked cigarette that dangled from his lips i watched him toss the cigarette into my bed of pink and white impatiens then lean toward alison and whisper something in her ear his fingers playing with the gold necklace at her throat as his eyes glanced toward my bedroom window was he talking about me i wondered careful to keep out of sight did he know i was there alison pushed him playfully aside waving after them as he and denise ambled along the side of the house to the street my eyes followed after them until they disappeared into the shadow of a nearby tree when i looked back i saw alison staring up at me a strange look on her face she waved signaled that she was coming over seconds later looking remarkably fresh and rested for someone whod been up all night she was at the kitchen door are you all right she asked as soon as she saw me i was sick last night i promptly collapsed into one of the kitchen chairs sick you mean like throwingup sick i mean like throwingup sick oh yuck thats awful i hate throwing up its my least favorite thing in the whole world i cant say im overly fond of it myself you know how some people tell you that throwing up will make you feel better not me id rather feel sick as a dog for weeks on end than throw up thats why it was always such a joke to me when people thought i was bulimic as if i would ever do anything to make myself vomit i mean yuck i could almost see the exclamation point i remember when i was a little girl she continued and i got sick one night after eating too much red licorice and every night after that when id climb into bed id ask my mother if i was going to be all right and shed roll her eyes and say yes but i wasnt convinced so id make her promise even still id grit my teeth until i fell asleep you didnt believe your mother alison shrugged her eyes circling the kitchen you want some tea id love some she busied herself with the mechanics of making tea she filled the kettle with water dropped a tea bag into a mug got the milk out of the fridge you probably drank too much champagne she ventured eyes glued to the kettle a watched pot never boils i told her what a watched pot never boils one of my mothers little aphorisms aphorism good word thats like what a saying more or less alison obligingly looked away from the kettle and toward the window so i guess you saw me talking to denise and kc it was more statement than question i nodded said nothing they wanted to see the cottage she paused studied her bare feet anyway we stayed up pretty late talking and next thing i knew denise was curled up in my bed and kc was passed out on the floor the teakettle whistled its readiness alison jumped at the sound then laughed looks like your mother was right i just had to stop watching it mother knows best i chose my next words carefully did you call your family to wish them a happy thanksgiving no alison poured my tea not quite ready to do that yet here drink this itll make you feel better i hope so i took a tentative sip so did you enjoy last night i mean aside from the throwingup part i laughed understanding the subject of her family was closed at least for now i had a wonderful time i think josh really likes you you do i could tell by the way he looked at you he thinks youre something special hes a very nice man i took another sip of my tea felt it burn the tip of my tongue pulled back careful alison warned too late its hot so what are you up to today going to the beach with your friends not a chance im going to stay right here and make sure youre okay oh no i dont want you to do that alison pulled up a chair plunked down beside me you took care of me when i got sick didnt you yes but no buts she smiled its settled im not going anywhere not long after i finished the tea my nausea returned and i suffered through an agonizing round of dry heaves surprisingly alison made a wonderful nurse holding a cool compress to my head and not leaving my side until i was safely tucked back in bed sleep i can still hear her repeating as she stroked my hair sleep sleep whether it was from exhaustion the sound of her voice or the touch of her hand within minutes i was sound asleep this time no dreams plagued me i slept soundly deeply for several hours when i opened my eyes it was almost noon i sat up in bed twisting my neck from side to side to get rid of the stiffness that had settled in then i heard a voice talking quietly from the second bedroom and realized it was alison i didnt call to fight i heard her say as i climbed out of bed steadying myself against the wall as i shuffled toward the door everything is going exactly as planned she continued as i stepped into the hall drew closer youre just going to have to trust that i know what im doing i must have made a sound because she suddenly spun around in her seat went ghostly white terry how long have you been standing there are you all right the words tumbled from her mouth in a frantic rush like sand from a broken hourglass look i have to go she said into the portable phone at her ear before stuffing it unceremoniously into the pocket of her white shorts she jumped to her feet and quickly ushered me toward the sofa then sat so close to me our knees were touching my brother she explained patting the phone in her pocket i decided you were right that the least i could do was call my family and wish them a happy holiday let them know im okay it didnt go well about as well as expected anyway how are you you look a hundred percent better i feel better i said without much conviction what had alison been talking to her brother about what i wondered was going exactly as planned what have you been doing all morning i asked instead first i went home took a shower changed my clothes then a huge grin swept across alisons face temporarily obliterating my concerns i found this she grabbed a large leatherbound photo album from the pillow beside her balanced it across her lap i hope you dont mind i stumbled across it when i was looking for something to read she flipped it open are these your parents i found myself staring at an old blackandwhite photograph of a smiling young couple at a public swimming pool my fathers skinny legs sticking out from underneath a pair of dark oversize swim trunks loafers on his feet a straw hat on his head my mother sitting beside him in a modest gingham bathing suit hands clasped primly in her lap hair piled high on her head large white sunglasses swamping her small face how long had it been since id looked at these pictures the album had been tucked away at the back of the highest shelf how had alison simply stumbled across it thats them i said brushing an invisible hair away from my mothers face feeling her swat my hand aside they werent married yet as alison steadily turned the pages i watched my parents grow up before my eyes from shy young lovers to selfconscious newlyweds to nervous parents this ones my favorite alison pointed to a picture of my mother pressing a sadeyed baby to her cheek look at how cute you were cute my ass just look at those bags under my eyes i shook my head in dismay my mother claimed i didnt sleep through the night until i was three years old and i peed in my pants until i was seven no wonder they decided not to have any more kids alison laughed studied each page in turn which ones you she asked suddenly indicating a large photograph of a bunch of small children arranged in neat little rows like pansies in a garden my senior kindergarten class i pointed to a little girl in a white dress frowning from the back row you dont look very happy i never liked having my picture taken no i love it oh look at this one is this you alisons index finger landed on a little girl in a plaid jumper scowling beside her thirdgrade teacher thats me all right would you just look at that face alison laughed you have the same expression in every picture even as a teenager which ones roger stillman what roger stillman is he in any of these pictures no he was a few grades ahead of me i reminded her too bad i would have liked to see what he looked like what do you think happened to him i have no idea do you ever think of just picking up the phone and calling him saying hi roger stillman this is terry painter remember me never i said louder than id intended do you think he still lives in baltimore i shrugged my lack of interest flipped to another page saw my parents now in glorious color posed together on the front lawn of their first house in delray beach they looked a little stiff as if aware there were difficult times ahead would you mind making me another cup of tea i asked it would be my supreme pleasure alison pushed herself off the sofa how about some toast and jam to go with it why not thats the spirit i leaned my head against the burgundy velvet of the sofa closed my eyes the sound of alisons voice soft against my ear everything is going exactly as planned she purred and then another voice i have a message for you from erica hollander the stranger whispered in my ear she says you better watch your step but i was too tired too weak to listen the weeks between thanksgiving and christmas were especially busy both at the hospital and at home in the five years since my mothers death i hadnt bothered much with the festive trappings of the holiday season indeed id gone out of my way to ignore the holidays often working overtime and volunteering for the graveyard shift but alison was determined to change that what do you mean youre working on christmas she wailed its just another day no its not its christmas cant you switch with somebody else i shook my head it was late afternoon and i was working in my garden alison was pacing restlessly back and forth on the lawn behind me but that really sucks she protested looking and sounding at least a decade younger than her twentyeight years i mean i was kind of hoping we could have christmas together we could do christmas eve immediately her face brightened thats right lots of families open their presents on christmas eve dont they i guess that would be okay can i go with you to pick out a tree a tree i couldnt remember the last time id had a christmas tree you have to have a tree whats christmas without a tree and well get decorations and little white lights my treat of course its the least i can do itll be so great can we do that how could i say no in the weeks since id been sick alison had become a regular and increasingly welcome part of my day we spoke often on the phone from our respective places of work had dinner together two or three times a week occasionally went to the movies or for a leisurely stroll along the beach no matter how busy our schedules alison found time for us to be together and despite my initial reservations about tenants in general and alison in particular she simply ran roughshod over any misgivings i might have had i was powerless where she was concerned i realized as we drove along military trail some days later a tall scotch pine protruding from the halfopen trunk of my car alison had managed in the space of only several months to become an integral part of my life and despite the twelveyear difference in our ages probably the closest friend id ever had is this not the most absolutely gorgeous tree in the whole wide world she asked after wed finished attaching the last of the delicate pink bows to its long sharp branches we stood back to admire our handiwork its absolutely the most gorgeous tree in the whole wide world i concurred and she hugged me this is going to be the best christmas ever alison declared as christmas eve drew closer and she added yet another present to the growing pile under the tree that shed stationed in the corner of my living room i think shes homesick i confided to margot at work i mean you should see what shes done to the house there are decorations everywhere mountains of holly sprigs and i cant move without bumping into one of these weird little santas she has everywhere sounds like shes taking over margot observed with a laugh how long before she moves in and you go back to living in the cottage she reached for a patients file answered the ringing phone beside her i think shes just homesick i repeated vaguely annoyed with margot although i wasnt sure why margot held out the phone for you terry painter i announced expecting to hear alisons voice had she somehow sensed we were talking about her terry its josh wylie my heart sank i really hate to do this to you again he was saying as i lowered my chin to my chest silently mouthing the words along with him somethings come up and im going to have to cancel our lunch im really sorry so am i i said truthfully this was the third lunch date josh had canceled in as many weeks aside from a few quick exchanges when hed dropped by to visit his mother we hadnt seen each other since thanksgiving how about dinner he surprised me now by asking i have to be up your way later and i have a little something for you you have something for me tis the season its just a little token of my appreciation for being so nice to my mother he added quickly how about i pick you up at seven oclock seven oclock would be fine seven oclock it is he clicked off without saying goodbye somebody looks awfully pleased with herself margot said with a sly wink i said nothing my mind already on the night ahead so what if josh had canceled three lunch dates in a row one dinner equaled three lunches any day not only that but he had a gift for me a small token of his appreciation hed said for being so nice to my mother i tried to imagine what it could be a bottle of perfume some fancy soaps maybe a silk scarf or even a small brooch no it was way too early for jewelry our relationship if a few kisses and several canceled lunch dates could be called a relationship was still in the beginning stages it wouldnt be appropriate as my mother might have said for him to be showering me with extravagant gifts it didnt matter whatever josh gave me would be wonderful i wondered what i could get him in return deciding to ask myra for her advice her condition had deteriorated in the last few weeks and she was understandably depressed perhaps news of my upcoming dinner date with her son might cheer her up but myra was asleep when i entered her room so after checking her iv and adjusting her blankets i left im having dinner with your son tonight i said from the doorway wish me luck but the only response i got was an involuntary whistle that escaped myras lips as she exhaled i closed the door and stepped into the hall where i was almost run over by one of the orderlies whats going on i called after him as he raced down the hall patient in came out of her coma he called back excitedly sheena oconnor i asked but the young man had already disappeared around a corner my god i dont believe it i hurried to room pushed open the door the room was overflowing with doctors and assorted medical personnel everyone moving about purposefully their actions both condensed and exaggerated as if the scene were being enacted in both slow motion and fastforward simultaneously i caught a glimpse of the pale young woman who was the calm at the center of the storm she was sitting up in bed still attached to a myriad of tubes and our eyes connected for only the briefest of seconds as i was backing out of the room wait her tiny voice pierced the air i froze as half a dozen bodies swiveled in my direction half a dozen faces found my own i know you the girl said youre the one whos been singing to me arent you you heard me i approached the bed the doctors and nurses who surrounded her clearing a path for me i heard you sheena said softly leaning back against her pillow large dark eyes fluttering to a close its a miracle a hushed voice whispered from a corner of the room has anyone notified her family someone asked her parents are on their way should we call the police theyve already been notified its a miracle someone else said a true christmas miracle i couldnt wait to share the news of sheenas miraculous recovery with alison so i decided to stop off at the gallery where she worked maybe alison could help me select a gift for josh something appropriate i thought feeling giddy and euphoric as i pulled into a just vacated parking space right on atlantic avenue another miracle i didnt see alison when i entered the store nor did i see denise indeed the gallery appeared to be deserted how on earth did they stay in business i wondered looking around noting that the painting of the woman with the widebrimmed sun hat no longer occupied its usual place on the far wall i felt a pang of regret alison had been right about it being the perfect painting for my living room it was too bad i hadnt taken her advice and scooped it up when i had the chance obviously someone much more decisive than i had done just that my life was a collection of missed opportunities i thought glumly deciding that was about to change starting with tonight starting with josh hello i called out alison can i help you i turned to see an attractive woman approximately my own age walking toward me her high heels clicking against the hardwood floor im sorry i was in my office have you been waiting long just got here the woman smiled although the skin around her mouth was pulled so tight it was hard to tell whether she was happy or in pain reflexively i brought my hand to my cheek pushed at the fine lines around my eyes is there something in particular youre looking for she asked actually im looking for someone who works here alison simms the womans smile became a tense straight line alison no longer works here she said curtly she doesnt she left last week she left why im afraid i had to let her go you had to let her go i repeated feeling like a parrot why perhaps you should ask her alison hadnt said a word about being let go she had told me that her boss had requested she not receive any more calls at work dear god was i the reason shed lost her job and this happened last week i heard myself ask my mind reeling is there anything i can help you with fern lorelli was clearly anxious to move on i muttered something about needing a christmas gift for a friend and eventually purchased an attractively masculine ballpoint pen i thought josh might like but my heart wasnt in it why had alison been fired more importantly why hadnt she told me i made up my mind to ask her as soon as i got home my phone was ringing as i pulled into the driveway i ran into the house the bells alison had hung on the front door jingling as i raced into the kitchen and grabbed for the phone i dropped the small bag containing my new purchase on the counter beside three small plastic santas all of whom stared at the bag with bemused curiosity hello a soft male voice slithered through the phone wire like a snake buy anything for me my breath froze in my lungs even as my eyes darted nervously toward the back window had someone been following me was i being watched why i wondered my arms folding protectively across my chest as if i were standing in my kitchen completely naked who is this what do you want my answer was a sly chuckle followed by silence and the familiar drone of the dial tone damn it i hung up and immediately pressed star but whoever was calling had blocked the trace i slammed the phone into its carriage it rang again almost immediately look i dont know what your problem is i said instead of hello but if you dont stop bothering me im going to call the police terry josh i know i broke our lunch date but do you really think the police are necessary im so sorry ive been getting these crank calls its nothing i sighed shook thoughts of other voices out of my head rough day actually no i said regrouping refocusing it was a great day i wondered briefly why he was calling surely it wasnt to talk about my day you remember sheena oconnor she came out of her coma this afternoon i prattled on almost afraid to let him speak it was incredible everyones calling it a christmas miracle it must have been very exciting it was amazing and the best part was that shed heard me singing to her while she was comatose isnt that incredible i asked sounding just like alison aware id used superlatives three times in as many seconds anyway ill tell you all about it tonight an awful silence followed for the second time that day my heart sank my happiness crashing to the floor with such force i felt the room shake beneath my feet i feel like such a jerk josh was saying is there a problem i opened the nearest drawer and stuffed the gift bag from lorelli gallery inside it clearly i wasnt going to be seeing josh wylie anytime soon its jillian he said referring to his daughter she came home from school and said she wasnt feeling very well does she have a fever i dont think so but i just wouldnt feel comfortable about leaving her im so sorry i cant believe im doing this to you twice in one day maybe you should call the police some days are like that i said gamely slamming the cupboard drawer shut watching the three santas collapse against each other like dominoes i feel really terrible about this youll make it up to me i ventured bravely absolutely as soon as i get back from california youre going away just for a couple of weeks the kids have cousins in san francisco we leave the day after tomorrow get back january third so much for new years eve i thought i hope you dont hate me these things happen i will make it up to you have a wonderful trip i said and tell jillian i hope she feels better soon i will see you next year i said cheerily then hung up the phone before i burst into tears damn it i swore damn it damn it damn it there was a knock on the kitchen door i gasped budding tears coating my eyes leaving a filmy residue im sorry alison apologized over the sound of jingling bells as i opened the door to let her in i didnt mean to scare you i caught a glimpse of strawberry curls white shorts and long tanned legs before turning away terry whats wrong why didnt you tell me you lost your job i demanded swiping at my eyes with the back of my hand refusing to look at her i could almost feel the color drain from alisons face what i dropped into the gallery this afternoon i spoke to fern lorelli oh she said she had to let you go silence then what else did she say not much she didnt say why wiping the last errant tears from my eyes i pivoted around to face her alisons gaze immediately dropped to the floor she said i should ask you alison nodded still unable to look me in the eye i was going to tell you but you didnt i thought id wait until i found another job i didnt want you worrying about the rent i didnt want to ruin christmas why were you let go slowly alison lifted her gaze to mine i didnt do anything wrong her voice implored apparently there was some money missing certain figures didnt add up i swear it wasnt me it was just easier for her to fire you than confront her own niece i offered after a pause biting down on my tongue to keep from adding i told you so you dont have to worry about anything honestly i have enough money im not worried about the money then what is it are you worried about me dont be she said before i could respond im sorry i didnt tell you i wont lie to you ever again i promise please dont be angry with me im not angry youre sure i nodded realizing it was true that if i was angry with anyone it was with myself for being such a damn fool i have a great idea alison suddenly announced running from the room seconds later i heard her foraging around under the christmas tree and seconds after that she was back a brightly if somewhat sloppily wrapped gift in her hands she extended it toward me since were opening the presents early anyway it wont hurt to open this one now ignore the wrapping i actually took a course in giftwrapping once would you believe go on open it itll make you feel better what is it open it i tore the wrapping off the brown cardboard box opened it large dark eyes stared up at me from under a shroud of translucent bubble wrap slowly carefully i lifted the head vase into the air the china lady sported an elaborate blond coif a large blue bow at her throat and mock diamond studs in her ears shes beautiful where did you find her at the flea market over by woolbright isnt she great i mean i know you think theyre junk and everything but i couldnt resist i saw her and i thought it was kind of like a sign or something a sign like i was meant to find her and you were meant to have her fate she said with an embarrassed roll of her eyes i mean the other heads were more your mothers this ones well shes all yours your firstborn so to speak do you like her i like her very much alison squealed with delight shes in mint condition check the eyelashes shes perfect i turned the china head over in my hands thank you feel better much where are you going to put her alison glanced toward the five shelves of ladies heads this ones pretty special i think ill keep her in my room alison beamed as if id just paid her the highest of compliments so i guess ill see you later later i agreed hearing the bells jingle as the kitchen door closed behind her i wandered into the dining area smiling at the sprigs of holly and pine that lay across the top of the cabinet at the applecheeked santa claus who stood in the middle of the dining room table at the papiermache reindeer that leaned against the wall the living room was more of the same more santas more reindeer at least a dozen elves if there was a space something christmassy was in it and then there was the tree itself tall and full and smelling of the forest its branches swathed in pink bows and small white lights presents swelling from beneath its base just looking at it buoyed my spirits and it was all alisons doing i recognized cradling the china head vase in my hands as if it were indeed my firstborn child alison was the true christmas miracle i decided what was i doing moping around the house because some guy had stood me up just think of all the things i had to be grateful for name three i heard alison urge my health i said reflexively then groaned sheena oconnors amazing recovery my god shed actually heard me sing to her alison i whispered then again louder more forcefully alison i looked down at the china head in my hands my heart full of remorse i was no better than fern lorelli i thought with disgust id used alison as a scapegoat transferred my anger and disappointment with someone else to her how could i have let her leave without giving her something in return i reached under the tree and selected a small parcel wrapped in silver foil then i carried it back into the kitchen leaving the china head on the kitchen table next to the santa claus saltandpepper shakers alison had picked up at target the sound of jingle bells followed me across the small patch of yard to the cottage door i heard the voices as i was about to knock i told you to let me handle this alison was saying her voice an angry hiss intense enough to be heard from outside im just here to help i dont need your help i know what im doing since when i turned to leave my shoulder accidentally brushing against the bells hanging from the bronze knocker setting them jangling almost immediately the door opened and alison stood before me with questioning eyes terry instinctively i thrust the gift toward her i wanted you to have this oh thats so sweet she glanced toward the interior of the cottage you didnt have to i know but i thought what did i think is someone here i ventured meekly there was a moments strained silence as a handsome young man materialized behind alison as if waved there by a magic wand he was several inches taller than alison with fair skin curly dark hair and the disturbingly blue eyes of a siamese cat welldefined biceps bulged from beneath the short sleeves of a black tshirt that stretched tightly across his chest that would be me the young man said smiling he reached around alison and extended his hand terry alison said her gaze drifting toward the grass the second time this afternoon shed been too embarrassed to look me in the eyes id like you to meet lance palmay my brother a pleasure to meet you lance said his handshake surprisingly gentle i called him after thanksgiving remember alison asked i nodded recalling the onesided conversation id overheard the morning i was so desperately sick everything is going exactly as planned youre just going to have to trust that i know what im doing lance decided he needed to fly down and see for himself how im making out looks like shes managing just fine lance pronounced thats why i came over before to tell you about lance alison explained inviting me inside the cottage with a sweep of her hand we got kind of sidetracked im not sure what i expected to see when i stepped inside a tinselcovered wonderland a veritable army of toys a recreation of the north pole but surprisingly the cottage bore only a few traces of christmas a large red candle surrounded by a few careless sprigs of holly on the glass coffee table in front of the deep purple love seat a lonely santa claus doll lying facedown on the bentwood rocker that was it do you want a cold drink alison offered i shook my head watched as lance flopped down on the large floralprint chair he looks way too comfortable i thought masking the unkind thought with a clearing of my throat when did you get in plane got into fort lauderdale around twelvethirty he smiled at alison i rented a car at the airport white lincoln town car no less its parked across the street you must have seen it surprised old sleepyhead here as she was getting out of bed alisons eyes narrowed as her shoulders tensed where are you staying i asked the two exchanged wary glances we were just talking about that alison began i thought i could stay here for a few days lance said as if the decision had already been made here i repeated when i could think of nothing else to say of course if you have any objections alison said quickly why would she object lance asked looking right at me but where would you sleep the sofa was far too short for the elongated legs of a former high school basketball player the double bed way too small to accommodate a brother and sister comfortably this is a pretty neat chair lance pounded its oversize arms and i can always throw a pillow on the floor is it all right alison asked me again because honestly if it isnt lance can find a motel at this time of year without a reservation i wouldnt count on it i dont want you to be uncomfortable alison said absolutely not lance concurred if my staying here would make you feel uncomfortable in any way its your comfort im concerned with dont worry about me ill pay you extra alison volunteered dont be silly thats not the point terry had a bad experience with her last tenant alison told her brother how so too long a story i shook my head well okay then i guess its okay a few days you said absolutely alison agreed christmas new years tops lance said effortlessly stretching the few days to ten well can i open my present now alison asked eagerly without waiting for my reply she tore off the silver wrapping paper her eyes widening with delight when she saw what was inside a wallet oh thats so great i need a wallet howd you know that i laughed picturing the loose bills that were always tumbling around inside her purse we are just so tuned in to each other dont you think alison stated more than asked turning the honeycolored leather wallet over in her hands caressing its smooth sides its amazing dont you think i think its a very nice wallet lance said terry is obviously a woman of impeccable taste was he being sarcastic i couldnt tell i should go i turned toward the door youll come with us for dinner wont you alison asked i dont think so im not very hungry you guys go get reacquainted okay alison agreed reluctantly but only if you promise to spend the day with us tomorrow tomorrow i know youre not working tomorrow and i want to show lance all around delray you dont need me for that yeah i do please it wont be the same without you you know its pointless to argue lance said with a laugh he was right and we all knew it you have to come alison persisted please itll be so fun please please say youll at least think about it ill think about it i said of course in the end i agreed to go what other choice did i have its pointless to say that i was being dangerously naive even reckless that i was deluding myself into thinking that everything was going to be all right that alison and her brother were exactly the people they represented themselves to be ive said all these things to myself and much more besides but i continued to rationalize my doubts away i convinced myself alison was sincere in her reasons for not telling me shed been fired and that of course shed had nothing to do with any money that might be missing from the gallery and what of the conversation id overheard at the cottage door i told you to let me handle this handle what im just here to help i dont need your help i know what im doing what did it mean nothing i assured myself that night alison and her brother could have been talking about anything what selfconscious paranoia made me think their conversation had anything to do with me not everything was about me as my mother might have said whatever alison and her brother had been arguing about probably didnt concern me at all handle what i was too tired to try figuring it out and the truth was i didnt want to i didnt want to believe that alison was anything other than the beautiful free spirit whod brought magic into my otherwise mundane existence why would i assume she had ulterior motives or that she might be planning anything sinister why couldnt her brothers visit be as unexpected and spontaneous as they claimed so i made a conscious decision to ignore the warning bells that were jingling like mad in my head much like the bells alison had hung from our doors i rationalized away my instincts reminded myself that lance palmay would be gone in a few days scolded myself for being so suspicious so uptight then i made a cup of tea and carried it into the living room where i curled up on the sofa with a new book the white lights of the christmas tree winking behind me the smell of pine needles competing with the aroma of white oleander i took a sip of the soothingly hot liquid read a few pages read them again when they failed to register then slowly drifted off to sleep the book slipping from my hands to the floor as old ghosts rushed toward me from the darkness and distant voices whispered in my ears in my dream i was kissing roger stillman in the backseat of his old red thunderbird his hands groping me under my sweater and skirt a succession of increasingly loud moans escaped his lips as he triumphantly rolled my panties down over my hips and climbed on top of me are you wearing a rubber i asked him feeling my flesh tear as he pushed his way roughly inside me i cried out opening my eyes eyes that had been tightly closed throughout most of our encounter and thats when i saw the policeman staring at us through the car window his flashlight illuminating the careless sprinkling of dark hairs across the top of rogers bare buttocks i screamed but roger continued humping away like an unwelcome dog on a human leg any leg any human i realized pushing him off me watching him effortlessly morph into alisons brother lance palmay could you step out of the car please the police officer directed and roger lance complied with an easy smile i struggled with my clothing trying to push my skirt down over the panties twisted around my knees but the policeman was already climbing into the backseat assuming rogers former position on top of me his flashlight directed at my eyes so that i couldnt see his face his large penis pushing its way toward my mouth youve been a bad girl he was saying in josh wylies soothing baritone im going to have to tell your mother please dont do that i begged as his monstrous organ forced my lips apart please dont tell my mother tell me what my mother asked suddenly materializing on the seat beside me which is when i woke up well that was fun i muttered my heart pounding as i looked around the room dark except for the flickering white lights of the tree behind me i checked my watch discovered id been sleeping for several hours which meant id probably be up half the night i rolled my head back letting it drop lazily from one shoulder to the other and waited for my heartbeat to return to normal i realized with equal amounts of shame and surprise that the dream had excited me in spite of its peculiarities in spite of my mother or maybe because of her i marveled at the appearance of roger stillman in my dream i didnt think id ever dreamed about him before even during the heat of what might have been described rather generously as our relationship and why the link to alisons brother yes they were both tall and goodlooking but so what my subconscious had obviously intuited a deeper connection even if my conscious mind had yet to determine what that connection might be i wiped a trickle of perspiration from the side of my neck massaged the tenderness at my shoulders my hand falling across my breast the way roger stillmans hand had done my nipples hardening at the memory of his fingers reaching underneath my blouse to unhook the clasp at the front of my bra i felt my bare breasts rush into his waiting hands recalled the way he fumbled with my pliant flesh manipulating it like cookie dough his eager mouth sucking on my nipples as ferociously as a starving infant i remembered my mothers barely concealed disgust each time she looked at my maturing body as if my breasts were a deliberate act of rebellion on my part something for which i should be duly ashamed go away mother i whispered now lying back on the sofa recalling how clumsily roger had pulled on the zipper of my pants before pushing his hand down the front of my panties i thought of joshs hands imagined his fingers in place of rogers felt them dancing around my most secret folds before disappearing inside me i cried out my own fingers unable to follow my minds lead to provide my body the relief it craved instead i flipped onto my stomach and pressed myself against the hard edge of the sofa its soft pillows muffling my embarrassed cries my body shaking with a series of mild convulsions instantly my mothers shame swept over me i pushed myself to my feet and looked around halfexpecting my mother to be sitting in one of the queen anne chairs watching me as she had watched me in my dream but the room was mercifully empty of ghosts i walked to the window stared out at the street watched large palm leaves dance in the shadows of the tall streetlight i pressed my head against the glass clasping my hands tightly behind my back i caught a flicker of movement across the street a shadow where before had been nothing was someone there dear god had anyone seen me someones always watching my mother admonished as i rushed to the front door threw it open and stared into the night bettye mccoy and her two idiot dogs were rounding the corner and coming this way i watched them approach totally oblivious to my presence in the darkened doorway she was wearing a pair of tight blue jeans and a cropped red sweater with matching red heels a red headband held her thick blond hair in place like an aging and surgically enhanced alice in wonderland i thought cruelly listening to her heels click against the pavement as she was pulled along by her two dogs of course the dogs stopped every few seconds to sniff at each and every bush repeatedly lifting their legs to mark their territory just do your business and move on i thought watching in growing dismay as one of the dogs suddenly spun around and lifted his rump into the air dropping several unwelcome deposits in the middle of the sidewalk at the end of my walkway i waited for bettye mccoy to scoop the droppings into her waiting plastic bag but instead she only smirked then tucked the empty bag back inside her jeans pocket before walking away i reacted without thinking excuse me i ran down the front path stopping just short of the neat pile of fresh excrement excuse me i called again when bettye mccoy failed to take notice her dogs began to bark and pull at their leashes im sorry bettye mccoy said reluctantly turning around were you addressing me do you see anyone else is there something i can do for you bettye mccoy arched one disdainful eyebrow you can clean up after your dogs i always clean up after my dogs not tonight you didnt i pointed at the small pile of dog feces by my feet my dogs didnt do that i could scarcely believe my ears what are you talking about i watched him do it i pointed at the smaller of the two white dogs who looked as if he were in danger of strangling on his leash its not corkys bettye mccoy insisted corky didnt do it i was standing right in the doorway i saw the whole thing corky didnt do it look why dont you just admit your dog did it clean it up and be on your way dont treat me like an idiot you are an idiot bettye mccoy muttered not quite under her breath i couldnt believe my ears what did you say i said youre an idiot bettye mccoy repeated brazenly first you chase poor cedric out of your yard with a broom and now you accuse corky of pooping on your precious sidewalk you know what you need dont you suppose you tell me get a man lady and stop picking on my dogs keep them off my property or ill lay them flat i countered our voices bouncing off the trees echoing through the leaves from out of the corner of my eye i saw alison and her brother walking up the street terry alison rushed to my side whats going on here lance asked trying to keep the bemusement in his eyes from spreading to the rest of his face the womans a lunatic bettye mccoy shouted already in retreat she wouldnt clean up after her dog i said understanding how hopeless i must sound her dog did this lance pointed to the dog feces hed narrowly missed stepping in i nodded then watched in shock as he scooped the offending dog poo into his hands then hurled it with stunning accuracy at bettye mccoys head it splattered against her blond hair clinging to the back of her head like mud bettye mccoy stopped her shoulders rising around her ears as she spun around to face us her face mirroring the openmouthed amazement of my own you better close your mouth lance warned there might be more youre all crazy bettye mccoy stammered backing up and getting entwined in the dogs leashes almost losing her balance then bursting into tears all of you we watched as she extricated herself from the dogs leashes a small turd dropping from her hair to her right shoulder then falling toward the ground landing on the toe of one red shoe a final outraged squeal escaped bettye mccoys lips as she kicked off her shoes gathered one yapping dog under each arm then ran to the end of the block and disappeared think shell call the police alison asked oh i dont think shed want to chance this story making the rounds i looked at lance who was grinning like the proverbial cheshire cat had he really picked up a dog turd with his bare hands and hurled it at my tormentor my hero i thought with a laugh thank you anytime we returned to the house in silence how was dinner i asked before i went inside not nearly as exciting as what was going on here alison said god i cant leave you alone for a minute speaking of which have you decided about tomorrow i smiled then laughed out loud what time do you want me to be ready lance knocked on my kitchen door at ten minutes after noon the following day he was all in black i was all in white we looked like opposing pawns on a chessboard i thought you said eleven oclock i said trying to keep my mother out of my voice slept in he said without apology you ready to go wheres alison still in bed migraine oh no is she all right should be fine in a few hours a verbal minimalist i decided watching his eyes swallow my kitchen whole i better go check not necessary lance grabbed my floppy straw bag from the kitchen table slung it over my shoulder alison instructed me to take you to lunch said shell join us as soon as she can stand up straight i think i should check on her first i protested remembering how sick alison had been with her last migraine but lance was already ushering me out the door guiding me away from the cottage and around the side of the house shell be fine he said giving my elbow an extra squeeze as we reached the street stop worrying i just dont feel right about going come on itll give us a chance to get better acquainted i looked up and down the sunsoaked street shadows like puddles spilled across the road from the high trees waves of heat like ocean surf rolled up from the pavement several houses down a large snowy egret stood straight and still as stone on a manicured front lawn anywhere in mind the everglades what just joking natures not my thing thought wed try elwoods we can walk and we dont have to worry about snakes dont be too sure elwoods was a converted filling station turned biker hangout that specialized in barbecue and elvis memorabilia it was located on atlantic avenue several blocks west of the lorelli gallery how do you know about elwoods alison pointed it out last night thought it looked interesting i shrugged recalling the last time id been to elwoods had been with erica hollander i was about to suggest an alternative but i decided against it instinctively understanding that to argue with alisons brother would be as pointless as arguing with alison herself taking no for an answer was clearly not a family trait its unusual to be this hot in december i remarked idly as we fell into step beside one another the heat wrapping itself around my shoulders like a scratchy shawl but lance wasnt paying attention his eyes flitting restlessly from one side of the street to the other as if half expecting someone to jump out at us from behind a neatly trimmed hedge looking for anything in particular what kind of tree is that he asked suddenly his finger brushing against the tip of my nose as he pointed to the squat palm tree in the middle of my neighbors front yard looks like it has a bunch of penises hanging from it i beg your pardon lance bounded across my neighbors lawn kneeling beside the tree in question and pointed at the numerous protuberances of various lengths that hung from its trunk you dont think they look like a bunch of uncircumcised dicks take a good look youre crazy reluctantly i rolled my eyes toward the tree oh my god youre right lance laughed so loud he startled the nearby egret who soared gracefully into the air like a giant paper plane aint nature grand theyre called screw palms i whispered what you heard me youre kidding me right honestly thats their name screw palms i couldnt possibly make up something like that lance shook his head grabbed my elbow picked up the pace of our walk come on he said laughing all this talk about screwing is making me hungry you should have seen this city twenty years ago i was saying between bites of my hamburger half these storefronts were vacant the school system was a disaster race relations were a mess about the only business that was doing well was the drug trade really it was the first time since id started my verbal tour of delray that lance had shown any real interest and hows the drug trade doing these days he asked surveying the line of motorcycles parked outside the large front patio where we were sitting i mean where would a person go if he were interested in such things jail most likely i said as lances lips curled into a grudging smile cute youre very cute my turn to smile cute had never been a word used to describe me we watched a middleaged man whose ragged gray ponytail extended halfway down the back of his black leather jacket as he wiggled his sagging gut between two chairs grandpas on wheels i thought taking another bite of my burger wondering how anyone could wear leather in this heat now of course the citys completely changed and what changed it exactly i paused trying to choose between the short and long answers deciding on the short money lance laughed ah yes money makes the world go round i thought it was love thats because youre a hopeless romantic i am youre not maybe i admitted squirming under his sudden scrutiny maybe i am a romantic dont forget hopeless he reached across the table and peeled several sweatdampened hairs away from my forehead with a gentle but confident hand as if he were teasing a bra strap off my shoulder i lowered my gaze to the table the tips of lances fingers lingering on my flesh even after hed removed his hand what about you he lifted a saucecoated sparerib from his plate to his mouth tearing the meat off with one neat tug well he said with a wink i love money does that qualify i took a sip of my beer held the icecold glass against my throat trying to ignore the perspiration trickling into the deep vee of my white tshirt wow would you look at those babies lance exclaimed and i saw that lances attention had been captured by the two shiny black motorcycles with chromeplated monkeyhanger handlebars that had just pulled up in front of the restaurant arent they beauties harleydavidsons i asked pulling out the only brand with which i was familiar trying to sound interested lance shook his head yamaha cc viragos he punctuated his sentence with an appreciative whistle you obviously know a lot about motorcycles a bit he raised another barbecued rib to his lips then slowly and meticulously stripped it bare i thought of alison she would have polished off those ribs in a heartbeat maybe we should call alison see how shes doing lance patted his cell phone which lay on the table next to his plate she knows my number its been over an hour shell call i rubbed the back of my neck the sweat coating my fingers like shellac has your family been very worried about her he shrugged nah they pretty much know what to expect by now which is alisons gonna do what alisons gonna do no point arguing no point getting in her face about it but you obviously felt concerned enough to fly down here and see for yourself just checking to make sure shes okay i mean she comes to florida doesnt know a soul she knew rita bishop i said recalling the name of alisons friend who rita bishop i wondered if i had the name correct lance looked confused although he tried to hide it by tearing into another rib oh yeah rita whatever happened to her anyway i realized id forgotten to ask personnel to find out where shed gone i dont know alison couldnt locate her typical lance released a deep breath of air its hot he said as if noticing the temperature for the first time i think its sweet that you were concerned about your sister i didnt think you were that close close enough to worry he shrugged an increasingly familiar gesture what can i say maybe im a romantic after all i couldnt help but smile i liked lance for worrying about alisons welfare its nice you could take the time off work no problem when youre selfemployed what is it you do i tried to remember if alison had ever mentioned her brothers occupation lance looked surprised by the question he coughed ran his hand through his hair systems analyst he said so quietly i almost didnt hear him my turn to be surprised they teach that sort of thing at brown brown alison said you graduated summa cum laude he laughed coughed a second time long time ago a lot of beer under the bridge since then he hoisted his mug into the space between us finished what was left in his glass and swiveled around in his chair looking for the waiter you ready for another one my own mug was still halffull im fine for the moment another draft lance called to a bald and heavily tattooed waiter resting against the far wall fear was stamped in large blue letters along his right forearm no man was imprinted on the other charming i thought noticing a man nursing a beer at a small round table in the corner a red bandanna wrapped around his forehead like a bloodsoaked strip of gauze long calloused fingers stroked a beard that was dark and scruffy the man was staring at me i realized thinking there was something disturbingly familiar about him trying to remember if and when id seen him before hows your burger lance asked swatting a buzzing insect away from his head as he squinted into the sunlight its fine just fine my ribs were fantastic im thinking of ordering another pound i glanced at his empty plate are you serious im always serious about what i put in my mouth his tongue lapped some errant sauce from his upper lip was he flirting with me or was the heat starting to affect my brain should have worn a hat i could almost hear my mother say i looked away my eyes pulled back toward the man with the red bandanna he cocked his head to one side then raised his beer mug in a silent toast as if hed been expecting me to look his way again where had i seen him before so tell me what you think of my baby sister lance instructed as the waiter approached with his beer lance gulped at its large head chewed it as if it were solid food i think shes great she involved with anyone special these days not to my knowledge she tell you about her exhusband just that he was a mistake lance laughed shook his head you dont agree seemed like a nice enough guy to me but hey what do i know shes the one who lived with him although alison doesnt always know whats good for her he added his face darkening as a cloud passed by overhead i dont think i agree with that i dont think you know alison as well as i do maybe not i conceded deciding to shift the focus of the conversation away from alison what about you any sweet young thing on the horizon not really lance allowed a slow smile to creep across his lips actually ive always had a thing for older women i laughed you should drop by the hospital one day ill introduce you to some of my patients lance stretched his neck back over the top of his spine and poured half his beer down his throat so whats the story on this guy who sings here every thursday night he asked as if this were the most logical of followups i glanced at the large cardboard cutout of a las vegasstyled elvis impersonator long sideburns rhinestonestudded white jumpsuit flowing cape classic karate pose that greeted patrons at the door to the restaurants interior hes a delray policeman believe it or not is he any good very good id heard him the time i was here with erica i gasped suddenly realizing where id seen the man with the red bandanna before id seen him with erica hollander my eyes shot toward the corner of the patio but the man was no longer there something wrong lance asked signaling the waiter for another half order of ribs and two more beers clearly we werent going anywhere anytime soon will you excuse me a minute i was already out of my chair and heading for the washrooms at the back of the restaurant before he could answer i needed to splash some cold water on my face the heat was definitely getting to me the interior of the restaurant was soothingly dark and while not exactly cold considerably cooler than outside i passed the large bar its barstools constructed from the old hoists of the former gas station most people ate outside but a few wooden tables hugged by leatherette furniture were scattered around the room for those who preferred not to see what they were eating the pig place people called elwoods with affection i wondered as i brushed by another potbellied biker if they were referring to the menu or the clientele i spent the next few minutes in the washroom trying to convince myself that my mind was playing tricks on me that the heat plus my overly active imagination had deceived me into thinking that the man with the red bandanna and scruffy goatee was anything but an overly familiar stereotype of course i didnt know him of course id never seen him with erica except even as i was trying to convince myself i was seeing bogeymen who didnt exist i knew the truth that i had seen the man before seen him with erica and not just once but several times and not only here i realized as a series of suppressed images assaulted my already spinning brain but much closer to home hadnt i seen him coming out of the cottage on several mornings with his arm around ericas waist hadnt i heard the unmistakable sounds of a motorcycle disappearing down the middle of a darkened street on several evenings and did the fact he was back mean erica was back as well i sprinkled water on my neck dabbed a few drops behind my ears as if it were perfume stared at myself in the grimy mirror over the sink my mother stared back dear god i said out loud realizing how much her features were starting to intrude upon my own except for the eyes in the back of her head i thought ruefully remembering her terrifying admonition when i was a little girl theres no point in trying to fool me shed warned i see everything i have eyes in the back of my head too bad i hadnt inherited those i thought returning to the patio my table was empty and i looked around for lance i saw the man with the red bandanna first he was standing by the row of motorcycles parked along the curb one hand resting on a pair of steel handlebars and he and lance were having an obviously serious conversation i watched the man lean forward to whisper something in lances ear before climbing on his bike and backing out into traffic acknowledging me with a barely perceptible nod of his head lance remained where he was as still as the cardboardimitation elvis his fists clenched tightly at his sides what was that about i asked when lance returned to the table what was what about that guy you were talking to what about him how do you know him i dont know him lances eyes squinted into the sunlight you were talking to him im a friendly guy dont play games with me lance what kind of games lance leaned back in his seat ran his tongue along his lower lip look that guy you were talking to is bad news he was involved with my previous tenant i think hes been phoning me i said realizing this was true you think you dont know lance looked amused im not sure i backpedaled beginning to doubt my instincts sorry sweetheart i dont have a clue what youre talking about why were you talking to him why is it so important what were you talking about i pressed my voice rising in frustration hey lance said softly his hand reaching across the table to stroke my arm no need to get upset it was nothing i was just telling him how much i liked his bike thats all it was you okay i nodded somewhat mollified already i was starting to feel foolish about my outburst lance picked up his cell phone time to give alison a call alison joined us at elwoods within minutes of lances call her migraine blissfully vanquished those pills you gave me were a godsend she told me repeatedly looking radiant in her blue sundress as she simultaneously wolfed down an order of spareribs and chewed on a mouthful of french fries i marveled that she managed to do so with such grace i also marveled that her headache had had no effect on her appetite indeed she seemed in better shape than i did are you okay she asked me as lance was settling the bill me im fine youre so quiet terry thought she saw some guy who was involved with her last tenant lance interjected really who i shook my head it probably wasnt him must be the heat i demurred now almost convinced id been mistaken its a scorcher all right alison looked around the patio still crowded at almost three oclock okay so where should we go now i suggested a visit to the morikami museum and japanese gardens something i thought would be both soothing and interesting but alison said she wasnt in the mood for museums and lance reiterated that nature wasnt his thing so instead we went for a long walk along the intracoastal waterway and took a boat ride on the ramblin rose ii then sat on the seawall at twilight and watched the bridge as it opened for a small parade of magnificent yachts on their way to the bahamas did you know that alligators move really fast alison asked later apropos of nothing at all as we strolled along seventh avenue heading for home and that if youre ever being chased by one you should run in a zigzag because alligators can only move in a straight line ill keep that in mind i said whats the difference between alligators and crocodiles lance asked crocs are nastier alison said with the sweetest of smiles she stretched her arms toward the sky as if reaching for the full moon that dangled precariously overhead im starving you just ate i reminded her that was hours ago im famished come on lets go to bostons im game lance said you two go im exhausted come on terry you cant poop out on us now sorry alison i have to be up really early in the morning what i need now is a cup of herbal tea a soothing bubble bath and my nice comfortable bed let terry go lance urged his sister softly did you have a good time alison stared at me expectantly the fat yellow moon reflected in eyes as eager as a childs three words yes i answered truthfully dismissing any lingering concerns about the man in the red bandanna id done my best to forget about him during the long afternoon but like a bad penny he kept popping up yes yes yes i said banishing his image altogether alison wrapped me in a tight embrace several loose tendrils of her hair tickling my cheek sneaking between my lips see you later alligator she said kissing my forehead in a while crocodile i answered back watching them until they turned the corner and were swallowed by the night i could hear alison laughing in the dark and i wondered briefly what she found so amusing the echo of her laughter pursued me down the street bouncing off my back like sharpened stones whats the difference between alligators and crocodiles lance had asked crocs are nastier alison had replied my house was in total darkness normally i leave at least one light on but lance had ushered me out so quickly id obviously forgotten proceeding cautiously my eyes scanning the ground in case bettye mccoy had returned with the dogs from hell i zigzagged up my front path mindful of hungry alligators that might have strayed dangerously off course feeling both relieved and foolish foolishly relieved i unlocked the front door and flicked on the light switch my eyes sweeping across the sofa the queen anne chairs the painting of peonies on the wall beside the window the christmas tree in the corner the numerous presents beneath it the daunting parade of santas and reindeer and elves alison had lovingly assembled merry christmas everybody i said locking the door behind me and heading for the kitchen and an especially merry christmas to you dear ladies i greeted the sixtyfive china heads regarding me with indifferent eyes i trust you were good little girls while i was away i filled the kettle with water made myself a cup of gingerpeach tea and carried it up the stairs to the bathroom where i stripped naked and poured myself a bath i climbed inside and leaned my head against the cool enamel jasminescented bubbles covering me like a blanket i remembered how once when i was a little girl my mother had found me in the tub my legs akimbo the water lapping against the insides of my thighs as i giggled with childish abandon the spanking id received that night was worse than any other shed administered over the years partly because i was soaking wet and partly because i had no idea why i was being punished i kept begging her to tell me what id done wrong but my mother never said a word to this day i can feel the sting of her fingers on my bare buttocks like the bite of thousands of tiny wasps my wet skin a magnifying glass reflecting and enlarging my pain and humiliation more than anything i remember the sound of those slaps as they resonated against my bare bottom then ricocheted off the walls even now there are nights when i close my eyes to sleep that i hear it i shook my head free of such unpleasant thoughts and slid down in the tub dragging my head under the waters surface my hair floating around my head like seaweed immediately another unpleasant memory attached itself to the insides of my closed eyelids three little grayandwhite kittens abandoned strays id found shivering in a corner of our garage all mangy and mewing and probably riddled with ringworm as my mother had proclaimed before wresting them from my arms and drowning them in a pail of water in the backyard i tried unsuccessfully not to see the kittens as i lay in the tub an inch of water covering my face like a shroud what was the matter with me why was my mother so much in my thoughts these days it seemed that ever since alisons arrival my mother had once again taken up residence in not only the house but my brain probably it was all the questions alison asked the photographs wed looked through together they were responsible for my strange dreams these unscheduled trips down memory lane i hadnt thought of those damn kittens in years why now for gods sake hadnt i made peace with my mother during those long awful days of her illness hadnt she begged my forgiveness hadnt i gratefully bestowed it my mother was such a formidable presence although im at a loss to say exactly why at only five feet two inches tall it was hardly her physical stature that made her so imposing indeed her disproportionately large bosom gave her a pigeonlike shape that was almost comic and her features were surprisingly small and nondescript i think what truly set her apart was the way she carried herself proud shoulders rigid stubborn head held high so that her tiny upturned nose always seemed to be looking down at you from a great height that posture infused all aspects of her life she was definite in her opinions even on subjects she knew little about her temper was quick her tongue sharp i learned early that there was no point in trying to press my side of things that only one side mattered certainly my father was rarely consulted if he had any opinions he kept them to himself id learned early to count on him for nothing and in that way he never disappointed me if he had any regrets they died with him my mother became even angrier after my father died lashing out at me at the slightest provocation youre a stupid stupid girl i can still hear her shout whenever ive done something particularly foolish later of course when age rounded those stubborn shoulders and infirmity softened her more abrasive edges she became gradually less formidable less selfrighteous less prone to poisonous outbursts or maybe she just became less after her stroke my mother literally shrank to half her former size and a strange thing happened in becoming less she became more as the architect mies van der rohe might have said more tolerant more grateful more vulnerable her shadow shrank to something approximating human size you know that everything i did i did for your benefit she said often in those last months of her life i know that i told her of course i know that i didnt mean to be cruel i know its the way i was raised my mother was the same with me you were a good mother i said i made a lot of mistakes we all make mistakes can you forgive me of course i forgive you i kissed the flaky dry skin of her forehead youre my mother i love you i love you too she whispered or maybe she didnt maybe i just wanted to hear her say the words so badly that i imagined she said them why was she returning to haunt me now i pushed my head above the waters surface felt the tiny soap bubbles evaporating on my skin was there something she was trying to tell me was she trying to warn me to protect me in death the way she never had during her lifetime protect me from what i pulled the plug with my toes listening as the water gulped its way musically down the drain it took a moment for me to become aware of other sounds another moment for me to understand exactly what those sounds were bells i realized hearing a downstairs door open and close as my heart slid down the drain with the last of the bubbles someone was in the house i stepped softly from the tub gathering my robe around me as i stretched over to lock the bathroom door but the lock had been broken for the better part of a year and the closest thing i had to a weapon was the blunt blade of a disposable razor i might have laughed had i not been so terrified hello is someone there i called as i peeked out the bathroom door and stepped into the hall alison is that you i waited for someone to respond my wet feet leaving footprints on the hardwood floor as i ventured to the top of the stairs alison lance is that you nothing was it possible id been mistaken i did a quick check of the bedrooms before inching my way down the stairs toward the living room halfexpecting someone to lunge out of the shadows with each step i took but no one lunged and nothing in the living room appeared to have been disturbed everything was in its proper place exactly as it had been earlier i jiggled the front door handle and breathed a deep sigh of relief at finding the door securely locked hello i called again as i headed toward the kitchen is anybody here but the kitchen was as empty as the rest of the house so now im hearing things i muttered my shoulders relaxing as i reached for the back door it fell open at my touch oh my god i stepped back in mounting horror as the warm night air pushed its way rudely inside the kitchen stay calm hadnt i just checked every room in the house and found nothing you didnt check the closets i heard alison say you didnt look under the bed youre a stupid stupid girl my mother added for good measure there are no such things as bogeymen i told them loudly deciding it was entirely possible id neglected to lock the back door when id left the house i pictured lance unapologetic and an hour late slipping my purse over my shoulder and ushering me outside his hand on my elbow i hadnt turned on any lights and i hadnt locked the kitchen door i didnt lock the door i informed the rows of ladies heads i didnt lock the door i repeated locking it now laughing at my foolishness there are no such things as bogeymen the phone rang dont you know its dangerous to leave your door unlocked the voice asked before i had a chance to say hello you never know who might drop by i spun around my hand sweeping across the counter and knocking against the block of knives i pulled the largest of the knives out of its slot waved it in the air like a flag who is this sweet dreams terry take care of yourself hello hello damn it who is this i slammed the phone back into its cradle then immediately picked it up again punched in emergency a womans voice stated after several minutes on hold well its not exactly an emergency i qualified this is maam if its not an emergency you should call your local police station well im not sure exactly maam is this an emergency or isnt it no i admitted lowering the knife to my side please call your local police station if you have a problem thank you ill do that except i didnt what was i going to say after all that i suspected someone had broken into my house except that id left the door unlocked and nothing had been taken that id received a vaguely menacing call from an anonymous man whose words on their surface were decidedly more solicitous than threatening dont you know its dangerous to leave your door unlocked you never know who might drop by sweet dreams take care of yourself sure that would bring the police running i returned the phone to its cradle and sank into a kitchen chair trying to decide my next move should i call the police anyway risk their derision or worse their indifference if only i had something more concrete to offer them to prove i wasnt some lonely middleaged woman with a too active imagination and way too much time on her hands if only i was sure about the voice on the other end of the phone i played the words back in my head like a recording sweet dreams terry take care of yourself but while there was something familiar about the speaker i couldnt be sure it belonged to ericas biker friend the man id seen talking to lance at elwoods the seriousness of their expressions indicative of more than a shared interest in motorcycles was there some connection between the two men between lance and erica between erica and alison was it just a coincidence these phone calls had started around the time alison had turned up on my doorstep what the hell was going on and then i saw him he was standing outside the kitchen window his forehead pressed against the windowpane the red of his bandanna bleeding into the glass oh my god and then as suddenly as his image had appeared it vanished absorbed by the night like a blotter had i seen anyone at all i rushed to the window peered out at the night i saw nothing no one i rifled through a kitchen drawer for the spare set of keys to the cottage youre a stupid stupid girl my mother admonished and for once i had to agree with her but i needed some answers and those answers could very well be found in alisons journal i estimated i had at least half an hour before alison and her brother returned home more than enough time if i moved quickly clutching the keys tightly i threw open the door and stepped outside my bare feet slipping into the night air like a pair of slippers are you crazy what are you doing i mumbled as i locked the door behind me and approached the cottage hand extended key pointing at the lock i was almost at the door when i heard a twig snap behind me i gasped spun around hi there a disembodied voice said from the darkness slowly almost magically a man materialized out of nothing to take shape in my backyard with deliberate care he stepped into the moons spotlight he was tall skinny cleanshaven there was no scraggly beard no red bandanna remember me kc i whispered short for kenneth charles but nobody ever hell you know the rest what are you doing here i came to see alison shes not home really then where are you going i slipped the key to the cottage into the side pocket of my robe wondering if hed noticed i thought i heard something i was just checking to make sure everything was all right i wondered why i was bothering to explain myself to someone i barely knew it was probably just me did you just phone me i asked my voice sharper than id intended kc produced a cell phone from his pocket smiled lazily was i supposed to you didnt answer my question no i didnt phone you his eyes narrowed are you okay im fine you seem a little on edge no i said forcing a yawn just a little tired i guess busy day i looked down realized my robe had fallen open i quickly secured the two sides of the robe together ignoring the growing smile on kcs face ill tell alison you stopped by if you dont mind i think ill wait till she gets back suit yourself i turned back toward the house terry he called after me i stopped turned around i just wanted to thank you again for the lovely thanksgiving dinner im glad you enjoyed it you dont find many people these days who are so willing to open their homes to strangers or so stupid i heard my mother say the key to the cottage weighing heavily in my pocket i was happy to do it again i turned toward the house terry he called a second time again i stopped although this time i didnt turn around take care of yourself he said as i stepped inside the house and locked the door behind me merry christmas alison jumped into the air at precisely the stroke of midnight clapping her hands with childish abandon merry christmas lance echoed clicking his glass of eggnog against alisons then mine god bless us everyone i added taking a tiny sip of the thick liquid pungent fumes of nutmeg swirling through my nostrils the evening had been pleasant filled with good food and happy chatter just the three of us no uninvited guests no apparitions in the glass no unexpected phone calls id asked alison about kc she claimed not to have seen or heard from him since thanksgiving when i told her about my encounter with him shed shrugged and said thats odd i wonder what he wanted ultimately i decided id probably blown the whole incident out of proportion and pushed it to the back of my mind wheres that from alison was asking now wheres what from what you just said god bless us everyone that sounds so familiar charles dickens i told her a christmas carol thats right lance said we saw the movie remember bill murray was in it you should read the book lance shrugged his indifference dont read much why is that not really interested lance had his fill of books at brown alison was quick to explain what does interest you i pressed lance glanced across the table at his sister before returning his attention to me you interest me i do yes lady you certainly do i laughed now youre mocking me on the contrary i find you fascinating it was my turn to glance at alison she seemed to be holding her breath and what exactly is it about me that fascinates you he shook his head im not sure exactly what is it they say about still waters running deep now i was the one holding my breath just that they do guess id like to be around when they get all churned up lance took another sip of eggnog the pale yellow cream creating a thin mustache across his upper lip he ran a lazy tongue across it his eyes fastened on mine i dont read nearly as much as i should alison piped in you dont read at all a flush of embarrassment stained alisons cheeks turning them almost the same color as her sweater maybe you could recommend some good books for me terry something to get me started again sure although i probably dont read as much as i should either we should all read more alison agreed theres lots of things we should do lance said cryptically name three i said and alison smiled although the smile was tentative as if she was afraid of what her brother might say we should stop procrastinating lance said procrastinating alison repeated with a strained laugh good word procrastinating over what i asked lance ignored my question we should stop playing games what kind of games i asked watching the smile harden on alisons face we should shit or get off the pot lance finished the eggnog in his glass then tossed his napkin onto the table as if challenging his sister to a duel am i missing something here alison leaped to her feet speaking of getting off the pot can we open the presents now she was in the living room and at the tree before i could answer open this one first she was saying holding a small gift bag toward me as i approached its from me its just little i thought we could start with the small gifts first save the best ones for last i carefully withdrew a small crystal rock from its tissue its a paperweight i thought it was so pretty i think its lovely thank you i sat down next to alison on the floor my mind still on our previous exchange procrastinating over what what kind of games as i ran my fingers along the jagged pink surface of the crystal i love it really its beautiful i motioned toward a small square box wrapped in red and green your turn eager hands tore at the wrapping paper what is it open it and find out this is so exciting isnt this so exciting alison discarded the last of the paper and ripped open the box would you just look at this lance look nail polish six bottles all in fabulous colors be still my heart lance said from the sofa vanilla milkshake mango madness wildflower these are so great use them well well do another spa day now that sounds like fun lance said can i come only if you let us paint your toes with mango madness i told him lady you can paint whatever part of my anatomy your little heart desires lance flopped over the sofa and joined us on the floor anything for me under there alison made a prolonged show of searching under the tree no im afraid it doesnt look like theres anything for you oh wait heres something she extended an oblong box wrapped in gold its a golf shirt she announced before the package was halfunwrapped its an extralarge because the salesman said they fit small what do you think do you think itll fit lance held the beigeandblack golf shirt against the navy one he was wearing looks good what do you think terry i think your sister has very good taste lance laughed first time shes ever been accused of that very funny alison pointed at the design that crisscrossed the lightweight fabric those are golf tees in case you didnt know looks like ill have to stick around lance said casually take up golf alison dropped her eyes to the floor heres something for terry she read the sticker glanced warily at her brother from lance she said with obvious surprise you didnt tell me you were buying terry a present what you think i was raised in a barn i opened the gift my hands trembling with the knowledge i hadnt bought anything for him inside was a long lilaccolored nightgown its lace bodice scooped provocatively low oh my alison said its silk its lovely but i really cant accept something like this i said in my mothers voice totally inappropriate i heard her agree what are you talking about of course you can why dont you try it on right now model it for us lances fingers slipped under the long slit that ran up the side of the nightgown i shivered as if his hand were on my leg i think you should save it for when josh comes home alison said eyes still on her brother josh lance sat up straight his interest clearly piqued first im hearing of any josh hes a friend of terrys sounds like more than a friend his mother is one of my patients i qualified not really wanting to discuss josh with alisons brother wondering what josh was doing at that moment it was three hours earlier in california probably he was attending some big family dinner or maybe he was out doing some lastminute shopping did he miss me had he thought about me at all whats the matter with his mother i pictured myra wylie asleep in her narrow hospital bed everything i said sadly lance shrugged she exceeded her expiration date did she what lance thinks people should be stamped with a best before date you know like dairy products i laughed in spite of myself you ever consider pulling the plug on some of these people what i think youd be doing most of them a favor and yourself too come to think of it now youve really lost me well im just thinking out loud here but i bet you get pretty close to some of these lonely old biddies am i right i nodded not sure where this conversation was going and a few of them probably have a little something stashed away lance continued i bet it wouldnt be that difficult to get them to include you in their wills have them sign over the bulk of their estates to you their humble caregiver then after a suitable period of time enough so as not to arouse undue suspicion you just give nature a little push you know a stray air bubble in their iv an extra dose of something to help them sleep hell i dont have to tell you youre the nurse youd know exactly how to do it wouldnt you i looked for the familiar mischievous twinkle in his eyes but he stared back at me with eyes as cold and humorless as a corpses was he serious what do you think terry he pressed sounds like a plan to me i think plans like that are the reason our jails are so overcrowded lance is just kidding alison said am i is money really so important to you its pretty important so important youd actually consider taking someones life guess that would depend lance is just joking alison interrupted again enough lance terry doesnt understand your sense of humor i think she understands me very well its my turn to open another present alison said pulling a gift from under the tree with such force she almost knocked the whole thing over look its from denise where is denise these days i asked as eager as alison to move on shes spending christmas with her folks up north but shell be back in time for new years speaking of which i guess we should start making plans for new years eve im working new years eve i told her youre not im afraid so but its the start of a whole new year i cant believe youre working its not fair i laughed open your present alison quietly unwrapped her gift and held out a pair of pink heartshaped earrings i couldnt help but wonder if denise had paid for them or simply helped herself to more of her aunts inventory alison said nothing she closed the small cardboard box and lowered it to the floor dont you like them theyre very nice poor alisons all upset because you wont be celebrating new years eve with us im just disappointed dont be its just another night i said although i didnt really believe it hadnt i been equally disappointed when josh had announced hed be out of town i just realized i forgot to put lances present under the tree i scrambled to my feet ran into the kitchen retrieved the bag with the ballpoint pen id originally intended for josh what the hell id buy him something better something more personal then headed back to the living room whats the matter with you i heard alison hiss as i approached lighten up lance said what are you trying to pull im just having fun with her i dont like it relax im warning you is that an ultimatum because we both know how much i love ultimatums here it is i said announcing my presence before i walked back into the room lance reached across the top of the sofa to take the small bag dangling from my fingers just what i wanted he said without a trace of irony as he extricated the thick black pen from its layers of tissue thank you terry im touched he stood up walked around the sofa and extended his hand i took it expecting a small handshake of gratitude but instead he pulled me toward him bringing his face so close to mine i tasted his breath in my mouth i turned my cheek but it was almost as if hed anticipated my reaction and he turned with me catching me fully on the lips what are you doing i asked attempting a smile but breaking away the taste of him lingering he looked surprised as if he had no idea what i was talking about had he thought i wouldnt notice its a great pen he said okay you guys alison called theres still lots to go here my turn its always your turn lance resumed his place on the sofa alison pulled a baseball cap with a logo from the houston astros out of a bag without examining the card look its from kc isnt that sweet she put the hat on her head he dropped by this afternoon she explained before i had time to ask he told me he came over the other night to give it to me but i wasnt home she continued unprompted thats why he was here i nodded although i couldnt recall any gift in kcs hands what do you know about him i asked straining to sound casual not much why just curious he thinks you dont like him hes right why is that i dont trust him i guess seemed like a nice enough guy to me lance interjected i think hes nice too alison agreed name three things you like about him i challenged alison smiled lets see i like his accent kcs gentle texas twang slammed against my ears i like his eyes i hated kcs eyes i thought seeing them laughing at me through the darkness of the other night i like that he bought me a present what three things do you like about me lance asked suddenly turning to me im not sure i like anything about you at all he laughed although it was the truth and i think he knew that sure you do he insisted anyway think i cant no more presents till you come up with something okay i said giving up i like that you threw dog poop at bettye mccoy he laughed are you saying you like my spunk i think shes saying youre full of you know what alison corrected what else do you like lance asked ignoring his sister i like your taste in nightgowns i admitted watching my mother shake her head in the reflection from the front window you like the way i taste lance translated blue eyes dancing i shook my head declined comment i like your belt i said finally you like my belt its a very nice belt lance palmay glanced down at the black leather belt that was secured around his slender waist by a large silver buckle you like my belt he repeated wondrously anyone ever tell you that youre a very strange woman terry painter we opened the remainder of the gifts in relative silence a tshirt from me to alison a photograph album from alison to me some movie tickets a box of shortbread cookies a travel alarm clock a pair of fluffy pink slippers last one i said reaching under the tree and extricating a small package with a large white bow what is it alison looked almost afraid to open it i hope you like it i watched as she gently lifted off the bow and discarded the paper removing the lid from the top of the box i thought it was time for you to have a necklace of your own i said as she held up the thin gold necklace that spelled out her name tears formed in alisons eyes fell freely down her face silently she reached up and removed the heart necklace replacing it with the new one its beautiful ill never take it off i laughed but tears were in my own eyes as well alison suddenly got up and reached to the very back of the tree pulling out a long thin rectangular present wrapped in dark green paper its for you she said laying it across my lap even before i unwrapped it i knew what it was this is too much i whispered staring at the painting of a woman in a largebrimmed hat relaxing on a beach of pink sand this is way too much you like it dont you of course i like it i love it but its way too expensive i got my employee discount this was before i got canned of course we both laughed although we were crying too even so even so nothing it belongs here right here alison pointed to the blank space on the wall behind the sofa lancell help you hang it hes good at hanging stuff are you suggesting im well hung lance asked as he pushed himself to his feet lance but i barely heard them nobodys ever done anything like this for me before i whispered whatever reservations i harbored whatever questions remained unanswered whatever doubts still lingered they vanished in that instant me neither alison said stroking the gold at her neck then extending her arms toward me careful you two lance said i might get jealous alison ignored him wrapping me in an almost suffocating embrace i felt the wetness of her tears on my cheeks the pounding of her heart against my own at that moment it was impossible to tell where i left off and she began merry christmas terry she cried softly merry christmas alison merry christmas i called as i pushed open the door to myra wylies hospital room it was just past eight oclock in the morning and myra wylie was lying in her bed her head turned toward the window she made no move to turn around even as i closed the door behind me and cautiously approached holding my breath id been through this routine already twice this morning and both times had found myra wylie sleeping soundly i hadnt disturbed her how often did the poor woman get a good nights sleep anymore i remembered that my mothers last months had been marked by extreme restlessness shed tossed and turned in her bed all night hardly closing her eyes at all if christmas had managed to bring a measure of peace to myra wylies tortured existence then who was i to disturb her except that there was something different about her posture this morning something worrisome about the way her shoulders slumped against their covers something unsettling in the angle of her head myra i reached for the skeletal hand beneath the sheet praying for a pulse its all right she said her voice clear but dull as if it had been stripped of its natural shine by a harsh abrasive im not dead yet lance thinks people should be stamped with a best before date i heard alison say immediately i rushed around to the other side of the bed positioned myself directly in front of her and realized instantly that shed been crying myra whats the matter has something happened are you in pain whats wrong nothings wrong somethings obviously upset you she shrugged the tiny gesture upsetting her delicate equilibrium throwing her frail body into a series of exaggerated spasms i grabbed a glass of water from the night table extended the straw to her lips watched as she coaxed the tepid liquid into her mouth do you want me to call a doctor myra shook her head said nothing what is it you can tell me im just a silly old woman myra said really looking at me for the first time since id walked into the room she tried to smile but the attempt disappeared into a prolonged set of twitches that made her jaw quiver like a ventriloquists dummy no youre not i smoothed several fine wisps of hair more like threads really away from her forehead i think youre just feeling a little sorry for yourself thats all im a silly old woman i brought you a present i watched her eyes fill instantly with a childs delight were never too old for presents i thought pulling a small package out of the pocket of my uniform she struggled with the wrapping for several seconds then gave up and handed the present back to me you open it she instructed eagerly and i discarded the paper to reveal a pair of bright redandgreen christmas socks so your feet will stay nice and warm she brought her hand to her heart as pleased as if id brought her diamonds will you put them on for me it will be my pleasure i lifted up the bottom of the sheets felt her toes icecold against the palms of my hands hows that i asked slipping on first one sock then the other wonderful just wonderful merry christmas myra a shadow like a large palm frond passed across her face i dont have anything for you i wasnt expecting anything the shadow disappeared as quickly as it had come her eyes noticeably brightening i might have some money in my purse she nodded toward the end table you could take as much as you want buy yourself something nice from me i bet you get pretty close to some of these lonely old biddies i heard lance say i bet it wouldnt be too difficult to get them to include you in their wills have them sign over the bulk of their estates to you he was right i realized in that instant it wouldnt be difficult at all and once i had their money then what was i expected to sign over my own estate to alison was that the plan was i the lonely old biddy to whom hed been referring was i the real target here why not i had a home a cottage a retirement savings plan sounds like a plan to me i heard lance say everything is going exactly as planned i recalled alison telling her brother over the phone after thanksgiving what was the matter with me i wondered impatiently where were these thoughts coming from hadnt i made a conscious decision to banish such silliness from my mind terry myra was saying terry dear whats the matter instantly i snapped back into the here and now im sorry did you say something i asked if you could get my purse from the drawer myra josh took your purse home with him months ago dont you remember she shook her head dislodged several fresh tears you miss josh dont you thats why youre so depressed myra buried her cheek into the side of her pillow i miss him too i said trying to sound upbeat and cheerful but hell be back real soon she nodded i checked my watch its only five oclock in the morning in california im sure hes planning to phone you as soon as he wakes up he called last night he did thats great how is he fine hes fine myras voice was curiously flat as if someone had rolled over it with a tire myra are you sure youre okay does something hurt you nothing hurts youre here my feet are warm what more could i want how about a piece of marzipan i pulled a miniature marzipan banana out of my pocket oh i love marzipan how did you know one marzipan lover can always spot another i unwrapped the marzipan candy placed it between her lips felt her nibble at it like a squirrel its delicious her hand reached toward my face i leaned forward felt her fingers trembling against my cheek thank you dear anytime terry yes she lifted her mouth to my ear youve been so kind the daughter i never had youve been so kind i repeated silently back at her the mother i never had i want you to know how grateful i am for everything youve done for me i know i love you i love you too i whispered burying my tears in the soft threads of her silver hair there was a knock on the door and i turned halfexpecting to find josh standing there if this were the movies i thought then josh wylie would have flown in as a surprise gift for his mother on christmas morning he would have seen me standing beside her bed recognized me as the great love of his life and instantly dropped to his knees begging me to be his wife but as this wasnt the movies when i turned toward the knock i saw not a lovestruck suitor but an indifferent gumchewing orderly yes phone call for you at the nurses station for me are you sure beverley said to tell you it was important who would be calling me at work on christmas morning it had to be alison had something happened was anything wrong you go dear myra said ill see you later youre sure youre all right im always all right when youre around then ill be back before you know it i left the room and headed for the nurses station line two beverley said as soon as she saw me he said it couldnt wait he josh i wondered calling from san francisco to wish me a merry christmas to say he missed me to tell me he was coming home early or maybe lance i secondguessed calling to tell me thered been an accident that alison had been critically injured hello merry christmas merry christmas to you i repeated disappointed it wasnt josh relieved it wasnt lance erica sends her love says shes sorry she couldnt be with you for the holidays who are you i shouted unmindful of the people walking by enough is enough i dont know what your game is but terry beverley cautioned from somewhere beside me lifting a silencing finger to her mouth i dropped the receiver angrily into its cradle sorry i didnt mean to raise my voice who was that i dont know you dont know ive been getting these nuisance calls beverley nodded you dont have to tell me about those she said chubby fingers carelessly tapping the desk as she leafed through a small stack of patients files she was thricedivorced and at least twice her fighting weight her hair was too short too permed and too many shades of blond clearly this was a woman only comfortable with extremes possibly the reason for the three divorces i thought but then who was i to judge id always felt vaguely sorry for her now i wondered if she felt the same about me after my last divorce beverley was saying my exhusband called me fifty times a day fifty i changed my number four times didnt do any good i finally had to sic the police on him i guess i might have to do that kind of hard when you dont know who it is you have no idea a smiling trio appeared before my eyes lance and kc flanking the man with the red bandanna no i said too bad he sounded so sexy the way he said your name real slow kind of like he was purring i thought it might be you know someone special she shrugged returning her attention to the stack of papers in front of her probably just some stupid kid getting his jollies well if anybody else calls just tell him i dont know use your imagination dont worry ill think of something i heard her laughing as i walked down the hall no clear idea where i was headed until i found myself in front of sheena oconnors door i peeked inside saw her sitting up and talking animatedly on the phone i was about to withdraw when her voice stopped me no wait she waved me inside the room come in ill just be another minute while she finished her conversation i checked on the many flower arrangements and poinsettias that filled the room watering the several that were in dire need and silently counting the others stopping at fifteen we love you mom and dad merry christmas munchkin from aunt kathy and uncle steve way to go love annie i paused the longest at the two dozen longstemmed yellow roses recalling the roses josh had sent me for thanksgiving wondering if thered be a surprise bouquet waiting for me when i got home smells like a funeral parlor in here sheena laughed as she replaced the receiver she looks beautiful i thought brown eyes as soft as sable against the whiteness of her skin her face was still swollen from the beating shed received and her subsequent corrective surgery but the deep scratches around her mouth had faded into fine lines and the only sign her nose had been broken was a slight curvature to the left an imperfection i rather liked but one she probably wouldnt i think it smells nice i said truthfully i guess she nodded toward the phone that was my parents theyre on their way over with a truckful of presents i bet they are i just wish i could go home i would think youll be going home very soon youve made remarkable progress why dont you sit down sheena suggested talk to me for a while unless youre busy i pulled up a nearby chair plopped down into it im not busy how come youre working today doesnt your family mind they dont mind i said deciding sheena wasnt really interested in the details of my life story she was just making pleasant conversation as a way of passing the time before her own family arrived are you married she asked unexpectedly glancing at my bare ring finger i pictured josh his warm eyes and warmer lips i felt his mouth graze mine as his eyelids fluttered against my cheek yes i told her i am do you have any kids i bet you have lots of kids i have a daughter i heard myself say and almost gasped at my audacity what was i doing i tried picturing alison as she must have looked as a little girl shes older than you are just the one child just the one im surprised i would have thought youd have at least three really why just cause i think youd be a really good mother she smiled shyly i remember the way you sang to me how did that song go tooralooraloora i sang softly tooralooralie thats it it was so beautiful it was calling to me i stopped singing what was it like being in a coma i nodded she shook her head i guess it was like being asleep i dont really remember anything specific mostly voices off in the distance like if i was dreaming except there were no pictures and then the sound of someone singing you she said and smiled you brought me back do you remember anything about the attack a shiver swept the smile from sheenas face im sorry i apologized immediately i shouldnt have asked no thats all right sheena said quickly the police have asked me about it a hundred times i wish i had something to tell them but the truth is i dont remember a thing about the attack itself i just remember that i was lying in my backyard working on my tan my parents were out and my sister was at the beach i was waiting for a phone call this guy i liked at school so i didnt want to leave the house i stretched a blanket across the grass and lay down on my stomach i remember undoing the back of my bikini top its pretty secluded in my backyard i didnt think anyone could see me i was almost dozing off when i heard it she stopped her eyes coming to rest on a large red poinsettia behind my head heard what there was this sound the leaves were rustling no she corrected immediately it wasnt as strong as that it was quieter they were whispering i said my own voice hushed yes thats exactly what it was her eyes fastened on mine i remember thinking it was so strange that the leaves would be moving when there was no wind at all and then i felt someone standing over me and it was too late im so sorry my instincts were trying to warn me but i didnt listen i nodded how often we ignore our instincts i was thinking how often we ignore the whispering of the leaves will you sing to me again sheena asked lying back against her pillow and closing her eyes tooralooraloora i began softly tooralooralie sheena sang with me tooralooraloora we sang together our voices steadily gaining strength and i was able for a few fleeting minutes to pretend that the leaves had stopped whispering and all was right with the world he called again beverley said as i returned to the nurses station at the end of my shift i didnt have to ask whom she meant when beverley glanced at the large round clock on the wall about forty minutes ago i told him you were dead i laughed in spite of myself what did he say said hed catch you later she shrugged as if to ask what can you do holiday season brings out all the crazies i guess i guess i repeated moving like an automaton toward the elevators pressing the button repeatedly until the doors opened was that all it was my instincts were trying to warn me i heard sheena oconnor repeat but i didnt listen the elevator was already pretty full and i had to squeeze in between two middleaged men one of whom smelled of liquor the other of poor personal hygiene i watched the doors drag to a close and steadied my feet as the elevator lurched into its slow almost painful descent merry christmas one of the men said the smell of whiskey overwhelming the small space like fumes of poisonous gas i held my breath nodded and prayed the elevator wouldnt stop at every floor of course it did and even more people crowded inside merry christmas the man beside me greeted each new occupant at one point even attempting a courtly bow he promptly lost his balance and fell against me his hand brushing against my breast as he tried to right himself sorry about that he said with a stupid grin as i fought back the urge to throw up all over him unlike alison i had no phobias in that department the elevator finally reached the lobby bouncing several times on its arrival as if it were surprised it had landed in one piece and its doors yawned open everyone folded together as one pouring from the elevator like water from a glass i felt a hand on my rear end and initially dismissed the intrusion as an unavoidable consequence of so many people being squished together like sardines until i felt stray fingers trying to worm their way between my legs i angrily swatted the hand away and glared at the drunk beside me whose stupid grin had now settled across his entire face jerk i muttered i stepped into the lobby releasing the trapped air from my lungs and brushing another phantom hand from my backside feeling its illusion linger invisible fingers continuing to probe terry a voice said from somewhere behind me and i found myself staring at an attractive oliveskinned woman about five years younger than i whose name stubbornly refused to materialize luisa she said as if sensing my predicament from admitting i thought i recognized you when you got in the elevator but it was so crowded and smelly she laughed wasnt that awful were you working today i nodded you she shook her head several black curls fell across her wide forehead no i was visiting my grandmother she tripped on a tiny crack in the sidewalk last week and broke her hip can you believe it im sorry this getting older is for the birds i thought of my mother of myra wylie of all the sick and helpless men and women whod exceeded their best before dates well have a merry christmas luisa said and if i dont see you before have a healthy and happy new year the same to you i watched her turn and walk away luisa i called out suddenly the unexpected urgency in my voice stopping us both dead in our tracks luisa eyed me quizzically as i ran to catch up to her sorry i just remembered something i need to ask you about luisa said nothing waited for me to continue a friend of mine is trying to locate a woman who used to work here rita bishop why was i bringing this up now i wondered hadnt alison herself told me not to bother luisa raised thick black eyebrows furrowed her wide brow name doesnt ring a bell she left about six seven months ago do you know what department she worked in i think she was a secretary or something well ive been here for three years and ive never heard of any rita bishop but that doesnt necessarily mean anything would you like me to check the files i dont want to put you to any trouble itll only take a minute i followed luisa to the main office waited while she unlocked the door this is silly i told myself watching while she flipped on the lights and quickly activated the computer on her desk but my conversation with sheena oconnor had left me a little unsettled my instincts were trying to warn me shed said and id nodded understanding realizing how successfully id buried my own instincts feeling them stubbornly reasserting themselves now refusing to be ignored any longer im pulling up the personnel files luisa explained her eyes on the screen i dont see anyone by that name you said she left about six or seven months ago maybe eight i qualified well i cant find anyone by that name at all luisa paused typed in some further information you said rita bishop right right i show a sally pope i laughed close but no cigar let me check something else she pressed a few more keys ill enter her name let the computer run a search i nodded although i already knew what the outcome of that search would be mission care would have no record of rita bishop ever having worked here in fact it was highly doubtful that anyone named rita bishop worked anywhere that she existed at all alison hadnt shown up at mission care looking for an old friend named rita bishop shed shown up at mission care looking for me there was no other plausible explanation the only remaining question was why no luisa shook her head theres nothing im not sure where else to look thats okay dont bother sorry luisa shut off the computer theres an assistedliving community not far from here called manor care maybe your friend got the name confused maybe i said hopefully grasping at proverbial straws still trying to ignore my instincts to silence the whispering of the leaves by convincing myself that alison was exactly whom she claimed to be that she hadnt lied to me that she wasnt lying to me still thanks for trying i told luisa offering her a lift home but she had her own car and we wished each other a final merry christmas in the parking lot ten minutes later i was still sitting in my car trying to figure out what it all meant and more importantly what i was going to do next it was already dark when i pulled my car into my driveway lances white lincoln town car was parked on the street and i debated whether to knock on the cottage door and confront alison and her brother with my latest discovery except that i was confused and exhausted and vulnerable and alison always had a plausible explanation for everything besides what exactly was i so upset about that i was being played for a fool or that i still hadnt figured out what the game was one thing was clear i wasnt some random victim id obviously been researched carefully chosen for a specific purpose although the reason id been selected continued to elude me a lot of time and money i thought of the expensive painting alison had presented me with at midnight had gone into whatever plan she and her brother had concocted but why what could they possibly want with me what could they possibly expect from me and what if anything did erica hollander have to do with any of it i got out of the car fished in my purse for my keys reconsidered calling the police and saying what exactly that id rented out the small cottage behind my house to a young woman i now suspected of being a con artist or worse and what has this young woman done to arouse your suspicions i could hear them ask has she asked you for money is she behind in her rent well no she pays her rent exactly on time and shes never asked me for a thing in fact shes bought me expensive presents and gone out of her way to be nice to me well thats certainly suspicious no wonder you called us you dont understand im afraid afraid of what exactly i dont know listen lady its your house if you dont like her ask her to leave exactly so simple ask her to leave thats all i had to do so why didnt i what was stopping me was i trying to persuade myself that despite mounting evidence to the contrary there was a simple and perfectly reasonable answer for each and every deception that nothing had happened that couldnt be neatly explained away was i still trying to convince myself that there were no ulterior motives no grand conspiracy no risk to my safety and wellbeing i cant ask her to leave why not because i dont want her to go i acknowledged silently it was her brother i wanted gone and in another week he would be happy new year indeed then we could go back to the way it had been in the beginning we could go back to pretending that alison wasnt pretending that she was everything she had initially represented herself to be at that moment i tripped across the image of sheena oconnor who appeared before me stretched out on a blanket across my front lawn i watched her reach behind her back to untie the top of her bikini then turn her profile lazily toward the indifferent moon overhead i heard the cool breeze rustling through the trees listened to the subtle whispers warning her of danger saw her wave them away with a careless toss of her hand as if brushing off a pesky mosquito could i really afford to be so cavalier the only solution was to talk to alison if she could provide me with a plausible explanation for what was going on i would consider the matter settled if not id have to insist she leave before i could change my mind i marched around the side of the house and stepped up to the cottage door knocking forcefully immediately i thought better of it i was being too hasty too foolhardy too naive at the very least i should tell someone of my concerns if not the police then maybe josh or someone at work except that josh was out of town and my coworkers had their own problems to deal with besides it was christmas i thought of all the lovely gifts alison had given me the beautiful painting the china head vase christmas day was hardly the time to question her sincerity to accuse her of sinister plans and nefarious motives nefarious i could hear her say good word there was plenty of time to confront her i decided turning to leave doors open lance called from inside the cottage reluctantly i pushed open the door what other choice did i have i stepped over the threshold and shut the door behind me glancing past the empty living room toward the rumpled bed in the next room you made your bed i heard my mother say whats the matter you forget your key lance asked emerging from the bathroom wearing nothing but a towel around his slender waist his hair was wet beads of water glistened from his sculpted chest oh oh yourself he said with a mischievous smile im sorry i didnt realize didnt realize what that i was naked he took two steps toward me i took two steps back ive obviously interrupted you showers all finished lance lifted muscular arms into the air see clean all over he turned the towel lifting slightly as he spun around exposing a flash of inner thigh i pretended not to notice is alison here silly question i thought biting down on my tongue obviously she wasnt she went for a walk a walk said she needed some air is she feeling all right sure why wouldnt she be no migraine he laughed shes fine he took another step toward me is there anything i can do for you keep you entertained until alison gets back i backed up until i felt the door handle press against the small of my back no i just wanted to thank her again for the beautiful painting i can come over he offered his right thumb hooking into the top of his towel hang it for you right now it can wait till morning some things are better hung at night his tongue darted between newly parted lips some things are better left to the imagination i countered and i bet you have quite the imagination what makes you say that his eyes traveled down my white sweater and black pants lingering on my breasts stopping on my crotch ive been watching you youve been watching me i repeated afraid to say more i felt an unwanted tingle between my legs just trying to figure you out i lifted my hands into the air two can play this game i thought curiously emboldened what you see is what you get is that so i nodded as he edged closer so close now i felt the dampness of his recent shower on my skin no secrets he asked provocatively i shook my head his breath brushing against the side of my cheek like a furtive kiss im very boring im afraid what exactly is it youre afraid of i almost laughed would have had he not been standing so close what exactly i repeated in a voice not quite my own do you want from me what do you want from me this time i did laugh immediately tasting his breath on mine ive never been very good at games i love games lance countered you ever see a cat playing with a mouse cat gets the poor mouse cornered no question the mouse is gonna bite the dust but the cat isnt satisfied with just the kill the kills the least interesting part as far as the cats concerned no the cat likes to play a while first is that what youre doing playing with me is that what youre doing he repeated slowly playing with me i heard footsteps behind me felt the doorknob turn against the small of my back and suddenly the door opened and i was propelled into lances waiting arms immediately he grabbed my hand slid it beneath the towel at his waist i felt the wet curls of his pubic hair as his organ stiffened against my unwilling fingers without pausing to consider my actions i reached up with my free hand and slapped him hard across the face okay thats it i want you out of here right now terry alison exclaimed stepping inside as i struggled to compose myself whats the matter she looked at her brother whats going on here what did you say to terry what have you done just a slight misunderstanding lance said flopping down on the large chair and extending one leg across its overstuffed arm so that his entire expanse of inner thigh was clearly visible his cheek was red where id slapped him isnt that right terry i was just telling your brother that i think its time he found another place to stay alisons expression vacillated between confusion and anger as her eyes traveled back and forth between us whatever hes done please let me apologize hey lance interrupted bringing both legs to the floor you dont have to apologize for me i was walking out of the shower when she came waltzing in i knocked i offered quickly lance said to come in the door was open you dont have to explain alison said staring at her brother whatever you said or did i want you to apologize right now i didnt do anything apologize anyway lance glared at his sister although by the time he turned to me his face had softened and he managed to look suitably contrite im sorry terry he said quietly and with conviction i thought we were just having some fun i guess sometimes i get carried away i really am sorry i nodded silently accepting his apology i should go ill be out of your hair in a few days hows that lance asked as i opened the cottage door again i nodded stepping outside and closing the door behind me hoping to overhear snatches of their conversation but there was nothing in the ensuing silence i stumbled toward my back door the night air cool against my skin still damp from contact with lances body my fingers tingling with unwanted echoes of the feel of his flesh you ever see a cat playing with a mouse i heard him whisper in my ear the cat isnt satisfied with just the kill i acknowledged out loud as moments later i stepped into my own shower tried washing the smell of him from my fingertips the cat likes to play a while first the last time i made love was on new years eve myra wylie said her voice heavy with age and infirmity although a youthful glint was in her eyes i pulled my chair closer to her bedside and leaned forward eager to catch each word it was ten years ago steve and i steve was my husband had been invited to this ghastly party you know one of those overblown affairs where there are too many people most of them strangers and everybody drinks too much and laughs too loud and makes a great show of having a good time but theyre really pretty miserable you know the kind of party i mean i nodded although i had no real idea what she was talking about id never been to one of those parties id never had a date for new years eve well i wasnt in a great mood because i didnt want to go to the damn party and steve knew that but it was at the home of one of his former business partners and he didnt think we could say no you know how it is i didnt but i agreed anyway so i got all dolled up in my fancy new dress and steve put on his tuxedo he always looked so handsome in his tuxedo not that i told him how handsome he looked myras eyes grew wistful filled with tears i should have told him i grabbed a tissue from the night table beside myras bed and dabbed gently at the rolling waves of flesh beneath her eyes im sure he knew how you felt about him oh he knew but i should have told him anyway it never hurts to tell someone hes loved so you went to the party i encouraged when she failed to continue we went to the party myra repeated picking up the thread of her earlier musings and it was every bit as awful as i knew it was going to be so i guess there was a certain satisfaction in that and we drank too much champagne and laughed too loud at jokes that were only mildly funny and pretended to be having the best time of our lives just like everybody else and at midnight we yelled happy new year like a bunch of drunken old idiots and kissed everyone in sight pretty soon after that we left for home i was very nervous i was always on the lookout for drunk drivers i had an uncle whod been killed by one when i was a little girl and this being new years eve well she coughed gasped for air i lifted the nearby glass of water to her lips all out of champagne im afraid i said watching her gulp it down tastes even better she finished the last of the water lay back against her pillows shouldnt get so excited its all this talk about sex i guess i must have missed something i said and she laughed i havent gotten to the good part yet she cleared her throat not that there was much of a good part no not that it was bad she qualified what is it they say about sex when its good its really good and when its bad its still good it was that kind of bad do you follow again i nodded although my own experiences with sex had been decidedly more bad than good well we got home around twelve thirty maybe later i guess it doesnt matter the point is that it was later than we were used to staying up and we were exhausted i dont know why we felt we had to have sex that night just because it was new years eve i mean we werent kids anymore we were in our late seventies for heavens sake it wasnt like we werent going to see each other the next morning it wasnt like we hadnt been having sex for almost half a century she stopped am i making you uncomfortable i shook my head im glad because im rather enjoying talking about this i never have before you know out loud that is youre sure you dont mind im sure its been my experience that young people dont like to hear about old people having sex they think its i dont know yicky she settled on finally i laughed yicky good word i heard alison say i quickly pushed thoughts of alison from my mind id seen almost nothing of either her or her brother since the episode in the cottage alison had come over early the next morning to apologize again for her brothers inappropriate behavior and to assure me hed be leaving in a matter of days but lances rented white lincoln was still parked in my driveway when id left for work this evening and the painting alison had bought me for christmas remained on my living room floor waiting to be hung children especially dont like to think of their parents having sex even when theyre older and should know better they prefer to think of their conception as some sort of miracle birth or that their parents only did it that once or maybe twice and stopped altogether once theyd completed their families but god steve and i did it all the time sorry i can see by the look on your face that was rather indelicate no of course not i stammered pushing some nonexistent hairs away from my forehead trying to arrange my features into a placid mask i was thinking of my own parents how certain id always been that my birth had been a freak of nature or that sex had been something theyd tried once disliked intensely and had never attempted again that that was the reason i was an only child now myra was telling me this wasnt necessarily the case too much information myra joked thats what josh always says hell be home soon yes she looked toward the window where was i you were having sex all the time myra all but hooted with glee it was the most animated id ever seen her oh i was such a bad girl she laughed even harder can i tell you something ive never told anyone of course i held my breath almost afraid of what she was about to say steve wasnt the only man i ever had sex with i said nothing although truthfully i was almost relieved myra wylie was so full of surprises tonight i hadnt been sure what she was about to confide no there were several others before him and this was in the days before birth control when girls who had sex before marriage were considered loose women although of course that never stopped anyone from doing it well you know i nodded this time i did know anyway there were several young men before i met steve although i told him he was the first and he believed me were youhis first she leaned forward cupped withered hands around her mouth lowered her voice as if afraid her late husband might be eavesdropping at the door i think i was a smile pulled at her powdery skin steve was such a natural lover much better than the other boys id been with and were there others after you got married i ventured heavens no once id made that commitment that was it not that there werent opportunities but after i got married i never really looked at other men in that way i had my stevie and he kept me plenty busy her voice trailed off she stared at the ceiling for a minute i thought she might have fallen asleep so on new years eve she started up again her eyes flickering across the ceiling as if her past were being projected on it we got home and went to bed and we kissed each other and wished each other a happy new year and steve said what do you think are you too tired and i was but i didnt want to say so so instead i said no im okay how about you so of course he said he was okay too and we made love although neither of us really felt like it and it was a bit of an effort if you know what i mean again i nodded hoping she wouldnt go into details but we managed i think we felt we should it being the new year and everything sort of like on your anniversary or your birthday you just feel you should anyway we made love and then we fell asleep sex always puts me right to sleep she laughed and later i was so glad wed made love that night because it turned out to be the last time we ever did steve had a heart attack the following week and died a month after that you must miss him a great deal there isnt a day goes by that i dont think about him but i guess ill be seeing him again pretty soon she said brightly well lets hope not too soon i patted her arm and stood up straightening her covers although there was no need i checked my watch another twenty minutes and it would be a brandnew year will you sit with me until midnight she asked then i promise to go to sleep like a good little girl i sat back down watched myras eyes flutter to a close im not asleep she warned just resting my eyes im not going anywhere i assured her watching the steady rise and fall of her chest beneath the covers noting the satisfied smile that lingered in the folds of her ancient face at seventyseven shed still been sexually active at eightyseven the thought of sex still made her smile i was envious i realized when had sex ever made me smile when had it brought me anything but embarrassment and shame my first time had been fast and uncomfortable and not particularly pleasant i remember roger stillman trying to pry my legs apart the few hurried grabs at my breasts that served as foreplay and then the sudden jolt of pain as his body pushed into mine the unexpected weight of his torso as he collapsed on top of me when it was over the last time id had sex hadnt been much of an improvement i thought with a shudder again envying the dying old woman lying in bed before me shed been so open so honest with me what would she think if i were to be equally open and honest with her could i tell her that the last time id had sex real sex not just the hint of it with josh or the threat of it with lance had been the night my mother died i shook my head in disbelief dear god how could i have done anything so vile what on earth had possessed me in truth id all but pushed the details of that night out of my mind altogether but myras memories had unleashed a flood of my own i sat back in my chair stared at the window saw the ghosts of my past etched in the dark mirror of glass i watched myself as i sat stiffly by my mothers bedside her death obvious in the grayness of her pallor and the stillness that had settled over her body like a fine coating of wax her eyes and mouth were open and i reached out to close them her skin already cool against my fingers even in death there remained a hint of the anger that had fueled her life even with her eyes closed and her breath stopped a certain ferocity clung to her features she was still a force to be reckoned with i remember thinking as i bent down to kiss her lips surprised to find them so soft and pliant when had i ever experienced softness from those lips had she ever kissed me as a baby a toddler a child had those lips ever brushed across my forehead to check if i was feverish had they ever whispered i love you while i slept the sad fact was that id hated my mother almost as much as id loved her that id spent my entire life trying to please her to make up for whatever wrongs both real and imaginary id committed after shed suffered her stroke id tried everything in my power to nurse her back to health and when it became obvious to both of us she wouldnt get better id continued to do my best to make sure she was as comfortable as possible id sacrificed so much of my life for her and suddenly she was gone and i had nothing no one i was left with an emptiness so overwhelming i didnt know what to do i remember pacing back and forth at the foot of her bed back and forth back and forth i could feel her watching me through closed dead eyes casting her continuing disapproval across my shoulders like a heavy cloak what kind of nurse are you that you couldnt keep your own mother alive i could hear her demand through cold dead lips and it was true i conceded id failed her again as id always failed her im so sorry i cried out loud so sorry sorry sorry sorry a sorry excuse for a nurse a sorrier excuse for a daughter i dont remember leaving the house although at some point i obviously did i must have showered and changed my clothes although i have no memory of having done so i do remember being in a bar on atlantic avenue throwing back several glasses of tequila and flirting with the handsomely nondescript bartender until he abandoned me for a girl who kept tossing her long blond hair from one shoulder to the other at the far end of the bar i then turned my attention to another generically handsome man this one wearing a bright hawaiian shirt who casually slipped his wedding band into the pocket of his tight jeans as he sidled up beside me i dont think ive seen you in here before he said yes he actually said that maybe because it was true maybe because he was too lazy to think of anything more original maybe because he sensed i was such an easy mark that nothing was to be gained by being more creative its my first time i told him trying and failing to toss my hair over my shoulder like the blonde at the end of the bar first time huh he signaled the bartender to refill our drinks i like first times dont you i gave him what i hoped would pass as a mysterious smile and said nothing instead i pushed my shoulders back and crossed my legs his eyes tracing each move i was wearing a striped jersey that accentuated the swell of my bosom and strappy sandals that dangled provocatively from my bare toes he was tall and slender with hair as black as coal and eyes the color of cool mint he did most of the talking about what i dont remember im sure he told me his name but ive successfully blocked it out jack john jerrod something with a j i dont think i told him mine im not sure he asked we had a few more drinks and he suggested going somewhere more private without another word i slid from my barstool and walked to the door surprisingly i had no trouble walking despite all the liquor in my system in fact i didnt feel the least bit drunk although afterward i convinced myself id been very drunk indeed but as much as id like to blame what happened that night on a combination of grief and alcohol im no longer sure i can do that the truth is that i wasnt drunk that night at least not so drunk i wasnt responsible for my actions the truth is that i knew exactly what i was doing when i agreed to leave that bar for somewhere more private when i let jack or john or jerrod feel me up as we stumbled toward his car when i whispered that i lived just around the corner he parked on the street in front of my house and i led him around the side to the cottage at the back who lives in the main house he asked as i opened the cottage door and began turning on the lights my mother i told him glancing toward her bedroom window arent you afraid shell see us with all these lights on shes a very sound sleeper i said pulling off my jersey in front of the window hearing my mothers silent gasp after that we said little but if id been expecting great sex i was sorely disappointed if id been looking for some kind of release i got nothing of the sort instead i got a lot of grunting and thrashing about to no particular purpose and when it was over too fast yet not nearly fast enough i couldnt wait for jack or john or jerrod to put on his tight jeans and hawaiian shirt and leave ill call you he said on his way out the door i nodded looking up at my mothers room feeling the crushing weight of her disapproval as heavy as the weight of the man whod just left my bed i took a shower and got dressed then i called for an ambulance and returned to the main house where i sat dutifully by my mothers side until it arrived then i wiped that night from my mind as if it had never happened and refused to think of it again until now i glanced at my watch it was midnight happy new year i whispered kissing myras warm cheek happy new year she repeated opening her eyes briefly her thin lashes brushing against my skin seconds later she was asleep and once again i was alone i thought i heard something when i stepped into the hallway i stopped looked around saw nothing but an empty corridor i stood there my hand still on the door to myras room my head cocked to one side like an attentive puppy my ears on full alert for any errant sounds a stray step a heavy breath anything at all out of the ordinary but there was nothing i shook my head and started down the hall looking in on my patients as i passed each joyless room most were asleep or pretending to be only eliot winchell a middleaged man saddled with the brain of a toddler as the result of a seemingly harmless spill from a bicycle was awake he waved when he saw me happy new year mr winchell i said automatically checking his pulse is there anything i can get for you he smiled his eerie childs smile and said nothing do you need to go to the bathroom he shook his head smiled wider the white of his teeth flashing in the semidarkness of the room then try to get some sleep now mr winchell you have a very busy day ahead of you i doubted this was true but what difference did it make one day would be pretty much the same as the next for eliot winchell for the rest of his life why werent you wearing your helmet eliot i scolded in my mothers voice watching the childs smile vanish abruptly from his face get some sleep i said softening patting his arm and making sure his covers were secure ill see you tomorrow i heard the noise as soon as i stepped back into the hall i spun around my eyes darting back and forth up and down the brightly lit corridor but again there was nothing i held my breath waited tried unsuccessfully to figure out exactly what it was i thought id heard but there was nothing i could put my finger on nothing but a vague sense of disquiet its nothing i said out loud as i walked past sheena oconnors former room sheena oconnor was no longer a patient at mission care her doctors felt shed recovered sufficiently to release her and her parents had arrived to take her home the day before yesterday isnt it great ill be home for new years shed exclaimed you take good care of yourself i urged youll keep in touch wont you youll come visit me of course i will i said but i think we both knew that once she left the hospital id never see her again she hugged me im gonna call you every time i cant sleep she warned have you sing to me you wont have any trouble sleeping what was she doing now i wondered returning to the nurses station realizing i missed having someone to sing to on holidays the hospital retained only a skeletal staff beverley and i were the only nurses on the floor truthfully i would have preferred total solitude then i wouldnt have to spend the first moments of the new year mired in boring small talk or pretend to be interested in beverleys mindnumbingly stupid problems i wouldnt be expected to offer advice i knew would never be followed i could simply enjoy this time alone chances were slight thered be an emergency and doctors were on call if i needed them a glorified babysitter thats all you are i heard my mother whisper did you hear something i asked beverley drowning out the sound of my mothers voice like what beverley looked up from the double issue of people she was perusing and listened i dont hear anything i shrugged unconvinced the silence of the night pounded against my head like a hammer just your imagination working overtime beverley pronounced god knows i have plenty of imagination i thought yes sir lots of imagination and no life the people dying in their beds just down the hall had more life than i did myra wylie for gods sake at eightyseven and sick with leukemia and heart disease still grew wistful at the very thought of sex ten years ago ten years ago shed still been sexually active and here was i almost half her age with only a tiny fraction of her life experience what was i waiting for how much of my life was i going to waste id never made new years resolutions before but i made one now come hell or high water this year was going to be different josh would be back from california in a few days and i was going to be ready for him who would you sleep with if you had the chance beverley startled me by asking as if privy to my thoughts tom cruise or russell crowe she held up the magazine tapped fake orange nails against the appropriate pictures is george clooney an option she laughed and i listened in mounting fear as the laugh spun circles around us dont tell me you didnt hear that i heard it beverley dropped the magazine to the counter and rose to her feet probably larry foster in he has that weird little laugh ill go check on him maybe we should call security fake orange nails waved my concerns aside as beverley headed down the hall i picked up the people magazine and flipped through its pages trying to pretend there was no cause for alarm by concentrating on which stars had undergone plastic surgery in the last year you definitely i said pointing to the picture of an aging starlet who except for an exaggerated mane of curly blond hair barely resembled her former self in fact it was only after i read the name beneath the photograph that i realized who she was thats when i heard the sound again the magazine dropped from my hands and slid off my lap as i jumped to my feet whos there i demanded eyes straying toward the alarm button on the wall a figure emerged from behind a nearby pillar and sauntered slowly toward me his fingers hooked into the pockets of his black jeans a cruel smile tugging at his lips tall skinny dressed all in black his brown eyes laughed at me from atop his hawklike nose i didnt need a name beneath a photograph to identify him kc happy new year terry i fought to get air into my lungs what are you doing here how did you get past security you mean my friend sylvester what did you do to him the smile disappeared from his mouth you mean after i slit his throat my voice fell to my knees oh my god kc laughed slapped his thigh in disbelief what you think im serious you think id hurt my friend sylvester what kind of people have you been hanging out with lady of course i didnt hurt him i just explained how unfair i thought it was you had to miss out on all the festivities and said i wanted to surprise you with a party of your own sylvester was very understanding especially when i presented him with a nice bottle of tenyearold scotch whats the matter terry you dont look very happy to see me are you alone what do you think he lifted his right hand aimed it at my heart it was only then i saw the gun there was a loud bang and in a blinding flash the world exploded i fell back cried out glanced toward my chest waiting for the sight of my blood to seep through the whiteness of my uniform my god whats going on here beverley exclaimed as my vision began to blur who are you she demanded of kc as the taste of blood filled my mouth friends of terrys kc answered easily and i was too weak to object and then alison suddenly jumped into view happy new year she shouted happy new year echoed denise popping up beside her welcome to the first day of the rest of your life lance announced from another corner laughing as champagne gushed from the large bottle in his hand to spill across the floor that was one noisy cork anybody see where it went whats going on here beverley asked again although a smile was already creeping into her voice new years celebration lance told her we didnt think you angels of mercy should miss out on all the fun well arent you sweet im beverley by the way pleasure to meet you beverley im lance this is alison denise and kc any friends of terrys beverley began then stopped when she saw the look on my face you scared me half to death i said realizing i hadnt been shot after all lance laughed a little scares good for you gets the adrenaline pumping we didnt mean to scare you alison apologized we just wanted to surprise you dont you like surprises terry denise asked approaching the nurses station her black hair had outgrown its trendy cut and as a result its spikes had lost some of their sharp edges collapsing around her pale face like ash from a cigarette her eyes were rimmed with black making her look more ghoulish than sophisticated an effect i dont think was intentional although knowing denise perhaps it was please dont touch anything i admonished still trying to catch my breath we brought glasses alison said producing them from the large shopping bag in her hands we thought of everything kc added where do you keep the drugs denise asked what just joking what happened to your lip alison asked i touched the side of my mouth where i must have bitten down immediately lance was beside me licking the drop of blood from my finger with the exaggerated gusto of a movie vampire hmm two thousand two a very good year i pulled my hand away save it bela lugosi i told him struggling to keep everyone in my line of sight beverley already had a glass in her hand dont be upset with us terry alison pleaded she was dressed all in white her strawberryblond curls falling loosely around her face botticellis venus removed from her shell im just not sure this is such a good idea its a great idea beverley countered with a slap on my arm as lance began carefully measuring out equal amounts of champagne i noticed that he too was dressed all in white we couldnt let you spend new years eve alone kc said that wouldnt have been very nice of us denise began rifling through a nearby stack of patients charts i quickly moved them out of her reach you shouldnt be back here why not denise alison said denise promptly left the nurses station grabbing a glass of champagne from the counter as she brushed by cheers everybody wait we have to make a toast alison waited to make sure we each had a glass what are we drinking to lance asked his sister to the best year ever alison raised her glass into the air the best year ever we all agreed i didnt want to be considered a wet blanket so i took one sip then another the champagne tasted surprisingly refreshing so i took several more the bubbles stinging the insides of my nose good health i said under my breath and wealth denise added quickly may we all get exactly what we want in the coming year lance continued everything thats coming to us kc added smiling at me from over the rim of his glass as everyone took another sip of champagne everything we deserve denise said everything we need said alison and what exactly is that her brother challenged alison buried her nose inside her glass of champagne and said nothing i finished the last of my champagne in two quick gulps well i know what i need denise said laughing i need a change of scenery werent you just in new york new york doesnt count i was with my mother whats wrong with your mother nothing if you like uptight anal retentive old farts denise immediately doubled over with laughter alison likes uptight anal retentive old farts lance said looking directly at me dont you alison i like everyone alison finished the contents of her glass and poured herself another i could tell by the way she was swaying by the way they were all swaying that this wasnt the evenings first bottle of booze terry your glass is empty alison filled it to the top before i had time to object drink up she urged watching as i lifted the glass to my mouth im serious denise was saying ive had it with the east coast its time for a change could this have anything to do with getting fired by your aunt kc asked my aunts an uptight anal retentive old fart whyd she fire you beverley asked holding out her glass for a refill denise shrugged because shes jealous of me shes always been jealous of me i thought it was because she caught you stealing from the till denise waved away kcs unwanted explanation wouldnt have happened if she wasnt such a damn tightwad she was paying me next to nothing for gods sake and she has all this money plus im family youd think she could afford to be more generous i hate people like that dont you hate people like that terry i think people have a right to decide what to do with their own money i took another long sip of champagne struggled to stay focused yeah well i think shes an uptight analretentive old fart lance asked slyly exactly denise wobbled toward him pushed her breasts against his chest i was thinking of trying new mexico want to come with me sounds like a plan lance put his arms around denises waist stared over her wilting dark spikes at alison im getting a little tired of south florida myself alison looked away smiled in my direction though her smile was tight as if it were holding back a torrent of angry words a buzzer sounded whats that denise raised her head from lances chest i glanced at the wall behind the nurses station the button indicating eliot winchells room was lit up its one of my patients i have to go well come with you lance said i shook my head in an effort to clear it watched the room spin instead no you have to leave now the buzzer sounded again come on guys we should get going alison said we dont want to get terry in trouble denise shook her head oh come on dont be such an uptight anal retentive kc continued old fart lance concluded and they all laughed except for alison who had the decency to look both embarrassed and ashamed the buzzer sounded again persistent little bugger isnt he beverley said making no move to respond to his call okay guys i appreciate your coming here and bringing the champagne and celebrating new years eve with us but i really have to go now and so do you we understand kc said we can show ourselves out lance offered guiding the others to the elevator as the buzzer sounded yet again thanks for dropping by i heard beverley say as i headed down the hall the floor was sliding under my feet like a moving sidewalk and i grabbed the wall for support trying to control the spinning of my head was i drunk already on only two glasses of champagne the only other time id gotten this drunk this fast i realized id also been with alison i pushed open the door to eliot winchells room he was sitting up in bed his covers bunched up around his ankles the front of his pajamas wet with his urine oh eliot have you had an accident im sorry he said sheepishly no dont be sorry its not your fault really lance asked pushing past me into the room followed by denise and kc alison hung back in the doorway as the others approached the bed then whose fault is it hello im dr palmay lance continued before i had time to react and these are my colleagues dr austin and dr powers denise laughed and eliot laughed with her although i doubt he got the joke hes so cute denise said whats his problem obviously hes wet his pants lance answered what kind of doctor are you anyway oh gross denise said you have to leave now i said when i could find my voice my mouth was dry thoughts swirled helplessly around my brain as if trapped in an unexpected eddy i steadied myself against eliot winchells bed yes we do alison agreed from the doorway come on doctors we have to go now and let terry do her job looks like terry could use a bit of help kc said shes looking a little green around the gills im sorry terry alison said i didnt know they were going to do this what are you talking about lance shot back angrily this whole thing was your idea and then they were gone in the merciful silence that followed i changed eliot into another pair of pajamas and settled him back in his bed i did all this by rote my head spinning my vision impaired by a cluster of bright neon bubbles exploding before my eyes had my glass contained something more potent than champagne i clung to the walls as i navigated the moving hallway back to the nurses station my concerns swept away in an unexpected fit of adolescent giggles that burst from my throat like kernels of corn from a popper seconds later i collapsed into my chair wondering at what precise moment id lost control of my life knowing it was exactly the moment alison had shown up at my door they were waiting for me in the parking lot at the end of my shift i saw denise first she was sitting on the trunk of a car drinking wine directly from a bottle and kicking her feet into the air as if she were lounging at the end of a dock on the intracoastal a small gold loop flashed at me from the side of her right nostril i didnt remember seeing it earlier kc was standing beside her his hands crammed into the pockets of his tight jeans his eyes on the ground he looked as if hed just been sick or was about to be although when he raised his head in my direction i saw he was smiling surprisingly i smiled back as if i were no longer in charge of my own reflexes as if id been reduced to a puppetlike state and i went wherever my strings pulled me id expected the champagne to have worn off by now but if anything i was feeling even more discombobulated than before strange images were dancing around my head refusing to settle long enough for me to identify them bright colors continued to float like loose balloons across my line of vision it required all my concentration just to put one foot in front of the other alison and lance were sitting halfin halfout of the white lincoln that was parked several empty spaces away its doors open to the earlymorning air lance was in the front seat alison the back and when she leaned forward balancing her elbows on her knees i saw that her eyes were puffy and wet as if shed been crying or maybe she was just stoned i realized as the unmistakable odor of marijuana wafted toward my nose and i saw the rich orange glow of a handrolled cigarette dangling casually from lances fingers well look whos here denise said about time kc straightened up lifted his arms above his head in a prolonged catlike stretch as if he were getting ready to pounce what are you still doing here i looked around the scenery blurring as i strained to see whether anyone else was in the parking lot but there was no one great security i thought wondering who would hear me if i screamed alison climbed out of the rented lincoln swiped at her eyes with the back of her hand i didnt want you driving home alone on new years eve lance took a long drag of his cigarette partys just beginning partys over i told them trying to remember where id parked my car im exhausted i just want to go home and crawl into bed now thats a plan lance said as he had said earlier he extended the marijuana cigarette in my direction smoke filled my nostrils like a too sweet perfume i shook my head no although i had to admit the sensation was not altogether unpleasant for strictly medicinal purposes of course denise slid off the trunk of the car and inhaled deeply from the smoldering joint in lances fingers kc you and denise take my car lance instructed alison and ill go with terry without asking he lifted my purse from my hands and extricated the keys to my car ill drive he said the words crawling around the joint now pressed between his lips im not sure this is such a good idea you shouldnt be driving in your condition lance laughed as if he knew something i didnt and i felt my legs buckle beneath me they had put something in my champagne probably a hallucinogen i decided trying to hang on to reality like a child clinging to the handlebars of a runaway bicycle let go a little voice urged inside my head give in and let go i felt a wave of euphoria wash over me as i released my grip on the here and now i pictured myself flying backward through the air without a helmet the wind whipping at my hair instead i found myself squashed beside alison in the passenger seat of my car her arm around me in a protective almost smothering embrace the oppressive smell of marijuana circled my head like an errant halo forcing its way up my sinuses like wads of cotton batten what exactly did you put in my drink i heard someone ask understanding it was me only by the echo bouncing between my ears you mean aside from the rufies and the lsd lance laughed as we sped out of the parking lot and turned onto jog road the white lincoln following close behind shut up lance alison said shell think youre serious i am serious im a very serious fellow come on terry he waved what was left of the marijuana cigarette in front of my face in for a penny in for a pound isnt that what they say she said she doesnt want any alison said no thats all right i surprised us all by saying what the hell i remember thinking my life was no longer my own whatever was going to happen was no longer up to me id been excluded from the decisionmaking process and instead of feeling threatened and afraid i felt relieved even excited i was walking a tightrope without a safety net i was free so i laughed as i accepted the joint from lances waiting fingers then raised it to my lips and inhaled deeply holding it in my lungs the way id seen denise do in the parking lot until my throat burned and my chest threatened to explode look at that lance laughed shes an old pro i took another drag this one longer than the first watching dispassionately as the thin paper burned its way down to the tips of my fingers unfamiliar stirrings of wellbeing whooshed through my body like a fresh transfusion of blood id never smoked marijuana before although id been tempted as a teenager this had less to do with any great moral integrity on my part than it did with my greater fear of my mother finding out i drew another long drag into my lungs then sank into a deep well of complete and utter calm realizing i never wanted to resurface i clung to the sensation as a drowning woman clings to a life buoy pressing the smoke against my lungs like a branding iron exhaling only the faintest puff and only when i could no longer hold my breath easy does it lance warned as i inhaled again a small tower of ash replacing the paper in my hand i gasped as the cigarette burned into my fingers are you all right alison asked did you burn yourself let me see that lance grabbed my right hand forced my index and middle fingers into his mouth sucked greedily on their tips oh for gods sake alison slapped her brothers hand with such force his teeth scraped my knuckles terry are you okay i stared at my tingling fingers thats firstrate weed isnt it lance asked proudly whered you get it i asked in return trust me the drug trade still thrives in delray beach i looked around trying to make sense of what was once familiar territory where are we i asked as we turned onto linton boulevard lakeview golf course lance announced reading the large sign on our left you ever play golf terry i shook my head not sure whether id answered him out loud i tried it once lance said but it was a disaster balls splaying all over the damn place its not as easy as it looks on tv ill tell you that i think its the sort of thing you need lessons for i heard myself say remarkably selfassured for someone who had no idea what she was talking about i have no patience for lessons lance has no patience for anything alison turned toward the window were there tears in her eyes are you okay i wondered if lance had another of his magic cigarettes to give to his sister get her to relax why was she so uptight alison nodded without looking back you fine i lay my head against her shoulder snuggled into the crook of her arm closed my eyes terry lance said terry are you asleep is she asleep he asked alison before i could formulate a response i felt alison swivel toward me her breath warm on my face as she spoke i hope youre proud of yourself she said in my mothers voice and i jumped up startled sure she was speaking to me so youre not asleep lance said trying to trick us were you where are we i asked again how many times had i asked that already where are we going thought wed go for a little new years dip in the ocean lance answered are you crazy alison asked its the middle of the night its pitchblack out there a sudden disquiet gnawed at my newfound serenity like a mouse on a piece of rope i pushed myself up in my seat and rubbed my forehead as if trying to clear it maybe a dip in the ocean was exactly what i needed just what the doctor ordered i thought then laughed whats so funny lance asked laughing with me alison was the only one who didnt laugh worry clung to her eyes like wraparound shades whats her problem i thought with growing irritation i looked out the car window at the largely deserted thoroughfare where was everybody it was new years eve for gods sake where were all the drunken revelers not to mention all the extra police cars supposedly trolling the streets here we were three plastered partiers crowded into the front seat of a car heading for the atlantic ocean surely we deserved a citation for that i thought giggling at the convoluted absurdity of my reasoning maybe we should just go home alison said i think terrys had enough excitement for one night every party needs a pooper lance began singing thats why we invited you party pooper i joined in laughing so hard now i could barely catch my breath whatever twinge of trepidation i might have felt earlier had vanished as quickly as it had appeared carried away by wave after wave of intense euphoria i would ride those waves right into the middle of the sea i thought as the ocean miraculously appeared before us and lance pulled to a stop at the side of the road the white lincoln stopping right behind in the next instant four doors opened as one and both cars emptied we raced each other toward the deserted beach so dark it was almost impossible to see where the sand ended and the water began in the distance several lonely firecrackers exploded and i looked up to see a spray of brilliant pink and green burst briefly across the sky aside from that and the low growl of a passing motorcycle it was quiet i suppressed a shudder as the cool night air blew through my hair then wrapped itself tightly around my neck like a tourniquet this is so great denise exclaimed throwing her arm over my shoulder and dragging me across the sand isnt this so great terry lets get naked lance was already kicking off his shoes and pulling his shirt over his head lets not alison quickly countered what are you trying to do lance she asked above the roar of the ocean draw as much attention to us as possible not a good idea lance agreed quickly okay everybody clothes back on he tried dragging his shirt back over his head but his head got caught in one of the sleeves and he gave up throwing the shirt to the ground in frustration then laughing as he stomped it into the sand with his bare feet never did like that stupid shirt he said and we all laughed as if hed just told the funniest joke in the world except alison she wasnt laughing i pulled off my clumsy nurses shoes and surveyed the ocean stretched out before me cold dark hypnotic it beckoned me forward pulling me like a giant magnet and i rushed toward its angry waves as if possessed the sand cold against my stockinged feet the icy water rushing over my toes way to go terry lance yelled from the darkness wait for us denise called out as a wave like an oversize boxers glove pummeled my back i looked toward the shore saw several vague shapes lumbering toward me hands waving in the air like delicate tree branches swaying in the wind i waved back lost my balance and stumbled over a rock struggling to maintain my footing i saw the darkness swirling around me and wondered briefly what in gods name i was doing hadnt i pulled this stunt once before hadnt i almost drowned terry be careful alison cried out fighting her way through the surf youre out too deep come back happy new year i shouted splashing at the water with my hands somebodys stoned lance said drawing closer his voice a singsong i pushed myself to my feet only to be slapped down on all fours by another wave the taste of salt filled my mouth and i laughed remembering the time id mistakenly sprinkled salt instead of sugar on my breakfast cereal and my mother had insisted i eat it anyway a lesson shed said so i wouldnt make the same mistake again but i was always making the same mistakes again i realized laughing even louder once again i tried to stand up but my feet could no longer find the ocean floor and i was drifting farther and farther away from the others help i cried as the water crept above my head and unseen hands reached for me in the dark strong hands pulled at my clothing stop struggling lance ordered his voice as cold as the ocean you only make things worse by struggling i lunged into lances arms the wet hairs of his bare chest rough against my cheek his heartbeat resonating against my ears i gasped for breath my hands flailing wildly in the air as another wave tore us apart then crashed over my head like a collapsing tent i screamed my mouth filling with water as my fingers reached across the darkness for something solid to grab on to i felt a large fish slap against my calves and i kicked it away what are you doing lance yelled above the sound of the angry surf stay still help me the cold water swirled around my legs tugging at my feet like heavy weights pulling me under i felt lance close beside me and struggled through the darkness toward him it was then that i felt a weight on the top of my head pushing me back under holding me down no i cried although no sound emerged i opened my eyes underwater saw lance beside me his hands somewhere above my head was he trying to save me or kill me stop fighting me lance ordered gruffly i reached frantically for the waters surface but my body was growing weak and my legs were constrained by the tightness of my uniform my lungs felt as if they were about to burst the sensation eerily similar to the one id enjoyed earlier with my first marijuana cigarette so this is what it feels like to drown i thought remembering the fate of those unfortunate kittens at my mothers cruel hands had they been scared i wondered had they fought back clawed at her murderous fingers or had they quietly accepted their fate as lance was urging me to do now damn it stop struggling he bellowed as my head finally shattered the surface of the water like a fist through glass and suddenly a bright light was shining toward me and for one insane second i wondered if i was already dead if this was the white light patients whod suffered neardeath experiences sometimes talked about and then i heard the distant voice police the voice announced whats going on out there goddamn it lance said pulling me up and securing me underneath his arm pushing me roughly toward the shore whats going on here the police officer asked again as i collapsed on the sand by his feet gulping wildly at the air unable to speak alison was immediately on her hands and knees hugging me to her side kc and denise hovered silently nearby sorry officer lance said shaking the water from his hair like a dog our friend forgot she doesnt know how to swim you all right the officer asked me i could tell by the timbre of his voice that he was young and more amused than concerned shes fine lance said with another shake of his head im the one you should be worrying about she almost killed me out there last time i play hero ill tell you that pretty stupid stunt lady a second officer admonished looking directly at me and i understood by his tone that it was the end of a long shift and the last thing he wanted was unnecessary overtime i noted that he was about the same height and weight as his partner with the same thick neck and square chest you better get this lady home he advised i think shes done enough celebrating for one night i opened my mouth and tried to speak but no sound emerged what could i tell them after all that i was drunk on champagne and high on marijuana that i suspected id been slipped some lsd did i really think that truthfully at that moment i didnt know what to think i wasnt certain of anything not what had happened earlier not what was happening now thank you officers lance was calling after the already retreating policemen happy new year when they were out of sight he turned back to me as alisons arm tightened around my waist you heard what the man said time to get you home the rest of the night is a blur i remember images lances knuckles white against the black of the steering wheel alisons wet hair clinging to the gaunt crevices of her face as tears continued spilling from her eyes my uniform wet and cold riding high on my thighs my sheer stockings ripped and speckled with sand i remember sounds the wetness of our clothes against the leather of the seats a horn blasting as a car sped past us on the inside lane the nervous tapping of lances foot on the brake as we waited for a light to change from red to green i remember the silence and then we were home and everyone was talking at once what a night how is she what happens now i remember being halfcarried halfdragged toward my front door what are you going to do to me i recall whispering what did she say what do you think were going to do to you whats she babbling about alisons voice as clear as the proverbial bell you guys should go now we can handle it from here i remember stumbling up the steps alisons hand loosely on my elbow lances arm tight now around my waist my bedroom swirled around me as if i were on an ocean liner during stormy seas i fought to stay upright as alison slipped from my side ended up on her knees beside my bed what the hell are you doing lance demanded gripping me tighter as if afraid i might bolt his fingernails carving small niches into my flesh you know what im doing alison answered defensively pushing herself back to her feet checking for bogeymen i told him silently then laughed out loud jeez two lunatics lance said his fingers at the front of my uniform struggling with the top button as alison left the room dont i protested weakly you want to go to bed soaking wet i can get undressed by myself lance took a step back suit yourself im happy to watch i think you should leave now thats not very hospitable lance said managing to sound hurt especially after i saved your life had he i wondered again or had he tried to end it alison reentered the room several large white towels in her hands she threw one at lance were they going to tie me up gag me then smother me with my own pillow i felt the towels in my hair at my breasts between my legs my wet uniform was scraped from my body a dry nightgown lowered over my head like a shroud hold still lance said ill do it alison instructed strong hands guided me toward the bed pushed me down on top of it covered me with a blanket think she has any clue whats going on lance asked as i buried my head in the pillow and curled into a fetal ball no shes really out of it alison said so what do we do now i felt them watching me from the foot of the bed as if considering my fate weighing the alternatives i feigned sleep hinted at a snore i should probably stay with her overnight alison said what for shes not going anywhere i know but id still like to keep an eye on her fine ill keep you company no you go get some sleep you know i dont sleep well when youre not beside me i felt him move to her side lance dont come on sis dont be like that i tilted my chin opened my eyes just enough to peek through the layers of lashes see two forms merging at the foot of my bed dont alison said again this time with less conviction as lance standing behind her reached around to caress her breasts i felt a gasp building in my throat held my breath to keep it from escaping my lips i saw you you know alison continued as lance began nuzzling her neck flirting with denise dont think i didnt see you whats the matter sis you jealous this isnt right alison said as he twisted her around kissed her right on the lips were gonna burn in hell he agreed kissing her again i buried my face in the pillow smothered the fresh scream building in the pit of my stomach not here alison said huskily taking her brothers hand leading him from the room i waited until i knew they were gone before opening my eyes were they still in the house making love on the downstairs sofa in the next room i listened for sounds of their voices fearful of what other noises i might hear i lay there in the semidarkness for what felt like an eternity afraid to move the first moon of the new year filtering through the ivory curtains i was trapped inside my own house tied to my bed by invisible wires there was no escape i closed my eyes opened them again found myself staring into the blank eyes of the ladies head vase that sat on my night table the vase alison had bought me for christmas keeping an eye on me i thought and might have laughed had i not been so sickened by everything id seen i pushed myself into a sitting position determined to make a run for it but even as i watched myself in my minds eye climbing out of bed and getting dressed phoning for a taxi getting the hell out of my own house i knew i didnt have the strength to go anywhere my arms and legs were useless they hung from my sides like anchors my head felt as if some insane dentist had pumped it full of novocain already i was losing consciousness drifting in and out of reality i knew i had only seconds left before i fell into whatever void was waiting i threw myself off the bed my arms flailing about madly as if i were still in the ocean and unseen hands were pressing into the top of my head holding me down my hand smacked against the lamp on the night table and i heard something shatter the sound bounced off the walls whizzed by my ear like a bullet i looked toward the door expecting alison and her brother to come bursting through restrain me but no one came and i collapsed back into bed my strength gone i closed my eyes abandoned myself to whatever fate had in store i awoke to bright sunshine and the sound of alisons voice good morning sleepyhead happy new year she advanced toward me wearing a pink sweater over matching pink jeans looking like a long stick of cotton candy i pushed myself up in bed trying to clear my head the events of the night before coming to me in fits and starts like a videotape skipping in midreel what had happened last night what time is it its after twelve i guess i should have said good afternoon alison deposited a tray of freshly squeezed orange juice hot coffee and croissants across my lap breakfast in bed she said then laughed or lunch whatever the croissants are nice and fresh lance went to publix lance poked his head around alisons shoulder how you feeling i stared at him unable to speak had he tried to drown me in the ocean last night or had he saved my life had i really seen him and alison embracing at the foot of my bed had i dreamed the whole damn thing was that possible oh no alison cried suddenly what happened here alison knelt beside the bed and began picking up the broken pieces of the china head vase shed bought me for christmas what happened she repeated trying to fit the pieces back together i fought to remember the back of my hand tingling with the memory of having smacked against something the previous night maybe we can fix it dont bother lance said removing the shards from alisons hands couldnt have happened to a nicer girl if you ask me he shuddered visibly these ladies give me the creeps then he carried the pieces out of the room terry are you all right alison asked terry is something wrong i know i said to her under my breath know what i saw you i continued boldly last night with your brother oh god alison said as lance returned to the room smiling broadly one broken lady easily disposed of was i next so has terry recovered from her excellent adventure she saw us alison said her voice a monotone saw us the smile slowly faded from his face as his eyes moved rapidly between us i saw you kissing i said flatly you saw us kissing the smile returned to lances eyes played with the corners of his lips what else did you see enough i pushed the breakfast tray aside climbed out of bed not sure whether my legs would hold me immediately something stabbed at the bottom of my foot i cried out fell back against the bed hugged my knee to my chest saw a small sliver of china sticking out from between my toes looks like the lady bites lance said taking my injured foot in his hands dont i said as alison had said last night weakly without much conviction alison ran from the room returned seconds later with a wet towel be still lance said relax i watched as he gently plucked the piece of china from my foot drawing only a drop of blood then patting it away with the towel seems like im always coming to your rescue he said without a trace of irony i tried to remove my foot from his grasp but he held on tight id like you to leave please terry alison said from somewhere beside me i can explain i dont need any explanations please its not what you think and what do i think again i tried to remove my leg from lances sturdy hands but his fingers had begun expertly massaging the sole of my foot and i realized with no small degree of shock that i didnt want him to stop you think hes my brother alison said lances knuckles moved to the base of my toes kneading my calloused flesh manipulating my muscles as easily as alison manipulated my emotions hes not my brother my husband used to give the best foot massages its probably why i married him certainly it would explain why i kept going back to him he had the best hands once he started massaging my feet i was a goner hes your husband i said my voice free of inflection why hadnt i realized it earlier why had it taken me so long to figure out what should have been obvious all along exhusband alison qualified lance palmay he said extending his right hand pleasure to meet you i ignored him concentrated on alison you lied to me i said stating the obvious why im so sorry i didnt know what else to do have you ever heard of the truth i reclaimed my foot from lances grasp pushed past him toward my closet where i threw a robe over my nightgown drew it tight around me never had i felt more vulnerable more exposed i wanted to tell you the truth alison protested but i was afraid afraid of what exactly afraid youd think i was some stupid weakwilled bimbo who falls to pieces every time her nogood exhusband shows up hey lance interrupted i wanted you to think well of me i wanted you to like me by lying to me it was stupid i can see that now but it seemed like a good idea at the time lance interjected shut up lance youre sure thats his real name i said alison looked stricken as if id slapped her across the face i phoned him after thanksgiving you were after me to call my family youre saying this is my fault no of course not im just saying that in a moment of weakness i called lance and told him where i was i didnt know hed come to florida or maybe i did i dont know i only know that when he showed up at my door i couldnt help myself he promised hed only stay a few days and i didnt want to upset you i knew your rules about no roommates i knew how skittish you were skittish she repeated softly smiling hopefully at me good word i felt a familiar tug the unwanted urge to take her in my arms and reassure her everything was going to be all right god i was as bad where she was concerned as she was with regard to her former husband if he was her former husband i thought wondering why i should believe anything she said alison changed stories as easily as she changed clothes what made me think she wasnt lying to me now so i lied to you alison continued as if reading my thoughts told you lance was my brother it just seemed easier that way you dont have a brother i stated more than asked no i do alison said quickly i do she repeated unnecessarily looking toward the floor as if afraid to let me see her face theres something youre not telling me no nothing ive told you everything she was lying i knew it and she knew i did it was the reason she couldnt look me in the eye i thought we were friends i said weakly not sure what else to say we are friends she pleaded friends dont lie to each other they dont keep secrets they dont have hidden agendas alisons eyes shot to mine for a second it looked as if she were about to break down and tell me everything reveal the whole ugly truth of what she was really up to confess her part in last nights mayhem unravel the entire charade but she said nothing and the moment passed i think you should leave now i told her she nodded turned to go ill call you later no you dont understand i want you to leave for good what i want you out of here you cant mean that hey terry lance interjected dont you think youre overreacting was i overreacting last night when you tried to kill me i shot back what lance said what alison echoed what the hell are you talking about the look lance gave me was equal parts amusement and fury youre out of your fucking mind you know that lady i want you out of my cottage i insisted out of my life no please alison cried ill give you till the end of the day i said but thats so unfair i think the law says youve got to give us at least a months notice lance said lazily and i dont know about you terry but i dont react too well to ultimatums if you dont leave ill call the police hows that for an ultimatum pretty lame lance said think you better call your lawyer too lance will be gone within the hour alison said forcefully what lance exclaimed you cant be serious just go alison told him her eyes never leaving mine now lance shifted uneasily from one foot to the other his hands slapping his sides in frustration then he stormed from the room if you could just give me a few days to find another place alison said softly i promise ill be out of your hair if thats what you still want in truth i didnt know what i wanted part of me wanted alison gone immediately part of me wanted her to stay i said nothing for several seconds waiting for her to fill in the empty spaces the way she usually did to offer even a semiplausible explanation i could latch onto even after everything that had happened i was still looking for a reason to believe her fine i spit out the word as if it were a piece of rotten meat you have till the weekend if youre not gone by then ill call the authorities thank you alison breathed a deep sigh of relief then she spun around her face disappearing inside a blur of strawberry curls i heard her footsteps retreating down the stairs the kitchen door opening and slamming shut i watched her from the bedroom window as she ran toward the cottage then stopped turned back toward the house i thought i saw her smile i didnt see alison at all during the next several days nor did i see lance although i doubted he was really gone i knew the matter was far from resolved that they werent likely to leave emptyhanded not with all the time and effort invested in me so far i lay in bed that first night trying to figure out how much of what alison had told me was true wondering where the lies ended and the truth began if indeed thered been any truth to anything shed said ever what difference did the truth make anyway looking back i see that alisons great gift was her uncanny ability to make me doubt myself to make me question what was beyond question to make me see things that werent really there to not see things that were in spite of everything i had to keep reminding myself that alison was not the sweet young woman id welcomed into my life but a liar a con artist and quite possibly a coldblooded killer i wasnt her friend i was her target a carefully selected one at that and judging by what id read in her journal i wasnt the first unsuspecting woman shed duped what had happened to the others and why that was the part i couldnt get past the part that kept me awake at night tossing restlessly back and forth in my bed not when alison and her cohorts might strike again but why why what was she after what do you want from me i should have demanded of her why did you seek me out work so hard to make me your friend what is it you think i have thats of any value what was the point what do you mean would have come her inevitable response green eyes wide with confusion expressive hands aflutter i dont know what youre talking about in my lighter moments i told myself i was out of danger that by confronting alison and ordering her to vacate the premises by threatening to call the police if she wasnt gone by the end of the week id effectively put the kibosh to her little scheme but in my darker moments i recognized that the only thing id accomplished was a slight delay a modest retooling of her plans that alison was simply biding her time waiting for just the right moment to come at me again at any rate several days passed without further incident alison made no further attempts to talk to me the white lincoln disappeared from my street i went to work tended to my patients and almost managed to convince myself that the worst was over on the morning of january i was getting ready for work when the phone rang i knew that josh had returned from california the night before and id been eagerly anticipating his call all morning i glanced in the mirror over my dresser trying to see myself through joshs eyes noting the cut alison had given me was growing out and i was in need of a trim impatiently pushing my hair behind my ears i pinched my cheeks to give them needed color then walked to the phone and not wanting to appear too anxious waited one more ring before answering it hello i said huskily as if freshly roused from sleep although id been up for hours erica says to wish you a happy new year the voice announced go to hell i shot back about to hang up the phone i believe you have something that belongs to her the voice continued undeterred i dont know what youre talking about i think you do youre wrong i have no idea what you want shed like it back like what back i felt the line go dead in my hands wait what do you mean i have something of ericas wait i continued shouting long after i knew the caller had hung up what could i possibly have of ericas the necklace i realized with a start the heartshaped pendant alison had found beneath her bed and worn proudly around her neck until id bought her one all her own but it couldnt be worth more than a few hundred dollars and erica owed me far more than that in back rent erica had never struck me as the sentimental type but then i was a lousy judge of character i reminded myself look how easily id allowed myself to be duped by alison my mind was racing thoughts crashing into one another like ocean waves what was ericas connection to alison had erica left behind more than the necklace something valuable shed hidden inside the cottage and was that something the reason alison had shown up on my doorstep gone out of her way to befriend me what did she think i had good god i said my head swimming as i grabbed my purse and ran down the stairs and out the front door did i really think alison had any intention of vacating my cottage by the end of the week that she and lance would depart emptyhanded i stood paralyzed by the side of my car not knowing what to do knowing only that time was running out that i couldnt continue to stay in my house that i had to talk to someone i had to talk to josh i returned to the house full of fresh resolve locking the door behind me and marching purposefully to the phone in the kitchen i punched in the familiar numbers then waited while the phone rang once twice three times before someone picked it up fourthfloor nurses station margot speaking margot its terry there was desperation in my voice as if someone had pushed it from a high ledge whats the matter you sound awful i dont think i can come in today dont tell me youve got that horrible flu bug thats making the rounds i dont know maybe can you manage without me guess well have to dont want you coming in sick im so sorry it just hit all of a sudden thats how these things work i felt fine last night i embellished knowing i should stop while i was ahead that the more lies i told the more likely i was to trip myself up wasnt that what had happened to alison well get back into bed take two tylenol and drink plenty of fluids you know the routine i feel really bad about this just feel better margot instructed i raced up the stairs to my bedroom where i swapped my nurses uniform for a pair of navy pants and matching jersey i packed the uniform along with another change of clothes and some underwear into the large overnight bag i kept at the back of my closet i wasnt sure how long id be gone or where id be staying but one thing was now crystal clear i couldnt stay here would josh insist i stay at his place i wondered throwing in my yellow dress with the plunging neckline in case he suggested somewhere nice for dinner or maybe id stay in one of those funky little art deco hotels in south beach maybe josh would stay with me i projected giddily opening the bottom drawer of my dresser and removing the slinky lavender nightgown lance had given me for christmas i tossed it into the bag thinking how ironic it would be to wear a gift from my wouldbe killer to a tryst with my wouldbe lover recognizing i was beyond giddy and was now verging on outright hysteria i took a series of long deep breaths trying to calm myself down i knew i was behaving foolishly even irrationally but it was as if in finally deciding to take action id unleashed a part of me id repressed for far too long the part that was determined to enjoy life take risks have fun the part that was tired of being surrounded by death the part that wanted to live i finished packing debated whether to call josh tell him i was coming then decided to surprise him instead i told myself i didnt have time for unnecessary phone calls but maybe i was just afraid hed tell me not to come that he was too busy to see me and i couldnt risk that i needed josh to be there for me i was at the car when i realized id left my nurses shoes on the floor by the bed i knew id need them if i chose to return to work the next day so i tossed my overnight bag into the backseat and reluctantly returned to the house taking the stairs two at a time i was doubled over and gasping for air when i reached my bedroom and saw my shoes standing by the foot of the bed as if waiting for me i was leaving the room when a cursory glance out the bedroom window revealed alison emerging from the cottage i raced downstairs coming to an abrupt halt at my front door fighting to catch my breath i couldnt appear panicky it was imperative everything appear normal alison couldnt suspect i was poised to take flight going somewhere she asked waiting by the side of my car her head tilting toward the overnight bag on the backseat i joined a gym thought id work out before going to the hospital i held up my nurses shoes for added credibility she seemed to accept my explanation terry im going to be late i opened the car door threw my shoes inside walked around to the drivers side of the car please i need to talk to you really alison i dont see the point just hear me out then if you still want me to leave i will i promise ive already rented out the cottage i told her watching her eyes widen in alarm a nurse at the hospital shes moving in on saturday alisons head snapped toward the cottage a gasp caught in her throat look i backtracked suddenly afraid she might try to restrain me if she thought shed run out of time if you really want to talk well do it when i get home from work relief flooded alisons face thatd be great it might be quite late thats fine ill wait up okay i climbed into the car and started the engine ill see you later later she agreed tapping on the hood of the car as i backed out of the driveway later i thought im not sure why i chose i over the turnpike always take the turnpike i recalled myra wylies advice to her son you get in an accident on and you can be stuck all day which was exactly what was happening i realized opening my window and craning my neck to see what was causing the prolonged delay but all i saw were long lines of cars like brightly colored snakes stalled and going nowhere god get me out of here i whispered flicking the dials of the car radio trying to find a traffic report i dont have time for this i heard alan jackson singing about lost love on one station and janet jackson singing about finding it on another maybe it was the same love i thought a laugh catching in my throat maybe alan and janet jackson were brother and sister or husband and wife just like alison and lance i laughed out loud catching the worried glance of the driver in the car beside me i am not going to think about alison i whispered through barely parted lips then flipped to another station listening as a male announcer swapped inane banter with his female counterpart so cathy how many new years resolutions have you broken so far i never make new years resolutions dave why cathy because i always break them i flipped to another station a fourcar collision just south of the exit to broward boulevard is holding up traffic on i the newscaster announced with the practiced calm of someone used to detailing disasters ambulances are on the scene great i turned off the radio not wanting to hear more a fourcar collision complete with ambulances and police cars meant i wasnt going anywhere for some time there was nothing i could do about it so there was no point in getting upset about it too bad i hadnt packed a book i thought swiveling around to check the backseat maybe there was a magazine on the floor thats when i saw him oh god he was several cars behind me in the row to my right and after the initial shock i told myself i must be mistaken that my eyes were playing tricks on me again that the sunlight and my overactive imagination had combined to produce an image that couldnt possibly be real that when i looked again the image would be gone except that when i looked again he was still there tall even sitting down his skinny frame was hunched over the wheel of his car small brown eyes peering over the top of his strong hawklike nose he was staring straight ahead as if unaware of my existence was it possible he didnt know i was there that our being on the same stretch of highway at the same time was nothing but a strange coincidence and then he leaned forward rested his chin on the top of his steering wheel and turned his gaze purposefully to mine his narrow lips creasing into a slow smile why terry painter i could almost hear him say as i live and breathe shit i cursed out loud watching as kc emerged from his car and sauntered lazily between the intervening cars toward me his fingers hooked into the pockets of his tight jeans what was i going to do what could i do make a run for it where would i go damn it why didnt i have a cell phone i was probably the only person left on the planet who didnt own one who hated their mounting proliferation their intrusion into every facet of our lives was i the only person who bristled at the sight of teenagers walking down the street phones dangling from their ears like earrings the person on the other end of the line more important than the person right beside them i loathed the selfishness the weird antisocialness of it all besides it wasnt as if i got that many calls i thought as a shadow fell across the side window of my car i heard a tapping at my head and turned to see kc staring at me through the tinted glass he signaled for me to roll down my window and i complied it was unlikely hed try to harm me here i reasoned in the middle of a traffic jam with so many witnesses well well well he said that was all well well well do you think its a good idea to get out of your car he shrugged doesnt look like were going anywhere i nodded turned away where are you headed i asked not looking at him pretending to be concentrating on the traffic ahead nowhere in particular you nowhere in particular i repeated thought you might be going to see josh he said catching me by surprise id forgotten theyd met at my house over thanksgiving i noticed him looking at my overnight bag on the backseat ignored the snide grin that crept into his eyes as if he could see the silk lavender nightgown inside so i take it youre all recovered from your little new years eve swim a shiver traveled the length of my spine what exactly was kcs role in all this yes im fine now thank you you had us pretty worried im fine yeah well you should be more careful wouldnt want anything to happen to you would we i dont know would you his grin spread from his eyes to his lips he said nothing are you following me i demanded suddenly the grin overtook his entire face why would i be following you you tell me he shook his head youre imagining things terry then he straightened up slapped his open palm on the side of my car and took a step back as all around me cars began inching forward i heard the approaching roar of a motorcycle held my breath as first one then two more motorbikes whizzed by my eyes followed them as they weaved in and out of the stalled traffic shiny black helmets hiding their riders faces was the man in the red bandanna among them be sure to give josh my regards kc called as he returned to his car minutes later when i finally worked up the nerve to check in my rearview mirror i could still see him sitting behind the wheel of his car watching me we crawled along i for the better part of an hour by the time we reached broward boulevard the four cars involved in the accident had been moved to the side of the road and the ambulances had already gone judging by the mangled remains of two of the automobiles one a bright red porsche that now resembled nothing so much as a squashed tomato and a puddle of what appeared to be blood beside one of the tires i suspected serious injuries possibly even fatalities i wondered briefly whether any of the victims would eventually find their way to my ward at mission care prayed wed all be spared several police cars remained on the scene their officers trying to persuade motorists not to waste time gawking but of course everyone did we couldnt help ourselves keep moving one of the officers directed as i again checked my rearview mirror immediately kc waved his fingers at me in greeting as if he knew i was looking at him as if hed been watching all along waiting for our eyes to meet on impulse i lowered my window beckoned the policeman forward keep moving he repeated louder this time his large hands waving the traffic forward please can you help me im being followed i ventured timidly trying to make out the features beneath the officers protective helmet seeing only his dark glasses and the impatient set of his jaw sorry maam the policeman said his eyes darting back and forth among the cars clearly oblivious to what id said im afraid i have to ask you to move along i nodded raised the window glanced into the rearview mirror in time to see kc shaking his head and laughing as if he understood what id tried to do and was amused by my audacity or my stupidity what had i hoped to accomplish under the circumstances had i really expected the officer to listen to me let alone take my concerns seriously and even if he had what could he have done questioned kc on the spot thereby causing further traffic jams and longer delays then what would he have arrested him highly doubtful at best he would have hauled both of us off to the station a lot of good that would have done me excuse me sir but this woman claims you were following her following her terry did you tell the officer i was following you do you two know each other were friends officer she had me over to her house for thanksgiving dinner is this true maam yes but to tell you the truth officer shes been acting very strangely lately all her friends are worried about her i felt the officers judgmental nod still i reminded myself no matter how strong kcs denials my complaint would be a matter of record at the very least it might buy me some time again i lowered my window waved the officer over please officer can you help me is there a problem maam he leaned in toward me removing his dark glasses with an impatient hand i saw that he was young younger than i maybe even younger than kc i also heard by his tone by the way he said maam that he would have a hard time believing a young man like kc would waste his time following a middleaged woman like me the thought now occurred to me that i would be dismissed as a troublemaker that by mouthing off prematurely i would effectively destroy any credibility i might need in the future no i decided i would accomplish nothing by crying wolf and i would miss seeing josh who was my only real hope was anybody hurt i asked fraid so the officer said pushing his sunglasses back across the bridge of his nose backing away im a nurse if theres anything i can do but the policeman wasnt interested in my offer of help its been taken care of came his curt reply keep moving please the traffic thinned out after that and by the time we reached hollywood boulevard it was back to its normal pace i picked up my speed zigzagging between lanes whenever possible trying to escape kc but he remained stubbornly on my tail in an effort to shake him i almost took the exit at miami shores then decided against it i didnt know the area and if i was going to try to lose kc it was probably better to do it somewhere i wouldnt get lost myself he was still behind me when i transferred onto us heading south somewhere between coconut grove and coral gables where josh lived kc vanished this wasnt due to any clever maneuvering on my part on the contrary one minute he was behind me the next minute he was gone i checked my rearview mirror at each stoplight i saw a woman in a black accord talking animatedly on her cell phone a woman in a creamcolored minivan trying to subdue a backseat of unruly children and a man picking his nose in a green bmw kc and his marooncolored impala were nowhere to be seen which didnt mean he wasnt lurking about i realized repeatedly swiveling around in my seat scanning my surroundings for anyone remotely suspicious both the make and color of kcs car told me it was likely a rental again i wondered how he fit into alisons plan the sound of a car horn brought me back to the here and now the light had turned green and i was being urged forward i continued driving north along us repeatedly checking my rearview mirror twisting around in my seat at each subsequent red light but it appeared my efforts had been successful i lost him i announced triumphantly turning to the car next to me in time to see a welldressed middleaged man jam his index finger high inside his left nostril wonderful i said entering the town of coral gables and continuing past the grand geometrically designed entertainment and shopping complex known as paseos in the heart of the tidy miami suburb i deliberately avoided the famous miracle mile district turning left then right then right again looking for sunset place i took several wrong turns found myself back where i started and almost had a heart attack when i saw a marooncolored impala pull up behind me but one peek at the wizened grayhaired man stooped over the steering wheel quickly brought my heart rate back to normal i laughed at my paranoia and shook my head continuing on eventually i found myself on the right street albeit at the wrong end sunset place was typical of many streets in the area a palm lined avenue full of small spanishstyle bungalows in all the colors of the rainbow josh lived with his children at number a neat white house with a sloping browntile roof and a beautiful front garden filled with coral and white impatiens as well as a variety of other flowers whose blooms i recognized but whose names always eluded me i parked on the street directly across from joshs house then sat for several minutes trying to decide my next move how had i come this far without a plan what was i doing showing up at his door uninvited and unannounced at just after one oclock on a friday afternoon my stomach was rumbling as i opened the car door and climbed out black rain clouds hovered ominously overhead like bruises on an otherwise blue sky and i debated whether i should go somewhere for lunch before seeing josh then decided to wait maybe josh would suggest lunch at his favorite neighborhood cafe unless he wasnt alone i thought stopping in the middle of the road school didnt start till monday it was entirely possible his children would be at home what was i going to say to them hi its your aunt terry come for an extended stay and what if josh wasnt there i asked myself returning to the sidewalk his car wasnt in the driveway so it was entirely possible that despite his having just returned from his vacation he was already off visiting clients or maybe he was in delray seeing his mother i realized with a start it was friday after all didnt he always visit his mother on fridays of course he was in delray what a fool i was coming all this way when all id had to do was go to work as usual what was the matter with me what in the world had i been thinking and then the woodpaneled front door to joshs house opened and suddenly josh was standing in the doorway looking tanned and unbearably handsome in a dark shortsleeved shirt and faded denim jeans he looked up and down the street glanced at the increasingly menacing clouds and was about to go back inside when his gaze drifted across the street toward me terry he mouthed in obvious surprise crossing the street in several long quick strides it is you josh hello has something happened to my mother is she all right what is it the questions toppled from his mouth like a line of dominoes nothings happened to your mother shes fine i talked to her less than an hour ago he said as if i hadnt spoken josh your mothers fine his shoulders relaxed although tension still narrowed his eyes then i dont understand what are you doing here i need to talk to you about my mother what was the matter with him hadnt i already explained my visit had nothing to do with his mother no josh your mother is doing remarkably well for a woman with both cancer and heart disease shes been a little depressed lately yes but thats pretty normal during the holiday season shell bounce back in fact im beginning to think shell outlive us all he smiled the lines on his forehead releasing slowly like an elastic band well thats a relief anyway ive been feeling so guilty these last weeks nonsense i said in my mothers voice before biting down on my tongue allowing a softer voice to emerge you werent gone long enough to feel guilty i lay my hand on his arm trying to reassure him he flinched as if id burned him with a match and pulled away coughing into his hand he stared in the direction of his open front door was he thinking of inviting me inside or making a run for the house feel like a cup of coffee he asked surprising me with the sudden warmth of his smile coffee sounds good actually lunch sounded even better but he didnt suggest it and since he already seemed spooked by my showing up on his doorstep without prior notice i didnt want to appear too presumptuous maybe wed go for an early dinner i thought hopefully as he led me into the rose marble foyer the interior of the house was surprisingly spacious consisting of one large common area that encompassed living dining and family rooms the kitchen was at the back as were two small bedrooms i caught only a brief glimpse of the master bedroom suite at the front noticed the bed was unmade and felt a slight weakening of my knees your home is lovely i remarked leaning against the tan ultrasuede of the living room sofa for support eyeing the clean lines of the modern minimalist furniture throughout the house how do you take your coffee black i reminded him a smile masking my disappointment that he hadnt remembered be right back make yourself at home he disappeared into the kitchen i crossed the whitetiled floor punctuated at irregular intervals by a series of muted needlepoint rugs the room surprised me it didnt seem to reflect the josh wylie i knew at all not that i knew him that well but id always assumed that joshs tastes would be closer my own that they leaned more toward comfort than style more toward tradition than trends i reminded myself that this was the house josh had shared with his former wife decided that the decor was probably more to her taste than his he just hadnt gotten around to changing it i concluded perhaps out of respect for his childrens feelings the walls were white and largely bare a few unimpressive lithographs hung at either side of the dining room table and a large abstract painting of what looked to be a bowl of fruit occupied the far wall of the family room i thought how nicely my own paintings would go in these rooms the lush flowers replacing the anemic bowl of fruit the unimaginative mirror by the front door usurped by the girl with the large hat on the beach why had alison given me such an expensive gift i wondered suddenly feeling my stomach cramp as if id been sucker punched id let my guard down for only a fraction of a second and alison had used it to sneak inside my head go away i warned her youre not welcome in this house im safe here still experience had shown me that once alison had her foot in the door she was remarkably difficult to dislodge thoughts of her now swirled about my head the first image of her in my doorway the magic way shed twirled about the cottage her wondrous hair on my pillow as she slept ericas necklace around her neck the necklace id given her at christmas to replace it and all the gifts shed given me the earrings the head vase the painting so extravagant had she paid for it at all or had denise simply removed it from her aunts inventory and what exactly was denises part in all this was it possible the women had known each other all along that denise nickson and erica hollander were two pieces of the puzzle that was alison simms youre a stupid stupid girl i heard my mother say i hope the coffees still good its been brewing all morning josh announced returning to the room with two steaming mugs coming to an abrupt stop when he saw me terry whats wrong you look like youve just seen a ghost i raised my hands in the air felt them shake i opened my mouth but no words came tears filled my eyes until this moment i hadnt realized how scared i really was how long id been denying my anxieties suppressing my fears and how desperately lonely id been and for how long i was tired of being brave rational and independent i was none of those things and i couldnt survive this on my own i needed someone to stand beside me someone to protect me from harm i needed josh it took all my resolve to keep from throwing myself into his arms to refrain from telling him what was in my heart how much i needed him wanted him loved him yes loved him i realized catching my breath in my lungs holding the words tight against my chest like smoke from a marijuana cigarette hold me i whispered my voice a plea immediately i felt joshs arms around me his lips in my hair im sorry i havent called you he was saying youve been away i wiped the tears from my eyes raised my lips to his youre here now im here now he repeated pressing his lips to mine lifting me into his arms and into the air carrying me toward the master bedroom like clark gable carrying vivien leigh grappling with my clothes as he fell on top of me across the unmade bed except he did none of those things said nothing of the sort while my imagination was busy sweeping me into his arms and into his bed he was already pulling out of my arms and out of my reach please i heard myself say in a desperate bid to hold on to him terry listen im so glad youre back ive missed you so much oh god terry i owe you an apology an apology no theres nothing to apologize for please tell me theres nothing to apologize for so much has happened josh said retreating to the other side of the glass table that held our coffee the steam from the mugs wafted into the still air like delicate streamers creating a scrim between us what do you mean whats happened im so sorry if ive misled you in any way i dont understand how have you misled me i should have told you earlier actually i assumed my mother already had told me what he lowered his head as if he were ashamed jan and i are back together his words slammed against my ears what jan and i he began as if he actually thought i hadnt heard him the first time when i interrupted feeling sick to my stomach just before christmas before christmas i echoed as if only the repetition of the words would make them sink in i wanted to tell you but you didnt im a coward it was easier to just keep canceling our dates and to be honest i wasnt sure if things would work out with jan so what are you saying that you were using me as backup in case your reconciliation didnt take i didnt mean it that way how exactly did you mean it the kids are so happy he said after a pause as if this explained everything a numbness was creeping steadily into my arms and legs buzzing about my head like a pesky mosquito so thanksgiving meant nothing to you thats not true thanksgiving was wonderful the kiss kisses they were meaningless they were beautiful but meaningless another pause longer than the first terry lets not do this lets not do what id like us to stay friends friends dont lie to each other hadnt i just said the same thing to alison it was never my intention to lie then listen i have a little something for you he walked quickly to the bedroom at the front of the house returned seconds later with a package wrapped in bright blue foil i meant to give it to you earlier he dropped the package into my hands whats this i wanted to thank you again for taking such good care of my mother your mother i felt a stab of humiliation so deep i almost doubled over i take it she knew you and jan were back together why do you think shes been so depressed she didnt tell me shes not too happy about it shes your mother shell come around arent you going to open your present i tore at the paper without enthusiasm a journal i said turning it over in my hands thinking of alison i wasnt sure if you kept one or not guess ill have to start im really sorry terry i never meant to hurt you he broke off looked toward the front door expecting company i asked coldly jan and the kids are at the mall they should be home pretty soon he looked anxiously at his watch i guess your wife wouldnt be too happy to find me here it would probably just confuse things well we certainly wouldnt want anyone to be confused i said walking to the door had i really expected him to protect me from anyone terry he called after me i stopped turned around dont go i need you ill find a way out of this mess i love you do you think you might talk to my mother try to get her to understand she loves you like a daughter i know shed listen to you again i nodded thinking this whole scene might be funny if it werent so mindnumbingly awful ill see what i can do thank you goodbye josh take care of yourself ill try i said closing the door behind me goddamn you you stupid stupid girl i railed at myself in my mothers voice how could you be so dumb have you no pride no selfrespect youre forty years old for gods sake have you learned nothing in all that time do you know so little about men ha i laughed ignoring the notsofurtive glances of other drivers as i banged down on the steering wheel inadvertently blasting the horn why stop with men you know nothing about anyone there isnt a worse judge of character in the entire world all someone has to do is show you a little kindness the tiniest bit of interest and you cant do enough for them you open your house you open your heart you open your legs i continued silently too ashamed to say the words out loud even in the closed confines of my car a man takes you out for one measly little lunch and already you have him marching down the aisle youre a stupid stupid girl you deserve to be taken advantage of you deserve to lose everything youre too damn stupid to live youre a stupid stupid girl i heard my mother say i thought of the unmade bed in joshs bedroom had he and jan had sex this morning before shed left for the mall were the crumpled sheets still redolent with the scent of their lovemaking youre an idiot i shouted my words bouncing off the car windows to slap me in the face people as stupid as you are dont deserve to live i looked into the rearview mirror saw my mothers eyes i didnt need the sound of her voice to know what she was thinking how could you do this her eyes burned into mine until my own eyes clouded over with so many tears she was no longer visible who needed my mothers harsh pronouncements when i was doing such a good job on my own youre a stupid stupid girl i was still repeating as i pulled into my driveway and fumbled in my purse for my house keys you deserve whatever happens to you i checked the street for lances white lincoln come and get me i cried at the quiet street the threat of rain still hovering overhead game over i give up but a quick glance told me lances car was nowhere in sight probably had it parked somewhere around the block i decided pushing the tears away from my swollen eyes with the palms of my hands and running toward my front door repeatedly jabbing the key into the lock until i heard the familiar click the door fell open i marched into the living room roughly pushing the christmas tree out of my way then watched it teeter precariously on its stand before falling against the wall its ornaments dropped from its branches and burst into delicate slivers of silver and pink on the hard floor should have taken this stupid thing down days ago should never have put it up in the first place stupid stupid stupid i ripped a handful of festive bows from the trees drying limbs then stomped on them to imagine that alison had ever really liked me to think josh had ever really cared why would anyone want you why would anyone want to be your friend your lover my mother was right she was always right i was nothing but a stupid stupid girl i deserved everything that happened to me how could you do this my mother demanded sneaking up behind me as i entered the kitchen go away i cried please go away leave me alone you did your job well i dont need you anymore from their lofty position my mothers collection of ladies head vases sneered at my naivete my mothers words continuing to assault me through their empty eyes and forced smiles i watched in horror as my arm suddenly shot out and swept across the bottom shelf instantly the line of china heads went flying in all directions like a swarm of angry bees and then the next row and the next i grabbed the head that alison had admired her first time in this room the one that resembled my mother with her judgmental imperious gaze like some snooty society matron looking down her nose at the rest of us alison had said i held the china head high into the air then flung it with all my might across the room it exploded upon contact with the wall bursting into the air like a firecracker i laughed as colorful shards of porcelain flew about the room covering the floor like confetti terry a voice cried out from outside the kitchen door terry whats happening let me in please let me in the doorknob twisted frantically from side to side i took a second to catch my breath then pulled open the kitchen door my god terry alison exclaimed a look of horror overwhelming her sweet face whats going on here what are you doing look at you youre bleeding i raised a hand to my forehead felt blood on my fingers terry whats wrong did something happen a wail like an ancient chant began building in my gut filling my mouth like water until it poured from my lips spilled onto the floor and eventually flooded the room i fell to my knees the sound of bottomless grief bouncing off the walls pieces of broken china piercing my clothing attaching themselves to my skin like burrs instantly alison was at my side rocking me in her arms kissing my bloodied forehead begging me to tell her what was wrong almost immediately i felt myself being sucked back into her orbit falling under her spell even now after all the lies and deceit after everything i knew to be true and everything i knew to be false i wanted nothing more than to believe she was truly concerned about me that no matter what was about to happen she wouldnt let any harm come my way im such a fool i whispered no no youre not a fool i am tell me what happened please terry tell me i looked into her eyes through the thick veil of my tears i was almost able to convince myself of her sincerity might as well tell her what happened i decided wincing at the sight of my blood on her lips she and her friends could have a good laugh about it later josh is back with his wife i said simply then almost laughed myself oh terry im so sorry this time i actually did manage a strangulated chuckle thats what he said you saw him i told her the whole pathetic story of my visit with josh knowing kc had probably already phoned her informed her of my plans had she been sitting by the window anxiously awaiting my return bastard she uttered now giving my shoulder a gentle squeeze no its my fault how is it your fault because it always is i thought but didnt say because im such a fool i said instead if youre a fool that must make me a fullout moron i laughed as i did so often when i was with her i mean look at me and lance for heavens sake alison continued without prompting after everything ive been through with him after all my resolutions about not letting him back into my life what do i do the first time he shows up at my door i invite him in hell i practically drag him inside the house it doesnt matter that i know hes no good for me that i know sooner or later hes going to break my heart screw things up the way he always does what things i interrupted she shrugged sadly things like he did with you i waited feeling the tension in her arms wondering if she was about to open up tell me everything but she didnt and the moment passed where is lance i looked toward the back door halfexpecting him to be standing there gone gone where alison shook her head her hair tickling the side of my face dont know dont care you mean hes gone back to chicago dont know alison said again i guess hell go wherever denise tells him to hes with denise should have seen that one coming i guess she hit her forehead with her hand as if trying to knock some sense into it what the hell it was over anyway finally about time she added for emphasis i nodded although i doubted lance was really gone men she said as if the word were a curse cant live with em cant shoot em i said recalling the words to an old country song im so sorry about everything if i could just go back to the beginning start over again what would you do i wouldnt give lance the time of day thats for sure id run for the hills the minute i saw him before it was too late its never too late i said as if pleading my case do you really believe that i shrugged who knew what i believed anymore ive been such a fool alisons eyes probed mine as if she were reaching into my soul hes the fool how could anyone not want you i studied her face for signs of ridicule but all i saw were fresh tears welling up in those enormous green eyes her lips quivered as i rubbed her tears away the blood from my finger staining her skin like an errant brushstroke as i took her cheeks in my hands and drew her face gently toward mine i dont know what it was fear disillusion longing maybe a combination of all those things that brought my lips so close to hers i wondered only briefly what i was doing then closed my mind to further thought as i shut my eyes grazed her lips with my own instantly alison pulled back as josh had earlier out of my arms out of my reach no thats not what i meant you dont understand my god i said scrambling to my feet my hand covering my mouth my god oh my god alison was on her feet beside me its all right terry please it was a misunderstanding its all my fault what have i done i stared down at all the shattered women at my feet at their lost earrings and broken strands of pearls pieces of their smiles mixed with stiff strands of their hair all the kings horses and all the kings men i thought seeing my reflection in alisons horrified eyes knowing we were all broken beyond repair that nothing could be done to put any of us back together again i have to get out of here i cried fleeing the carnage racing for the front door alison was right behind me terry wait let me come with you no please just leave me alone leave me alone i was in my car before she could stop me the doors locked the engine running the car in reverse my foot on the gas terry please come back i backed out of the driveway and onto the street mowing over the grass of the corner lot and almost colliding with bettye mccoy and her stupid dogs two blocks away in response she gave me the finger and called me a name although it was my mothers voice i heard i drove through the streets of delray for the better part of an hour drawing comfort from the little seaside town that had somehow managed to retain its quaint thriving downtown without falling prey to the towering office buildings and ugly strip malls of most of floridas older cities i drove past the small old homes of the historic marina district past the newer oceanfront condominiums and luxury estates along the coast then doubled back headed for the gated communities retirement enclaves and country clubs that existed west of the city limits i drove until my legs were stiff and my hands felt welded to the steering wheel i drove until the dark black clouds spreading above my head exploded in a thunderous rage flooding the thoroughfares with sheets of angry rain then i pulled the car over to the side of the road and quietly watched the rain as it pounded against my windshield an eerie calm settling over me like a warm blanket my tears stopped my head cleared and i was no longer afraid i knew exactly what i had to do twenty minutes later i pulled my car into the parking lot of mission care and ran through the continuing downpour into the lobby shaking the water from my hair as i headed for the stairwell i kept my head down not wanting anyone to see me i was supposed to be in bed with the flu after all not gallivanting around in the rain besides my visit was personal not professional there was no reason for anyone to know i was there i climbed the steps to the fourth floor stopping at the landing to catch my breath before cracking open the door and peeking my head around no one was there so i proceeded cautiously down the corridor i was halfway down the hall when one of the staff doctors emerged from a patients room heading right for me i thought of lowering my head stooping to pick up an invisible penny from the floor maybe even ducking into a nearby room but i did none of those things instead i gave the young doctor a shy smile preparing to tell him how much better i was feeling thank him so much for asking but the vacant smile he offered in return announced he had no idea who i was that i was as faceless to him in my street clothes as i was in my nurses uniform i could have been anyone i realized in fact i was no one myra wylie was lying in bed staring at the ceiling when i pushed open the door to her room and stepped inside please go away she said without looking to see who it was myra its me terry terry she turned her cheek to me smiled with her eyes how are you today i walked to her side grasped the bruised hand she extended toward me they told me you were sick i was im feeling much better now me too now that youre here has the doctor been in to see you yet he was here a little while ago he poked and prodded lectured me about eating more if i want to keep up my strength hes right i know i just dont seem to have much of an appetite these days not even for a piece of marzipan i produced a small candied apple from the pocket of my navy pants i stopped at the bakery on my way over in this rain its not so bad youre a darling girl i opened the wrapping broke the small piece of candy into two pieces placed one on the tip of her tongue enjoyed the pleasure that filled her eyes i saw josh today i said immediately her eyes darkened like the sky josh was here no i drove to coral gables you went to coral gables to his house i deposited the remaining piece of marzipan on her tongue to his house why i wanted to see him is there something wrong something the doctors havent told me no i reassured her quickly as id reassured her son only hours ago this wasnt about you it was about me concern swam through the milkiness of her eyes are you all right im fine i just needed to talk to josh myra looked puzzled she waited for me to continue he told me hes back with his wife yes he says youre not very happy about it im his mother if thats what he wants then im happy it seems it is im just an old worrywart i guess i dont want to see him get hurt again hes a big boy do they ever really grow up she asked how long have you known i think ive always known theyd get back together he never stopped loving her even after the divorce the minute she started making reconciliation noises i knew it was only a matter of time myra twisted her head from side to side no longer able to find a comfortable position here let me fluff that up for you thank you darling she smiled lifted her head allowed me to extricate one of the meager pillows from behind her head i wish youd told me i said kneading it with my fingers i wanted to but i felt a bit foolish after the things id said about her i hope you understand it would have saved me a lot of embarrassment im sorry dear i didnt think it would be a big deal i drove all the way down there made a complete fool of myself a sound halfway between a laugh and a cry escaped my lips how could you let me do that im so sorry dear i had no idea please forgive me i smiled smoothed several fine strands of hair away from her forehead i forgive you then i lowered the pillow i was holding to her face and held it over her nose and mouth until she stopped breathing its such a strange sensation killing another person myra wylie was surprisingly strong for someone so frail she fought me with a determination that was stunning in its ferocity her long skeletal arms flailing blindly toward me gnarled and brittle fingers clawing helplessly toward my throat the muscles in her neck warring with the pillow in my hands as her desperate lungs screamed silently for air such stubborn tenacity the instinct to survive in the face of certain even longedfor death caught me temporarily offguard and i almost lost my grip myra seized that split seconds hesitation with all the strength left in her twisting her head wildly from side to side and kicking frantically at her sheets i quickly refocused pressing down harder on the pillow patiently watching as her feet twitched to an almost graceful stop beneath the tightly tucked hospital corners of her narrow bed i listened to her last desperate intake of breath and smelled the pungent odor of urine as it leaked from her body then i counted slowly to one hundred and waited for the unmistakable stillness of death to overwhelm her only then did i remove the pillow from her face fluffing it out before returning it to behind her head careful to arrange her hair the way she liked it it was damp with the sweat of her exertion and i blew gently on the matted strands at her forehead in an effort to dry them watching as myras thin eyelashes fluttered girlishly in my warm breath as if she were flirting with me watery blue eyes stared up at me in frozen disbelief and i closed them with my lips my hands trembling toward the exaggerated open oval of her mouth contorted in a way to suggest that even now she was still trying to suck air into her withered broken frame my fingers quickly molded her lips into a more pleasing shape as if i were an artist working with fastdrying clay then i stood back and observed my handiwork she reminded me of one of those floats people buy for their pool stretched out and waiting to be inflated still i was satisfied that myra looked peaceful even happy as if shed simply slipped away from life in the middle of a pleasant dream goodbye myra i told her from the door sleep well i proceeded briskly down the hall toward the exit confident no one would notice me i even smiled at a young man on his way to visit his father the blank look i received in return reassuring me i was still invisible a ghost haunting the hallowed hospital halls as insubstantial and fleeting as a whisper in the wind how did i feel energized relieved possibly a little sad id always liked and admired myra wylie considered her a friend until shed betrayed me abused the many kindnesses id shown her until i realized she was no better than any of the others whod abused and betrayed me over the years and that like those others she was the author of her own misfortune responsible for and deserving of her fate not that i enjoyed being the minister of that fate the truth is that ive never liked watching people die never really gotten used to it no matter how many times ive borne witness maybe thats what makes me such a good nurse the fact that i genuinely care about people that i want nothing but the best for everyone the idea of taking a life is genuinely abhorrent to me as a nurse ive been trained to do everything in my power to sustain life although some might argue why sustain a life void of purpose a life that is increasingly more parasitic than human besides whom am i kidding nurses have no power even doctors whose exalted egos we stroke daily and whose daily mistakes were constantly covering up have no real power when it comes to matters of life and death were not the caregivers we claim to be were caretakers janitors really thats all we are looking after the leftover detritus of all the people whove exceeded their best before dates lance was right i pictured alisons exhusband if thats who he truly was tall slimhipped irredeemably handsome and wondered if he was really gone or was he still in delray squatting among the obscene appendages of an overgrown screw palm biding his time waiting for just the right moment to leap out at me from the darkness times up i thought with a smile i walked calmly down the four flights of stairs to the exit grateful to see the rain had stopped and that the storm clouds that had carpeted the sky all day had given way to the cautiously optimistic sun of twilight happy hour i thought checking my watch as i climbed into my car debating whether to stop on my way home for a celebratory drink deciding that it was still too early to celebrate that much still required my attention it was important that i be fully alert for the night ahead that i not let down my guard in any way a siren was wailing as i turned my car into the rushhour traffic along jog road and i watched an ambulance speed by on the outside shoulder probably on its way to the delray medical center i wondered how long it would be before one of the nurses looked in on myra checked her vital signs and realized she was dead i wondered if anyone would call me to relay the sad news she was my patient after all wheres my terry she would say the first words out of her mouth every morning as if i werent entitled to a few hours away from her side as if i werent entitled to a life of my own wheres my terry wheres my terry everyone always thought it was so cute heres your terry i said now gripping the steering wheel as if it were a pillow pushing on it with all my strength hearing the loud blast of the horn as it spun out into the traffic then crashed into the dying afternoon instantly half a dozen other horns began polluting the air with their mindless bleating like lambs to the slaughter i thought smiling at the motorist in the car ahead of mine as he extended the middle finger of his right hand into the air without even bothering to turn around why should he turn around what was there to see i was invisible there would be no autopsy there was no need myras death had been expected even anticipated it was long overdue there was nothing remotely surprising or suspicious about it an eightysevenyearold woman with both cancer and heart disease her death would be considered a blessing the nurses would acknowledge her passing with a collective nod of their heads and a brief notation in their charts the doctors would record the time of death and move on to the next cadaver inwaiting josh wylie would quietly arrange for his mothers burial a few weeks from now he might even send the staff an arrangement of flowers in appreciation of the excellent care his mother had received during her stay at mission care soon a new patient would occupy myras bed after eightyseven years it would be as if shed never existed an old song by the beatles she loves you yeah yeah yeah came on the radio and i sang along loudly with it surprised to discover i knew all the words this made me feel strangely exhilarated even elated the beatles were followed by neil diamond then elton john sweet caroline goodbye yellow brick road long a devotee of golden oldies i knew every word every beat every pause soldier boy i belted out along with the shirelles oh my little soldier boy bum bum bum bum bum ill be true to you im not sure why i decided not to park in my driveway why i chose to drive past my house circle back around the block instead and park around the corner was i looking for lances car if so i didnt see it was it possible he was really gone that i was truly safe i scoffed at my own naivete rechecking the street before getting out of my car and continuing briskly on foot careful to stay in the shadows of the growing darkness the hovering palm fronds above my head shaking in the wind like giant castanets when i reached seventh avenue i slowed my pace hunched my shoulders lowered my gaze approached my house as if i were about to pass it by then turned with seeming nonchalance at the last possible second and hurried up the path to the front door my key already secreted in my hand i pushed open the door locking it immediately behind me then ran to the living room window my heart thumping against my chest perspiration from my forehead forming a small puddle on the glass as i pressed my flesh against it my eyes racing up and down the quiet street was anyone watching its okay i said out loud youre okay i nodded as if to reassure myself further ignoring the toppled christmas tree and shattered ornaments as i walked into the kitchen listening to the crunch of broken china heads beneath my feet as i approached the back door my total focus on the small cottage behind my house the lights in the cottage were on which meant alison was probably home undoubtedly waiting for my car to turn into the driveway so that she could put the final phase of her plan into operation listen to me i said with a laugh final phase of her plan i repeated this time out loud and laughed again at the sound of it i sank into a kitchen chair and surveyed the mess of broken womens heads coating the floor my mothers pride and joy whats the matter girls pms got you down i kicked at the shards with my feet watching the jagged pieces skate across the floor and collide with other fragments an ear here a bow there an upturned collar a wayward hand i dont know what you have to complain about ladies you already had big holes in your heads i pushed myself off my chair and swept the mess into the center of the room first with my hands then with a broom it took the better part of half an hour to gather together and dispose of all the women i was working in the dark remember but ultimately i threw the whole mess into the garbage bin under the sink then went over the entire floor with a dustbuster and then again with a damp cloth when i was finished i was starving so i made myself a sandwich of leftover roast beef then washed it down with a tall glass of skim milk women need their calcium i remember thinking even invisible ones like me i returned to the window stared through the deepening veil of night at the tiny cottage that had once been my home a home for wayward girls i thought picturing first erica and then alison what was the matter with me that i was drawn to such people where was my judgment my common sense why was i constantly putting myself in such danger hadnt experience taught me anything at all my mothers silent scorn leaked through the ceiling from the upstairs bedroom like battery acid from a car engine and i felt it burning a hole in the top of my scalp another stupid woman with a gaping hole in her head i thought pulling at my hair as my mothers voice whispered in my ear you never learn you belong in the garbage with the others a sudden movement caught my eye and i flattened my back against the wall just as alison pulled back her living room curtain to stare outside she peered toward the driveway her face full of worry wondering where i am i realized wondering when im coming home she lingered at the window for several long seconds then backed away the curtains hiding her continuing vigil i had to be careful keep to the corners not let her know i was home until i had everything in place there was still so much to be done i pushed myself toward the kitchen counter reached for the shelves began gathering together the ingredients i would need duncan hines yellow cake mix a small box of instant chocolate pudding a cup of crisco oil a package of chopped walnuts a quarter cup of chocolate chippets four eggs and a cup of sour cream from the fridge terrys magic chocolate cake my mothers favorite i hadnt made it in years not since the night she died terry i could still hear her yelling at me from upstairs her voice strong despite the stroke that had rendered her body useless ill be up in a minute mother now im coming whats taking you so long ill be right up i stirred the ingredients together in a large bowl dropping the eggs onto the top of the cake mix instant pudding crisco and sour cream then mixing them in by hand so that i wouldnt make any noise there was always the chance that alison might sneak out of the cottage without my noticing hear the whir of an electric mixer interrupt me before i was ready i couldnt take that chance i watched the yolks of the eggs separate from the whites and spill across the light brown of the pudding then i wove my spatula through the mix producing vibrant yellow swirls like paint on a canvas creating my own masterpiece still life terry for gods sake what are you doing down there im almost done i need the bedpan i cant hold it any longer ill be right there i folded the chopped nuts and the chocolate chippets into the rest of the mix then ran my index finger along the top of the bowl lifting a large gob of batter to my mouth and greedily sucking it from my fingertip then i did it again this time using two fingers a loud groan inadvertently escaped my throat as i slowly manipulated my fingers in and out of my mouth what are you doing down there my mother cried when i was a little girl i used to watch my mother in the kitchen she was always baking something and i often pleaded with her to let me help of course she always refused told me id only make a mess but one afternoon when she was out i decided to surprise her by making a cake of my own i gathered up the necessary ingredients and mixed them together careful to beat out all the lumps just as id watched her do week after week then i baked the whole thing for an hour at degrees when my mother came home i presented her with my beautiful chocolate cake she surveyed the neat countertop checked the floor for spillage then silently sat down at the table and waited to be served with great pride i cut into the cake and produced a perfect slice then watched eagerly as my mother raised her fork to her lips i waited for her words of praise the tap on the top of my head that told me she was pleased instead i recoiled in horror as her face began collapsing in on itself her cheeks hollowing disappearing into the sides of her mouth as she spit the cake into the air shouting what have you done you stupid girl what have you done what id done was use bitter chocolate instead of sweet a careless mistake no doubt but i was only nine or ten and surely the look on my mothers face the knowledge that shed been right about me all along was punishment enough except that it wasnt and i knew it it was never enough even now i can feel my body tense as i waited for the blow to strike the side of my face the blow that would send my head spinning and my ears ringing but the blow never came instead came an eerie calm a misplaced smile my mother simply pointed to the chair beside her and instructed me to sit down then she took the knife and cut into my cake producing a perfect piece similar to the one id cut for her pushed it toward me and waited for me to take a bite i can still feel my hands shaking as i pushed the cake into my mouth instantly the bitter taste settled on my tongue combining with the bitter salt of my tears as they fell down my cheeks and ran between my lips she made me eat the entire cake only when i was sick and vomiting on the floor did she stop and only then to make me clean it up terry for gods sake what are you doing down there coming mother i glanced back at the cottage then preset the oven to degrees and lightly greased a large bundt pan i poured the batter inside it then added my secret ingredient what on earth took you so long i need the bedpan its right beside you no need to get so upset ive been calling you for fortyfive minutes im sorry i was baking you a cake what kind of cake its chocolate your favorite when the oven reached degrees i put the cake inside then licked the bowl free of whatever batter remained you never let me lick the bowl did you mother the best part ive always thought i always missed out on the best part i know you blame me i dont blame you yes you do you blame me for the way your life has turned out for the fact you never married or had children that whole episode with roger stillman that was a long time ago mother ive let it go have you have you really i nodded cut her a large slice of cake pressed a forkful to her lips you know that everything i did i did for your benefit i know that of course i know that i didnt mean to be cruel i know its the way i was raised my mother was the same with me you were a good mother i made a lot of mistakes we all make mistakes can you forgive me of course i forgive you i kissed the flaky dry skin of her forehead youre my mother i love you she whispered something unintelligible maybe i love you maybe not whatever it was i knew it was a lie everything she said was a goddamn lie she didnt love me she wasnt sorry about anything except that she was the one in that bed and not me i pushed another forkful of cake into her stupid eager mouth my reveries were interrupted by a loud knocking and i raced to the kitchen door a man was standing outside the cottage his back to me suddenly alison opened her door the light from inside the cottage throwing a spotlight on the now familiar figure kc alison exclaimed as his profile came clearly into view come in she cast a furtive glance around the cottage before ushering him inside and closing the door look at the lowlife youve allowed into my home i heard my mother hiss my home i corrected her now you died remember with the help of terrys magic chocolate cake and a favorite pillow taste buds failed you that time didnt they mother whoever said that percodan and chocolate pudding didnt mix i smelled the aroma of freshly baking cake glanced at the oven then back to the cottage in time to see the door reopen and alison step outside behind kc terry should be home soon she was saying i cant be gone long i ran through the kitchen to the front of the house watched through the living room window as alison and kc marched purposefully down the front path to the street then turned the corner their arms brushing up against one another as they walked were they going to meet lance and denise how long before theyd be back and would ericas biker friend be with them i wasted no more time clutching the spare key to the cottage between my fingers and carefully sliding the footlong butcher knife with its tapered twoinch blade from its wooden slot i opened the back door and stepped into a night redolent with whispers and lies im not sure what i was looking for or what exactly i thought id find maybe i was checking to make sure lance was really gone or maybe i was looking for alisons journal something i could take to the police point to as proof positive that my life was at risk i dont know as i stood in the middle of the brightly lit living room my hands trembling my knees all but knocking together i had absolutely no thought in my head as to what to do next i had no idea how long alison and kc would be gone and how did i know lance wasnt hiding in the bedroom watching and waiting for my next stupid move hadnt i parked my car around the block to avoid discovery couldnt he have done exactly the same thing except there was no sign of him anywhere no rumpled clothing strewn carelessly on the floor no wayward creases in the furniture where he might have sat no stray masculine smells permeating the air disturbing the scent of baby powder and strawberries i tiptoed toward the bedroom the handle of the large butcher knife clutched tightly in the palm of my hand the blade protruding from my body like the thorn of a giant rose but nothing in the bedroom indicated lance might still be in residence no shirts in the drawers no suitcase in the closet no shaving kit in the medicine cabinet i even checked under the bed nothing i said to the reflection that flickered at me from the long sharp blade of the knife was it possible he was really gone that hed taken off with denise just as alison had claimed if so then why was kc still around what was his connection to alison i laid the knife across the top of the white wicker dresser watched it wobble against the uneven surface as i rifled through each drawer but the drawers were mostly empty a few pushup bras from victorias secret half a dozen pairs of panties several uncomfortable looking thongs and a pair of yellow cotton pajamas decorated with images from i love lucy where was her journal surely that would tell me something only after searching through every drawer several times did i spot the damn thing sitting on the night table beside the bed stupid i said in my mothers voice it was right there the whole time open your eyes i marched to the nightstand grabbed the journal turned swiftly to its final entry everythings falling apart i read as if on cue a series of loud bangs like small explosions erupted from the street followed by an even louder voice then more banging terry the voice shouted terry i know youre in there terry please open the door i dropped the journal onto the bed raced to the side window watched as alison came running around the side of my house from the front to the back door kc at her heels terry she persisted banging repeatedly on my back door with her open palm terry please open up we have to talk shes not there kc said she is there terry please open the door suddenly alison was vaulting toward the cottage had she seen me watching from the window i spun around in helpless circles knowing there was nowhere for me to go i was trapped i ran toward the closet noting only at the last second the journal id carelessly dropped on alisons bed i hurried back scooped it up and returned it to its rightful place on the nightstand then scrambled across the bed toward the closet bringing the door closed after me just as alisons key turned in the front lock it was then my fingers tightly curled around the doorknob that i realized id left the knife the footlong behemoth with its tapered twoinch blade lying on top of the dresser stupid stupid girl my mother whispered in my ear shes not likely to miss that is she maybe it wasnt her car kc was saying from the next room there are lots of black nissans it was her car alison insisted confusion bracketing her words why would she park it around the block and not in the driveway maybe shes visiting a friend she doesnt have any friends im the only friend shes got doesnt that strike you as strange there followed a long pause in which we all seemed to be holding our breath what are you talking about alison asked i heard the shuffling sounds of two wary people walking around in circles how long before one of them stepped into the bedroom saw the knife how long before alison checked the closet for bogeymen look alison there are some things i have to tell you what kind of things another pause this one even longer than the first i havent been very honest with you welcome to the club alison muttered listen on second thought i dont think im up for this discussion right now no you need to hear me out i need to pee dear god i thought as i shot from the closet like a yoyo on a string i grabbed the knife the blade slicing across my palm as my fingers closed around it then i leaped back inside the closet the door closing after me just as alison entered the room i stuffed my wounded hand inside my mouth sucked at the steady stream of blood issuing from my palm and tried not to cry out from the bathroom i heard alison grumbling as she relieved herself what in the world is going on here she kept repeating over and over what in the world is going on alison flushed the toilet washed her hands and reentered the bedroom then stopped as if not sure of her next move or had something suspicious caught her eye a drop of blood on the dresser a suspicious footprint in the carpet was her journal lying wrongside up i raised my knife steeled my body for her approach alison kc called from the living room are you all right that depends a pronounced sigh of resignation what is it you want to tell me kcs voice drew closer i felt him standing in the doorway maybe you should sit down alison obediently plopped down on her bed im liking this less and less for starters my name isnt kc it isnt alison said more statement than question its charlie charlie kentish charlie kentish where had i heard that name before charlie kentish alison repeated as if thinking the same thing not kc short for kenneth charles no no wonder nobody ever calls you that she observed wryly and i almost laughed i dont understand she continued in almost the same breath why would you lie about your name because i didnt know if i could trust you why wouldnt you trust me i felt him shrug im not sure where to start another shrug perhaps a shake of his head then maybe you shouldnt bother alison jumped to her feet i felt her moving around pacing back and forth in front of the bed maybe its not important who you really are or what you have to tell me maybe you should just leave so that you can get on with your life whose ever it is and ill get on with mine and we can all live happily ever after dont you think thats a good idea only if you come with me come with you youre in danger if you stay here im in danger alison laughed are you completely nuts please listen to me no alison said resolutely youre starting to scare me and i want you to leave its not me you have to worry about listen kc or charlie or whoever the hell you really are im charlie kentish charlie kentish i repeated why was that name so damn familiar i dont want to have this conversation if you dont leave im going to call the police erica hollander is my fiancee what the woman who used to live here i know who erica hollander is so thats where i knew the name of course charlie kentish ericas fiance the one she was always going on about charlie this charlie that charlies so handsome charlies so smart charlies got this great job in japan for a year charlie and i are getting married as soon as he comes home your precious fiancee ran out on terry in the middle of the night owing several months rent alison said she didnt go anywhere what do you mean i mean she didnt go anywhere he repeated as if that explained everything i dont understand what are you saying i was hoping you could tell me tell you what i dont have a clue what youre talking about maybe if youd stop pacing for two minutes and sit down i dont want to sit down please just hear me out and then youll leave if thats what you want i heard the bed squeak as alison resumed her former position im listening she said in a tone that indicated shed rather not be erica and i had been living together for about six months when i got this great job offer to work in japan for a year we decided i should go and shed stay here move into a cheaper apartment and wed save our money so we could get married as soon as i got home i thought you were from texas originally yes i moved here after college okay so off you went to japan alison said getting back on track and erica emailed me about finding this great little place a small cottage behind a house belonging to a nurse she was thrilled im sure she was everything seemed perfect id get these glowing emails telling me how wonderful terry was how she was always inviting erica over for dinner doing little things for her ericas mother died a couple of years ago and her father had remarried and moved to arizona so i guess she was just really grateful to have someone like terry in her life so she could take advantage of her erica wasnt like that she was the sweetest his voice cracked threatened to break then things started to change what do you mean what things the letters stopped being so positive erica wrote that terry was starting to behave strangely that she seemed fixated on some biker erica once said hello to in a restaurant that she was getting paranoid paranoid in what way she never went into detail she just said that terry was starting to make her feel uncomfortable that she was afraid she might have to start looking for another place so she skipped out in the middle of the night no i was due back in a few months we decided she might as well stay put until i got back to delray and we could look for a place together but then the emails suddenly stopped i tried calling her cell phone but no one ever answered thats when i started calling terry she told me erica had moved out you didnt believe her it seemed odd that erica would move out without telling me let alone go anywhere without leaving a forwarding address terry told me she was hanging out with a bad crowd no that she met someone else i dont believe it things like that happen every day im sure they do but thats not what happened here did you check with her employer erica didnt have a regular employer she worked for kelly services they hadnt heard from her in weeks did you go to the police i called them from japan there wasnt much they could do longdistance they contacted terry she gave them the same story she gave me which you cant accept because it isnt true did you go to the police when you got back home as soon as i got off the plane they reacted pretty much the same way you are now she found somebody else buddy move on but you cant not till i find out what happened to her and you think terry is somehow involved that im involved i thought that in the beginning the beginning when you first moved in i could almost feel the quizzical look on alisons face id been watching the house for about a month at that point kc explained after you moved in i started following you you got a job at that gallery and i started hanging around i almost had a heart attack when i saw you wearing ericas necklace i gave her that necklace i found it under the bed alison protested i believe you but in the beginning i didnt know what to think i had to find out the extent of your involvement how much you knew i tried flirting with you but you werent interested so i hit on denise convinced her to let me tag along for thanksgiving dinner i realized pretty quickly that you had nothing to do with ericas disappearance but the more i got to know terry the more convinced i became she did and why is that because theres something very weird about that lady dont be ridiculous ive been watching her for months phoning her following her in my car trying to spook her anything to get her to slip up and shes starting to crack i can feel it so it hadnt been my imagination someone had been watching me and not just today kc was the shifting shadow outside my window the anonymous yet strangely familiar voice on my telephone that subtle texas twang he couldnt quite disguise how had i failed to recognize it before now youve been harassing her for months alison stated and youre surprised shes acting strangely terry knows what happened to erica damn it shes responsible are you finished because if youre finished then its time for you to leave havent you heard anything ive said you havent said anything alison shot back your girlfriend pulled a disappearing act im sorry i know being dumped is a hard thing to accept but what youre suggesting is outrageous and ive heard quite enough thank you i want you to go now there was a seconds silence then the sound of feet shuffling reluctantly toward the front door wait alison called out and i held my breath inched forward leaned my head against the closet door you should have this she walked around the side of the bed pulled open the drawer of the nightstand you said you gave it to her you should have it back i pictured alison walking toward him ericas thin gold necklace dangling from her fingertips come with me he urged its not safe for you to stay here dont worry about me she told him flatly ill be fine i heard the front door open as i crept out of the closet and inched along the side of the dresser my palm leaving a bloody trail on the white wicker as i balanced against it be careful the man calling himself kc warned the young woman who called herself alison simms and then he was gone i dont know how long i stood there my breath caught somewhere between my lungs and my mouth my hand pulsating with pain as i pressed the handle of the knife against my torn flesh like a branding iron could i really use this knife against alison even in selfdefense what the hell is going on here alison demanded suddenly and i lunged forward in response my arm instinctively arcing into the air while blood from my palm streaked down my arm as if someone had outlined the path of one of my veins in red ink but alison hadnt been speaking to me and she was already out the door and on her way to the main house when i emerged from the shadows her anguished unanswered question vibrating against the still air like smoke from a discarded cigarette terry i heard her shouting as once more she pounded on my kitchen door terry open the door i know youre in there i watched as she backed away from the door her head tilted toward my bedroom terry she shouted her voice targeting my window like a wellaimed stone before she gave up in defeat what now i wondered swallowing what little air i could find holding it hostage against my lungs alison stood very still for what seemed an excruciatingly long time weighing her options i thought just like me ultimately she decided to give it one last try turning on her heels and running around the side of the house to the front only then did i push open the cottage door and creep into the night a sudden breeze scratching at my neck like the tongue of a cat as alison banged on the front door i was opening the back in the next instant i was inside my kitchen the aroma of freshly baked chocolate cake settling about my head like a bridal veil i slid the bloody knife back into its triangular wooden holder then wrapped my bleeding palm inside a dishcloth as alison returned to the back door her eyes widening with shock as i flipped on the light and opened the door to let her in terry whats going on where have you been ive been so worried i was taking a nap i answered sleepily in a voice not quite my own hell kc wasnt the only one capable of disguising his voice are you all right im fine i waved my hand into the air as if to dismiss her concerns my god what happened to your hand i glanced at my injured arm as if seeing it for the first time blood had already soaked through the thin cotton towel i cut it its nothing its not nothing let me have a look at it she unwrapped the towel before i could protest further oh my god this is awful maybe we should go to the hospital alison its just a little cut its not just a little cut you might need stitches she pulled me toward the sink ran the cold water guided my hand under the steady stream how long has it been bleeding like this not long i winced as the water hit my palm pushing the blood aside and exposing the fragile white line of my wound my wounded lifeline i thought as blood continued to wash across the inside of my hand whats that smell alison looked toward the stove terrys magic chocolate cake i said with a shrug confusion brought her eyebrows together at the bridge of her nose i dont understand when did you have time to bake ive been waiting for you for hours when did you get back and whats your car doing parked around the corner the questions were coming faster now out of her mouth as soon as they entered her head one piled on top of the other like pancakes alison shut off the water grabbed a handful of paper towels from the roll on the wall and pressed the absorbent white towels into my cupped hand tell me whats going on terry i shook my head trying to gather my thoughts together to give order to my lies theres not that much to tell start with when you left here where did you go alison prompted she didnt have to say any more she didnt have to mention the aborted kiss i noted a small red circle metastasizing in the middle of the white paper towels like menstrual blood i thought watching it grow wider and darker reach toward the edges im so embarrassed about what happened i whispered as she led me to a chair i dont know what came over me it was all my fault alison interjected immediately sitting down beside me i obviously gave you the wrong impression ive never done anything like that before in my life i know you were just upset about josh yes i agreed thinking this was probably true anyway im not sure where i went after i left here i was pretty confused so i just drove around for a while tried to clear my head and you parked around the corner because you didnt want me to know you were back alison stated quietly traces of guilt bracketing her words i was feeling pretty shaky i thought it was best if we didnt see each other right away i was so worried about you im sorry dont be i looked around the room it felt so bare so empty without the women watching bakings always been a kind of therapy for me i continued glancing from the shelves to the oven so i decided why not bake a cake i dont know it seemed like a good idea at the time isnt that what they say she nodded seems like theyre always saying something i smiled you like chocolate cake dont you her turn to smile is that a rhetorical question i patted her hand it felt icecold it should be ready in a few minutes is that how you cut your hand baking it was stupid i began the lie wiggling around the tip of my tongue like a worm on a fishermans hook i was reaching for something in a drawer and i sliced it on a small paring knife alison clutched her own hand in sympathy ooh that hurts its a bit better now i glanced back at the oven smiled cake should be ready feel like a piece dont you have to let it cool off for a while no its best fresh out of the oven i rose from my seat walked to the stove opened the oven door with my left hand a gust of heat rolled toward me like an ocean wave as i bent forward and inhaled the rich chocolate perfume i reached for my oven mitts on the counter ill do it alison offered immediately sliding her hands inside the waiting pink mitts then gingerly transferring the cake to a nearby trivet this looks as good as it smells should i make some coffee coffee sounds wonderful you sit keep that hand still raise it above your heart she rolled her eyes listen to me youre the nurse and im telling you what to do she shook her head laughed with what i recognized was relief relief that i seemed to have a reasonable explanation for everything relief that i seemed no longer angry with her relief that things seemed back to normal seemed i thought sitting back in my chair good word i smiled as i watched alison prepare the coffee it was amazing how comfortable she was in my kitchen among my things she knew without asking that i kept the coffee in the freezer and the sugar in the cupboard to the left of the sink theres whipped cream in the fridge i told her as she measured out the coffee and poured the water into the back of the coffeemaker youre amazing she said youre always prepared for everything sometimes it pays to be prepared i wish i was more like that alison leaned against the counter ive always acted more on impulse that can be pretty dangerous tell me about it there was a moments silence alison glanced at the floor then at the empty shelves an impish grin spreading across her face smashing all those heads was a pretty impulsive thing to do i laughed i guess it was maybe were more alike than you think maybe our eyes locked and for a moment neither of us moved as if we were daring each other to be the first to look away of course i was the one to blink first what say we have some of that cake you stay right where you are keep that hand up ill do everything alison removed two small plates from the cupboard along with two sets of cups and saucers and set them on the table beside several paper napkins the sugar and the bowl of whipped cream then she returned to the counter and reached for a knife remember the first day i was here and i grabbed the wrong knife she said pulling the giant butcher knife from its wooden block as my breath froze in my throat and you said whoa overkill dont you think whoa she repeated now staring with openmouthed wonder at the bloodencrusted blade whats this is this blood her focus shifted to the shaft of the knife and it looks like theres blood on the handle too she stared at her palm more like blood on the brain i said rising quickly from my chair and removing the knife from her hands then dropping it into the sink and running hot water over it its not blood i told her what is it just a stubborn case of strawberry jam jam on the handle are you going to cut me a piece of cake or what i asked impatiently alison grabbed another knife and proceeded to slice into the warm cake oh no its starting to crumble youre sure its not too soon to do this the timing is perfect i said as she slid a large piece of cake onto a plate give me one half that size youre sure i can always come back for more dont count on it alison returned to her seat and eagerly stuffed a heaping forkful of cake into her mouth i watched the crumbs form a dark outline around her lips like a clowns mouth i thought as she licked the errant crumbs into her mouth with the flick of her tongue a snakes tongue i thought watching her swallow this is absolutely the best cake you have ever made the best she swallowed another forkful will you teach me how to bake one day its really very easy dont worry ill find a way to make it difficult alison laughed selfconsciously quickly finishing what was left on her plate this is so yummy delicious why arent you eating thought id wait for the coffee alison glanced at the coffeemaker looks like itll be a few more minutes a watched kettle never boils she reminded me looking away you told me that do you remember everything i say i try to why i asked genuinely curious because i think youre smart because i admire you alison hesitated as if there was more she wanted to say then obviously thought better of it can i have another piece i cant wait for the coffee be my guest try it with some whipped cream alison cut herself another even larger slice of cake then spooned a large dollop of the whipped cream on top of it this is heaven she enthused filling her mouth absolute heaven you have to taste this she extended her fork toward me i shook my head pointed toward the coffee you have such willpower it wont be long now i watched as she wolfed down the second piece of cake a human garburetor i thought with something approaching awe ready for thirds are you kidding one more piece and it wont be just the china heads exploding around here she hesitated although maybe i have room for one more very tiny piece with my coffee she laughed she lowered her gaze to her lap closed her eyes ill miss this she whispered her body swaying i leaned forward wondering if she was about to fall thinking that even a strong sedative like percodan needs more than a few minutes to work its magic instead of falling over alison bolted upright in her chair her eyes popping open as if shed just awakened from a bad dream please dont make me leave what i know you said youve already rented out the cottage to someone at work but im really praying youll change your mind and give me another chance i promise i wont mess up this time ill do everything you say ill follow all your rules i wont screw up again honest she sounded so sincere that i almost found myself believing her in spite of everything i realized i wanted to believe her what about lance lance thats over lance is gone how do i know he wont come back because i give you my solemn vow you lied to me before i know and im so sorry it was stupid i was stupid stupid to think lance would ever change that things would be any different this time what about the next time there wont be a next time lance knows he went too far that he crossed the line when he came on to you why am i any different than anyone else she paused looked up then down as if searching for just the right words because he knew how important you are to me and what makes me so important another pause you just are alison jumped to her feet then grabbed for the table alison are you all right yeah i just got a little dizzy there for a minute i guess i must have moved too fast are you still dizzy she shook her head slowly as if she wasnt sure i think im okay now kind of scary though have some coffee coffees a good antidote to dizziness it is im the nurse remember she smiled two cups of coffee coming right up she poured the freshly brewed coffee into each cup then added three heaping spoonfuls of sugar and a large dollop of whipped cream to hers cheers i clicked my cup against hers to us to us i agreed watching as she took a long sip she made a face lowered the cup to its saucer kind of bitter i took a sip from my own cup tastes fine to me i think i made it too strong maybe you need more sugar i teased alison added a fourth spoonful took another sip no still not quite right she brought her hand to her head alison are you okay i dont know i feel a little strange drink some more coffee itll help alison did as she was told throwing back the coffee as if it were a glass of tequila then taking a long deep breath is it warm in here not really oh god i hope im not getting a migraine is this how they usually start no usually i get this kind of tunnel vision thing going and then this horrible headache takes over i have some more of those pills i got up from my chair and pretended to fish around in a drawer why dont you take a couple strike a preemptive blow i handed her two little white pills returned the bottle of percodan to the drawer she took the pills without even bothering to examine them so what do you think she asked pushing her hair away from her forehead i noticed she was beginning to perspire i think youll start to feel better soon no i mean about me staying you can stay as long as you like tears immediately appeared in the corners of each eye really you mean that absolutely youre not kicking me out how could i this is your home alison brought her hands to her mouth muffled a gasp of pure joy oh thank you thank you so much you wont be sorry i promise you but no more lies i promise ill never lie to you again good because lies destroy trust and without trust youre right of course youre right she ran her hand through her hair rolled her neck from side to side wet her lips with her tongue are you all right alison would you like to lie down no ill be okay what was kc doing here before i asked slipping the question in casually as her eyes struggled to stay focused what no more lies alison you promised no more lies she whispered what was kc doing here she shook her head then raised her hands to her temples as if to steady her head prevent it from rolling off altogether his name isnt kc it isnt no its charlie charlie somethingor other i dont remember he was erica hollanders fiance ericas fiance what was he doing here i dont know alisons eyes struggled to find my face he was talking crazy what did he say nothing that made any sense she laughed but the weak sound wobbled then died in her throat he says that she didnt run off that she never went anywhere he has this ridiculous idea that you know where she is maybe its not such a ridiculous idea what what are you saying maybe i do know where she is do you alison tried to stand up stumbled collapsed back in the chair i really think youd be much more comfortable lying down why dont we go into the living room i helped alison to her feet lifting one long slender arm over my shoulder and guiding her from the kitchen her feet shuffling along the floor like whispers from a crowd what happened to the christmas tree she asked as we entered the living room it had a little accident i directed her to the sofa and sat down beside her lifting her feet into my lap are you going to give me a pedicure she asked with a smile that refused to settle maybe later i feel so strange maybe its the pills and the cake i said removing her sandals massaging her bare feet the way i knew she liked and the coffee she regarded me quizzically i believe you had four spoonfuls of sugar this time not a good idea alison they say sugars poison for your system i dont understand for the first time a look of fear flashed through alisons beautiful green eyes what are you talking about you thought you had me didnt you alison you thought all you had to do was smile and pay me a few stupid compliments and id fall under your magic spell all over again except it didnt work this time im the one with all the magic terrys magic chocolate cake terrys magic sugar terrys magic pills what are you talking about what have you done to me who are you i demanded what who are you you know who i am im alison alison simms i didnt give her a chance to answer i doubt that there is no alison simms i watched her flinch as if id raised my hand to strike her just like theres no kc but i didnt know about kc i didnt know just like theres no rita bishop she rubbed her mouth her neck her hair who your friend from chicago the one you were looking for at mission care when you just happened to stumble across my notice oh god lets play our little game three words to describe alison terry please you dont understand lets see oh i know liar liar liar but i havent lied please i havent lied youve done nothing but lie since the moment i met you i read your journal alison you read my journal but then you know i know youre coming here was no accident i know you and lance have been plotting for months to get rid of me get rid of you no alison swung her legs off my lap tried to get up only halfsucceeded before her knees gave out and she teetered to the floor oh god whats happening to me who are you alison who are you really please help me the lord helps those who help themselves i said coldly in my mothers voice its all a huge misunderstanding please take me to the hospital i promise ill tell you everything as soon as i feel better tell me now i pushed her back on the sofa watching her disappear into the deep downfilled cushions their pretty pink and mauve flowers threatening to swallow her whole i settled into the striped queen anne chair directly across from her and waited the truth i warned her dont leave anything out can i have a glass of water alison asked later after you tell me tears fell the length of alisons face her color was ashen a once vibrant photograph fading before my eyes i dont know where to start start with who you really are start with your name its alison not simms i said matteroffactly not simms she repeated dully sinukoff a sudden spark of interest does that name mean anything to you should it she shrugged i wasnt sure if it would or not it doesnt i didnt know if it would i had to be sure sure of what i didnt want to make another mistake what are you talking about what kind of mistake alisons head rolled back across her shoulders swayed precariously as if it might fall off im so tired why did you come to florida alison i demanded what were you after i came to find you i know that what i dont know is why im not rich im not famous i have nothing that could possibly interest you she steadied her head concentrated all her attention on my face you have everything she said simply im afraid youll have to explain that one her eyes fluttered to a close and for a moment i thought she might have succumbed to all the sedatives in her system but then she started to speak slowly at first and with obvious effort as if trying to keep track of her words as one thought merged with another and one word slurred into the next id been looking for you for a while without any luck i decided to hire a private detective the first one didnt work out so i hired someone else he said you were working in a hospital in delray so i went there to see for myself thats when i saw your notice at the nurses station i couldnt believe my luck i made up the story about rita bishop i thought it would give us a chance to get to know one another before before what before i told you told me what for gods sake dont you know know what i dont understand you said you read my journal know what i repeated my voice a low roar like the sound of an approaching wave her eyes locked on mine snapped into focus as if seeing me for the first time that youre my mother for an instant i didnt know whether to laugh or cry so i did both the strangled sound emerging from my mouth foreign even to my own ears i jumped to my feet began pacing back and forth in front of her what are you talking about thats impossible what are you talking about im your daughter she said fresh tears forming in her eyes youre crazy your mother lives in chicago im not from chicago im from baltimore like you youre lying i was adopted as an infant by john and carole sinukoff did you know them i shook my head vigorously distant images flashing through my mind like a strobe light i shielded my eyes struggled to keep unwanted memories at bay they already had a son but they couldnt have any more children and they wanted a daughter so they picked me a mistake she acknowledged licking at her lips i was this awful kid pretty much like i told you i never felt i belonged i was so different from everyone else and it didnt help that my perfect older brother kept reminding me i wasnt really part of the family one christmas when he came home from brown he told me that my real mother was a fourteenyear old slut who couldnt keep her legs together oh god i kicked him where it counts he certainly didnt have any trouble keepinghis legs together after that she attempted a laugh wheezed instead but what youre saying is impossible i told her my head spinning as much as hers images of the past snuck through decadesold defenses to assault my brain roger stillman clumsily pushing his way inside me in the backseat of his car my frantic eyes checking my underwear every day after that for signs of a period that stubbornly refused to come my childs belly growing more distended every day no matter how baggy the clothes i wore its impossible i repeated more forcefully this time trying in vain to frighten the images away do the math im forty youre twentyeight that would have made me twelve im not twentyeight im twentyfive ill be twentysix on february i mouthed silently as she spoke the words out loud i covered my ears with my hands in an effort to block out her voice when had it gotten so loud so strong i was afraid if i told you my real age you might figure everything out before you had the chance to get to know me and i didnt know how youd feel about having me back in your life i wanted so much for you to like me no thats a lie she said correcting herself i wanted more than that i wanted you to love me so you wouldnt be able to give me up again i sank back into the queen anne chair she was crazy of course even if some of what she said was true it was impossible for her to be my daughter she was so tall so beautiful just like roger stillman i thought its not true i insisted im sorry youve made a mistake no not this time the first detective i hired found some woman in hagerstown he thought was you i got so excited i went to see her but it turned out he was wrong then i found you lance said i was crazy to come all the way down here that i was only going to get hurt again but i had to see you and the minute i did the minute i talked to you i knew i was right even before you told me about roger stillman i knew you were my mother well im sorry but youre wrong im not wrong you know im not the only thing i know is that youre a stupid stupid girl i heard myself shout my mothers voiced bounced off the walls youre a stupid stupid girl no please dont say that how could you do this how could you let some ridiculous boy stick his awful thing inside you ill take care of the baby mommy i promise ill take good care of it dont think for one minute that im going to allow a bastard child into this house ill drown it in a basin just like i drowned those damn kittens terry alison was whispering terry im not feeling very well i moved swiftly to her side wrapped her in my arms its all right alison dont worry you wont throw up i know how much you hate throwing up please take me to the hospital later sweetheart after youve had a little nap i dont want to fall asleep ssh dont fight it darling itll all be over soon no oh god no please you have to help me we heard the noise at the same moment our heads twisting in unison toward the kitchen door pounding yelling ringing alison a voice bellowed over the cacophony of sounds alison are you in there kc alison exclaimed her voice scarcely audible im here oh god help me im in here terry kc hollered terry open this door right now or im calling the police just a minute i called back calmly gently extricating myself from alisons side hearing her groan as she toppled over too drugged to move i walked quickly to the back door im coming hold your horses where is she kc pushed roughly past me into the house what have you done with her who are we talking about i asked him pleasantly erica or alison but kc was already in the living room alison my god what has that lunatic done to you i reached into the sink and carefully removed the butcher knife from the white enamel basin it fit comfortably into the center of my hand as if it belonged there i squeezed it felt it damp against my tender skin as the cut reopened in my palm then i returned to the living room watching from behind the dying branches of the christmas tree as kc struggled to lift alison to her feet can you walk i dont think so put your arms around my neck ill carry you how can i describe what happened next it was as if id been handed the starring role in a play no not a play more like a ballet full of grand gestures and exaggerated mime each move carefully planned and choreographed as alison raised her arms so did i as kc was bending to scoop her up i was swooping down as he took the first of several awkward steps i was flying across the room with savage grace as alison was resting her head against kcs shoulder i was plunging the footlong blade into his back with such force the handle snapped off in my hands kc staggered forward alison dropping from his arms and landing with a dull thud on the floor kc spun around in a sloppy pirouette his hands losing their graceful rhythm and flailing about for the blade that was buried deep in his back the growing swell of alisons screams filled the air like a thirdrate orchestra as kc balanced on his toes his arms extended toward me as if asking me to join him for one final twirl around the room i declined his silent invitation taking a step back as he fell forward his disbelieving eyes glazing over with the approach of imminent death he hit the floor the top of his head just missing the base of the overturned tree it took a few seconds for me to realize that alison had stopped screaming that she was no longer sprawled carelessly across the floor that she had somehow managed to gather whatever strength she still possessed and was making a desperate scramble for the front door that she actually succeeded in getting it open and was halfway down the front steps before i caught up to her is a great tribute to her strength and determination the instinct for survival the will to live is an amazing thing i remembered having had similar thoughts about myra wylie only erica hollander had gone quietly dozing off within minutes of finishing the latenight snack id prepared the pillow id subsequently held over her nose and mouth had brought only token resistance no alison was screaming as i reached for her arm alison please dont make a scene no dont touch me leave me alone come back inside alison i grabbed her elbow dug my fingers into her flesh no she screamed again wresting her arm away from me with such force i almost lost my balance she made it halfway to the street before her legs simply gave out and she collapsed like the proverbial rag doll even then she refused to give up crawling on her hands and knees toward the sidewalk it was then we heard the barking followed immediately by the click of high heels on pavement bettye mccoy and her two lunatic dogs i realized trying to drag alison to her feet help me alison cried as the third mrs mccoy wiggled around the corner in a pair of leopardprint capri pants help me but alisons cries were drowned out by the angry yapping of the dogs its okay i called to the aging alice in wonderland shes just had a bit too much to drink bettye mccoy tossed her overly teased blond mane disdainfully over her shoulder and gathered the two dogs into her arms before crossing the street and walking briskly in the opposite direction no please alison called after her you have to help me help me you really need to sleep this off i said loudly in case anyone was listening please alison begged the now empty street please dont go im right here baby i told her gathering her into my arms guiding her toward the house im not going anywhere when we reached the door she stopped fighting whether it was the drugs or the realization that such struggles were useless i dont know she simply sighed and went limp in my arms i carried her across the threshold as a new husband lovingly transports his bride do they even do that anymore i dont know i doubt ill ever have the opportunity to find out its too late for me just as it was too late for alison and its too bad because i think i would have made a fine wife thats all i ever really wanted to love someone to be loved in return to make a home have a family a child on whom i could lavish all the tenderness id been denied a daughter ive always wanted a daughter i carried alison to the sofa cradled her in my arms tooralooraloora i sang tenderly tooralooralie alison raised her eyes slowly to mine her mouth opened whispers filled the air i think i heard the word mommy of course i dont believe for a minute that alison was my child she probably heard about how id disgraced my family from the sinukoffs the name sounds vaguely familiar perhaps they were neighbors perhaps not baltimores a big city you cant know everyone despite my mothers assertion that the whole town knew about my condition that she was a laughingstock too ashamed ever to show her face in public again thats why we moved to florida not because my fathers job demanded it because of me i stayed in school until my condition became too obvious to ignore then i was asked to leave nothing happened to roger stillman my shame was his badge of honor and he was allowed to remain in school and graduate with his classmates i endured almost twenty hours of labor before my mother let my father drive me to the hospital it was another ten hours before the baby weighing in at an impressive eight pounds seven ounces was born i never got the chance to hold her never even got the chance to see her my mother made sure of that of course she was right what else could she have done i was only fourteen years old after all a baby myself what did i know of life of looking after another human being it was a ridiculous notion one im sure i would have lived to regret and yet maybe not would i have been such a bad mother ive often wondered id secretly loved that little baby growing inside me from the first minute i felt her moving around i talked to her when no one was home sang to her when we were alone in my room assuring her that i would never lose my temper with her never hit her or disparage her in any way that i would shower her with kisses assure her each and every day how very much she was loved ill take care of you i promised her when no one was listening instead she was pulled from my body and banished from my side before her sweet little face had time to register and i spent my whole life taking care of other people instead of course alison wasnt my child shed undoubtedly heard about the fourteen yearold slut who couldnt keep her legs together from someone back in baltimore possibly even her older brother as shed claimed then she and her friends had concocted this elaborate scenario determined to insinuate themselves into my life i wanted you to like me no i wanted you to love me alison herself had admitted shortly before she died i miss her terribly of course think of her often and always with great affection even love so maybe alison got what she came for after all she didnt suffer she simply fell asleep in my arms the rest was easy there were so many drugs in her system i doubt she was even aware of the pillow i held against her face for the better part of two minutes later i dressed her in her pretty blue sundress the one she had been wearing the first day we met and then buried her in the garden beside erica the flowers are especially lush in that corner of the yard and i think she would have approved kc was a different story id never killed a man before never used a knife never had to resort to such brutality it took days for the vibrations to stop echoing through my hand weeks till i was finally able to scrub all the blood from my living room floor of course i had to get rid of the rug it was ruined alison was right a white rug in the living room hadnt proved very practical at any rate it was time for a change i didnt want kc polluting my garden so i waited until the middle of the night then bundled him into the trunk of my car and drove all the way to the everglades where i tossed him into a slimecovered swamp it seemed fitting and im sure the alligators appreciated my efforts its been three months since alison died the season is almost over every day there are fewer cars on the roads fewer tourists prowling the streets its easier to get into restaurants now there are shorter lines at the movies bettye mccoy still walks her two lunatic dogs down the street several times a day and occasionally one breaks away from her makes a beeline for my backyard ive erected a small fence to keep them out hopefully that will suffice should one of those mangy mutts manage to get into my yard again i wont be chasing it out with anything as gentle as a broom occasionally i wonder what would happen if lance and denise came back looking for alison but so far theres been no sign of either of them so maybe alison was telling the truth about their taking off together about her relationship with her exhusband being over once and for all i hope so still i cant let down my guard my job at the hospital continues much as it always has myras bed has been filled by an elderly gentleman with advanced parkinsons i take very good care of him his family think im the greatest thing since sliced bread incidentally i was right about josh he did send flowers to the staff several weeks after his mothers funeral actually the flowers were from both him and his wife the note thanked everyone on the ward no one was singled out for special mention the journal he gave me has proved useful however its nice to have somewhere to record my thoughts as im doing now a place to set the record straight and who knows maybe one day ill find true love just because josh proved both weak and unworthy doesnt mean there isnt someone out there whos right for me its not too late im only forty im still reasonably attractive i could meet someone tomorrow get married have the family ive always craved many women over forty are having babies it could happen im praying it does and thats about it life goes on as they say who are they anyway i can hear alison ask her voice never very far from my ear i turn around look the other way shes right beside me describe your life since i went away she whispers playfully three words uneventful i reply obediently unexciting i survey the empty shelves that line the kitchen walls thinking that perhaps the time has come to start rebuilding my collection lonely i admit choking back tears i stare out my back window at the small empty cottage behind my house it has been unoccupied for three months now and is starting to look a little neglected it needs someone as much as i do someone who will love it and take care of it who will show it the love and respect it deserves after the debacles with erica and alison im not sure such a person even exists but maybe its time to find out maybe its time to bury the whispers and lies of the past time to start afresh afresh i repeat out loud in alisons voice deciding to place an ad in the weekend paper good word the end
