returned to barracks for all of past differences which had been finally settled between them for all that they had once been bitter enemies and were by disposition and development as radically opposite as the positive and negative points of a magnetic needle frank merriwell and bartley hodge had chosen to room together there was to be no more herding in fours and so barney mulloy the irish lad and hans dunnerwust the dutch boy were assigned to another room like hodge barney and hans were frank merriwells stanch friends and admirers they were ready to do anything for the jolly young plebe who had become popular at the academy and thus won both friends and foes among the older cadets barney was shrewd and readywitted while hans for all of his speech and his blundering ways was much brighter than he appeared still being plebes merriwell and hodge had been assigned to the cockloft of the third division which meant the top floor on the north side of the barracks the sunless side the other sides and the lower floors with the exception of the first were reserved for the older cadets their room contained two alcoves or bedrooms at the end opposite the door these alcoves were made by a simple partition that separated one side from the other but left the bedrooms open to the rest of the room against the walls in the alcoves stood two light iron bedsteads with a single mattress on each carefully folded back during the day and made up only after tattoo the rest of the bedding was carefully and systematically piled on the mattresses in the partitions were rows of iron hooks on which their clothing must be placed in regular order overcoats to the front then rubber coats uniform coats jackets trousers and underclothing following with a bag for soiled clothing at the rear on the broad wooden bar that ran across the front of these alcoves near the ceiling the names of the cadets who occupied the bedrooms were posted so inspecting officers could tell at a glance who occupied the beds at the front of the partition the washstand was placed with the bucket of water dipper and washbowl which must always be kept in a certain order with the washbowl inverted and the soapdish on top of it rifles were kept in the rack barrels to the front with dress hats on the shelf and a mirror in the middle of the mantelshelf accoutrements and forage saps were hung on certain hooks and clothing and other things allowable and necessary were always to be kept in an unvarying order on a set of openfaced shelves the broom and slopbucket were to be deposited behind the door the chairs against the table when not in use and the table against the wall opposite the fireplace at the foot of each bed the shoes were placed in a line neatly dusted with toes to the front it was required that the room should be constantly kept in perfect order and merriwell and hodge were called on to take turns week and week about at being orderly and the name of the one responsible for the appearance of the room was placed on the orderly board hung to the front of the alcove partition back of the door was another board on which each was required to post his hours of recitation and to account for his absence from the room at any inspection in fact a rigid effort was made at fardale to imitate in every possible way the regulations and requirements enforced at west point and it was the boast that the school was in almost every particular identical with our great military academy of course it was impossible to enforce the rules as rigidly as they are at the point for the cadets at fardale were as a class far younger and the disgrace of expulsion or failure in any way was not to be compared with that attending unfortunates at the school where youths are graduated into actual service as officers of the united states army many of the cadets at fardale had been sent there by parents who could not handle them at home and who had hoped the discipline they would receive at a military school would serve to tone down their wildness thus it will be seen that many harumscarum fellows got into the school and that they could not readily be compelled to conform to the rules and requirements for all that frank merriwell was a jolly funloving fellow he was naturally orderly and neat so that it seemed very little effort for him to do his part in keeping the room in order on the other hand bartley hodge was naturally careless and he had a persistent way of displacing things that annoyed frank although the latter said little about it at first whenever the inspecting officer found anything wrong about the room he simply glanced at the orderly board and down went the demerit against the lad whose name was posted there it made no difference who had left a chair out of place hung a coat where it should not be or failed to invert the washbowl the room orderly had to assume the responsibility now it was the last thing in the world that hodge could wish to injure merriwell but three times in franks first week as room orderly he was reported for things he could not help and for which bart was entirely responsible merriwell had risen to the first section in recitation at the very start while hodge who had been placed in the third was soon relegated to the second frank was trying to curb his almost unbounded inclination for mischief and he was studying assiduously on the other hand while hodge did not seem at all mischievous by nature he detested study and he was inclined to spend the time when he should have been digging in reading some story or in idly yawning and wishing the time away one day after having taken his third demerit on his roommates account the inspector having detected tobacco smoke in the room frank said why dont you swear off on cigarettes bart they dont do a fellow any good and they are pretty sure to get him into trouble here at the academy hodge was in anything but a pleasant frame of mind and he instantly retorted i know what you mean you are orderly and i ought to have spoken up and told the inspector i had been smoking i didnt know what it was he put down but ill go and confess my crime now he sprang up petulantly but franks hand dropped on his arm and merriwell quietly said dont go off angry old man you know i dont want you to do anything of the sort i will take my medicine when i am orderly and i know you will do the same when it comes your turn well i didnt know began bart in a somewhat sulky manner you ought to know pretty well by this time i am not much given to kicking or growling but i do want to have a sober talk with you and i hope you will not fire up at anything i say all right go ahead said hodge throwing himself wearily into a chair and thrusting his hands deep into his pockets ill listen to your sermon it isnt to be a sermon you should know i am not the kind of a fellow to preach thats so dont mind me drive ahead first i want to ask how it is you happened to let yourself be put back in recitations oh old gunn just put me back thats all but you are fully as good a scholar as i am and you could have gone ahead into the first section if you had braced up perhaps so i know it you do not study whats the use of boning all the time i wasnt cut out for it thats the only way to get ahead here i dont care much about getting ahead all i want is to pull through and graduate then i can go to college if i wish these fellows who get the idea that they must dig dig dig here just as they say they do at west point give me a pain what is there to dig for were not working for commissions in the army from your point of view you put up a very good argument admitted frank but theres another side it surely must be some satisfaction to graduate well up in your class if not at the head and then the more a fellow learns here the easier he will find the work after entering college work pshaw there are not many fellows in colleges who are compelled to bone i hate work i thought you were the kind of a fellow who liked a little fun well you know i am havent i always been in for sport but youre getting to be a regular plodder you dont do a thing lately to keep your blood circulating i am afraid you do too much that is contrary to rules old man for instance where is it that you go so often nights and stay till near morning i go out for a little sport replied bart with a grim smile chapter ii a ghastly subject but you know the consequences if you are caught said frank warningly of course i do nodded bart but you must acknowledge there is not much danger that i shall be caught as long as i make up a good dummy to leave in my place on the bed still you may be thats right and theres where part of the sport comes in as you ought to know for you are quite a fellow to take chances yourself merriwell thats right admitted frank its in my blood and i cant help it anything with a spice of risk or danger attracts and fascinates me you are not in the habit of hesitating or being easily scared when there is some sport in the wind frank smiled i never have been he admitted i have taken altogether too many risks in the past a fellow has to sober down and straighten up if he means to do anything or be anything bart made an impatient gesture any one would think you were a reformed toper to hear you talk he said with a trace of a sneer not if they knew me said frank quietly whatever my faults may be i never had any inclination to drink i have had fellows tell me they did so for fun but i have never been able to see the fun in it and it surely is injurious and dangerous i dont believe many young fellows like the taste of liquor i dont they drink it for fun and they keep on drinking it for fun till a habit is formed and they become drunkards now i can find plenty of fun of a sort that will not harm me or bring i thought you werent going to preach interrupted the darkhaired boy impatiently let me give you a text thou shalt not put an enemy into thy mouth to steal away thy brain or something of the sort now go ahead and spout old man franks face grew red and he bit his lip he saw that hodge was in a most unpleasant humor and so he forced a laugh whats the matter with you today bart he asked i havent seen you this way for a long time oh theres nothing the matter it must be staying up nights where do you go if you want to come along and have some fun i will show you tonight frank hesitated it was a great temptation and he felt a longing to go well he said finally i have not broken any in quite a while and i believe ill take a whirl with you tonight all right nodded bart ill show you some fellows with sporting blood in their veins but i want you to understand i do not propose to follow it up night after night frank hastened to say a fellow cant do it and stand the work thats cut out for him here bother the work ill have to work to keep up with the procession if you can get along without work you are dead lucky oh ill scrub along some way dont you worry and i will come out as well as you do in the end that night some time after taps two boys arose and proceeded to carefully prepare dummies in their beds arranging the figures so they looked very much like sleeping cadets if they were not examined too closely bart was rather skillful at this and he assisted frank in perfecting the figure in merriwells bed there he finally whispered with satisfaction that would fool lieutenant gordan himself they donned trousers and coats and prepared to leave the room in their stocking feet bart opened the door and peered cautiously out into the hall coast is clear he whispered over his shoulder in another moment they were outside the room along the corridor they skurried like cats their feet making no noise on the floor frank was still entirely unaware of their destination but as they had not taken their shoes he knew they were not to leave the building frank cared little where they went but he realized hodge was leading the way to a remote part of the building where the rooms were not entirely taken as the academy was not full of students all at once bart sent a peculiar hiss down the corridor and it was answered by a similar sound a moment later they scudded past a fellow who was hugging in a shadow where the lights did not reach whos that whispered frank thats the sentinel replied bart then they came to the door of a certain room on which hodge knocked in a peculiar manner a faint sound of unbarring came from behind the door which quickly opened and they dodged into the room as yet there was no light in the room and still filled with wonder frank asked was that the regular sentinel out there bart that was our sentinel was the reply but where are the regular sentinels i did not see one of them faint chuckles came from several parts of the room and hodge replied at a certain hour each night the duties of the regular sentinels take them away long enough for me to get out of my room and in here see they must be in the trick the most of them are when it happens that one is not we have to look out for him and dodge him tonight those on duty on this floor were all fixed then somebody cautiously struck a match by the flare of which frank saw several fellows were gathered in the room a lamp was lighted and merriwell looked around besides bart he saw harvey dare george harris wat snell and sam winslow hello merriwell old man some greeted cordially but cautiously glad to see hodge has brought you along frank was instantly seized by an unpleasant sensation a foreboding or a warning harris and snell were not friends of his in fact in the past they had been distinctly unfriendly dare he knew little about as they had never had much to do with each other sam winslow was a plebe having entered the academy at the same time with merriwell but frank had never been able to determine whether he was no good or a pretty decent sort of fellow had frank been governed by his first impression he would have found an excuse to bid that company goodnight immediately but he did not like to do anything like that for he knew it would cause them to designate him as a cad and he would be despised for doing so he had gone too far to back out immediately so he resolved to stay a while and then get out as best he could at the window of the room blankets had been suspended so no ray of light could shine out into the night to betray the little party at a glance frank saw the room was not occupied by students for it contained nothing but the bare furniture besides a box on the table and the assembled lads bart saw frank looking around and divined his thoughts i suppose you are wondering where you are well this is the room in which cadet bolt committed suicide it has been closed ever since as no fellow will occupy it it is said to be haunted this appealed to franks love of the sensational besides that he fancied he saw an opportunity for some sport that was not down in the programme and he smiled a bit of course it isnt haunted he said i dont believe there is a fellow here who believes in ghosts i dont nor i nor i such stuff is rot i dont believe in anything i cant see thus the assembled lads expressed themselves and frank smiled again while i do not believe this room is haunted he said i once had a rather bloodcurdling experience with something like a disembodied spirit an adventure that came near turning my hair snowy white from fright and horror i will tell you about it the original of my ghost happened to be a fellow who committed suicide and he say hold on gurgled wat snell who had declared that believing in ghosts was all rot what are we here for to listen to ghost stories or to have a little picnic oh drop your ghost yam said george harris who had asserted that he did not believe in anything he could not see you may tell it to us some other time but this is a really interesting story insisted frank you see the fellow shot himself three times and when he did not die quickly enough to be suited he cut his throat from ear to ear and his specter was a most ghastlyappearing object bleeding from the bullet wounds and having a gash across its throat from say will you let up gasped harris if you dont ill get out oh i dont want to break up this jolly gathering said frank his eyes twinkling but i was just going to tell how the ghost cheese it interrupted sam winslow talk about something besides ghosts will you you are not given to dwelling on such unpleasant subjects merriwell but i thought you fellows didnt take any stock in ghosts we dont grinned harvey dare and thats just why we dont want to hear about em weve got something else to do besides listen to yarns said harris lets proceed to gorge and he began opening the box that sat on the table chapter iii an irresistible temptation harris is lucky said sam winslow his folks send him a box every now and then and he gets it through old carter at the village i have hard enough time smuggling it in said harris and i share when i get it here for which we may well call ourselves lucky dogs smiled harvey dare a fellow gets awfully weary of the regular rations they have here thats right agreed frank i often long for the flesh pots of egypt or almost anything in the way of a change of fare well heres where you get it if youll agree not to spring any more ghost yarns on us said harris just look over this collection of palate ticklers fellows fruit cake gasped sam delightedly oh how my stomach yearns for it cream pie ejaculated wat snell yum yum somebody please hold me tarts panted harvey dare oh i wont do a thing to them look at the cookies and assorted good stuff murmured bart ecstatically i shall be ready to perish without a tremor after this permit me to do the honors said harris grandly just nominate your poison and i will deal it out so each one called for what he desired and harris supplied them using a pocketknife with which to cut the cake and pie arent you glad you came merriwell asked sam with his mouth full of fruit cake sure smiled frank as he helped himself i shall not regret it if it gives me indigestion frank believed wat snell was a sneak but he did not fancy it would be at all necessary to accept the fellow as a friend just because they had met under such circumstances he meant to use snell well and let it go at that the boys thoroughly enjoyed their clandestine feast it was a luxury a hundred times dearer than a feast from similar things could have been had there been no secrecy about it and had it been perfectly allowable they gorged themselves till they could eat no more and the contents of the box proved none too plentiful for their ravenous appetites when they had finished nothing but a few crumbs were left there sighed harvey dare i havent felt so full as this before since the last time harris had a box nor i said wat snell lighting a cigarette have one merriwell frank declined to smoke but his example was not followed by any of the other lads each one took a cigarette and fired up you ought to smoke merriwell said dare theres lots of pleasure in it perhaps so admitted frank but i dont care for it and as it is against the rules it keeps me out of trouble by not smoking its against the rules to indulge in this kind of a feast old man you cant be too much of a stickler for rules it doesnt do to be too goodygood put in snell insinuatingly such rubbish doesnt go with the fellows i dont think any one can accuse me of playing the goodygood said frank quietly i like fun as well as any one as you all know but i do not care for cigarettes and so i do not smoke them i dont wish to take any credit to myself so i make no claim to resisting a temptation for they are no temptation to me lots of fellows smoke who do not like cigarettes assured sam winslow well i cant understand why they do so declared merriwell they do it for fun i fail to see where the fun comes in there are enough improper things that i would like to do for me not to care about those things that are repugnant to me some time ago i made up my mind never to do a thing i did not want to do or did not give me pleasure unless it was absolutely necessary or was required as a courtesy to somebody else i am trying to stick by that rule oh dont talk about rules cut in dare it makes me weary we have enough of rules here at this academy without making any for ourselves come fellows broke in hodge lets get down to business business said frank questioningly i thought this was a case of sport it is you mustnt be so quick to catch up a word the table was cleared and the boys gathered round it hodge producing a pack of cards the seal of which had not been broken youll notice that those papers are all right he said significantly nobodys had a chance to tamper with them what do you play asked frank to whose face a strange look had come on sight of the cards oh we play most anything euchre seven up poker poker yes just a light game penny ante to make it interesting you know theres no interest in poker unless theres some risk the strange look grew on frank merriwells face he seemed in doubt as if hesitating over something i i think i will go back to the room he said whats that exclaimed several in amazement why you have just got here but i am not feeling exactly right what i have eaten may give me a headache and i have a hard day before me tomorrow oh but we cant let you go now old man said harris decidedly you must stop a while if your head begins to ache and gets real bad of course you can go but i dont see how you can get out now frank did not see either he had accepted harris hospitality had eaten freely of the good things harris had provided and the boys would vote him a prig if he left them for his bed as soon as the feast was finished it would seem that he was afraid of being discovered absent from his room as if he did not dare to share the danger with them frank was generally very decided in what he did and it was quite unusual for him to hesitate over anything there is an old saying that he who hesitates is lost in this case it proved true oh all right fellows said frank lightly ill stop a while and watch you play but you must take a hand you really must you know urged harvey dare our game is small well put on a limit to suit you anything you say i do not play poker if that is your game dont you know how well yes i know a little something about it but i swore off more than a year ago nobody ever swears off on anything for more than a year sit in and take a hand still he refused and they finally found it useless to urge him so the game was begun without him and he looked on the limit was set at ten cents and it was to be a regular penny ante game there was some hesitation over the limit which bart named winking meaningly at one or two of the fellows who seemingly started to protest surely there could not be much harm in such a light game no one could lose a great deal the first deal fell to bart and he shuffled the cards and tossed them round in a way that betokened considerable dexterity and practice the boys were inclined to be jolly but they were forced to restrain their feelings as far as possible for although the rooms near them were unoccupied there was danger that they might be heard by some one who would investigate and their sentinel might not be able to give the warning in time as frank merriwell watched the game a peculiar light stole into his eyes and he was swayed by illrepressed excitement he was tempted to get up and go away for all that anybody might say but he did not go he lingered and he was overcome by an irresistible longing a desire he could not govern finally he exclaimed whats the use for me to sit humped up here give me a hand and let me in chapter iv a game of bluff thats the talk old man exclaimed harvey dare with satisfaction now you are beginning to appear natural the other boys were only too glad to get frank into the game and room was quickly made for him while he was given a hand the moment he decided to play he seemed to throw off the air of restraint that had been about him since he discovered the kind of company bart hodge had brought him into he became his freeandeasy jolly self soon cracking a joke or two that set the boys laughing and beginning by taking the very first pot on the table after entering the game thats bad luck he said with a laugh the fellow who wins at the start usually loses at the finish so i may as well consider my fortune yours some of you will become enormously wealthy in about fifteen minutes for i wont last longer than that if my luck turns he soon betrayed that he was familiar with the game and luck ran to him in a way that made the other boys look tired he seemed able to draw anything he wanted say gasped sam winslow in admiration i shouldnt think youd want to play poker oh no if i had your luck id play poker as a profession why if you drew to a spike youd get a railroad i never saw anything like it wat snell had been losing right along and he sneered theres an old saying a fool for luck you know it applies in this case laughed frank if i wasnt a fool i wouldnt be in this game whats the matter with this game asked harris isnt the limit high enough to suit you thats the matter said dare swiftly lets raise the limit lets throw it off urged snell whats the use of limit any how frank shook his head i dont believe in a nolimit game he said there are none of us millionaires and for that very reason none of us will play a heavy game said sam we have played a nolimit game before and nobody ever bets more than a dollar or so that doesnt happen once a game either twentyfive cents is usually the limit of our bets declared harris then raise the limit to a quarter said frank i am willing to give you fellows a show to get back your money but they did not fancy having the limit a quarter and quite a long argument ensued which resulted in the game being resumed as a nolimit affair there breathed wat snell this is something like it now i can do something if a fellow wanted to bluff he couldnt do it on a tencent limit hodge had said very little but he seemed willing and ready to throw off the limit the change of limit did not seem to affect merriwells luck for he continued to win i believe you are a wizard exclaimed sam winslow you seem to read a fellows cards wat snell growled continually and the more he growled the more he lost oh wait till i catch em byandby he said as he saw frank rake in a good pot i wont do a thing to you if i get a good chance if you have the cards you will win was the reply they are coming for me now and i am simply playing em hodge had lost something but he said little being more than satisfied as long as frank was winning thus the hours passed by one oclock frank was far ahead of the game but he still played on for he knew it would not seem right for him to propose stopping dare harris and winslow were nearly broken but they still hung on hoping for a turn in their direction snell had plenty of money for all that he had been the heaviest loser finally there came a goodsized jackpot which dare opened snell was the next man and he promptly raised it fifty cents winslow dropped out and hodge raised snell fifty cents then it came franks turn and he simply staid in harris was dealing and he dropped out while dare simply made good this gave snell his turn and he boosted two dollars whew breathed winslow that settles me im out hodge was game and he came up on a pair of nines snell was watching merriwell and the latter quietly pushed in two dollars which finished the betting till cards were drawn as dare dropped out after some deliberation how many asked harris of snell dont want any was the calm reply hodge took three as also did merriwell which plainly indicated they had a pair each snell has this pot in a canter said harris snell bet five dollars doing it in a way that seemed to say he was not risking anything hodge dropped his nines which he had not bettered and that left merriwell and snell to fight it out this is why i object to a limit being taken off a game said frank it spoils the fun and makes it a clean case of gambling its too late to make that kind of talk sneered snell you are in it now do you call no replied frank but i will see your five dollars and put in another this created a stir but snell seemed delighted i admire your blood he said but the bluff wont go with me heres the five and i will raise ten now there was excitement franks cards lay face downward on the table and every one was wondering what he could have found to go up against snells pat hand he was wonderfully calm as he turned to bart and asked will you loan me something every cent i have was the instant reply as hodge took out a roll of bills and threw it on the table use what you want there were thirtyfive dollars in the roll frank counted it over carefully and then put it all into the pot raising snell twentyfive dollars when he saw this snells nerve suddenly left him his face paled and his hands shook whoever heard of such infernal luck as that fellow has he grated held up a pair and must have fours now frank said not a word his face was quiet and he seemed waiting for snell to do something if you havent the money to call him began harris i have declared snell but whats the use a man cant beat foolluck heres my hand and ill allow i played it for all it is worth he threw the cards face upward on the table and smothered exclamations of astonishment came from the boys his hand contained no more than a single pair of fourspots then you do not mean to call me asked prank of course not think im a blooming idiot the pot is mine yes well i will allow i played this hand for all it is worth said the winner as he turned his cards over so all could see what they were wat snell nearly fainted merriwells hand was made up of a king eight spot five spot and one pair of deuces it had been a game of bluff and frank merriwell had won chapter v franks revelation great caesar gasped harvey dare will you look at that that is what i call nerve for you that is playing my boys wat snell rose slowly to his feet his face very white its robbery came hoarsely from his lips steady snell warned harvey dare you were beaten at your own game thats all snell knew this but it simply served to make his rage and chagrin all the deeper i am not a professional card player he said bitterly and i am no match for a professional he was more deeply cut by the manner in which he had been beaten than by the loss of his money nor am i a professional came quietly from frank merriwells lips as he quickly sorted from the pot the money he had placed therein i simply sized you up as on the bluff and i was right i dont want your money snell take it i set into this game for amusement and not with the idea of beating anybody to any such extent as this snell hesitated and then the hot blood mounted quickly to his face which had been so pale a few moments before no i will not take the money he grated i take the offer as an insult merriwell no insult is intended i assure you snell was shrewd enough to know he would stand little chance of getting into another game of poker with that company if he accepted the money and so he made a desperate effort to control his rage and play the hypocrite i dont suppose you did mean the offer as an insult merriwell and i presume i was too hasty i am rather quick at times and as dare says i was beaten at my own game which made me hot you had nerve merriwell take the money keep it the words almost choked him but he pretended to be quite sincere although his heart was full of bitterness and a longing to get even it was some time before frank could be persuaded to accept his winnings and when he did finally take it he was resolved to return it quietly and secretly to snell at such a time that no one else could know anything of it this matter was scarcely settled when there came a peculiar rap on the door whos that asked frank in some alarm its our sentinel assured harris his time on post is up the door opened and leslie gage entered the room gage had been merriwells bitter enemy at one time during the summer encampment having made two dastardly attacks on frank who had been generous enough to rescue him from death after that and had saved him from expulsion by refusing to give any testimony against him for all of this generosity on merriwells part gage still bore deep down in his heart a hatred for the plebe who had become so popular at the academy this he tried to keep concealed pretending that he had changed into a friend and admirer hello merriwell he saluted been having a little whirl with the boys i should say he has replied snell he has whirled me wrong end up and i feel as if i am still twisted then the whole play was explained to gage who chuckled over it and complimented frank on his nerve for all of this apparent restoration of good feeling frank was discerning enough to detect the insincerity of both snell and gage gage had done his duty as guard and there was no one on the watch now none of the boys felt like taking the place so it was decided to call the session over for that night you must come again merriwell said dare you have given us the sensation of the evening and you must let snell have a chance to get square yes said snell all i ask is a fair chance to get square if i fail i wont say a word and ill acknowledge you are the best fellow lets shake hands merriwell and call it quits for the time being thats the stuff came from sam winslow now everything is quiet on the potomac again frank shook hands with snell and a few moments later the boys began to slip from the room and skurry along the corridors to their rooms which all reached without being challenged by the sentries bart was filled with satisfaction and delight and before getting into bed he whispered to frank not daring to speak aloud in that room that was the prettiest trick i ever saw and i was delighted to see you rub that fellow he hasnt done a thing to me but win every time i have held up a hand against him of late frank said nothing and had there been a light in the room bart would have seen that his face bore an expression that was anything but one of satisfaction merriwell did not sleep well during the few hours before reveille his slumber was filled with dreams and he muttered and moaned very often awaking hodge once or twice i guess he is still playing thought bart at reveille frank was as a rule very prompt about springing out of bed and hurrying into his clothes and through his toilet on the morning after the game however he continued to sleep till hodge awakened him by a fierce shaking come come man said bart turn out are you going to let a little thing like last night break you up frank got up wearily and stiffly i didnt sleep well he said he was quite unlike his usual spirited self get a brace on urged bart you want to be on hand at rollcall finding it was necessary to get a brace on frank did so and was able to leave the room in time to go rushing down the stairway and spring into ranks at the last second after breakfast as bart was sprucing up the room and frank was vainly trying to prepare himself for the first recitation but simply sat staring in a bewildered way at the book he held the former said you dont know what a slick trick you did last night merriwell why id given almost anything if i had been the one to soak snell in that fashion frank put down the book and rose to his feet pacing twice the length of the room all at once he stopped and faced bart and his voice was not steady as he said you didnt mean any harm old man but you did me a bad turn last night bart stared and asked how by taking me where i could sit into a game like that i am going to tell you something i have one great failing one terrible fault that quite overshadows all my other failings and faults that is my passion for cards or to put it more strongly and properly my passion for gambling bart whistled you dont mean to say that you have a failing or a fault that you cannot govern do you he asked frank put out one hand and partly turned away instantly bart sprang forward and caught the hand saying swiftly there there merriwell dont notice it i didnt mean anything you are sensitive today hang it all man do you think i want to hurt your feelings without cause i shouldnt have said it for i see you are not yourself no i am not confessed frank you know every fellow has a secret i did not intend to tell mine i believe i was born with an intense passion for gambling and you cannot govern it well i have been able to do so during the past year oh you are all right you have a strong mind and every strong mind has a weak spot i began gaming by playing marbles and the passion grew on me when i had money i gambled for cents and nickels as i grew older i learned to play cards and i gambled for larger sums if i knew that a game was going on i would leave everything to get into it once i appropriated money from my mothers purse to gamble with frank stopped his face crimsoned as he uttered the words and he showed his deep shame and humiliation but he quickly added that was my first and last theft the shame and disgrace of exposure by my mother was nearly more than i could endure but she did not know i played cards for money thank god she never knew she died when i was twelve years old i never knew much about my fathers business he was much away from home and i saw him but little after mothers death i went to live with my uncle still i played cards for money and the passion grew upon me a little more than a year ago i was rapidly developing into a young gambler then came news of my fathers sudden death in california and i swore i would never play cards again last night i broke my oath what was the cause of your fathers death asked bart by way of saying something he was shot over a game of cards in a gamblinghouse replied frank hoarsely chapter vi the plot wat snell and leslie gage were roommates and they certainly made a delectable pair gage was naturally the leader being the worse of the two he was a daring and reckless sort of fellow one who would not stop at anything and who would have recourse to almost any measure to gain his ends this revengeful fellow had never forgiven merriwell for what he considered a great injury gage had been the pitcher on the regular ball team but by superior skill merriwell had supplanted him that was enough to produce in gages heart a feeling of undying hatred for the successful plebe it made no difference that frank had in all probability saved him from death after he had twice attempted to kill merriwell gage had been shrewd enough to see that he must dissemble if he would remain in the academy and so he pretended to be repentant and to think frank one of the finest fellows in the world while his hatred and longing for revenge still lay hidden black and hideous in a secret corner of his heart snell was quite a different sort of bad boy he regarded gage as his superior and he was ready to do almost anything for the fellow but he could not imitate leslies daring and he kept his own vileness so much concealed that many square honest lads believed he was a really good fellow bart hodge had begun to think snell was a sneak and bad but he had no proof of it and so he kept still wat was in anything but a pleasant mood the day after the game of cards he flung things round the room in a way that caused gage to regard him with wonder as it was so much unlike the usual quiet crafty roommate he knew whats the matter with you wat he asked in surprise you must be ill go directly and place those things where they belong for we never know when one of those blooming inspectors will pop in i am room orderly this week and am going to have things kept straight for i cant afford to take any more demerit my record is bad enough as it stands so with a little grumbling wat went about and restored to order the things he had disarranged but he could not help thinking how often when he was room orderly he had been obliged to follow gage about and gather up things he had displaced whats the matter repeated leslie who suspected the truth you dont seem to feel well old boy oh its nothing replied wat i was thinking of last night and raising all this row because you happened to drop a dollar why thats the run of the cards oh it wasnt what i lost that made me mad then what was it why i was thinking that that fellow merriwell won and i presume you were thinking how he won the last pot eh yes sullenly you dont love merriwell a great deal i should say not i despise the fellow and youd like to get square wouldnt i i suppose you mean to do so if i ever get the chance yes i fancy you are aware that i am not dead stuck on merriwell myself yes i know i have an old score to settle with him and i will settle it some way i failed in one or two attempts to do him up for you were altogether too bold partner mine and its a wonder you were not expelled from the academy you would have been if merriwell had blowed on you thats right and he would have done so if he had known what was good for him he is soft in some things he may be soft but you must acknowledge he is hard enough in others he has a way of coming on top in almost everything gage could not deny this and it made him angry to think of it you are right he said fiercely i suppose i was foolish to fight him in the way i did that big bully bascomb got a hold on me and he has been blackmailing me ever since hang that fellow ill choke the wind out of him yet a crafty look came to snells face and he said there are ways to down a fellow without showing your hand i suppose so but it usually takes too long to suit me i like to jump on an enemy at once and do him up well i hope you are satisfied that merriwell is the kind of a fellow who will not be jumped on that way it seems so then it is possible you are ready to try some other method their eyes met and wat grinned significantly how do you mean asked leslie eagerly you have some kind of a scheme that fellow won some money off me and i refused to take it back he must show up again and give me a chance to square the score he is bound in honor not to refuse to do so thats right nodded gage well you are rather handy with the cards and i reckon you will not find it hard to fleece him oh i can beat him out of his money but that is poor satisfaction when you want to disgrace a fellow and drive him out of the school well find a way for that if we can get him to following the game i dont know as i see how his parents are dead well he is supported by a rich uncle who sent him here to this school what of that his uncle gives him a regular allowance if merriwell exceeds that allowance there will be inquiries as to what he has done with his money i begin to see this uncle is a stern crusty old fellow and he would be furious if he should accidentally find out that his nephew is gambling the chances are about ten to one that he would take him out of fardale and turn him adrift to hustle for himself gages eyes began to glitter and the smile about his mouth was most unpleasant to see snell he said you have a head on your shoulders you are a dandy schemer but how will this uncle find out that merriwell has been gambling there are several ways for him to find it out if we can get hold of a few of merriwells ious they might be sent to the uncle for collection i see but first we must run him out of ready cash of course by the time he has lost all his money he will be eager to play to win it back we must lend him money and take his ious well do it gage jumped up struck snell a blow on the back and then grasped his hand giving it a shake well do it he repeated merriwells goose is beautifully cooked snell smiled in his crafty way i am glad you take to the scheme for with your aid there ought not to be any trouble in carrying it out oh well work it but how did you find out so much about merriwell thats what sticks me he has been sort of a mystery here as none of the fellows knew exactly where he came from or anything about his folks oh i took a fancy to get posted concerning him at first i didnt see how i was going to do so that was during camp and hans dunnerwust tented with him then i cultivated the thickheaded dutchman and succeeded in getting into his good graces so i often visited hans in the tent when merriwell and mulloy that irish clown who thinks merriwell the finest fellow in the world were away i kept my eyes open and one day i spotted a letter to merriwell i swiped it instanter and it helped me out for it was from his uncle youre an artist in your line wat exclaimed leslie approvingly that letter didnt give me all the information i desired continued snell but i found i had a friend living in a town adjoining the one merriwell hails from so i wrote and asked him to find out a few things for me he rode over on his wheel and found out what i have told you why you are a regular detective old man merriwells mother continued wat has been dead several years no one seems to know much about his father except that he was nearly always away from home and he died suddenly in california a little more than a year ago i havent been able to find out that he left any property so merriwell is dependent on the generosity of a rather crabbed and crusty old uncle whose head is filled with freaks and fancies he seems to be just the kind of a man who would be easily turned against a nephew who had as he would consider it gone astray that settles merriwell if we cannot get the old uncle down on him we are pretty poor schemers they looked at each other and smiled again a precious pair of youthful plotters they were we must be slick about this business warned snell we mustnt let anybody but ourselves get the least wind of it certainly not and we must do our prettiest to pull the wool over merriwells eyes for you know he is rather discerning in some things and he may be inclined to be wary we must seem to think he is the finest fellow in the world that will be pretty hard said leslie with a wry face but i have been doing something in that line of late and i will keep it up that business doesnt come so easy for me as it does for you you can do it if you try and i shall depend on you to skin him with the papers that wont be hard if he plays square i dont think there is any doubt about that he is one of the kind of fellows who doesnt know enough to play any other way then frank merriwells name is mud with a capital m chapter vii spreading the snare the plot was laid the snare was set but the game seemed wary for some time frank merriwell remained away from those midnight gatherings in the room of the student who had committed suicide hang the luck exclaimed gage is he going to keep away right along he must not be allowed to do so said leslie he must be shamed into coming that may not be easy it should not be difficult with a fellow like merriwell he must give me a chance to get even hodge doesnt try to get merriwell out again no he says he will not influence him to attend the gatherings whats the matter with hodge i dont know he is ready enough to come himself it was true that bart had positively refused to use his influence to induce merriwell to attend again one of the secret parties he had been greatly moved by franks revelation and he had resolved not to lead frank into the path that was so fascinating and so dangerous for him he did not know that the evil was already done the fever was burning in merriwells veins frank had been waiting an opportunity to speak with snell in private and it came one day when he met the fellow on the grounds outside the academy hello snell he saluted i have been looking for you and i have been looking for you said wat meaningly why havent you ever come round since that night arent you going to give a fellow a show to get square i am not going to play cards any more what cried wat in apparent astonishment that beats anything i ever heard you have beaten me out of a good roll and now i have been looking for you that i might return every cent you lost that night so you cannot consider me mean if i do not give you a chance to get even over the table if you will tell me just how much you dropped ill make it good now an eager look came to wats face but it quickly vanished for he realized that he would defeat himself if he accepted the money what do you take me for he cried with apparent indignation i am not that kind of a fellow you need never fear that i will say anything about it for i pledge you my word of honor to say nothing all i want is to make sure you do not feel that i have any money that belongs to you i dont care whether you say anything about it or not merriwell that does not keep me from accepting the money i tell you i am not that kind of a fellow you won it and you will keep it unless you have nerve enough to give me an opportunity to win it back this did not suit frank at all for the money had lain like a load on his conscience he had sworn not to gamble again and he had broken his oath but what was worse so long as he kept that money he felt that he really ought to give snell a chance to get square there seemed but one way to get out of playing again and that was to make snell take back the money but it was useless for him to urge wat not a dollar would the fellow accept you cant give me back anything declared snell you won that money by having the most nerve at that time but you cant repeat the trick old man he added jovially come around tonight and see if you can frank shook his head no he declared i shall not come oh whats the use merriwell we want you to come and all the fellows are saying it is not like you to win a few dollars and then stay away i have told them over and over that i do not believe you are staying away because you are afraid i will win the money back youre not that kind of a fellow at that moment snell seemed very sincere and frank said thank you i am glad to know you do not believe such a thing possible of me still i shall not come oh yes you will laughed wat it cant be that youre afraid of being caught if anybody says so ill swear i know better you have nerve enough not to care for that come around tonight well look for you snell hurried away knowing full well that he had said things which must worry merriwell if they did not drive him into coming to the midnight card parties wat was right frank was worried not a little for he could not bear to fancy that some of the boys thought him mean in staying away hodge saw merriwell was troubled but the darkhaired boy remained silent in the meantime finding hodge would do nothing to bring merriwell round gage and snell tried their best to make friends with hans dunnerwust and barney mulloy as these boys were particular friends of merriwells and might be induced to use some influence over him barney however was wary he did not fancy either gage or snell and he repulsed their advances to hans the temptation of a midnight supper on cakes and pies was too much to resist and he was added to the circle that gathered in the room of the suicide hans could play poker and the game being made small enough to suit him he came in and won about two dollars which made him swell up like a toad and declared uf you poys know some games vot i can play petter as dot boker shust you name him und i vill do you at dot oh i vose a dandy on trucks aind it shust keep your eye on me und i vill learn some tricks vot you dond know alretty yet snell did his best to make hans believe he was a great favorite and then he told him how frank had won the only time he had appeared in the game and had never come around since some of the fellows seem to think he is afraid i will win the money back said wat but i dont take any stock in that for merriwells not that kind of a fellow still i dont like to have such ideas concerning him get into circulation dot vos vere i vos righdt nodded hans he dont peen dot kindt uf a feller ad all you pet me my shirt dot vrankie merrivell vos a taisy undt he dond peen afrait a show to gif anypody you vait till i tell him vot dose fellers say i pet me your life he vill gome aroundt bretty kuveek righdt avay oh dont say anything about it exclaimed snell as if he really wished hans to keep silent merriwell knows his business his friends will stand up for him no matter what others may say vell i vos going to toldt him dot shust der same uf he dond peen aroundt here der next dime i dond know der kindt uv a feller vot he vos peen yet avile well dont mention that i said anything he might fancy i thought him afraid to come round i dond call your name at all dond you let me vorry apout dot snell knew the dutch boy would lose little time in communicating with frank and he was right hans did not see that frank was little like his usual jovial self and he did not know in what a turbulent state of mind the unfortunate plebe was left bart was not a little worried over frank for he saw how the lad had changed in a short time but he hoped that merriwell would come round in time and be his old jolly self that evening a short while before taps frank asked i suppose it is another card party tonight yes replied bart a few of us are going to get together will snell be there i presume so no more was said bart rose and slipped out of the room at the usual time thinking frank was asleep but frank was not asleep and hodge was scarcely gone when he too arose and began to arrange a dummy in his bed chapter viii the haunted room the little party of card players was expectantly awaiting the appearance of bartley hodge there was to be no feast this night nothing but cigarettes and draw poker hodge appeared at last and he brought a disappointment to at least two of the party for frank merriwell was not with him leslie gage and wat snell exchanged glances that were full of meaning sam winslow was on guard outside it being his turn to fill that unenviable position hello hodge saluted harvey dare now we are ready to proceed to business dot vas righdt nodded hans dunnerwust who was on hand i vos goin to smoke cigarreds tonighd dill i vos sick und haf a pully dime why doesnt merriwell ever show up again asked leslie gage thats it joined in wat snell why doesnt he come round and give a fellow a show to win back some of that money he won off us is he afraid you know well enough that frank merriwell is not afraid said bart quickly well it looks that way declared leslie yes it looks that way echoed wat possibly he has too much sense to spend his nights here said hodge if i had known that much i wouldnt have gone back a class merriwell is in the first section and he is making right along well he is a different fellow than i thought he was asserted snell until lately he has seemed quite a fellow for sport but he is degenerating into a drone such drones are the fellows who get along well in school and in the world bah give me a fellow with blood in him came contemptuously from gage leslie had grown desperate having come to the conclusion that frank was not to be cajoled into playing poker any more he now determined of a sudden that he would take another tack and see if he could not anger merriwell into coming hodge remembered that gage had tried to injure frank in the past and the darkeyed plebe was ready to blaze forth in an instant although he did not know it gage was treading on the very thin crust that covered a smoldering volcano leslie was not warned by the fire that gleamed in barts eyes for he continued if merriwell persists in staying away if he does not show up and give snell a chance to get square he is a knock at the door it was the regular signal for admittance and so after the first start of alarm george harris said open up quickly it must be sam and if so theres something wrong in the wind wat snell opened the door and to their amazement into the room stepped frank merriwell it was with difficulty that the boys suppressed a shout of welcome snell quickly closed the door and then the boys rushed at frank and shook his hand delightedly youre a sight for sore eyes exclaimed wat snell joyously dot vos so agreed hans you vould peen a sighd for a plind man i will take back anything i said and swallow what i was going to say came from leslie gage i didnt think it could be possible you wouldnt come round again old man now we will have a jolly little racket said george harris and you want to look out for merriwell he is a great bluffer but he doesnt bluff all the time supplemented harvey dare i found out that he held cards occasionally for i called him a few the last time he was around frank laughed it was his old jolly laugh suppressed somewhat he seemed like himself once more as bart hodge instantly noted he had cast off the strain under which he had been for so long and now frank merriwell mischievous and full of fun was on deck again but this did not quite please hodge who watched his roommate closely his uneasiness growing as he saw how carefree merriwell seemed what had brought about such a change had frank thrown his resolutions to the wind ive got a supply of coffinnails said snell as he produced several packages of cigarettes help yourselves gentlemen pass them round round they went and when they reached frank merriwell he accepted one i am going to be real dissipated tonight he laughed as he struck a match and fired up you may have to carry me to my room on a shutter for i actually am going to smoke leslie gage and wat snell exchanged glances of satisfaction a black look came to bart hodges face and he half started up as frank took the cigarette acting as if he would utter a warning then he settled back in his seat thinking let him smoke if he wants to one cigarette will do nobody harm but hodge knew in his heart that it was not the smoking of one or a dozen cigarettes that was dangerous to merriwell it was the breaking of his resolutions it was the feeling of abandon and recklessness that had seemed to seize upon him not much time was lost in beginning the game but now bart insisted on a proper limit what do you say merriwell asked george harris what kind of a limit suits you anything from five cents to the sky was the laughing reply fix it to suit yourselves once more gage and snell exchanged glances bart stuck for a moderate limit but he finally agreed to make it a dollar the ante being five cents vell uf i had pad luck i dond last long at dot said hans i dond haf more as four tollars und sefen cends merriwell won at the start the last time he was here and he kept the luck straight through to the finish observed harvey dare it isnt often such a thing occurs a few minutes later as harris beat frank the latter said this game starts differently from the other fellows i have lost at the beginning and to keep up the precedent i have established i must lose all through it he said this smilingly as if he really wished to lose as the cards were being dealt bart who sat by his roommates side leaned toward frank and softly asked what made you come old man couldnt keep away was the reply well be careful keep watch of yourself not tonight bart i am going to let loose on this occasion frank played recklessly from the start and fortune fluctuated with him for he would forge ahead and then drop behind but he was never much ahead nor far behind for all of his careless playing he seemed to hang about even leslie gage was too shrewd to try to get at frank on this occasion for he wanted merriwell to win again so they would get a still firmer hold upon him wat snell lost steadily soon beginning to growl and keeping it up once under cover of conversation the others were making he leaned toward gage and muttered merriwell is my hoodoo i cant do a thing with him in the game keep cool warned leslie never mind what happens this time well get at him again hans dunnerwust managed to blunder along and keep in the game by sheer luck for he did not play the cards for their face value at any time still he made enough to keep on his feet and not have to get out of the game vell hans finally exclaimed as he tried in vain to win uf i dond do petter as dot i vill suicide go und gommit bretty soon alretty by the way hans said frank do you know that the fellow who used to have this room committed suicide here shimminy gristmas gurgled the dutch boy you dond say dot yes i do and the room is said to be haunted by his spook which cannot rest in its grave vell dot vos nice oxcuse me while i haf a chill at this moment a hollow groan seemed to come from beneath the chair on which hans sat and the dutch lad gave a jump getting on his feet quickly and peering under the chair his face growing pale as he chattered vot vos dot aind id some of the other boys were not a little alarmed for all had heard it distinctly it it actually sounded like a groan said wat snell thats what it did agreed george harris but you know it couldnt have been anything of the sort laughed frank for you fellows do not believe in ghosts who who who said anything about ghosts stammered snell at this moment another groan louder and more dismal than the first seemed to come from directly beneath the table there was a scrambling among the boys as they hastened to get their legs from beneath that table i dond feel very vell aroundt der bit uf mein stomach gasped hans i pelief i vos going to be sick alretty yet one of the boys held the light while they all looked under the table but they did not find anything there now that is singular commented harvey dare if that wasnt a groan i never heard one in my life and a real ghostly groan at that said leslie gage i never did take any stock in this rot about ghosts but beware young man how you mock at the spirits of the departed the voice seemed to come from one of the alcove bedrooms and it was of the sort to make the hair stand on the head of a superstitious person oh dunder und blitzen panted hans dot vos a shook uf i dont ged avay oud uf here righd off i peen gone grazy i dond vant any shook in mine it is some fellow playing a joke on us said harvey dare angrily some one has concealed himself in there bring the light fellows and we will soon find out he started for the alcove but no one seemed anxious to take the light and follow him after a moment however frank did so all through both alcoves harvey searched and his face was rather pale when he and frank returned to the table what did you find asked wat snell thickly not a thing but dust replied harvey there hasnt been a living soul in either of those bedrooms since the room was closed after the suicide ha ha ha laughed the hollow voice you are right they dare not come but i am doomed to stay here till this building shall crumble and decay vell you may sday till der cows come home gurgled hans but i dond peen caught in here any more bretty soon righd avay you pet and he made a break for the door the others quickly extinguished the light and followed him there would be no more gatherings in that room chapter ix in the meshes frank merriwell fancied he had hit upon a scheme to stop the card games from which he could not remain away being a skilled ventriloquist he was the author of the dismal groans and the mysterious voice that had so alarmed the boys bart was not in the secret and so he wondered when he heard frank chuckling to himself after they had safely reached their room and were getting into bed for several days the gang was disconsolate having no place in which they could play a game of cards without fear of detection at any instant frank merriwell seemed restored to his usual jolly self he laughed and joked and did not seem worried over anything but the gang would not remain long without a place in which to play cards one day frank received an invitation to sit into a little game that evening snell tendered the invitation merriwells face clouded instantly why there is no place to play is there sure was the reply you didnt suppose wed be knocked out so easy did you where do you play come along with hodge tonight and he will show you you have been there before but frank did not come along three nights he knew of bart rising and stealing out of the room then there was an interval of two nights during which bart plainly too much used up to stand the strain or else out of money remained in his bed when hodge arose again and prepared to go out he heard a stir in merriwells alcove are you awake frank he asked softly yes was the reply and i am going with you bart hesitated he was tempted to undress and return to bed but he had received his money from home that day and having lost heavily the last time he played he was anxious for satisfaction im not merriwells guardian he thought i guess the fellow is able to take care of himself so he told frank to dress fully for going out and to take his shoes in his hand together they crept from the room slid along the corridor watched a favorable moment to get past the sentinel and finally found their way into a room where the gang was waiting there was much whispered satisfaction when merriwell was known to be with hodge then the window was softly opened and one by one the boys descended the fireescape which ran past that window the last one out closed the window having arranged it so it could be readily opened from the outside behind the messhall they sat down on the ground and pulled on their shoes it was a cool starry night i rather fancy i know where we are bound said frank where asked bart to the old boathouse down the cove sure you are a good guesser old man then the thought came to frank that it would be a good thing for fardale academy if that boathouse should burn to the ground it was there plebes generally received their first hazing and there most of the fights between the cadets took place to the boathouse they went and this night luck ran against frank for he lost heavily there he said as he and bart were returning together i can stay away from the game now and no one will have a right to accuse me of meanness for i have dropped more than i made at both of the other games i have been in thats right assured bart you may do as you like now and ill fight the fellow that dares open his trap about it but frank had taken the false step that leads to others and he was to find it no easy thing to keep away from the game that fascinated him so for a little time he succeeded but he was uneasy and in a bad way so long as he knew a game was going on night after night he heard bart dress and slip out and the longing to accompany him grew and grew till it was unbearable whats the matter with merriwell one of his classmates asked of another he was making right along at one time and we all thought he would head the class but now he is making an average of less than oh he is flighty replied the other do you notice that he doesnt seem to be as jolly and full of fun as he was once i believe he is in some kind of trouble declared the first he doesnt ever get a max lately by way of explanation let us state a max was the highest mark obtainable or or was considered first class was really good was fair and below that it fell off rapidly too which meant utter failure frank was indeed in trouble he found it impossible to keep away from the poker parties and so one night after bart had departed being unable to sleep he got up and followed his roommate again gage and snell were rejoiced for they saw they had merriwell fairly within the meshes all that was needed now was to close the net carefully and draw it tighter and tighter about him till there was no possible escape this trick was accomplished with consummate skill franks luck seemed to have deserted him but at first his losings were just heavy enough to provoke without alarming him sometimes he would win a little and then he would fancy his luck had turned but the tide soon set the other way made angry by his petty losses he followed the game with dogged persistency and those petty losses soon began to grow larger and larger his money melted away rapidly and still fortune frowned on him in vain hodge counseled his friend to drop the game and stay away such advice was now wasted on frank and it made him angry its too late he hotly declared i am going to see the thing through and so the meshes of the snare closed around him chapter x downward in vain gage and snell tried to get hold of some ious with frank merriwells name on them franks money was exhausted and he stopped playing suddenly gage offered to loan him money but he had not forgotten the past and not a cent of gages cash would he touch then snell tried it but was no more successful this made them both angry confound the fellow said gage fiercely weve got him badly tangled but he seems to have taken the alarm and im afraid he will break away we must not let him do so said snell if we lose our fish now well never land him what can be done that is for us to study out and so they set about plotting and trying to devise still other schemes to disgrace frank and drive him from the academy in the meantime a feeling of revulsion had seized frank merriwell of a sudden he had perceived whither he was drifting he realized what false steps he had already taken and he was heartily ashamed of himself among his treasures was a medal of honor presented to him by congress for twice saving the life of inza burrage a pretty girl who lived in fardale and whose brother walter was a cadet at the academy once he had fought a mad dog with no weapon but a claspknife and kept the creature from biting inza and once he had saved her from death beneath the wheels of the afternoon express which flew through fardale village without stopping coming across this medal where he kept it choicely deposited it suddenly brought to him an overwhelming feeling of selfabasement and shame what would inza burrage think of him if she knew of his weakness knew that he was playing cards for money and making associates of such fellows as gage and snell it was true that she did not know either gage or snell for what they really were at heart but frank did and there really seemed no excuse for him he tried to excuse himself by saying he had been led into temptation through hodge but in another instant he felt meaner than before you ought to be ashamed merriwell he told himself you have all the influence in the world over hodge if you use your power skillfully and instead of trying to shoulder the blame on him you should be disgusted with yourself for making no attempt to save him from such company and such practices then he thought of the money he had lost how could he stop without making an effort to win it back if he could have one good streak of luck and win enough to make himself square he would stop this very desire to get square with the game has been the ruin of more than one promising youth so he told himself over and over that he would stop as soon as he got square saturday came round inza burrage had sent him word through her brother that she would visit belinda snodd that afternoon and he might see her there if he cared to call belinda snodd was the daughter of john snodd a rather queer old fellow who ran an odd sort of boardinghouse for summer people who visited the cove on which fardale academy was situated snodd each year boarded a number of applicants for admission to the academy until they had prepared themselves for examination and been accepted or turned away frank had boarded there when he first came to fardale and so he knew the family well but how could he meet inza that afternoon he was in no mood to meet her she had regarded him as a hero as being very near perfection if she knew the truth i cant do it frank muttered not till i face about squarely can i see her again but as the afternoon came round he was seized by a great longing to catch a glimpse of her at least mechanically he began dressing as if he were going to call on her hodge was reading a book he flung it aside with an impatient exclamation that was followed by a yawn im tired of that old thing he cried i am tired of everything you need a rest bart said frank you are not getting enough sleep i am getting as much as you i say frank dont you think living is a bore anyway not when a fellow lives right right what do you mean by that isnt a chap to have any sport yes but there are two kinds of sport so called one is healthy invigorating delightful like baseball and football for instance the other is fascinating injurious debasing like poker bart stared at frank a moment as if he were somewhat puzzled and then said i guess you are right old man i hadnt ever thought of it just that way before id swear off and try to keep away from the game if i wasnt in so deep you have lost quite an amount lately yes i have been knifed deep gage has astounding luck do you think it is all luck bart looked surprised why to be sure the fellow plays a square game why should he you know as well as i that he is not square by nature thats right but his cards are cut every time and he doesnt know enough to put em up there are other ways of cheating besides putting the cards up thats true but i do not believe gage is on that lay he simply has beastly big luck perhaps you do not think so i do not know you will remember that gage has no particular love for either of us and we have both lost heavily do you mean to quit playing possibly hodge looked doubtful for he now understood how strong must be the temptation for merriwell to follow the game frank completed dressing and left the academy he turned his footsteps in the direction of snodds but still he had no intention of going there keeping under the brow of the hill he passed around to a large grove in the rear of snodds buildings it was early october now and the air was bracing and exhilarating for all the afternoon was mild the trees were flaming with color and the leaves had begun to sift down in the grove squirrels romped and chattered it seemed good to frank to get away alone under the shadow of the trees new strength and new life came to him and new resolves and determinations formed themselves unsought and unbidden in his mind he felt that it was a privilege and a blessing to be alive had he felt free to meet inza then he would have been quite happy he flung himself down beneath a great tree at the edge of the grove where he could see snodds buildings for a long time he lay there thinking and dreaming suddenly he started up three figures were leaving the buildings and coming toward the grove he saw they were three girls and he instantly recognized one of them as inza the others were belinda snodd and one of the village girls with whom frank was slightly acquainted mabel blossom generally known as may blossom they are coming here exclaimed frank they must not see me he arose hastily and scurried away into the grove and he did not stop till he had reached the shore there he sat down amid some rocks and remained a long time as it seemed to him but he could not resist the temptation to steal back and see if the girls were still in the grove he finally arose and did so as he passed through the grove and came out near the old picnicground he suddenly halted and stepped behind a tree for he had come upon two persons in earnest conversation they were inza burrage and leslie gage chapter xi trusting and true instantly a surge of jealousy swept over frank merriwell how did it come about that gage had met inza there was it by appointment belinda snodd and may blossom were in plain view a short distance away and wat snell was trying to make himself agreeable to them without intending to eavesdrop frank paused there a moment unconsciously listening he heard inza say the others cannot hear you now mr gage so you can tell me the important thing you have to reveal i dont know as you will be pleased to hear it said gage with an attempt at great apparent sincerity for it is about your friend frank merriwell and you will not like to hear anything unpleasant of him inza drew herself up proudly you cannot tell me anything of mr merriwell that will make me think less of him she declared her dark eyes flashing that was enough to chain frank to the spot he could not have slipped away then had he desired to do so perhaps not said gage with a significant smile but i think i can how has frank merriwell ever injured you that you should be slandering him behind his back for an instant this staggered leslie like a blow in the face but he swiftly recovered oh merriwell has never injured me and i havent the least thing in the world against him he said smoothly but i do take an interest in you and it makes me sorry to see you so absorbed in a fellow utterly unworthy of your friendship utterly unworthy to be spoken to or even noticed by you gage spoke rapidly for he saw she was eager to interrupt him her face grew pale and she stamped one small foot angrily on the ground as she flung back this is not the first time you have tried to injure him and you should be ashamed why he saved you from the eagles ledge after you had fallen over black bluff which was exactly what any fellow would have done for another under similar circumstances that is not to his credit i beg you to listen it has taken me some time to make up my mind to tell you the truth to warn you and now i must to begin with merriwell comes of an uncertain family although i believe he has an uncle who has some money and that uncle is paying the fellows way through fardale academy what do i care about his family so long as i know him to be a noble fellow you forget sir that he has twice saved my life no i have not forgotten i do not blame you for being grateful but you must know the whole truth about him frank merriwell is a gambler he plays cards for money i dont believe it were the words that came from inzas lips and sent a thrill of shame through the lad behind the tree but it is true and i can prove it i will prove it too if i prove it to your satisfaction miss burrage will you cut the fellow and have nothing to do with him in the future frank leaned forward holding his breath eager to hear the answer it came promptly and decisively no gage caught his breath do you mean to say you will still be friends with a regular gambler like merriwell he asked i do not believe frank merriwell is a gambler you can never make me believe it but i will bring proof even then i will believe your proof is hatched up against him this made gage lose his head why you are awfully stuck on that cad he cried you are altogether too fine a girl for him he suddenly caught her in his arms and tried to embrace her she struggled and cried out for help like a panther frank merriwell bounded from behind the tree he caught gage by the collar and tore inza from his grasp then franks fist shot out landing with a sharp spat right between leslies eyes a second later gage came in violent contact with the ground frank exclaimed inza as he supported her wat snell and the two girls with whom he had been talking had witnessed the entire affair they now came hurrying toward the spot the miserable cur cried frank i will dont touch him again urged inza oh you struck him an awful blow in truth frank had given gage a heavy blow and it was some seconds before the fellow made a move snell helped him sit up leslie put his hand to his head and stared in a dazed way at frank are you hurt much old man asked wat sympathizingly i guess not mumbled gage what did he strike me with his fist why it seemed like a rock wat helped him to his feet and the two stood glaring at frank who regarded them with supreme scorn shall we sail in and do him up asked wat excitedly yes said leslie we will give him a good drubbing instantly frank placed inza to one side and boldly faced the two young rascals i dont believe you both can whip me the way i feel just now he cried i think i can give you more fight than you want so just sail right in they hesitated there was something about merriwells look and bearing that seemed to warn them against attacking him to wat snell it suddenly seemed quite probable that frank would prove more than a match for both of them there are ladies present he said hastily we cannot fight in the presence of ladies very thoughtful came scornfully from franks lips possibly the ladies will step aside long enough for us to settle this little matter oh dont fight with them frank pleaded inza there are two of them and that is not enough i am good for two such sneaking scoundrels as they are dont worry about me hear the blowhard sneered snell frank seemed on the point of springing toward him and wat hastily dodged behind leslie saying give it to him les if he wants to fight this showed how much gage could depend on snell in a scrimmage and the former instantly decided that it was not best to try to get revenge on merriwell just then there will be no fighting here he said loftily but i shall not forget merriwells blow and he shall pay dearly for it i will make him wish he had not been so free with his fist as for you miss spitfire turning to inza you must feel proud to have a friend in a fellow of his class do not forget what i told you about him and silence sir cried inza contemptuously you had better go away at once i wouldnt believe such a contemptible creature as you under any circumstances all right all right growled gage scowling blackly you will find out in time that i told the truth this is not the end of this matter come wat lets go if i stay any longer ill have to whip merriwell before all of the present company so the delectable pair moved away together and gages revengeful heart was made still more bitter by the ringing laugh of scorn inza burrage sent after them chapter xii the snare is broken when frank parted from inza that afternoon he had made a free and full confession of his fault she had listened with pained surprise almost with incredulity but she had not shown the scorn that frank felt he fully deserved however she had exacted a pledge which he had freely given and returning to the academy he felt that he was himself once more his step was elastic his heart was light and he whistled a lively strain that evening he had a long talk with bart come bartley urged frank drop this cardplaying and give attention to your studies bart was in a bad mood as he had been much of the time lately and he laughed harshly youre a fine fellow to give that sort of advice when you cannot keep away from the game yourself he said but i can keep away came quietly and decidedly from franks lips prove it i will i am not going to play any more i have been a fool and i am ashamed of it that is easy enough to say but well we will see what we will see you doubt my ability to keep away from the game havent i reason to do so you surely have but look here bart you know as well as i the kind of fellows we are running with when we play cards with that gang neither you nor i care to call gage and snell our particular friends thats right and harris is a kind of uncertain fellow neither one thing nor another sure sam winslow hasnt enough stamina to resist temptation of any sort go on harvey dare is a pretty decent chap but he doesnt care a rap what people think or say of him well hans dunnerwust has been inveigled into the game and i am going to do my best to make him break away bart drew a deep breath go ahead frank he said and i hope you may succeed in your missionary work you didnt name my failings but i have them or they have me for i cant break away from them you can if you will try make a desperate effort bart think how differently you are situated than i who was born with a passion for gambling bart rose impatiently drop it old man he growled ive lost too much to knock off now i am going to play tonight tonight why it is saturday night yes if you begin playing you will not stop before sunday comes in perhaps not you dont mean to say that you are going to play on sunday the better the day the better the deed mocked bart frank said no more but he formed a firm resolution he would find a way to save his roommate and break up the card game gage and snell were welcome to all they had won off him but he would bring their career to an end how was he to do it surely he could not report them for that would place him beneath a ban among the cadets he studied over the problem that night when hodge arose to slip away frank got up also and began to dress bartley heard him and was surprised where are you going frank he whispered with you was the quiet reply but i thought hodge stopped he would not say what he thought but he told himself that he had known all along that frank could not keep away they got out of the academy and made their way to the old boathouse where the company was already assembled gage and snell were there but neither of them spoke to frank bart sat into the game immediately but to the general surprise frank declined i am short and i dont feel like playing tonight he said ive got a book i want to read and it wasnt possible for me to have a light in quarters so i came along he declined all offers of money and sat down to read the book he turned his back to the table so the light fell on the pages from over his shoulder and in a short time he seemed too much absorbed in the book to observe anything that was going on the game became very warm it was without limit and hodge lost from the first both gage and snell were winning steadily still merriwell seemed to read on calmly but he was not reading a great deal in the palm of one hand he had a small mirror concealed by the aid of this mirror he was watching the movements of gage and snell and he was making some very interesting discoveries at length there came a large pot hodge and gage stayed in and raised till every one else fell out hodge took one card gage who was dealing took two then there was betting such as had never before been known in that old boathouse hodges face was pale and he refused to call for he believed his time to get square had come he put in his paper for more than fifty dollars after his money was exhausted finally the game came to an end and gage proclaimed himself the winner he started to take the money lying on the table like a leaping tiger frank merriwell came out of his chair whirled thrust leslies hands aside and pushed the money toward bart not this evening mr gage he said i am onto your little game and it wont work any more with this crowd the boys sprang to their feet what do you mean asked gage hoarsely his face very pale i mean that you are a sneak and a cheat said frank deliberately i mean that you are too mean and contemptible for any honest fellow in this academy to ever have anything to do with i mean that you have deliberately robbed your companions by means of crooked appliances made for dishonest gamblers that is exactly what i mean mr gage leslie gasped and managed to say be careful you will have to prove every word or i will prove it i have been watching you and i have seen you repeatedly make the pass that restores cut cards to their original position i have seen you hold back at least three of the top cards in dealing and give them to snell or take them yourself those cards will be found to be skillfully marked and that pack is short boys count those cards the cards were counted and the pack proved to be four cards short here is one of the gamblers appliances of which i spoke said frank thrusting his hand under leslies side of the table and wrenching away something it is a table holdout and it contains the four missing cards this is the kind of a fellow you are playing cards with gentlemen the faces of the boys were black with anger wat snell being excepted seeing his opportunity snell quickly slipped away and before he could be stopped had bolted from the boathouse gage took advantage of the excitement to make a break for liberty and he too got away what a howling shame said harvey dare in disgust wed tar and feather them both anyway theyll have to get out of the academy the boys who had put money into the game were given what they had invested the rest was turned over to hodge it made his losing nearly square this settles me he said grimly i am done playing no more of this business for me stick to that and you will be all right said frank merriwell in a low tone leslie gage knew what must follow the story was bound to spread among the cadets and he would find himself scorned and shunned he immediately ran away and it was reported that he had gone to sea wat snell had not the nerve to run away but he found himself the most unpopular fellow at the academy shunned by the cadets generally and regarded with contempt the exposure of gages crookedness broke up the poker parties for that season at least and frank was happy for he had saved himself and rescued hodge and hans dunnerwust but he was happiest in receiving the approbation of inza burrage who learned through her brother what frank had done chapter xiii the centipede joke sh whats up theres a carmine haze on the moon thats clear as mud whats the racket you room next to mulloy and dunnerwust yes well you will hear the racket just about the time taps sound but i want to know whats up persisted the second speaker whose curiosity was aroused has somebody put up a job on those two marks mulloy and his dutch chum youve guessed it who guess again merriwell right take your place at the head of the class this hasty and guarded conversation was carried on between two plebe cadets who had met in a corridor of the academy cockloft the first speaker was a jollyfaced little fellow whose name was sammy smiles and whose companions had failed to invent a nickname for him that fitted as well as his real name smiles the other boys name was also samuel or the first part of his name was samuel but the cadets declined to have two sams among the plebes and so samuel winslow had gradually come to be known as poke whats merriwell up to now asked poke a look of delighted suspense on his face hes making things rather lively round here lately you bet grinned sammy smiles theres more fun in him than there is in a barrel of monkeys but whats he up to now reiterated winslow dont keep a fellow in suspense he smuggled in a basket of crawfish well well you dont suppose he got em to eat do you course not is he going to make the dutchman eat them no but they may take a few bites out of the dutchman you dont mean hes put the crawfish into dunnerwusts and mulloys beds jeewhiz poke clapped a hand over his mouth and looked round hastily then he asked how could he do it beds aint made up till after tattoo and he wouldnt have time to tattoo sounded fifteen minutes ago it doesnt take mulloy more than two minutes to make up his beds hans is slower but i hustled em both up tonight i dodged into their room the instant tattoo sounded and told em gray wanted em both to come to his room but they mustnt come till after their beds were made for they might stay till it was too late to make the beds before taps they both hustled up the beds and then skipped over to see gray merriwell was watching and he didnt lose more than an hour getting that basket of crawfish into their room and stowing the lively little birds in the beds oh my wont there be a howl when they yank themselves into bed sammy smiles doubled up with suppressed laughter he was convulsed at the thought of what would happen when the dutch boy and the irish lad hastily jumped into their beds merriwell takes the cake poke declared with a chuckle hes been on a regular frolic for the last week and he can invent more kinds of fun than any fellow living besides himself thats right agreed sammy frank is a dandy things would be rather dull here this winter if it wasnt for him well hell never let them get dull and i believe he is the best fellow that ever lived right again nodded the other lad with a moment of seriousness merriwell is the prince of good fellows and theres not a white man in the academy who wouldnt fight for him i know some fellows are down on him but thats pure jealousy theyre sore because he has become so popular i dont believe he cares much if he wouldnt stick up for hodge the way he does that shows his loyalty i cant see what he finds to admire in hodge though the fellow can fight and play ball he and frank do not seem very well matched for roommates i dont see how merriwell can keep from working jokes on hodge all the time jingoes but wouldnt i laugh if he had put some of those crawfish in hodges bed this fancy convulsed sammy again and just then poke hissed sh somebodys coming skip both made haste to get into their rooms and as sammy roomed with ned gray he found barney mulloy and hans dunnerwust being entertained there ned was telling them stories and pretending to be greatly absorbed in their society as sammy slipped in with the inevitable grin on his face although he was doing his best to suppress it ned looked up and asked hows the weather outside it is settled replied sammy with a meaning wink do you think it will be a cold night it will be for some folks when the weather is cold down east they call it nipping well it will be nipping tonight for some people in that case somebody will have to be stirring thats right yaw said hans with a lazy yawn i pet me your life some folks peen plame fools enough to peen sdirring tonighd dot makes me dired vy in dunder dond dey gid in dere peds und sday dere aind id oh some people dont know enough for that said ned gray and then there are people who are afraid to go to bed at this season of the year vot vos dot afrait uf vot centipedes vot vos cendibedes they are a creature with a poisonous bite and they are all sizes from the bigness of a pea to one as large as your hand oh phwat are yez givin av us cried barney mulloy derisively is it idiots or fools ye take us fer oi dunno oh i am telling you the sober truth declared ned with the utmost seriousness while sammy smiles got behind the visitors and stuffed his handkerchief into his mouth to keep from shrieking with laughter the centipedes of tropical countries are smaller than our regular winter centipedes which are sometimes as large as a mans hand their bite is deadly poison dunder und blitzens gasped hans i dond tole you dot get away wid yer blarney exclaimed barney disbelievingly pwhat do yez take us fer oi

leglike claws and are covered with hard shells und dey pite well i should say so put vy vos some beoples afrait dose cendibedes uf to go to ped you tole me dot well these winter centipedes are great creatures to seek warm corners and so they get into beds sammy smiles was ready to roll on the floor he could not keep his laughter bottled up and it burst forth in a gurgle which he quickly changed to a most distressing cough wan thing is sure said barney nivver a cintipade is loikely to get inther our beds fer we make em up ache noight so wed see th craythers if they wur there i believe one of them has never been seen in the academy came seriously from neds lips the strict discipline of the institution is too much for them and they keep away barney grinned thots all roight me by some doay

enditled big injun on der rhine aind id oh well thats all right said ned with a wave of his hand as if he was not quite pleased then he looked at his watch and exclaimed great scott weve got but one minute left in which to undress and get into bed before taps he leaped up and began undressing and with exclamations of alarm the irish lad and the dutch boy hustled from the room losing no time about getting into their own and undressing did merriwell fix it asked ned of sammy you bet was the reply extinguish the flicker and wait for the general wardance it will take place in a very few seconds so they extinguished the light and awaited the outburst that must soon come chapter xiv lively times barney and hans dashed into their room and tore themselves out of their clothes which however they took care to hang in order on the pegs placed along the partition that divided one end of the room into two alcoves long practice enabled them to undress with great swiftness by the time taps began to sound they were ready to jump into their beds barney quickly extinguished the light but hans lost no time in getting under the blankets while the irish lad made a leap to do so then came a cry of astonishment and fear from hans shimminy gristmas exclaimed the dutch boy vot dot vos i touch me to aind id shut up growled barney bad cess to yez do yez phwant th officer av th guarrud doon on us

loight th lamp hellup hellup hellup in some way they scrambled to their feet and both lunged for the door which they beat upon with their fists as if they would tear it down docther bellowed barney

yez well see about thot biff smack thud thump the two frantic boys were hammering each other in the darkness of their room while the listening jokers were convulsed with merriment the uproar had aroused that entire section of the academy the sentinel came down the corridor at the double quick just as frank merriwell partly dressed leaped out of his room and flung himself against the door of the room from which the racket issued other boys came swarming into the corridor and the excitement was intense merriwell burst into the room and a moment later dragged out hans and barney into the lighted corridor the crawfish were still clinging comfortably to various portions of the garments in which the two lads had gone to bed seeing the creatures hans uttered a howl of agony louder than any that had yet issued from his throat cendibedes he wailed i vos a tead boy i vos peen bit in more as nine huntred und sefenteen blaces alretty yet vere vos dot toctor theyre centipades sure groaned barney an oi didnt belave there wur such craythers ouch ouch how they boight take em off but the two lads danced kicked and beat about them with their arms so that no one could remove the crawfish the boys who were witnesses of this circus nearly choked with laughter sammy smiles had a fit and rolled on the floor clinging to his sides all the while frank was apparently making desperate efforts to quiet the boys and remove the crawfish but at the same time he was saying just loud enough for them to hear the bite is deadly poison the only antidote is equal parts of new milk and vinegar taken internally about a gallon should be absorbed while a chemically prepared poultice of ho tempus fugit and aqua pura should be applied to each and every bite bring on yer new milk and vinegar begorra roared the irish boy wildly its a barrel ur two oill drink av th sthuff somepody dose boultices make britty queek alretty shouted hans i vant dwo huntred und elefen for dose bites vot i haf all ofer

vinegar and milk that you want and you must have it shouted frank in the irish lads ear every second you delay about procuring it makes your chances all the more desperate begorra oill hiv it directly av theres anything av th sort in th ranch then barney made a break for the stairs with hans a close second and the boys could not resist the temptation to rush after them never before had there been such an uproar heard in fardale academy and the commotion had brought professor gunn and his two principal assistants professor jenks and professor scotch from their rooms on the floor below the cockloft what can be the meaning of this outrageous hubbub cried professor jenks who on account of his exceeding height was known as high jinks goodness knows exclaimed professor gunn peering over his spectacles in a horrified way at his companions it must be a mutiny or a murder chattered professor scotch who was a very small man and was generally known as hot scotch because of his fiery red hair and peppery temper let us proceed together to investigate came resolutely from professor gunns lips all right said high jinks bravely lead the way sir be cautious gentlemen be cautious urged hot scotch his face pale and his teeth rattling together such dreadful shrieks have never before assailed my ears never they are certainly cries of mortal agony oh you can go to your room and lock yourself in if you are afraid came scornfully from the tall professors lips whos afraid bristled the little man instantly you will find i am not afraid of you sir i am ready to gentlemen gentlemen silence came commandingly from professor gunns lips i will not have this unseemly bickering if you are ready come on so they moved toward the stairs high jinks resolutely keeping by professor gunns side while hot scotch lingered a little in the rear clinging to the tail of the head professors coat just as they reached the foot of the stairs and were about to ascend feet were heard rushing along the corridor above and then barney mulloy came plunging down the stairs with hans dunnerwust riding astride his neck both in their nightclothes with a few crawfish still clinging to them the three professors were unable to get out of the way so the frantic boys plunged straight into them and all fell in a struggling squirming mass on the floor chapter xv warned at the head of the stairs swarmed the plebes who were convulsed with laughter oh oh oh gasped sammy smiles clinging to his sides somebody please do something to stop me from laughing ha ha ha if i dont stop soon ill die oh dear oh dear i am sore all over help cried professor gunn the boys on the floor below the cockloft were out by this time and they were enjoying the spectacle quite as much as the plebes above frank had rushed into his room and he came forth with a bag that contained something that moved and snarled reaching the head of the stairs he quickly opened the mouth of the bag and extracted two cats he had slipped on a pair of heavy gloves and he succeeded in holding the cats securely while he said to ned gray quick take the string that held the mouth of the bag tie their tails together lively ned caught up the string and worked swiftly tying the cats tails tightly together when this was accomplished frank gave the felines a fling toward the group at the foot of the stairs the cats struck one on either side of professor gunns neck and as their tails were tied together they hung there but not quietly with wild howls of agony they began clawing each other incidentally by way of diversion socking their claws into the professors face now and then and ripping up a few furrows in that gentlemans countenance professor gunn howled louder than the cats and tried to fling them off but they clung to him as if they loved him and continued to shower marks of affection upon him great scott gasped ned gray if it is ever found out that you were at the bottom of this merriwell you will be expelled sure then i shall perish in a good cause laughed frank fun is better than medicine and we were beginning to stagnate help cried professor gunn in tones of deep anguish take these beasts away they are devouring me meow meeeow spt spt meeeeow howled the cats as they continued to scratch the professors face till it began to look like the colored map of a country that had been disturbed by a violent earthquake somehow hot scotch had gotten into a wrangle with high jinks whom he was holding down and punching vigorously hit me in the ribs will ye pound me in the eye will ye tackle me when down will ye well ive got a score against you and ill settle it now take him off squealed jenks thrashing about with his long legs save me save me having untangled themselves from the mass and become freed of the crawfish in the struggle hans and barney sat on the floor and stared in astonishment at the spectacle the sight was too much for the risibilities of the irish boy and he forgot that he had been severely bitten by centipades begorra dutchy this is a roight loively avening oi do belave he chuckled will yez look at this fer a racket oi dunno hurro sail in bys vell i dont efer seen der peat uf dot gasped hans his eyes bulging uf dot dont peen a recular fight i vos an oysder now boys its time to take a hand said frank merriwell be lively gather up the crawfish and throw em out of the windows work quick here windsor dispose of this bag his words put the cadets in motion down the stairs he ran and quickly gathered up every crawfish he could find while others followed his example then leaving the boys to take care of the cats and separate the fighting professors he bounded up the stairs and hurried to the room occupied by barney and hans where he removed every crawfish he could find in the beds or upon the floor he worked with great swiftness and accomplished all this in a very few seconds in the meantime some of the boys who had been in the joke from the start took hold and aided frank to clear out all signs of the crawfish while others hastened to professor gunns assistance and pulled off the cats removing the string from their tails barney and hans were beginning to call for the doctor again declaring they had been bitten by centibedes or cintipades and professor gunn was glaring over a handkerchief held to his bleeding face while high jinks and hot scotch stood apart and glowered at each other ready to resume hostilities at the slightest provocation lieutenant gordan was on hand looking very stern and asking a few very pointed questions he fully understood a practical joke had been perpetrated and woe to the perpetrator if the lieutenant found proof against him gordan was stern and as unwavering as the hills in the discharge of his duty but the lieutenant found five very excited and incoherent persons in the group that had assembled at the foot of the stairs professors jenks and scotch would not say much of anything only mutter and glare daggers at each other while professor gunn was too furious and too confused to tell anything straight barney and hans declared over and over that they had been bitten by centipedes and showed the wounds the jumbled story told by them puzzled the lieutenant more than anything else having been released the cats had taken flight lieutenant gordan did not say much but the expression on his face told that he meant to investigate the affair thoroughly the time however was not suitable for an investigation and so he ordered everybody to their rooms barney called for a drink of milk and vinegar but the lieutenant assured him that he was not in danger of dying immediately if he did not obtain what he desired so both the irish lad and the dutch boy were sent to their rooms like the others in a brief time silence settled over the academy and no one could have fancied there had been such an uproar there a short while before in the morning bartley said to frank what in the world has got into you old man you are full of the old harry lately you will have this academy turned bottom up if you keep on frank smiled weve got to have something to break the monotony he said a fellow gets tired of plugging away at his studies all the time thats so admitted bart who was a darkfaced reserved sort of boy but such tricks as you perpetrated last night are dangerous how what if lieutenant gordan finds out you were at the bottom of it you know what will happen sure well you are taking big chances for a little fun a little fun echoed frank didnt you consider that something more than a little fun last night it struck me as a roaring farce a faint trace of a smile came to hodges dark face you enjoy anything of the kind far more than i do merriwell he said i like fun of a different sort well i fancy you will acknowledge i take some interest in other sports bart thats all right frank you are the leader of our class in everything because you are a natural leader but you have a dangerous rival think so i know it there is a fellow in this school who is aiming to stand at the head in athletics up to a few weeks ago he remained in the background so that little or no notice was taken of him but he is coming to the front now and i believe he means to give you a hot race for first position he has even declared openly that he is a pitcher and means to make a try for a position on the team thats all right bart i am not hoggish enough to want all the honors and if we play as much ball as we intend to next spring and summer well need another pitcher i cant do all the twirling but he says he will not play under you as captain of the team ha that is interesting now you are waking me up i suppose the fellow you speak of is paul rains yes he is the one then rains is something of an enemy as well as a rival well well see who is the better man chapter xvi paul rains the short dark days of winter had brought about changes in fardale academy drills had been discontinued and except for weekly inspections and occasional guard duty there were no formations under arms the hours for study were longer as also were the lessons some of the plebes were negligent and regardless of the fact that the january examinations were close at hand while others were boning steadily doing their level best to stand well in their classes for all of his mischievous disposition frank was studying enough to hold his own in his class and he was looked on favorably by his instructors he was magnetic and had a winning way so that he made many friends always among the better class at the school no one either man or boy is ever popular without having enemies and this was true of frank but his enemies were those who were jealous of him or those with whom he did not care to associate for the best of reasons hodge was not a fellow to make friends being haughty and proud and merriwell obtained many enemies because he roomed with bart and seemed to stand up for the fellow the friendship of the two lads was rather remarkable considering how they had once been enemies and how hodge had worked hard to injure frank among the plebes there were a few who stood head and shoulders above their companions in athletics hodge went in for fencing and professor rhynas declared he would make a master of the foil hugh bascomb with a pugilists thick neck and round head was spending all his spare time boxing and it was said that he could strike a blow that would stagger an ox his admirers declared it was a beautiful sight to see him hammer the punchingbag and they assured him over and over that he was certain to make another sullivan naturally this gave bascomb the swelled head and he got an idea into his brain that he was really cut out for a fighter and that nobody in fardale could stand up before him for four rounds day after day barney mulloy took a long pull at the rowing machine ned gray spent his spare time on the horizontal bars or the trapeze and hans dunnerwust tried his hand at everything making sport for the spectators among the plebes there were two lads who seemed allround athletes they were paul rains and frank merriwell paul did not like frank in fact he was envious of merriwells popularity although he did his best to keep the fact concealed being a sly secretive person it was but natural that rains should come to be considered as modest and unassuming in truth he was not modest at all for in his secret heart there was nothing that any one else could do that he did not believe he could do and so while appearing to be very modest he was really intensely egotistical rains had not been given much attention for a time after he entered the academy but his athletic abilities for he was really a capable fellow although his capabilities were limited were bringing him into notice jolly open as the day frank did not know what it was to be crafty or secretive he had a way of saying things he thought and he did not understand people who kept their fancies and ambitious desires bottled up hodge had not been the first to give frank a hint that he had a rival in rains but he was the first to tell him that rains had declared he would not play on the ball team if merriwell was captain frank remembered that and he wondered what rains could have against him frank was never able to understand one fellow despising another because the other was popular for it was natural for him to wish everybody good luck and success and he always rejoiced in the success of any fellow he knew providing of course that the success was of the right sort lieutenant gordan made a rigid investigation of the racket caused by the centipedes but he failed to fasten the blame firmly on any one not one of the boys who knew the facts would expose merriwell and both barney and hans discovering their wounds were not fatal grinned and declared they were not sure there had been anything in their beds but they thought they had felt something professor gunn was very indignant to think the culprits could not be discovered it is a disgrace to the school he told lieutenant gordan just look at my face sir i am a picture the lieutenant did not crack a smile you have no one but yourself to blame for your condition sir he said eh eh hows that hows that sputtered professor gunn i dont think i understand you sir then i will make it clear if you had remained in your room as you should when the disturbance occurred you would not have received those injuries but sir but i am the principal of this school it is my place it is your place to keep in your room sir when there is an outbreak like the one under discussion and allow me to straighten matters out if you had done so i might be able to get at the bottom of this affair and discover the guilty jokers as it is you and your associates complicated matters so that i do not seem able to do much of anything having spoken thus plainly lieutenant gordan turned on his heel and left the professor in anything but a pleasant frame of mind it was a day or two after the occurrence of the great centipede joke as the crawfish affair came to be termed that paul rains and hugh bascomb were having a bout with the gloves in the gymnasium quite a number of spectators had gathered and frank merriwell sauntered up and joined the group professor rhynas was giving his attention to another department of the gymnasium and he had left bascomb to meet all comers and give them points bascomb was not finding it a very easy thing to give rains many points although he believed he could knock the fellow down any time he wished to do so by simply letting drive one of his sledgehammer blows but bascomb had not thought of striking rains with all his strength he had discovered that rains disliked merriwell and that was enough to establish a bond of friendship between the big plebe and the lad with whom he was boxing bascomb hated frank but he feared him at the same time nobody seems able to get the best of that fellow he had thought a hundred times it seems to be bad luck to go against him and so i am going to keep away from him in the future poor gage merriwell was bad medicine for him bascomb was a coward but he could hate intensely in his twofaced treacherous way the moment merriwell joined the group bascomb noted it hes watching rains mentally decided the big plebe he wants to see what the fellow is made of rains seemed aware that merriwell was a spectator for he braced up and gave bascomb a merry go for a few minutes forcing the big fellow back and seeming to tap him with ease and skill whenever and wherever he chose when this little flurry was over rains threw off his gloves and declared he had had enough so have i said bascomb with a grin youre the best man ive put the mittens on with yet i believe there is a fellow not more than a hundred miles from here that thinks he is some one with gloves but you can do him dead easy more than that i think he knows it and i dont believe he has the nerve to stand up and face you for a whirl oh i dont want to box with any one said rains keep still bascomb you may not want to box but you can down frank merriwell just the same declared the big plebe chapter xvii the bullys match a moment of silence followed bascombs distinctlyspoken words and the eyes of nearly every one were turned on merriwell to whose face the hot color slowly mounted whats the matter with you bascomb he finally asked what do you want to draw me into this affair for i dont know as i have any desire to put on the gloves with rains the big fellow grinned in a way that was distinctly insulting i dont think you have he said you wouldnt cut any ice with him you may be right but i dont quite understand how you know as i have never stood up with you oh that wasnt necessary ive seen you spar and i have your gage you dont run in the class with rains at this juncture rains made a move as if he would quiet bascomb but the big fellow quickly went on im not going to keep still any longer youre too modest rains you keep in the background and let fellows like merriwell take the lead in everything when you should be a leader you are a better allround man than merriwell any day and you can knock corners off him any time he has nerve enough to put on the mitts with you hes a dandy to push himself to the front but that was a little more than frank could stand the jolly look had vanished from his face and he faced bascomb saying sharply look here my friend i reckon you are saying one word for rains and two for yourself i havent mixed up with you for reasons that you very well understand but i dont propose to take much of your talk if there is any difference between mr rains and myself we will settle it at another time but if you want to get a rap at me now is the accepted occasion and i will put on the gloves with you bascomb had not been looking for this and he was taken aback for a moment still although he knew merriwell was a far better allround athlete he believed he could more than match him in boxing so he eagerly accepted the opportunity im your man he said peel off and get into gear it wont take me long to show you there are a few things you do not know he laughed in a disagreeable way and hodge who had overheard all bit his lips to repress an outburst of anger the sneak whispered bart to frank as the latter stepped aside to take off his coat and vest he means to use his sledgehammer blow on you he wont box for points but he will try to soak you look out for him i am not afraid of him thats all right but you know he has been practicing that blow and they say it is terrible he is cut out for a prizefighter and is no fit boxing antagonist for a gentleman i shall look out for his wicked left as i have heard the boys call it he wants to provoke you into a fight with himself or rains i thought as much but he may change his mind after we spar if he does not catch me foul by an accident he is tricky i will watch out for his tricks look out for his crossbuttock hes stout as a moose and he will give you a nasty fall for all of his warning words bart had great confidence in frank they had fought once shortly after coming to fardale and hodge had found merriwell more than his match then since that time frank had missed no opportunity to pick up points in boxing and his advancement had been great still there was a chance that by some accident bascomb might land once with that wicked left or might seek to injure merriwell by a fall if he found that he was matched in every other way so bart was on hand with his words of warning it did not take frank long to get ready and it was not long before the two boys faced each other adjusting the gloves upon their hands then they came up to the scratch and the word was given that started the contest bascomb started in at once with a series of false motions intended to confuse merriwell but they simply brought a faint smile to franks face and he remained as placid as ever until just as bascomb had decided to rush merriwell rushed there was a flashing of their gloves the big fellow struck twice and both blows were met by a ready guard biff biff biff first with the right and then twice with the left frank struck the big plebe none of them were heavy blows but they all stung and the angry blood surged to bascombs face as he saw merriwell leap back beyond his reach laughing a bit mosquito bites said bascomb derisively but they count who cares i will more than square that in a minute all right i am waiting once more they were at it toe to toe hands moving slightly light on their feet ready to dodge or spring ready to strike or guard blows came one landing on merriwells cheek and another on his shoulder but more than twenty were dodged or guarded and bascomb was struck twice for every blow he gave frank was watching for that left hand body blow and it came at last just when bascomb thought it must count in that case bascomb deceived himself the blow was struck swiftly enough but frank stopped it with a right hand guard and with his left countered heavily on bascombs mouth sending the big fellows head back bascomb was surprised and he showed it he was also thoroughly angered and he proceeded to wade into merriwell like a cyclone on the other hand merriwell was cool as ice and he made every blow count something for even when they failed to land they kept the big fellow busy time after time bascomb rushed in but merriwell was light as a feather on his feet and he danced nimbly about tapping the other fellow now here now there smiling sweetly all the while and showing a skill that was very baffling to bascomb hang him thought the big fellow he is a regular jumping jack if i dont land a blow on him pretty quick i am going to clinch this he soon did catching frank for the crossbuttock throw for a moment it looked as if merriwell would be flung heavily and hodge drew his breath through his teeth with a hissing sound that turned to a sigh of relief as he saw his friend thrust forward his right foot between bascombs break his wrist clear and catch the big fellow behind the left knee with his left hand while he brought his right arm up over bascombs shoulder and pressed his hand over bascombs face snapping his head back and hurling him off sideways this was done quickly and scientifically and it convinced hodge that bascomb could not work the crossbuttock on merriwell hugh bascomb was disgusted and infuriated by his failure he had counted on having a soft thing and he was actually getting the worst of the encounter time was called and a breathing spell taken then they went at it again and this time both worked savagely their movements being swift and telling watching this battle paul rains began to believe that he was not yet quite merriwells match at boxing but i am a better man than he is at most anything else thought the fellow smack smack smack merriwell was following bascomb up like a tiger and the big fellow was forced to give ground again and again frank hammered the desperate plebe getting few blows in return and seeming to mind none of them no more than drops of rain bascombs face wore the look of an enraged bull suddenly with a quick side motion he snapped off the glove on his left hand then with his bare first he struck straight and hard at frank merriwells face chapter xviii rains challenge bascombs movement had been noted by the spectators and a cry of astonishment and warning broke from many lips look out shouted bart hodge frank had seen the movement and he needed no warning like a flash he ducked to the right and bascombs bare fist missed his face and shot over his shoulder at the same instant frank countered with his left striking the big fellow on the chin and hurling him backward with force enough to send him reeling leaping forward merriwell followed up his advantage and bascomb received two terrible blows one of which knocked him down as if he had been struck by a cannon ball then frank flung off both his gloves his face flushed and his eyes flashing as he exclaimed two can play at your game fellow if you want to try a round with uncovered knuckles pick yourself up and come on snarling like a wounded dog bascomb scrambled to his feet but here the spectators surged between the two rains catching hold of the big plebe while hodge grasped merriwell easy frank warned bart are you crazy you know what it will mean if you fight in the gym rhynas has noticed it now hes coming confound that fellow muttered frank i dont often get started this way but it was such a dirty trick that never mind now keep still or rhynas will hear let me get at him bascomb had snarled i will beat the life out of him stop stop said rains swiftly you are making a fool of yourself you cant fight here cant i well no it is against the rules if you press this you will be expelled for the affair will be investigated and it will be proved that you bared your hand and merriwell was forced to do so to defend himself oh i could hammer him well there is plenty of time steady now here is the professor he has scented a row cant you play cool and pretend it was a joke quick then frank was surprised to see bascomb come forward laughing in a sickly way as he said youre pretty flip with your hands merriwell and thats right i hope you wont lay up anything against me because i lost my glove i was so excited that i didnt know it was gone it was on franks tongue to give bascomb the lie but for once in his life hodge was the cooler of the two and he warned his friend by a soft pressure on the arm then seeing professor rhynas listening with a dark look on his face frank laughed and retorted i dont mind a little thing like that bascomb as long as you didnt strike me i rather think i held my own with you and so we will drop it yes said bascomb we will drop it for the present the way he spoke the words seemed to indicate that though they might let it drop for the present the affair was not settled between them by any means rhynas now demanded to know the cause of the excitement and he was told that bascomb had knocked his glove off and then in his excitement had struck a blow the professor looked blacker than ever such a thing is not possible he declared this is no resort for fighters if you fellows have any differences to settle settle them elsewhere i propose to run this department so there can be no slurs cast upon it and i will not have fighting quarreling or loud talking here the professor was very strict and they knew he meant every word he spoke so they did their best to pacify him with smooth words and apologies the man however was too shrewd to be deceived and he knew very well that the two boxers had come very near fighting in the gymnasium while he was present however he could do nothing but warn them which he did and then went about his affairs the spectators of the little bout had been given something to talk about for up to that moment they had not dreamed there was any one in the academy who could stand up before bascombs wicked left and not be unmercifully hammered merriwell had been touched very few times with bascombs left for he had constantly been on the guard for any blow that might come from that point and he had thumped the big plebe most aggravatingly all through the affair but what was most significant after bascomb had flung off one glove and struck at frank with his bare fist the smaller and more supple lad had sailed in and shown that he could put pounds into his blows for he had driven bascomb back and knocked him down this feat had caused paul rains to gasp with astonishment and in his heart he was forced to acknowledge that he doubted if he were yet a match for merriwell hodge alone of them all had believed all along that frank was more than a match for bascomb now the spectators began to realize that merriwell was not given to boasting or showing off for he had made no pretense to be the champion boxer and he had allowed them to think bascomb was more than a match for anybody in the academy when forced to meet some one in a contest that should be a test of skill frank had chosen to meet bascomb which showed he had been confident in himself all along for all that he had not thrust himself forward in his heart rains was very sore for he had just met bascomb and while he had made a good display the big fellow had shown that he was the superior merriwell is putting me in the shade without running up against me at all thought paul i have lost ground with the fellows right here how can i recover it did not take him long to decide that he must go against merriwell in some kind of a contest and beat him you are very clever with the gloves merriwell said rains stepping forward and speaking placidly but i would like to see what you can do jumping is that a challenge asked frank quietly if you wish to regard it as such oh i am not anxious i simply wanted to know just what you meant it for then let it go as a challenge for what high jump or broad jump both thats the talk laughed one of the spectators now we will have more sport all right laughed frank i will go you though i have not been doing much jumping lately and i am not in my best form that will sound all right if you beat said rains but it will not do for an excuse if you lose all right let it go i wont try to make any other excuse in case you are the victor in a mass the boys surged toward a piece of ground just outside of the gymnasium adapted to jumping what shall it be first asked frank as he stood at the edge of the long strip of turf running long jump decided rains thats agreeable you challenged and i presume we are to take turns for three jumps the one who makes the best leap out of the number is the winner thats all right hodge spoke up quickly what do you mean by taking turns is one to jump three times and then the other jump three times no i mean for us to alternate explained frank first one jumps and then the other hodge nodded his satisfaction that is fair and it is much better than the other way he declared the rivals made preparations for the contest by lot it fell to rains to lead off rains was smiling and confident if there is anything i can do i can jump he told bascomb in an aside i will beat him by a foot at the very least i hope you will beat him by a yard muttered the big fellow sullenly i want to see him taken down he has been a leader long enough oh i will manage to win some of his glory away from him before the spring campaign opens said rains confidently dont you worry about that but he added swiftly dont repeat my words to anybody i am not going to boast but i am going to do something thats the proper way sure nodded bascomb i guess you can do it too in his heart however bascomb did not feel at all sure that rains would prove the victor in the jumping contest merriwell is the hardest fellow to beat that i ever saw he told himself it doesnt seem possible to down him and keep him down if one seems to get the best of him for a bit he bobs up serenely directly and comes out on top it is just his luck if bascomb had said it was just merriwells pluck he would have hit the truth for frank besides being physically capable was endowed with any amount of determination having a neversaydie spirit that would not give up as long as there was a ghost of a chance left to pull out a winner in the words of the boys merriwell was no quitter ready called the fellow who had been chosen for referee rains will set the stint chapter xix jumping there was a determined look on pauls face as he walked to one end of the long strip of turf that ran down one side of the gymnasium he is built for jumping said one of the spectators there is a fine pair of legs if i ever saw a fine pair thats right agreed another and he is full of snap and ginger he will give merriwell a hard go but merriwell is no slow coach at anything broke in a third i never saw a fellow who seemed able to make such a record at all sorts of sports who would have thought that he could face bascomb look rains is going to start see him crouch for the run he is like a young panther now hes off down the line of turf darted paul reached the white line rose gracefully into the air with a pretty spring and sailed forward in a handsome jump that brought a round of applause from the spectators the measurers immediately ran the tape seventeen feet and four inches was the announcement a shade of disappointment came to the faces of the spectators for that was far below the fardale record rains however winked quietly to bascomb as if to say that the first jump was a teaser just to see what merriwell would do frank now took his position ran swiftly and lightly down the turf and made the jump he seemed to be doing his best or nearly that yet he did not reach but a little beyond rains mark seventeen feet six inches and a quarter announced one of the measurers i wonder if that is anywhere near his limit thought paul as he slowly walked back to the starting point i think i will have to give him a stint this time as he faced the mark he gathered his energies in every part of his body felt his muscles strain knew his nerves were at their highest tension hes going to lay himself out this time said one of the spectators to another seventeen feet will not be mentioned again down the strip shot rains he reached the mark and went flying through the air like a bird bringing a cry to the lips of those watching for they saw he had gone far ahead of the first jump that was a beauty exclaimed bascomb speaking to wat snell who stood watching it was a good jump said snell but merriwell will beat it what makes you think so because that fellow always beats at everything i had rather have his luck than a license to steal ive quit trying to down him for i found i was bound to get the worst of it if i kept it up oh his time will come perhaps so but it isnt coming in a hurry nineteen feet three inches and a third announced the measurer hooray shouted one of pauls delighted admirers thats the stuff merriwell will have to shake himself if he means to beat that but frank had friends who were confident that he would still hold the lead wait till the next measurement is taken they said franks manner as he took his place for the start seemed to indicate that he believed the task before him a difficult one hes doubtful muttered one of pauls friends hes losing courage said another pressing his lips together frank made the run and the watchers held their breath as he jumped hes tied rains not much hes behind rains holds the lead great scott is that merriwells best bascomb thumped wat snell on the back whatd i tell you he laughed in snells ear this is right where merriwell loses some of his glory rains has beaten him this time perhaps admitted snell but there is another jump to follow and the best score made is the one that decides the contest you will find merriwell is not beaten yet why you talk as if you wanted him to beat not much i would give almost anything to see him beaten at everything he attempts dont think for a minute that i am in love with that fellow the tape had been run and now the announcement was heard nineteen feet one inch and onethird rains had beaten merriwell by two inches on the second jump but the contest was not yet over and there was a chance that frank would finally redeem himself franks friends were disappointed hodge showed deep chagrin in his face as he drew merriwell aside saying swiftly and guardedly youre making a mistake old man if you are holding off for the last jump the second jump is the one to lay yourself out on always perhaps i did smiled frank what gasped hodge and he has beaten you it looks that way doesnt it but but i i wont believe it you can do better you must do better why old man you will lose your grip if you dont beat him you do not expect impossibilities do you no but would you go back on me if i lost this match you know better frank i would stick by you under any circumstances then i shall not feel so bad about losing it hodge gasped and clutched the arm of his roommate for gracious sake you dont mean to say he had set you a stint you cannot beat you mustnt lose you shant lose do brace up old man why think how those fellows who are envious of you will rejoice if rains comes out on top you must win well i will do my best on the next there goes rains for the last jump with the ghost of a triumphant mile on his face paul again took his place at the starting point the smile vanished and a look of resolution took its place he is going to try to beat your other jump said bascomb he cant do it declared snell wait and see paul had really resolved to beat his last jump as he ran he gathered momentum gauging the distance carefully and reaching the mark exactly the jump was a splendid one and it was instantly seen that he had actually beaten his former record quickly and carefully the tape was stretched nineteen feet nine inches and threefourths then there were exclamations of wonderment from all sides and more than one declared merriwell was badly beaten there were not a few among franks friends who confessed that he had very little chance and the faces of those who said nothing showed that they had lost heart to a great extent hodge continued to talk excitedly to merriwell who shook his head looking very grave paul rains was quietly triumphant for he felt that he was safely the winner of this contest merriwell and hodge went up the strip together the latter still talking and making an occasional gesture reaching the starting point they paused and stood talking by smoke laughed bascomb merriwell doesnt want to try it at all and hodge is having hard work to induce him to do so rains has this match in a walkover that remains to be seen said one of franks friends doggedly you may be right but dont you fancy for a moment that merriwell is going to give up without jumping he isnt that kind of a hairpin my boy well he might as well give up without another try for he doesnt stand any show oh wait and see wait and see was all that franks defender could say hodge was now seen to leave merriwell and come back down the runway and it was noted that the look on his face was far from one of confidence and satisfaction when hodge loses confidence in merriwell the case is desperate declared bascomb thats so confessed wat snell i am beginning to hope merriwell is making ready hes preparing for the run all eyes were now fixed on frank who had taken his position at the starting point he was seen to dig his toe into the ground to get a brace and he leaned far forward with one hand outstretched then he darted toward the mark with the speed of a fawn frank came down the run reached the mark shot like a leopard into the air sailed like a soaring bird and landed safely far beyond rains best mark so far indeed that the crowd was too astonished to make a sound but stood staring as the tape was laid twentyone feet and two inches came the electrifying announcement then for all of rules for all of professor rhynas franks friends made the air ring with their wild shouts of applause chapter xx bascombs mistake paul rains was struck with dismay and confusion which threatened to turn to anger he saw the crowd gathering round frank and congratulating him paul was left quite alone not even bascomb approached him for the big plebe was too dismayed to say anything or do anything wat snell simply muttered i knew it his tone expressed his hopeless disgust franks hand was wrung till his arm ached and he was told over and over that he would make a new record for fardale academy if he chose to enter the athletic contests in the spring if he chooses shouted one enthusiastic fellow hell have to enter whether he chooses or not you dont suppose we will let a fellow like him remain out of it do you i knew you could do it old man murmured bart hodge his dark face flushed with pleasure you were bluffing all the while that you pretended to doubt i wanted to see how much confidence you actually had in me said frank with a smile well you found out yes and that gave me a great deal more of confidence in myself i tell you it helps to know one has friends whose faith in him cannot be shaken even when he seems to lose faith in himself where is rains there he is i wonder if he is satisfied paul was still quite alone pretending to examine the spikes in the bottom of one of his shoes frank moved toward his rival and the others swarmed along seeing them coming rains straightened up and through his mind flashed the thought that he must not show his chagrin no matter how deeply he felt it and he must receive merriwell in a manner that would not make him seem like a cad in the eyes of the fellows and so when frank came up paul said that was a beautiful jump merriwell you beat me fairly and squarely i cant deny that you are satisfied then perfectly then we will try the high jump next not much what do you mean i mean that i am satisfied for the present if you can beat me nearly a foot and a half at the running broad jump you ought to be able to beat me at the high jump but i am going to try you another whirl by and by you do not hold a grudge what do you take me for shake hands of course their hands met but frank did not fail to note that rains shook in a manner that was very cold and insincere i reckon merriwell has come pretty near showing what he is made of said hodge and those fellows who have been claiming that he has won his popularity by luck had better keep still in the future thats so shouted the crowd and several who did so had been saying the most disagreeable things about frank a short time before there is nothing in the world so ephemeral as popularity the individual who is today a hero may be an outcast tomorrow there is nothing harder to hold than the esteem of a set of schoolboys he who is regarded as an idol in the fall may be supplanted by a rival in the spring and may find himself unnoticed and neglected having once become a leader in a school the fellow who has obtained the position must prove his superiority to all comers in order to hold it even then his success will produce jealous enemies who will seek his overthrow by some means no matter how unfair frank had not sought popularity it had come unbidden having found himself a leader however he had pride enough to hold the position just as long as he was capable of doing so fairly and honestly but he had already discovered that he would be assailed openly and secretly and his foes would try to drag him down by any means fair or foul had rains been a little more cordial had he shaken hands with frank as if he really held no grudge merriwell would have been more than glad to hail him as a good fellow and a friend but the touch of his fingers was enough to reveal the bitterness in his heart having disliked and envied merriwell before rains would now dislike and envy him still more as soon as he could do so without attracting too much attention rains left the excited throng of boys and hurried away to one of the dressingrooms hugh bascomb quickly followed being the only one among rains late friends to note his departure bascomb found rains rubbing down paul did not say a word as the big plebe entered well said bascomb as he sat down on a stool what do you think of merriwell i think he is a mighty hard fellow to beat at anything growled paul but he can be beaten eh how there are ways what do you mean speak plainly you ought to know what i mean said bascomb doggedly keeping his eyes on the floor it isnt always the best trotter that wins a race it will not be easy to beat merriwell fairly thats right but you are a fellow of nerve and brains and you ought to be able to devise some scheme to get the best of him unfairly rains stopped and stared at bascomb his face showing that he was angrier than ever now your meaning is pretty plain he said slowly i will confess that i dislike merriwell that i would give almost anything to get the best of him but i want you to understand hugh bascomb that i am no sneak bascomb still kept his eyes on the floor oh whats the use to get on your high horse rains he said in his sullen way if you dislike merriwell as you pretend and if you hope to down him at anything you cannot be too much of a stickler for little things once get him to going down hill and we can keep him going i can help you start him had bascomb taken more than a fleeting glance at rains face he must have seen that the latter was regarding him with contempt i suppose you have a scheme of your own paul finally observed in a questioning way sure what is it well to begin with i have pretty good proof that merriwell was the originator and perpetrator of that crawfish joke on mulloy and dunnerwust what of that i think that lieutenant gordan would be able to fasten it on merriwell if he knew what i know that would mean certain expulsion for merriwell of course all three of the professors were so tangled up in that affair that the fellow would surely be fired if the blame could be fastened upon him what do you want of me bascomb cleared his throat twisted on the stool and hesitated finally he said you may be able to devise some other means to get the best of the fellow but if you cant and you are ready to take hold of this you may see him fired out of the academy so he will no longer be in your way what do you want of me repeated rains coldly and quietly well you see you understand you know i came near getting into trouble once by trying to help gage do merriwell up after that gage was caught cheating at cards and had to run away everybody knows i hate merriwell and theyd all think i blowed if anything came to lieutenant gordans ears thats why i dont dare make a move with you it is different what do you want of me demanded rains the third time i will give you the proofs and you can carry them to lieutenant gordan who will follow it up and see that

trick he said growlingly yes thats my trick and if you blow on merriwell i will play the card you made a big mistake in taking me for a sneak just because i didnt happen to like a fellow who is popular get out now and dont come round me again i dont belong to your class and i dont want to have anything to do with you get bascomb hesitated longing to strike rains but not daring to do so slowly he moved toward the door where he paused to growl this is all right i will get square with you some time if you blow on me i will pound the life out of you then he went out rains had shown his manhood chapter xxi the rival professors professor jenks and professor scotch were rivals each admired and sought to win the affections of a widow of uncertain years who lived in fardale village for some years professor gunns two assistants had been very friendly but nancy cobb the widow spoken of was the rock on which they split their jealousy often caused them to completely forget their dignity and they did things that made them utterly ridiculous in the eyes of all beholders as yet neither had possessed nerve enough to propose to the widow and so wishing to make a sure catch the elderly lady had clung to both ready to jump at the first one who should offer himself the cause of the illwill existing between the under professors was well known to the cadets at fardale academy and had provided them with no small amount of sport now it happened that tad jones a village lad who was very well known to frank merriwell was the nephew of the coquettish widow and the widow made her home with tads father and mother tad was a lively youngster who liked fun and in more ways than one he was a thorn in the flesh unto his aunt one day he succeeded in seeing frank whom he informed that he had put up another joke on his aunt nancy ive been imertatin her handwritin lately said tad and ive got so i can scrawl jest like her old scotch and jenks aint never run onto each other at our house but ive fixed it tad grinned gleefully as he made this declaration fixed it how asked frank why i writ em both a letter askin em to call tonight at eight oclock and i signed nancys name i made the

funloving youngster oh if theyd jest fight id like to see the circus come on over i dont know as i can get away i will come if i can all right bring along any of the fellers that night frank found a way to get leave to go to the village and hans whom he had told of the coming racket escaped from the building and joined him outside the grounds together they went over to the village and called on tad jones tad was waiting for them and he straightway smuggled them into the house aunt nancys expectin professor jenks to call he gleefully whispered i told her that i saw him and he said hed be here tonight so shes frizzled and primped to receive him youll get into a scrape said frank i dont care for that if i can see some fun come right into the parlor and well all hide aunts up in her room layin on the finishin touches into the parlor they slipped a fire was burning in the oldfashioned open fireplace and it was plain that mrs cobb had spruced things up to receive company two of us can git behind the organ in the corner here said tad the other feller can hide under the sofa as the sofa was a long oldfashioned affair and any one hidden beneath it could command a view of the entire room frank decided to conceal himself there this was barely settled when there came a sharp rap on the door git under cover quick hissed tad that must be one of em tad and hans made haste to squeeze in behind the organ and frank crept under the sofa shimminy gristmas muttered the dutch lad uf id dond peen britty tight blace here den i tont know somedings it is all right returned tad who had obtained a position where he could peer out keep cool and let your hair curl pretty soon nancy fluttered downstairs and then frank heard the highpitched voice of professor jenks in the hall a moment later the widow entered the parlor oh dear she simpered what a surprise this is dear mr jenks set right down on this chair close to the fire you must be cold let me take your hat and coat i am rather cold squeaked the professor as he peeled off his coat and allowed her to take it away with his hat it is a chilly night you are cozy in here the widow was wonderfully and artistically gotten up in a backnumber silk dress beneath which was an expansive hoopskirt while all around her face were corkscrew curls meant to be very fetching as she was somewhat deaf although she never acknowledged it she misunderstood the professors last remark oh yes she smiled coming back and sitting quite close to jenks no one can hear we are quite alone is that so gasped the professor nervously looking as if he contemplated flight i received your letter you believe im better why my dear professor i havent bin sick you must have been misinformed i didnt say that mrs cobb i said that i received at this moment there came another sharp rap on the door and professor jenks started as if he had been struck somebody is knocking he said rocking smiled nancy then take the rockingchair i like to rock myself pritty well somebody is knocking knocking at the door cried the professor in his high falsetto oh somebody knocking i will see who it is mrs jones doesnt always hear em i sometimes think she is ruther hard of hearing as she fluttered out of the room the professor gasped im in a perfect sweat already id rather face a battery i wonder if she will propose its leap year and she may then he suddenly started to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and anger for he heard professor scotchs hoarse voice in the hall confound it exclaimed jenks whats brought him here tonight i dont understand this in came nancy and professor scotch was close behind her its so good of you both to call gushed the widow girlishly well have a real lovely little chat professor scotch started back as he caught sight of his rival and the two glared at each other then scotch growled you here yes sir squeaked jenks defiantly whos got a better right id like to know but id have you to understand i was invited so was i but i received an invitation from this particular lady so did i set right down on the sofy professor scotch urged nancy well pop some corn and eat some apples and be real sociabul madame said the little man with great dignity i think there is some mistake youd like some steak exclaimed mrs cobb in surprise i never heerd of people havin steak to treat callers on i dont blieve theres a bit in the house i spose you do git awful sick of the food they have over to the cademy now if you was a married man and hed a wife to cook for ye i say i think there is a mistake in this matter beefsteak in a platter yes thats a good way to serve it the little professor gave a gasp and collapsed onto the sofa and frank promptly jabbed a hatpin up through the sofa so that it penetrated the professor to a distance of about a quarter of an inch chapter xxii a lively call whoop roared the big voice of the little man and professor scotch shot into the air like a jumpingjack out of a box wow he howled clutching convulsively at that part of his person which had felt the hatpin what did i sit down on the widow looked frightened and professor jenks looked astonished what did i sit down on repeated professor scotch his red hair bristling with anger why you sat on the sofa sir squeaked jenks then there must be a whole nest of wasps concealed in that sofa shouted scotch i was stung or i was stabbed i dont know which why im sure i cannot imagine what the matter with you can be fluttered the widow in distress well i dont know what is the matter with your old sofa he spoke so loudly that she understood him and she immediately turned up her nose old sofa sir old sofa there is nothing the matter with that sofa your language is surprisingly offensive sir tehe he he giggled jenks now youre getting it scotch youve put your foot in it beg your pardon beg your pardon roared the little man i did not mean any offense mrs cobb but i assure you there must be a dagger concealed in that sofa for some pointed weapon entered my person in a most painful manner if you will excuse me ill take this chair for i really do not dare sit down there again the widow gave a sniff your courage is very limited she said now i do love to admire a man with courage enough to excuse me squealed jenks elevating his voice the sofa is good enough for me down he sat upon it smiling triumphantly frank still had the hatpin which he had found on the floor beneath the sofa ready for use but he held his hand a bit knowing he could give jenks a greater shock if he should be pricked after he had sat there a while in apparent security oh youre a daring blade you are sneered scotch fiercely as he glared at jenks youd walk right up to the mouth of a cannon if you knew it wasnt loaded well i never yet got frightened by a haircloth sofa squeaked jenks the widow smiled seductively on the long and lanky professor you dont find nothing the matter with the sofy do you professor she asked not a thing piped jenks it is ever the wicked man who feels the pricks of conscience now my conscience is easy and so i do not feelweeeow murder im stabbed im killed weeow professor jenks shot into the air with such suddenness and vigor that he thumped his head against the low ceiling which seemed to fling him back upon the sofa and frank promptly gave him a second dose of hatpin wooouch squealed the tall professor bounding up again and dancing wildly round the room with his hands concealed beneath the tails of his coat that sofa is filled with broadswords and bayonets it is stuffed with deadly weapons professor scotch literally roared with laughter oh theres nothing the matter with the sofa he laughed just go right back and sit down there ha ha ha it is ever the wicked man who feels the pricks of conscience ha ha ha ho ho ho shut up piped jenks coming close to scotch at whom he shook his fist threateningly shut up or i will thump you dont you dare do it here if you do ill what ill see you later landy massy spluttered nancy i do believe youve both been tooken crazy behind the organ were two boys who were holding their hands over their mouths to keep from roaring with laughter while frank under the sofa was finding it no easy task to be silent the widow was frightened and both of the professors immediately sought to reassure her they pranced up on either side and scotch began dont be alarmed mrs cobb well not fight youre not tight well you act as if you were and thats a fact oh go fall on yourself scotch advised jenks dropping into the slang he had overheard some boy use this is an unfortunate affair whats the matter with my hair indignantly asked the widow as she caressed her corkscrew curls you are getting very personal sir ho ho laughed scotch guardedly now you are getting it jenks you make me tired go have your voice filed so you wont be an old woman who be you callin an old woman cried nancy catching the words with wonderful quickness i must say your language is most surprisin and offensive sir excuse me roared scotch i was speaking to mr jenks but he isnt a woman said nancy suspiciously i dont know why you should use such language to him youve put your foot in it now snickered the little man and i dont know what hes grinnin and laughin about you both act as if too much studyin and tooterin was beginnin to affect your brains now why dont you both git married and give up this awful wearin life you are leadin thats just what i called to see about declared professor scotch bracing up i called to pro hold on squealed jenks excitedly i was here first and i will have my first say mrs cobb my heart has long yearned for domestic joys and comforts oh i dont keer how much youve earned its what youve saved that counts oh if i had that voice id go break it sneered scotch try again hyson and youll get her so twisted that ill stand a good show of winning her so jenks braced up and tried again i say my heart has yearned sodywater or magneeshy is good for heartburn smiled the widow ye gods gasped jenks i didnt know she was so hard of hearing oh sail in and win her chuckled the little professor youre doing first rate mrs cobb continued jenks i am not much given to the follies of life i am a very grave man and i do so admire a brave man gushed nancy while passing through the village on the way to tad jones home frank had purchased an automatic mouse being wound up the mouse would run swiftly across the room at this juncture frank pointed the mouse toward nancy and let it go at the same time giving a squeak which both professors distinctly heard nancy saw the mouse coming and she uttered a wild shriek of terror clutching professor jenks around his slender neck save me save me from that terrible beast she squawked it happened that the professor was quite as scared of a mouse as nancy could be and he broke away and jumped up on a chair squealing murder well all be bitten in a most remarkably skillful manner the widow sprang up to the top of the centertable where she stood in a stooping position her head against the ceiling whos scared of a mouse sneered professor scotch as he gave chase to the toy which bumped against various pieces of furniture and so kept dodging about under the chair on which jenks stood ran the mouse scotch knocked the chair over and jenks uttered a wild shriek as he came down astride the little professors neck then both rolled against the centertable which was upset down came nancy like a balloon nearly smothering the two professors upon whom she alighted this was too much for tad jones who burst into a shriek of laughter jumped out and extinguished the light and shouted skip fellows skip frank and hans lost no time in leaving their places of concealment and hustling out of the room abandoning the two professors to their fate chapter xxiii skating for honors i nefer seen der peat uf dot alretty yet declared hans as he and frank were hurrying back to the academy uf dot dond peen der piggest racket vot nefer vos you dunno vot i vos talkin apout if it is found that we know anything about it we will be sure to get into trouble said frank should anybody question you why you must be ignorant as a mule you pet me your life i vos i vill peen ignorand as a clam but it seemed that the professors did not suspect that any of the academy boys had been present and so no inquiries were made in the school tad jones however was accused of having some of his village chums in the scrape and when he refused to tell their names he was soundly strapped by his father who had sincerely hoped one of the professors would propose to nancy and take her away without delay just how the rival professors had escaped was not known but if possible the coldness between them was more pronounced than ever the feud seemed of a deadly nature and some of the boys declared that jenks and scotch were certain to fight a duel over nancy sooner or later the following saturday was fine and that afternoon large numbers of the boys from the academy sought the village pond where the skating was excellent by midafternoon there were between two and three hundred skaters on the long pond while half as many spectators were gathered on the shore it was a lively and pleasant scene inza burrage was there with her chosen companion may blossom inza was a beautiful skater and so was much sought as a companion by the boys three times did frank approach her to ask her to skate with him and each time he saw her carried off by some one else she was in a coquettish mood that day and her merry laughter as she skated away each time proved rather tantalizing to frank who finally muttered all right two can play at that game it was almost if not quite may blossoms first attempt at skating and although she was doing very well her company was not in such demand as that of inza seeing may alone frank immediately skated to her side and he was soon doing his best to instruct her in the correct handling of her feet they seemed quite absorbed in each others company and not even inzas ringing laugh as she sped past with paul rains caused either of them to glance up at first inza had not minded franks attentions to may but as time slipped away and they still clung together laughing chatting and minding no one else she began to grow uneasy oh she can have him if she wants him muttered inza her cheeks beginning to burn there are any amount of other fellows that was quite true but in her heart she knew full well that there was no other fellow she cared so much for as she did for frank merriwell from this moment she ceased to enjoy herself and she could not keep from watching frank and may although she tried to do so she grew petulant and those who were in her company found her surprisingly crisp and disagreeable whenever she could she skated past frank and may and she always laughed as she did so but there was a false note in her laughter it did not seem very sincere paul rains was a beautiful skater he could cut fancy figures that took away the breath of the village boys and all his movements were graceful and rhythmical he could write his name with his skates and every letter was perfect and clean cut as if done with a pen it was not long before all eyes were centered on him and inza did not fail to note that he seemed to be the principal attraction on the pond so inza skated a great deal with paul hoping to arouse franks jealousy but to her overwhelming dismay after he began to skate with may frank seemed to forget there was any one else on the pond i believe he really likes her better than he does me thought inza and she knowing all my secrets knowing how much i think of frank is doing her best to cut me out oh that is true friendship she felt like crying with vexation and once or twice tears did come to her eyes but she forced them back continuing to skate and laugh arrangements were made for a skating contest to take place very soon one of the gentlemen of the village offered a badge of honor to the swiftest skater on the pond the one who could win the race paul rains entered as also did bartley hodge and sammy smiles from the academy three village boys entered then hodge sought frank saying come old man we want you in this race oh i am busy laughed frank noticing that inza was near although he did not glance in her direction i am teaching miss blossom to skate and she is getting on famously well i think she will excuse you a few minutes you may go on with your lessons after the race oh say cant you get along without me cant anyway you must come along well if i must i must murmured frank with mock distress i will see you later miss blossom and we will do our best to induce that left foot to make the stroke properly so bowing and smiling he left her and in her heart inza cried if he skates with her again this afternoon ill be outwitted thats all as bart drew frank aside he hastily and guardedly said you must go into this race to win old man rains friends have been saying you would not dare skate against him and that he would have a walkover if you did franks teeth came together with a click is that so he exclaimed well they may be right but well see that was quite enough to put him on his mettle and he lost no time in entering for the race a short time later the seven contestants were drawn up in line waiting the signal one mile up the pond a rock reared its head from the ice where at low water there was a tiny rocky island every contestant was to turn the rock and skate back to the starting point making a race of two miles in two long straight stretches the gentleman who had offered the badge of honor stood pistol in hand ready to give the signal the contestants leaned forward for the start ready muscles were drawn taut nerves were tingling one two three bang away darted the skaters and the race had begun a cheer went up from the spectators paul rains took the lead at the very start for he seemed to jump away at astonishing speed while the others were gathering headway rains has a snap this time declared one merriwell may be able to take the honors at jumping but he wont be in this kind of a contest jist wait a whoile an see about thot me by said barney mulloy who had overheard the remark frankie is as full av surproises as a horrunets nest is full av stings chapter xxiv skating for life during the entire first half of the course there were four of the seven contestants who made a good showing these were rains merriwell hodge and one of the village boys through it all rains kept the lead but the village lad was second until the turning point was nearly reached then merriwell settled down to business and took second place while hodge pushed the village boy hard rains heart was full of triumph over and over he told himself at last i have found something at which i can defeat merriwell fairly rains believed he was safely in advance and this delusion was not broken till the last half mile of the course was struck then he heard somebodys skates ringing close behind and looking over his shoulder he saw frank bearing down on him like the wind pauls heart gave a great leap by jove he breathed that fellow means to press me but he shall not come in first he shall not then he strained every muscle and for a few seconds the distance between them did not seem to diminish frank however held steadily to that terrible speed and paul began to fear he could not stand it to the finish for his head was beginning to grow unsteady and there was a wild roaring in his ears through a bluish mist he saw the great crowd on the shore near the starting point and he knew the eyes of hundreds were upon the contestants ill die before he shall pass me thought rains and then once more he heard the skates of his rival ringing clear close at his elbow one wild look he cast over his shoulder and there was merriwell fearfully near and gaining pauls heart rose with a bursting sensation into his throat he had seen that merriwells face bore a look of determination nay more a look of confidence oh for the power to hold out to the end again he forced himself to spurt but as that mad burst of energy slackened he felt rather than saw his rival reach his side now a great cheer broke from the crowd of excited and delighted spectators for the two boys were fairly abreast and neither seemed able to gain another inch on the other rains had shut his teeth his nostrils were dilated and his eyes wild in their sockets the finish line was near and he must cross it in advance a yard a foot an inch but he little knew that frank merriwell had reserved for the last supreme moment enough strength to make a final spurt now now is the time for one or the other to forge ahead another shout goes up merriwell merriwell hes the winner hurrah frank had forged to the front but even as the cheer came from the crowd he was seen to be flipped into the air as if he had struck a springboard and he came down heavily on the ice there was no time to recover frank slid over the starting line prostrate on the ice but paul rains crossed it upright and at least three yards in advance rains had won an accident had prevented frank from winning for his skate had struck a flaw in the ice and he had been thrown with stunning force great was the excitement merriwell was picked up and carried to the shore where a dash of cold water brought him round rains was quite used up for a while but he soon recovered his friends crowded round him to offer congratulations you beat merriwell this time paul they said but he fell said paul bitterly that makes the victory anything but satisfactory however i will race him again at any time and any place little did he think how soon they would race again within a short time after the finish of the race a sudden cry of alarm and terror went up from the throng look look there two girls have broken through the ice they will be drowned at a certain point in the pond there was a dangerous bit of ice where some springs deep down at the bottom continually bubbled up and kept the water alive so the ice did not form solidly it was supposed that every one knew where this dangerous spot was so no sign had been placed there now however two girls had ventured upon it and broken through who are they inza burrage and may blossom save them save them several started toward the imperiled girls but two forms darted out ahead of the rest and another race between paul rains and frank merriwell had begun this time it was a race for life shoulder to shoulder they started and for some seconds they kept thus then frank began to forge ahead for all that paul was straining every muscle was doing the very best that he could to save life the girls were seen clinging to the broken edge of the ice which broke beneath them once or twice but they managed to keep up in some way wider and wider grew the distance between merriwell and rains showing that the former was by far the faster skater in such a case as this as frank drew near the girls the ice broke again and both went under he did not slacken speed but taking care to avoid them skated straight into the water clinging to each other the girls came up but they would have sunk again immediately if he had not been there to clutch them treading water he held them up getting close to the ragged edge of the ice the water was fearfully cold but he managed to keep his head out knowing aid must come quickly paul rains slackened his speed as he came near the opening in the ice form a line get hold of my feet he shouted down upon his stomach he went and he slid forward till he could reach out and grasp one of the girls there he lay till another lad clutched his feet and still others grasped the feet of the one who had hold of paul now merriwell said paul if you can break their clutch on each other we can take em out one at a time with some difficulty the grasp of the halfdrowned girls was broken paul held fast to one and shouted pull away he was drawn backward and the girl was dragged from the water upon the ice quickly she was passed to some one who carried her away to a place of warmth and safety while paul rains crept back to the opening and the other girl was rescued in a similar manner then frank nearly exhausted was drawn out with rains on one side and hodge on the other frank skated back to the shore where the great crowd of spectators had witnessed the gallant rescue how the crowd cheered and flung up their hats hurrah for frank merriwell was the roar that went up hurrah hurrah for paul rains hurrah the man who had offered the badge of honor grasped the two lads by the hands crying you shall both have a badge of honor this is true heroism and you are both heroic lads hurrah hurrah hurrah thundered the crowd let us add here that neither inza nor may suffered any particularly ill results from their plunge through the ice between inza and frank the slight misunderstanding was easily adjusted and may in her innocent little heart had never dreamed of cutting out her friend she and paul rains afterward became very friendly between frank and paul a rivalry continued to exist but for the most part it was of a healthy generous sort and merriwell retained his position as leader having become more popular than before among the better class of boys at the academy chapter xxv the sinister stranger boy where did you get that ring frank merriwell started and looked quickly at the man who had hoarsely hissed the question in his ear at a glance he saw that the man was a stranger in fardale village the stranger was dressed in black clothes wore a cloak with a cape and had the brim of his hat slouched over his eyes which were coalblack and piercing he had a heavy black mustache and imperial which gave him a rather savage expression and withal he made a somewhat sinister figure the night mail at fardale was not delivered at the academy till the following morning and frank had come to the village post office late that afternoon to obtain an expected letter from home if it had arrived he had also hoped that on his way to the post office or in returning to the academy he might catch a glimpse of inza frank was now a welcome visitor at inzas home but being governed by natural tact and delicacy he did not wish to call too frequently fearing inzas parents might regard him as something of a bore shortly after entering the village he had noticed the stranger in black who seemed to be staring wonderingly at the boy to franks surprise this man followed him about finally the stranger slipped softly to franks side and hoarsely whispered the question with which this chapter opens at the same time he pointed to a peculiar ring which merriwell wore on the third finger of his left hand frank drew back looking the man over from head to feet i beg your pardon sir he said in a manner that was intended to repulse further advances but the man was not to be choked off thus easily the ring he repeated i asked you where you obtained it i know you did said the boy coolly answer me sibilated the stranger his brows darkening beneath the wide brim of the hat and a gleam of fire showing in his eyes tell me the truth boy i dont know why i should answer you said frank i do not know you and i do not understand what right you have to ask me such a question the man in black bit his lip and hesitated after a moment he forced a smile that was far from agreeable to see although he plainly meant that it should reassure the boy and in a low tone he rapidly said that ring is very odd and it attracted my attention for that reason i am a great collector of curios and especially of quaint and curious rings i have traveled the world over in search of the quaint and curious and i have a collection of nearly five hundred rings of all patterns makes and values this collecting of rings has become a fad or mania with me whenever i see an odd or peculiar ring i am immediately seized by a great desire to possess it but i always want to know its history it enhances the value of a ring to know its history i assure you that some rings have very queer histories indeed frank watched the man closely as he was speaking and although it was plain that the stranger was trying to secure the boys confidence merriwell continued to regard him with suspicion and aversion there was something about this persons dark face and sinister aspect that was extremely repulsive to the lad once more the man smiled as if making a desperate attempt to thaw the cool reserve of the boy but he had begun in a very poor way for frank remained cold and distant some of my rings went on the man in black have tales of bloodshed and murder connected with them and these are interesting in their way some recall romances of blighted love or sundered hearts and these tales are always interesting to the ladies who look over the collection some have been worn by great men or great ladies and some have encircled the fingers of great villains or great criminals you should understand why i desire to know the history of every ring that comes into my possession well said frank quietly as there is not the slightest possibility that you will ever possess this ring you can have very little interest in its history the stranger fell back a step and then with one hand eagerly outstretched he exclaimed you will sell it for a good price of course you will no why its real value is insignificant it is valuable to me no jeweler will give you more than three or four dollars for it possibly five well i will give you ten dollars for that ring it is useless for you to offer me money for it as i do not intend to sell it frank turned as if he would move away but he felt a hand clutch his shoulder with a grasp of iron while the voice of the stranger almost snarled dont be a fool boy i want that ring and i mean to have it at some price i will give you twentyfive dollars for it take your hand off my shoulder sir ill give you thirty dollars take your hand off my shoulder sir forty dollars i have warned you twice to take your hand off my shoulder came coldly from the lips of the boy on whose face there was now a dangerous look i am going to warn you again and if you do not obey it will be the worse for you take your hand off my shoulder there was a single moment of hesitation and then the stranger obeyed but the look on his face was not pleasant to see and he hoarsely said you are showing a great deal of authority for a stripling these military schools spoil boys like you by making them think they are men before the fuzz grows on their faces there was no doubt in the lads mind but he was dealing with a desperate man and frank fully realized that he had thoroughly aroused the strangers anger but frank could not be bullied and the man in black was very repulsive to him for some reason once more the boy started to walk away but the man was quickly at his side where he kept again attempting to be persuasive although it was plain that he longed to throttle the lad what is the use of being unreasonable i am willing to do the square thing i have made you a magnificent offer for that ring which i am anxious to possess far too anxious muttered frank that is natural declared the man swiftly did you ever collect stamps if you have you should know something of the mania that seizes upon a collector it is thus with me if i see an odd ring i cannot obtain i feel as if i had been robbed of something that rightfully belongs to me he paused a moment in his talk but frank walked straight onward saying nothing i have offered you a ridiculous price for that ring continued the man i cannot afford it but my mind is set on having the ring already i have spent a fortune in my collections and the time has come when i cannot fling money freely to the winds come now young man have a little sympathy with me and sell me that ring under certain circumstances these words might have melted frank who was not a coldblooded lad by any means but there was something in the strangers villainous aspect and repulsive manner that had turned the boy against the man in black and caused him to remain obdurate i told you at first that it was useless to offer me money for this ring said the boy i think you will begin to understand that i meant it at least you will tell me how it came in your possession frank hesitated surely there could be no harm in telling this and it might enable him to get rid of the stranger so he said it was given to me by my mother and your mother how did she obtain it swiftly asked the stranger my father gave it to her i do not know how it came into his possession your father and mother are dead ha and you prize the ring because it was a present from your mother that is one reason and there is another yes what it suddenly struck frank that he was talking altogether too much and so he answered i decline to say i have already told you enough and i beg you to excuse me we will part here first answer one more question what was your fathers name charles conrad merriwell the man in black put a hand to his eyes and seemed to be thinking for a moment beneath his breath he muttered merriwell merriwell i do not know the name then dropping his hand he said i will make you one more offer for the ring i will give you fifty dollars for it see here is the money dont be foolish take it you will never receive another such offer he had pulled out some bills from which he quickly selected a fiftydollar banknote which he tendered to frank the boy drew away you are wasting your time in offering me money for the ring i am in earnest in declining to sell it goodday sir he turned and walked swiftly away the baffled man in black stood staring after the lad his forehead lowering and his white teeth showing a bit through his dark mustache refuse to sell the ring he grated madly all right i am not defeated i will have it within a week chapter xxvi the mystery of the ring frank did not glance back till he turned onto another street and then he saw the man in black standing quite still where they had parted the reddish glow of the sunset was behind the man on which his black figure stood out like a silhouette the cloak and cape making him slightly resemble a gigantic bat the boy shivered a little as he passed beyond the view of the mysterious stranger that man makes my blood cold he murmured there is something decidedly aweinspiring about him somehow i do not believe i have seen the last of him frank was right he had not seen the last of the man in black thinking of what had happened frank soon came to the conclusion that the man was mad or else there was some mystery about the ring that was not known to the possessor why had the stranger been so desirous of knowing how the ring came into franks possession true he had said that he always wished to know the history of such rings as he collected but frank had refused distinctly to sell the ring and still the man had seemed very desirous of obtaining information concerning it why had he asked the name of franks father these questions presented themselves to the boy for consideration and he remembered how on hearing the name the stranger had confessed that it was unfamiliar to him frank was thinking deeply of these things when a familiar voice called hello frank are you going past without speaking he started and looked up finding himself in front of inzas home it was a fine oldfashioned house built years and years ago and an iron fence surrounded the front lawn inza was at the gate a pretty pout on her face the young cadet instantly lifted his cap as he smilingly retorted i did not see you there miss burrage oh bother your miss burrage she exclaimed you know it was inza with you long ago you promised to call me that no wonder you didnt see me you were going past with your head down your eyes on the ground and an expression of profound abstraction on your face what in the world were you thinking of thats a mystery said frank approaching the gate indeed and she lifted her eyebrows with a pretty assumption of offended dignity a secret from me i did not say it was a secret i said it was a mystery i was thinking of the man in black mercy she gave a little shiver what is the man in black some horrible ogre well i fancy he is ogre enough to give you the chills what story did you find him in oh i didnt find him in a story i met him in real life i left him a few minutes ago this is interesting she laughed who is he whats his name i dont know didnt i say he is a mystery come frank are you trying to tease me not at all i will tell you all i know about this singular man in black then leaning gracefully against one of the iron gateposts he related his recent adventure with the unpleasant stranger she listened with breathless interest her eyes growing wider and wider and an expression of alarm coming to her pretty face oh frank she exclaimed when he had finished i know this terrible man is dangerous he will do you harm oh im not afraid of that declared the boy lightly but i would give something to know what there is about this ring that makes him so desirous of possessing it he held up the ring for her to examine it was an oddly twisted band of gold looking like a writhing serpent it was set with a peculiar black stone that seemed quite as hard as a diamond for all that there were numerous marks and scratches on its smooth surface it is a horrid ugly old ring declared inza anybody must be crazy to offer fifty dollars for it unless it bears some value that is not apparent to one who does not know its secret what value can it bear that is the mystery still from my mothers words i am sure my father prized this ring highly when it came into his possession he was in southern california or mexico and he sent it home to my mother at the earliest opportunity writing her to be very choice of it and not to lose it on her life as it was very valuable now my father never revealed the secret of this ring to my mother if the ring has a secret but i am sure that mother believed there was something mysterious about it for when she was dying she gave it to me telling me never to part with it of course i will not sell it of course not nodded inza but the horrid old thing may bring you trouble instead of good oh i dont think there is much danger of that the man in black will give over his attempt to obtain it when he really knows i will not part with it on any condition he may but his words which you have repeated for me make me believe he will do something desperate in order to get possession of it you must look out for him you must be on your guard constantly why inza laughed frank in astonishment i never heard you speak like this before you really appear as if you felt a foreboding of some terrible thing perhaps i do she said very gravely for a lighthearted girl frank looked down at the ring on his hand surely it was an ugly trifle to make so much trouble do you see those fine lines on the surface of the stone he asked they were faintly visible to the naked eye there is something peculiar about those lines he said this stone is so hard that nothing seems to scratch it and i am sure those lines were not made by the ring accidentally striking against hard objects they were there when it came into my possession i do not think another line or mark has been made upon it since i have owned it that is odd odd it is remarkable it makes it appear that these lines were traced there with some instrument that could mark the stone and that they have a secret meaning who knows possibly that is true and it may be that the man in black can read their meaning the red light was dying out of the western sky and the dusky shadows of advancing night were gathering in the village street which was overhung by large dark elm trees standing by the gate the boy and girl minded not the approach of darkness as they talked on suddenly inza uttered a cry and caught franks arm pointing to the opposite side of the street and excitedly whispering look look there who is that man skulking along the walk over there by jove it is the man in black declared frank chapter xxvii attacked on the road it was in truth the mysterious man who was lingering on the opposite side of the street under the deeper shadows of the elms that he was watching frank quickly became evident but he slowly walked away when he saw he was observed what a villainouslooking creature he is said inza in a flutter of alarm how could you tell at that distance when it is so dark half laughed frank oh it was his general appearance his black clothes and that strange cloak and cape to himself frank confessed that the man had seemed rather more aweinspiring when seen through the gathering darkness than he had appeared near at hand in the stronger light of sunset the stranger had moved along the street till swallowed by the darkness beneath the great trees but something told the boy he was lingering at a distance watching and waiting despite his strong nerves the boy felt a cold chill creep along his back what desperate deed might not the mysterious man in black be contemplating the girl was no less impressed oh frank she exclaimed looking up into his handsome face i know you are in danger i am sure of it that dreadful creature means to do you some injury seeing how distressed she was frank began to feel sorry that he had told her so much you are nervous he said i shouldnt have told you all this stuff about the ring and that man her hand fell on his which rested on the top of the iron gate you did right in telling me came softly from her lips who should you have told if not me we ought not to have secrets from each other i do not fancy we have many secrets that we keep from each other inza he murmured leaning toward her over the gate you know how i have trusted you and have i not trusted you frank i have told you all my delightful little secrets and i have not told yours to another soul they say girls cannot keep secrets but i think you will find out they can ah inza you are not like other girls oh yes i am she laughed you think i am not but i am perhaps i am a trifle too old for my years as papa often says but the terrible dangers you have rescued me from have been quite enough to add something to my age in the face of every danger you have been brave as few girls could have been thats flattery it is the sincere honest truth do you think i would attempt to flatter you frank their hands met and he suddenly leaned over the gate and kissed her in the dusky twilight she gave a little cry as of surprise or dismay retreating swiftly but frank clung to her hands and she did not make a severe struggle to break away although for a moment there was a playful mockery of a struggle slowly he drew her back to the gate but she timidly held away as if she were really alarmed how dare you sir she exclaimed with a toss of her head you are very bold i beg your pardon he beseeched with mock humbleness i will agree not to do it again till i get another good chance really how sacrificing you are you are extremely free stolen sweets you know are the best but truly inza hadnt i a right to that a right indeed why to use a slang expression that is cheek never mind the cheek he said laughingly i prefer the lips and then before she could divine his intention he kissed her again this time she broke away in earnest goodnight sir she called from up the walk oh wait a moment he implored you arent going to leave me like this oh but i am how can you you are getting altogether too free she seemed really angry and a feeling of dismay came over the lad at the gate inza she had paused well sir dont go away angry please i know i had no right to steal those kisses but i am willing to make amends oh you are she said wonderingly and it seemed to frank that she was struggling to keep back a burst of laughter how will you do it if youll come here i will give them back to you that was a masterstroke a soft laugh came from her lips and she returned you are a saucy cheeky fellow and i am not coming back goodnight you are not angry whats the use to be angry with you goodnight inza goodnight frank as he turned away down the walk he saw her pause at the door and heard her softly call frank yes i dont like to think of you as a thief i will take those kisses back some other time then with another ripple of laughter she disappeared into the house franks heart was very light as he walked airily down the street he had forgotten the man in black for the time and he whistled a lively air thinking of the charming girl he had left a few moments before it had now grown quite dark for the moon had not yet risen but there was a springtime sweetness in the air which was not yet enervated by the languorous heat of summer frank passed beyond the limits of the village where lights were twinkling from the windows of the houses and he swung down the road toward the cove at a lively gait still whistling at a certain point the road was lined with bushes and not far away was the village cemetery frank had reached this lonely locality when of a sudden a feeling of uneasiness came over him somehow it seemed that he was in danger then came a rustle in the bushes and the following moment a dark form confronted the lad blocking his path frank recoiled and through his mind flashed the thought it is the man in black at the same moment the unknown sprang forward and clutched the lad snarling give me that ring i will have it give it up peaceably or i will choke the breath out of your body dont shout it will be the worse for you if you do right there and then the man in black met with a great surprise frank grappled with the stranger and for some moments they engaged in a fierce struggle at length the boy got the best of it and as he threw the man he gave his assailant a terrible uppercut blow having freed himself frank took to his heels and ran down the road toward the academy chapter xxviii the marks on the black stone frank fancied he heard pursuing footsteps behind him but the mysterious man might have spared himself the effort if he tried to overtake the lad for merriwell almost flew over the ground the lights from the windows of the barracks soon appeared through the trees and frank felt relieved when he was safely within the grounds with the academy buildings looming before him a short time later he entered his own room in the cockloft to find bartley hodge sitting with his feet on the table smoking a cigarette and perusing an exciting detective story but the feet went down to the floor like a flash and the cigarette and book disappeared with magical swiftness as frank came in oh said hodge with a sigh of relief its you is it merriwell i thought it might be an inspector frank laughed it would have been rather bad for you if i had been an inspector for you did not get that book and cigarette out of sight quick enough to fool anybody and the air is full of smoke you would have stood a good chance for chevrons next month if you had let cigarettes and novels alone and taken a little more care to avoid demerit never mind old man said hodge as he resumed the cigarette and brought forth the detective story again youll be a corporal sure and that is glory enough for us dont preach if you should start in on this yarn you wouldnt give it up till you finished it and that is exactly why i am not going to start in i enjoy a good story as well as you do but i cannot afford to read novels now and so i refuse to be tempted into looking into any of them this is a hummer declared bart enthusiastically it is full of mystery and murder and all that beagle ben the detective is a corker that fellow can look a man over and tell what he had for dinner by the expression around the corners of his mouth he sees through a crook as easily as you can look through a plateglass window and the mysteries in this story are enough to give a fellow the nightmare i wonder why such mysterious things never happen in real life perhaps they do occasionally the way frank spoke the words caused bart to turn and look him over wonderingly hello he said whats struck you you are breathing as if you had been running but youre rather pale round the gills i have had an adventure you are always having adventures youre the luckiest fellow alive this adventure is somewhat out of the usual order declared frank it might furnish material for a detective story whew whistled the darkhaired lad now you are making me curious reel it off for us then frank sat down and told hodge the full particulars of his adventure with the mysterious man in black a look of wonder and delight grew on barts face as he listened and when the account was finished he slapped his thigh crying by jove merriwell this is great why such things do actually happen dont they why do you suppose that man is so determined to obtain possession of that ugly old ring do you actually believe he is a collector of rings with a mania for the quaint and curious it is possible but for some reason i doubt it so do i he did not seem quite sincere in his manner of telling that story and he was altogether too desperate in his determination to obtain the ring thats right besides that he wished to know how it came into my possession and when he learned my fathers name he declared he had never heard it before what do you make out of that well it strikes me that this man recognized the ring as one he had seen before bart nodded with satisfaction just the way i figured it out old man he did not seem so anxious to learn the history of the ring although he pretended that it was his wish to know the history of every ring that came into his possession in this case he seemed far more anxious to discover how i came to have it and so he must already know its history yes what do you know about it yourself frank not much was the serious reply you know i once told you that my father was much away from home traveling in the west where he claimed to have business interests and it was not till after his death that we knew what his business actually was that of a note broker with a passion for gambling yes i remember all this in his wanderings father somehow got hold of that ring and it is pretty certain that he considered it very valuable for he sent it to mother and wrote her to guard it faithfully and not to let it part from her on any consideration he said that he would come for it some day but he never did when mother died she gave me the ring telling me to keep it always that is as much of the rings history as is known to me and that is just enough to make the thing a decided mystery i have heard of magic rings used by east indian fakirs and magicians perhaps this is one of those rings frank smiled a bit and shook his head hardly that i think he said from its appearance i should say this ring was made by some crude workman in the west in that case what can there be about it that is mysterious or valuable you have asked me something i cannot answer lets look at the thing bart held out his hand and frank removed the ring from his finger handing it over it slips off altogether too easily said hodge i should think you would fear losing it it does come off easy and for that reason i have not worn it much till of late yes i never noticed it on your hand till a short time ago i have kept it among my valuables hodge looked the ring all over examining it slowly and carefully there doesnt seem to be anything about it to make a fellow think it so very mysterious he said with a shade of disappointment in his voice no it is just a homely twisted ring with an old scratched black stone set in it thats right perhaps the man in black is crazy it is possible in which case the mystery amounts to nothing for a few seconds the two lads sat staring at each other then frank removed a pin from some hidden place and held it toward bart here he said take this and see how easily you can scratch that stone hodge took it and attempted to scratch the black stone that was set in the ring why the thing is hard as flint yes harder he exclaimed the pin will not leave a mark upon it and it has already turned the point of the pin over still as you said the stone is scratched what do you make of that it strikes me it was not scratched by accident hodge started and whistled do you imagine these marks were made here intentionally and deliberately doesnt it seem that way well it is not impossible if they were made there deliberately and intentionally cut by some instrument that could mark that hard stone doesnt it stand to reason that the one who made them did not do all that work for nothing of course then those marks may mean something by jingoes you are right this may be known to the man in black which makes him so fierce to obtain the ring sure again the boys stared silently at each other but there were traces of eager excitement on the faces of both how are you going to find out what those marks mean frank that is a question easier asked than answered did you ever examine this stone under a microscope no then i advise you to do so without delay these scratches are not very plain to the naked eye but a microscope may reveal a great secret to you as bart passed the ring back frank said you are right my curiosity is thoroughly aroused and i will examine it under a magnifying glass at the earliest opportunity get leave to look at it under the big glass in the experimenting room i will try it tomorrow until very near taps the boys talked of the mystery of the ring and that night both of them dreamed over and over of the ring and the sinister man in black chapter xxix bart makes a pledge the following day frank obtained permission to look at the ring through the powerful microscope belonging to the academy bart accompanied him to the experimenting room and they were soon taking turns in looking at the marked stone what do you make of it old man asked bart it looks like a map said frank right exclaimed the other lad it looks like a map and i believe that is what it is there is a river or road and mountains something that looks like a lake and then a tiny cross the cross must be a landmark yes and you will note that it is at the end of what looks like a river but that must be a road it is if this is a map for it runs over that range of hills or mountains that is plain enough and you will see there is a tiny snakelike thread that winds away from that spot which looks as if it was intended for a lake i see it that must be a river or stream the boys were now very excited all doubts were fading from their minds the lines on the black stone had surely been intended to represent a map but what portion of the face of the earth did it portray that was a question the ring did not answer supposing it is a map said frank helplessly what good will it do me i do not know what it is a map of but you may bet your last dollar the man in black knows i dont see how that is going to do me any good it will do him some good if he gets hold of this ring well i shall take care that he does not get hold of it the map if it were a map on the stone served to more fully arouse the curiosity of the boys without in any way satisfying them concerning the mystery of the ring frank became so absorbed in trying to discover the true meaning of the map and in getting some light on the mystery that he began to neglect his studies this however was quickly noted by hodge who said be careful old man dont let that ring get into your head so that you will lose your chance of standing well up in your class you are all right in drill work and you should be appointed a corporal next month hang the old ring exclaimed frank petulantly i never had anything cause me so much bother before whenever i try to study i fall to thinking of it and i dream of it every night two days passed and nothing more was seen of the man in black during that time which led bart to believe that the mysterious individual had left the vicinity he must have fancied that you would have him arrested for attacking you on the road said hodge you are not likely to see him again very soon dont get that impression into your head returned frank he is not far away i seem to feel that he is lurking near awaiting his next opportunity thats tommyrot you have let this old ring mix you all up dont slip any cogs now frank or you may have the pleasure of seeing your new rival paul rains appointed a corporal while you still remain an ordinary cadet frank flushed rains is not a bad fellow he said he is square he may seem so to you said hodge but i am suspicious of any fellow who has much to do with wat snell and that gang frank it is a wonder to me that you ever came to have anything to do with me afterward well you know i shouldnt if i hadnt believed there was some good in you for all of appearances thank you old man exclaimed hodge with genuine feeling you are white all the way through and i believe it is to you i owe credit for still remaining a cadet in this school nonsense there is no nonsense about it you know i tried two military schools before i came here and i did not remain in either i could not get along you have helped me over the hard places and you have stood by me through thick and thin although most of the fellows disliked me at first and thought you were foolish in doing what you did i have been no particular aid to you but i have led you into temptations and dangers you would have avoided but for the fact that we were roommates and friends in return you have saved me many bad breaks and i am not liable to forget i did hate you most intensely but you shall find that i can be as strong in my friendships as i am in my hatreds this was saying a great deal for hodge who was usually silent and reserved concerning himself but bart knew he was speaking no more than the truth and he felt that the time had come when such an acknowledgment would do him good franks generous heart was touched by this new revelation of his friends nature and he grasped barts hand warmly if i have helped you in any way i am glad to know it he said earnestly well you have and you have taken demerit on my account without a murmur it is selfish of me to cling to cigarettes when tobacco smoke in quarters has been reported against us so many times by jingoes im going to swear off they dont do a fellow any good and they get an awful hold on one it wont be easy for me to give them up but i am going to do it if you catch me smoking another of the things you may kick me till there isnt a breath left in my body thats business and i will stick to it good laughed frank you have been smoking a good many of them lately and i have noticed that you complained of your lungs how can your lungs be in any condition when you are constantly inhaling so much of that smoke i know of a young fellow with weak lungs who went into quick consumption and the doctors said cigarettes were entirely responsible he smoked a number of packages a day when he started he simply smoked now and then but the habit grew on him and at last he was unable to break it i believe any fellow can break off smoking them if he has any willpower of his own i think a fellow should but you may not find it as easy as you fancy oh it will be easy enough for me when i make up my mind to a thing i never give up well i sincerely trust it will prove so every one knows cigarettes are harmful yesterday i read in a paper about a boy in a new york hospital who was said to have a tobacco heart from smoking cigarettes by a tobacco heart it was meant that his heart was so badly affected that it did not perform its action regularly and properly sometimes he is convulsed with terrible pains and gasps for breath nearly all the time he moans and begs for cigarettes but the doctors say he must never smoke another one if he cares to live as it is if he should get up his heart is so weakened that it may go on a strike any time and cause his death oh say laughed bart that settles it now i never will smoke again i mean it you see if i dont i sincerely hope you do you may become one of the best athletes in this school your only trouble has been shortness of breath when you exercise heavily and that came entirely from smoking if you give it up you will soon cease to be troubled that way well heres my hand on it and it is as good as settled no matter how much i may desire a smoke now ill not monkey with the deadly cigarette their hands met again chapter xxx frank and the professor frank merriwell was right in thinking he had not seen the last of the man in black on the third day after his first meeting with the mysterious stranger he was astonished while ascending the stairs to see that individual come out of professor gunns room frank paused on the flight that led to the cockloft and watched the man hurriedly descend the stairs great scott muttered the young cadet that is remarkable i wonder what he was up to in the professors room he saw me but he hustled away in a hurry for a moment frank hesitated and then he resolved to find out if possible what could be the meaning of the strangers visit with this object in view he descended the stairs and approached the professors door on which he rapped of late professor gunn had been severely troubled with headaches and this happening to be one of his bad days he was stopping in his room with his head bound up in a cloth saturated with camphor frank was obliged to rap a second time and then the professors shuffling step was heard and his clothbound head appeared as the door opened whats wanted he asked sharply cant i have any peace and rest speak up whats wanted i have something to ask you professor said frank quietly ah is it you merriwell i was going to see you later come in not a little surprised frank entered the professors room standing cap in hand while the crusty old fellow seated himself in an easy chair and asked what is it you want to see me about young man you were lately visited by a stranger whom i saw leaving this room a few moments ago yes sir yes that man assaulted me on the highway a few nights ago whats that what assaulted you this is interesting decidedly yes he assaulted me but i managed to give him the worst of it and got away without being harmed you should have reported the occurrence you certainly should that was the proper thing to do the correct thing young man then i would have known how to receive him i thought he had gone away from this vicinity but it seems that he has not now i would like to know his name what is his name professor please eh ah his name let me see now that is surprising really surprising i do not think he gave me his name did not give his name how did he obtain admission to the building thats so how did he i hadnt thought of that he was the smoothest talker i ever heard he didnt give me a chance to ask many questions he must have had some sort of business with you he did that is he pretended to have he said he was here to recover some property that belonged to him property he lost several years ago the eyes of the old professor searched franks hands and rested on the peculiar ring so that was his trick the scoundrel cried frank repressing his anger with difficulty i presume he claimed this ring belonged to him well ahem he described such a ring which he said he had seen on the hand of a student here exactly and he named me as the possessor of the ring he said the name of the students father was charles conrad merriwell i believe sir i am quite sure in fact that that was the name of your father frank was fully aroused and his brown eyes gleamed in a way that showed how indignant he was although it was necessary to keep his feelings suppressed as far as possible professor gunn he said swiftly that man is a scoundrel eh ha hum severe language be careful young man be cautious do not make a statement you cannot stand behind it is dangerous very dangerous i can stand behind every word i have said why when he found i would not sell him the ring professor he tried to rob me of it that is not only the act of a scoundrel but that of a desperado it looks bad bad confessed the old professor who seemed in a somewhat nervous and flustered state tell me all about it give the full particulars of the occurrence frank did so telling a straightforward story to which the professor listened with interest that was apparent although he now and then pressed his hand to his head as if the pain were troubling him when the story was finished and frank had explained what he and bart had discovered on the black stone set in the ring the old professor showed that he was quite wrought up remarkable he exclaimed reemarkable i am surprised i am puzzled this man told a very straight story said the ring was stolen from him in arizona he said it was very valuable to him as it was an heirloom he could not tell how it came into your possession he did not try all he wanted was to recover his property that was all that was his scheme when he found he could not buy it from me he did not attempt to make you believe he was a collector of odd rings professor for he knew that would do no good and so he laid claim to the ring what proof did he give you that it was his property eh proof it seems as if he did give proof of some sort but really i dont know as he did he was such a plausible person so very smooth and convincing why i did not think of doubting him but i know your record very well since entering the academy merriwell it is satisfactory quite satisfactory i do not think you are the sort of a lad to tell a deliberate falsehood no sir no thank you sir that being the case i shall have to accept your statement yes i will accept it he said he would call again tomorrow let him come i think i will have an officer on hand he shall be arrested the moment he shows himself thats right thats proper hum ha assaulted a cadet of fardale academy did he attempted to rob a student at this school did he well he shall be duly and properly punished yes sir the professor had worked himself up into a state of considerable excitement seeming to have forgotten his headache for the time he got upon his feet and went tramping about the room in his slippers the heels of which had been trodden down he perched his noseglasses far down on his pointed proboscis and glared over them in a way he had when he was endeavoring to appear very impressive before a class under other circumstances frank might have smiled at the figure cut by the excited old man but he was now far too angry himself to note what was ludicrous take care of that ring young man advised the professor take the best of care of it it may be more valuable than it appears there is certainly something connected with this ring that makes it valuable to this stranger or else the man is a lunatic yes sir a lunatic i do not think that no i do not he appeared rational he was quite sane when he was here quite so i have ever regarded this ring as simply an ugly ornament that my father ran across and took a fancy to but now i believe it must be something more it is likely quite likely it seems that there is a mystery connected with the ring it may be solved soon very soon this stranger must know a great deal concerning it perhaps he will tell what he knows perhaps he may be induced to tell the professor said this in a peculiar way that seemed to say strong inducements would be held out to the strange man in black frank had seen professor gunn and asked his question but the mystery was deep as ever when the boy left the professors room chapter xxxi snell talks frank was not the only one who had observed the man in black as that mysterious individual was departing bart hodge saw the sinister stranger and instantly recognized him from franks description great scott thought bart what can that imp of satan be up to here the man was hurrying from the grounds and hodge followed the man passed the sentry but bart was challenged see that man said the lad hurriedly i am satisfied that he has been up to some mischief i want to follow him and see where he goes you cannot leave the grounds without a pass said the sentinel firmly oh hang your pass cried bart warmly as he saw there was danger that the man in black would escape this is an exceptional case a sentry knows no exceptions if you leave the grounds you will have to obtain a pass from the office but that man is a robber a highwayman if you stand on the rules of the academy now he will escape and you may be reprimanded i shall do my duty as sentinel sir reprimand or no reprimand the man in black was walking swiftly up the road toward the village his cape flapping behind him in the wind like the wings of a bat in a few moments he would disappear from view hang the luck grated hodge as he turned away in disappointment id given something to follow him up he was inclined to be angry at the sentinel at first but his friendship with merriwell had taught him that he should have forbearance when in the right and should never hold a grudge when in the wrong sober reason told him the sentinel had done no more than his plain duty so the feeling of anger was swiftly banished from barts breast i will find frank and tell him what is up he thought as he walked swiftly toward the barracks he was met by wat snell who said hello hodge i want to have a talk with you with me asked bart in surprise snell had not been friendly for some time and of late he had ceased to speak to hodge this had not troubled bart at all but he was greatly surprised by this advance on the part of his enemy yes with you assured snell there was a time when you were ready enough to talk with me i have even known you to follow me up to get a chance to have a word in private with me the face of the darkhaired boy flushed that time is past he said what do you want of me it is my turn now i want to have a word in private with you bart did not fancy this much he knew snell for exactly what the fellow was a sneaking revengeful rascal the thought that he had ever had dealings with such a scamp made barts cheeks burn and caused him to regard himself with no little contempt he did not care to be seen talking privately with snell and he glanced hastily around to see if any one was watching them snell noted the look and an angry light came into his eyes which were somewhat too small and set so near together that they seemed crowding his nose between them oh you hesitate over it do you he sneered thats like some fellows to go back on their old friends you wont make anything by it in the end if you have anything to say to me say it commanded hodge sharply come over here where the fellows cant see us from the windows invited snell beckoning bart to follow but hodge did not stir no sir he said firmly if you have anything you want to say to me say it right here snell did not like this he came back slowly casting a hasty doubtful look up to the dormitory windows after some hesitation during which he kicked the gravel of the walk with his toe he began there was a time when you didnt like merriwell any better than the rest of us and you have done things that would put you in a pretty bad corner if they were known hodges brows lowered in a scowl and his nostrils dilated like those of a wild creature that scents danger he said nothing but his steady piercing gaze made snell keep his eyes on the ground of course i am not the kind of a fellow to blow anything of the sort wat went on hurriedly i simply mentioned it by chance you seem friendly with merriwell now and i thought you might have forgotten i wonder what the rascal is coming at thought bart but not a word did he speak aloud for the sake of old times i thought perhaps you might do something for some of your old friends i didnt know but you might it cant harm merriwell any in particular hell never miss it it will be a lift for me and i can make it an object for you snell was floundering and the look on his face seemed to indicate that he was growing frightened and felt like taking to his heels of a sudden hodge became curious to know what the fellow had to say and so he decided to try diplomacy i do not forget my friends he said what is it you want of me snell that gave wat a little courage before i tell you hodge i want to say that you will be well paid if you help out a little in this matter and merriwell can never know that you were in it hell never suspect you you didnt have any scruples about doing something of the sort once on a time well what is it demanded bart impatiently dont beat round the bush so much oh dont be in such a hurry fluttered snell nervously far from feeling fully confident of hodge theres money in this it will be twentyfive dollars in your pocket if you do what i want you to are you with me that depends on what you want me to do name it well merriwell has something that doesnt rightfully belong to him understand that it is not his by right it belongs to a friend of mine who wants me to recover his property well you can aid me as you room with merriwell jupiter thought bart i wonder if the mysterious ring is the piece of property snell means it was with no little difficulty that hodge held himself in check but he did not wish snell to become alarmed and so he quietly asked what is this piece of property it is something merriwell wears every day i suppose he takes it off occasionally that would give you your chance mind you it is not rightfully his but it belongs to my friend so there is no harm in taking it to restore it to its proper owner in fact that is a simple act of justice why doesnt the rightful owner recover his property in the regular manner that might prove difficult or even impossible as he would have trouble in establishing his claim and merriwell might conceal the property it is not the value of this property that the owner cares so much for he wants the property itself there was no longer any doubt in barts mind snell was speaking of the ring the man in black had resorted to another scheme to obtain possession of that ugly ornament with the greatest difficulty hodge kept cool and placid as he asked and you want me to steal this property no no no it would not be stealing it it would be returning it to its proper owner cant you see well if i am going to do this job i must know what the property is it is the ring merriwell wears when he is not in ranks the twisted band with a black stone set in it and you want me to obtain that ring and give it to you yes for which i am to receive twentyfive dollars yes what is your answer this is my answer like a flash hodge struck out straight from the shoulder and his fist caught snell between the eyes chapter xxxii snells hatred smack the blow sounded sharp and clear and snell quickly found himself stretched on the gravel walk he looked up in a dazed way to see hodge standing near at hand regarding him with withering scorn youll pay dearly for this gasped snell lifting himself to his elbow and glaring at bart all right was the hot retort i am willing to pay for it you may have taken me for a thief but i rather think you have discovered your mistake you werent so honest once on a time not so very long whats that cried bart taking a threatening step toward the fellow i was never a thief no matter what my other failings may have been and if you dare insinuate such a thing i will ram the words down your throat thats all right thats all right muttered wat scrambling up and getting out of reach i will report this assault report it and be hanged the fellows in this academy admire a tattler you will have a very pleasant time if you report it it was seen somebody will tell professor gunn perhaps so but it isnt best that you are the one ill ill get even go ahead id like the satisfaction of fighting you to a finish i will not fight with my fists blustered wat trying to appear very fierce there are more deadly weapons name any weapon you choose i will be only too glad to meet you i am a good pistol shot and professor rhynas says i handle the foils fairly well oh youre a regular ruffian cried snell his chin beginning to quiver and his voice choking with anger that brought tears to his eyes i will not fight you in any way i do not pretend to be a match for a ruffian of your sort but i will get square just the same i presume you will try to square the account in some sneaking manner well i warn you now and here that it will not be healthy if you try any dirty tricks on me if anything underhand happens to me ill know who was the originator of it and ill settle with you that is business with this bart turned to walk away noting that a great many of the cadets were peering from the windows some of them grinning with delight snell shook his fist at hodges back blustering this is all right all right sir it is not necessary for me to fight you you are not on the same level with me no muttered the darkhaired boy grimly i have never sunk as low as that the room occupied by merriwell and hodge was not on that side of the building so frank who was studying had not witnessed the encounter between his roommate and snell fortunately also the blow had not been seen by any one but cadets so it was not liable to come to professor gunns knowledge unless wat told of it himself bart found frank in their room and merriwell looked up as the darkhaired boy entered with a quick nervous step hello he cried in surprise whats happened your face is dark as a thundercloud and you look as if you could eat iron well i feel as if i wouldnt have any trouble in chewing up a few pounds of iron replied bart by jove old man i never realized till a few minutes ago how narrow was my escape from being a most contemptible scoundrel how is that i was taken for a thief grated bart his white teeth clicking yes sir taken for a thief it must have been by somebody who does not know you very well thats where you are wrong it was by somebody who knows me far too well that is why i feel that my escape from being a scoundrel was a narrow one had he not seen that bart was so serious and thoroughly in earnest frank must have smiled give us the particulars he urged what did you do when you were taken for a thief knocked the cad down snarled bart smashing his clinched right hand into the open palm of his left that was very proper assured merriwell you did nicely my son but i do not feel any the less humiliated if i had not given him reason to approach me in such a manner he would not have ventured then bart related the particulars of his adventure with snell so so muttered frank that rascal is in this affair the man in black has chosen a good tool that man is determined to have your ring i should say so he has been to professor gunn and represented that the ring belonged to him and then frank took his turn to tell what he had learned from the head professor well i never cried bart as frank finished why the scoundrel has the cheek of a brass monkey he is dangerous frank i believe you if i were in your place i would swear out a warrant for his arrest and send an officer after him i may be forced to do so and i advise you to keep your eye on wat snell i will do that in the meantime let me take the ring long enough to make an enlarged drawing of those lines so that you will have the map if it is a map even if you lose the ring you know my ability to copy with pen and ink anything i see my father wants me to become a civil engineer and so i am taking a course to suit him but when i leave fardale i mean to go to an art school and find out if i am not cut out for an artist how can you make a drawing of the lines why i will place the ring under a microscope and then it will not be difficult you know i can be very accurate when i try yes i know it and i will think of your plan i am inclined to believe it is a good one whether i should lose the ring or not id like to have a copy of that map to study ill find time to do the job tomorrow if old gunn will permit us to use the microscope again on the following day however bart found no opportunity to make the drawing frank watched for the man in black who had said he would call on professor gunn again but the mysterious man did not put in an appearance and merriwell waited his time wat snell was forced to endure no end of ridicule from his companions as it was the rule at fardale that a student who had received a blow or an insult must challenge the one who gave it if he did not do so he was regarded as a coward and his life in school from that time was certain to be far from pleasant in his heart snell was an arrant coward and he knew that hodge was really longing for a challenge wat felt sure that he would receive a severe drubbing at the hands of the darkhaired boy whom he had angered and the thoughts of such punishment filled his soul with horror i cant fight him its no use i cant he told himself over and over he is a turncoat anyway he did not pretend to be so conscientious till after he got thick with merriwell oh merriwell is really the one who is at the bottom of all the trouble i have had in this school and i hate him worse than i do hodge id like to get hold of that ring jupiter seventyfive dollars is a price to pay for an old ring like that but its what that strange man in black offered me to secure it for him theres something mighty mysterious about that ring i wish i knew what the mystery is i am going to ask the man when i see him this evening that night snell escaped from the building and the grounds without obtaining leave he was going to keep an appointment with the man in black chapter xxxiii playing the shadow snell was followed frank had taken barts advice to keep an eye on the fellow and something in wats actions had given him the impression that snell was up to something that he did not care to have generally known with a great deal of skill frank kept watch of snell till the latter slipped from the grounds under cover of darkness it was a cloudy night with the wind moaning far out at sea and the waves roaring sullenly along the base of black bluff down the shore as may be imagined it was no easy task to follow wat without losing the fellow in the darkness or getting so close that the shadowed lad would discover that somebody was watching him although he was not aware of it frank possessed a remarkable faculty for performing such a task he moved with the silence of a creeping cat and yet covered ground with sufficient swiftness to keep near wat something must have made snell suspicious for three times he stopped and peered back through the darkness and three times frank sunk like a ghost to the ground escaping discovery by his swiftness in making the move indeed had it been possible for a third party to watch them it must have seemed that merriwell felt an intuition which told him exactly when snell was going to look back once or twice before they came to the road that led up from the cove frank lost sight of the boy he was following but his keen ears served him quite as well as his eyes when the road up the hill was reached frank was able to follow wat with greater ease suddenly snell paused and whistled three times in a moment a single sharp whistle sounded near at hand and then frank crouching close to the ground saw a black figure come toward wat snell the wind that was moaning over the sea swept up the road and caused something to flap around the shoulders of this figure like a great pair of wings for all of the darkness frank recognized this figure and he was seized with an indefinable feeling of fear such as he had never felt before with an effort frank steadied his quivering nerves remaining quiet to watch and listen the person who had appeared in answer to snells signal was the man in black and he quickly pounced upon the boy like a huge hawk upon its prey the ring he cried hoarsely where is it wat gave a low cry of fear dont he gasped youre hurting me your fingers are hard as iron and they crush right into a fellow the ring repeated the man fiercely produce it i havent got it what snarled the mysterious stranger you have not kept your word what do you mean dont shake a fellow like that quavered snell you act like a madman answer my questions why havent you kept your word couldnt why not didnt get the chance but you said you could get a boy to assist you the fellow who rooms with this merriwell i thought i could but the cad went back on me he refused to aid you yes sir and you have found no opportunity to get hold of the ring yourself not yet but i will sir snell hastily answered all i want is to know that you will pay me as you agreed dont hold onto my arm so tight i wont run away bah cried the man in black as he halfflung wat from him what beastly luck it is bad luck confessed snell falteringly but it isnt my fault i have done my best the man in black said nothing but stood with his head bowed the elbow of his right arm resting in the hollow of his left hand while his right hand fiercely clinched supported his chin the wind continued to flap the cape about his shoulders the mans attitude and his silence gave snell a feeling of fear and he drew away acting as if he contemplated taking to his heels for all that he had said he would not run i do not propose to endure much more of this muttered the man at length ill have that ring soon by some means you must consider it very valuable said wat curiously valuable came hoarsely from the lips of the man in black i should say so if it were not i shouldnt be making such a desperate struggle to get possession of it the lad who was listening a short distance away strained his ears to catch every word there must be some secret about the ring insinuated snell the gold in it amounts to little and the old black stone a strange sound came from the throat of the man in black and then seeming to fancy that he had admitted altogether too much he hastened to say the ring is valuable to me but it is worth little to anybody else i suppose that is because nobody else knows its secret came from snell secret bah it has no secret but it was not easy to convince snell that this was the truth then why should you go to such extremes to get possession of a wretched old thing of that sort demanded wat i have told you the ring belonged to me was stolen from me it has been in our family a great length of time and was given me by my father i prize it highly for that reason i do not know how it came into the possession of this merriwell family and i cannot prove my claim to my own property so i must recover it in such a manner as is possible that is the truth wat said nothing somehow he was doubtful for it did not seem that anybody who was sane could resort to such desperate expedients to recover an ugly old ring that had no particular value save as an heirloom as for frank he might have believed the strange mans story but for the fact that the man had told him something entirely different one story or the other might be true but in any case the man in black was a liar there was a brief silence and then snell asked how am i to know that you will surely pay me seventyfive dollars for the ring you pounced upon me a few minutes ago as if you would rob me of it if it had been in my possession that was all through my eagerness and excitement declared the man soothingly i meant you no harm but i was very anxious well i dont know i am afraid i will be left when i get the ring and hand it over so i guess ill what wat edged a little farther away i guess ill throw up the job he hesitated do you still think you can find a way to get the ring think so i know i can get it sooner or later if i want to then look here to prove that i am sincere i will pay you this much in advance it is a twentydollar gold piece now you cannot doubt my earnestness and fairness in this matter if you bring me the ring within fortyeight hours ill pay you besides this twenty the seventyfive dollars i offered in the first place snell eagerly clutched the piece of money youre a brick he cried and ill lay myself out to get that ring i havent begun to try the schemes i have in my head i will meet you here tomorrow night at about this time and ill do my best to have the ring only if i havent got it i want you to promise not to jump on me and grab me the way you did tonight dont be afraid i wont harm you well you can scare a fellow out of his boots and i dont like to be scared i am afraid you are something of a coward said the man a trace of contempt in his tone but little more passed between them before the man in black turned away toward fardale village and wat descended the road in the direction of the academy frank hugged the ground at one side of the road and he was not seen by snell but by the time wat had gone so far that there was little danger of discovery if frank moved from the locality the man in black had vanished in the night still frank sprang up and went scurrying lightly up the hill keeping to the grass at the side of the road so his feet made scarcely a sound he hurried along the road till fardale village was almost reached but he saw nothing more of the man in black the mysterious stranger had vanished as completely as if swallowed up by the earth frank had hoped to trace the man to the place where he was stopping but he was forced to give this up and hurry back to the academy still he had not wasted his time they will meet there tomorrow night eh he muttered well it would not be a very difficult thing to have an officer on hand with a warrant for this stranger he went straight to his room hoping to find hodge there he did bart was seated in his favorite attitude with his feet on the table and a cigarette in his mouth chapter xxxiv the ring disappears bart the exclamation of mingled surprise and reproach came from franks lips hodge had made a move to conceal the cigarette but discovered he was too late his face turned crimson and he hung his head with shame frank closed the door and came to the side of his roommate on whose shoulder he gently placed a hand as he asked how does it happen bart bart started to say something choked a little and then forced an unpleasant laugh oh im a liar he burst out hotly i have broken my pledge at the first temptation why did you do it you know you said you could leave off smoking cigarettes easily i thought i could and you found out the habit was fastened more firmly on you than you thought thats about the size of it i have been longing for a cigarette all day and when i came by accident upon this one finding myself all alone i could not resist the desire to have a whiff that shows the habit had a firmer hold on you than you thought yes i fancied i could leave it off readily enough but i was mistaken it seems a fellow never knows what a hold the nasty little things have on him till he tries to stop smoking them and were you going to give up the struggle without another effort oh no i didnt mean to smoke only this once that is i didnt mean to at first but after i got to smoking i thought it would be a good plan to taper off which meant that you were going to tamper with the stuff again and finally you would smoke as much as ever and would not leave off at all perhaps youre right confessed hodge who showed his shame i am sure i am right but you will give over the plan of tapering off you will stop at once you are not weakminded enough to let cigarettes get a hold on you that you cannot break well i thought i wasnt but i dont know about it now oh this is bad but it doesnt mean failure i dont believe you are the kind of a fellow to give in thus easily to an enemy you have more fight in you than that frank spoke in a confident tone as if he did not doubt hodges ability to conquer the habit and bart gave him a grateful look all at once bart jumped up and opened the window out of which he fiercely flung the halfsmoked cigarette if i hadnt been a fool by nature id never lighted the thing he cried in supreme selfcontempt your confidence in me old man has given me confidence in myself this settles it i am done with cigarettes forever youll never again discover me with one in my lips bart had meant to keep his pledge in the first place but franks failure to reproach him for falling and franks confidence in his ability to stop smoking gave him the needed confidence in himself filled him with a determination not to be defeated and from that hour he never again smoked a cigarette now were all right again said merriwell heartily as bart came back from the window sit down while i relate a very interesting tale to you bart sat down and frank told what he had seen and heard through following snell that sneak makes me sick cried hodge fiercely id like to get another chance at him why hes the biggest sneak in this school thats right gage couldnt hold a candle to snell gage was bolder snell is a bigger sneak thats about the size of it what are you going to do with the fellow i think it would be well to catch him in company with the man in black when they meet tomorrow night bart slapped his thigh just the scheme but whos going to do the catching it would be a good plan to have an officer from the village on hand for that job good you can swear out a warrant for the man for felonious assault attempted highway robbery or something of the sort and have him sent where he wont trouble you again for some little time thats what i thought it seems the only way to get rid of him and he is mighty dangerous he is desperate yes he means to have that ring anyway ill find a way tomorrow to draw those lines on paper i dont care if that man does say the ring is of no particular value i know better if the lines are taken off you will stand a show of finding out what they mean frank was eager to have an enlarged copy of the lines made for he felt that he could never be sure that he would not lose the ring even though the mysterious man in black should be disposed of effectually snell is determined to get himself into serious trouble said frank oh money will hire him to do any mean sneaking thing came scornfully from barts lips if he is caught with this scoundrel in black tomorrow night he will be under a cloud here he is under a cloud now twenty fellows saw me knock him down and theyll never give him any rest till he sends me a challenge well i dont fancy he will send you a challenge then his life will be made wretched while he remains at fardale academy he has brought it on himself of course a fellow cant be a sneak and have the respect of anybody who is decent i found that out long ago the following forenoon bart obtained permission to use the microscope long enough to make a drawing of the lines on the stone set in the mysterious ring before going to recitation frank surrendered the ring to bart who hesitated about taking it what if i should lose it he said you cant smiled frank there is no danger of that still i rather wish you were coming along i cant do that without getting dismissed from recitation and that isnt possible well i will do the job quickly and ill have it finished by the time your class is through reciting so they parted and with the precious ring in his possession hodge hurried to the room where the microscope was kept having provided himself with the necessary materials for making the drawing he lost no time in getting to work and he made rapid progress as the drawing developed he grew excited and enthusiastic for he plainly saw it must be a map of some wild bit of country ill bet the man who can read this correctly and knows where this country is located can go straight to a fortune muttered the lad but i do not see how it is going to benefit anybody who does not know what section of the country this map represents it was a warm spring day and bart had opened a window near the table at which he was working a pleasant breeze was stirring although he took care to be quite accurate it did not take the lad long to complete the drawing he was examining it carefully to make sure he had omitted nothing and had made no errors when a strong wind sucked through the building swinging open the door of the room he rose hastily to close the door when another breath of wind set the paper on which he had been drawing fluttering across the table he sprang to catch it but it avoided his fingers and fluttered out of the window thrusting his head forth he saw it sail away and settle slowly at the foot of one of the great trees amid which the academy buildings stood out of the room darted bart and down the stairs he bounded he was soon outside and recovering the paper which he readily found he hastened back great scott he muttered i left that ring under the microscope the thought that he had allowed the ring to escape his sight for a moment filled him with anxiety what if he should not find it where he had left it a few moments before a cold sweat started out on his face and he literally tore up the stairs and rushed headlong into the experimenting room the door of which he had left open and then when he looked for the mysterious ring he found it had vanished chapter xxxv more danger gone bart staggered as if he had been struck a heavy blow and his face grew ghastly pale while his eyes stared at the spot where he had last seen the ring it was truly gone in some surprising manner it had disappeared from the room while he was in pursuit of the paper astonishing though such a thing seemed for a few moments hodge was quite overcome by this discovery he sank weakly into a chair wringing his hands and breathing hoarsely how had it happened it did not take bart long to decide that some one must have slipped into the room and stolen the ring while he was after the drawing in that case whoever committed the theft must have been watching for an opportunity knowing that he had the ring hodge quickly recovered from his stupefied condition and dashed out into the corridor to look for the miscreant it must have been snell was his decision i will look for the sneak straight to snells room he rushed but snells roommate who was studying declared wat had not been there in the past hour this put bart at sea for a moment where could he find snell looking at the recitation board he saw that snell should appear in the recitation room in a very few minutes he could not be confronted there what plan of action could be devised he did not wish to give snell time enough to conceal the ring if the fellow could be caught with it still in his possession it might be possible to make him disgorge it was time for frank to return from recitation the thought of facing merriwell with the confession that the ring was gone made barts knees weak but he decided that that was the proper course to pursue and so he hurried to their room frank had just got in and by the look on hodges face he instantly saw that something of an alarming nature had happened the ring he cried where is it i think wat snell has it came huskily from barts lips with one bound merriwell caught his companion by both shoulders staring straight into his face have you also turned no no he quickly went on i do not think that of you bart you are still true no i didnt go back on you said hodge thickly but i was guilty of criminal carelessness how did it happen tell me quick bart did so speaking swiftly so that no more moments were wasted it is probable that snell has it said frank he must be apprehended without delay come he took the lead and bart followed at his heels but they were not to confront wat snell at the door of the recitation room as merriwell hoped for they were not long in learning that the fellow had lately obtained a pass and left the grounds according to snell his uncle was to pass through fardale village on the noon train and wats presence was desired at the station of course both frank and bart immediately decided that this excuse had been used to enable him to reach the village and deliver the stolen ring to the man in black for all of their desire to pursue snell hotly they were unable to leave without permission and so valuable time was lost at length however they were on the highway running side by side toward the village frank had seemed cool and clearheaded but not knowing that bart had fully completed the drawing of the lines on the black stone in his heart he was feeling very desperate indeed hodge had grown thoroughly angry and snell was likely to get hurt when bart placed hands upon him the boys were good runners and they covered the distance between the academy and fardale village in a very short time once within the village they began inquiring for snell and it was not long before they discovered people who had seen him to the post office they went and then they were told that a boy answering snells description had been seen going toward the railway station it would be a corker if the fellow had really come to see his uncle said bart i do not take any stock in that now declared frank nor i but i dont understand why he is making so many twists and turns since reaching the village if he has the ring why didnt he take it straight to the man in black perhaps he knows as little about where to find that individual as we do possibly they came in sight of the station about which were several carriages while a few people were seen on the platform waiting for the midday train reaching the station they came sharply round the first corner and found themselves face to face with wat snell and the man in black at that very instant snell accepted some money and surrendered something to the stranger franks keen eyes saw that the something was the stolen ring with a cry he leaped forward flinging snell aside and grasping the man give me that ring a fierce exclamation of fury broke from the strangers lips and he swiftly thrust the ring into his pocket hands off boy he hoarsely commanded hands off or you will get hurt ill never take my hands off you till you give up that ring you scoundrel the man having encountered frank before well knew that the boy possessed remarkable strength which would not make it an easy thing to shake him off let go he hissed i will not then take that something bright and gleaming like the blade of a knife flashed in the mans hand he struck and with a cry frank fell heavily to the platform chapter xxxvi the secret of the ring astonished and horrified though he was bart hodge realized that frank had been stabbed at that moment with the lack of resolution that was characteristic of him on occasions of peril and not through fear he stood quite still and did nothing without a shout or a sound the man in black leaped toward the end of the station where a saddled and bridled horse was hitched to a post one slash of the knife set the horse free and the desperate man leaped to the creatures back riding rapidly away frank had swiftly risen to his feet and several persons who had witnessed the blow crowded anxiously around him asking how badly he was hurt its nothing but a scratch in the shoulder for i saw it coming and dodged dont mind me dont let that man get away he wont get very fur on that hoss said the owner of the animal shes lame in her off hind foot an shell tarnal soon give out if he pushes her like that still he will get away if he is not immediately pursued come wholl follow into this carriage boy cried a man i have a little horse here that will give him a hot chase come on i am the constable said another man with great dignity ill foller as soon as i can get a boss saddled realizing that the boy was not seriously hurt half of those who had been lingering about the station made a rush to join in the pursuit of the murderous stranger all kinds of teams were pressed into use and the road was soon filled with a string of pursuers looking back anxiously the man in black saw them coming and he grated his teeth fiercely for he had already discovered that the horse he had appropriated was seriously lamed let em come he cried ill not be taken easily i have the key to a fortune in my pocket and i will escape with it if it is in me to do so ruthlessly and cruelly he pricked the lame mare with the keen point of the knife which he still held in his hand and a trail of dust rose behind him out of the village and into the country the lame horse bore the fugitive not far from fardale was a big stone quarry and by chance the man had selected the road which skirted the jagged hole in the ground his pursuers were gaining on him and he continued to use the knife mercilessly as the horse bore him along the road past the quarry of a sudden a large dog bounded into the road in front of the man in black and the horse which the man bestrode gave a snort and whirled sideways coming with a crash against the rail which ran along by the roadside at that point the rail was somewhat rotten and a shriek of horror broke from the mans lips as he saw it break he made one desperate effort to spring from the saddle and escape going down into the quarry with the horse but the pursuers were dismayed to see man and beast disappear into the yawning hole he wont get away today my boy said the man in the foremost carriage at whose side was frank well find him down at the bottom of the quarry dead as a flounder finding a place to hitch the horse at the side of the road the man did so and they went forward together while the other pursuers kept coming up reaching the point where the man and horse had fallen into the quarry they looked down amid the jagged rocks far below were two motionless forms come said the man well go down there by the regular road they passed round the quarry till they found a road that wound downward till it reached the bottom by this road they descended with scores of others at their heels when they came to the man and the horse great was their astonishment to hear the man moaning and to see him open his eyes and look at them why the critter ant dead yet exclaimed the constable i think its my sollum duty to arrest him on the spot frank quickly knelt by the side of the mysterious man who faintly whispered so i didnt kill you boy well i have crimes enough to answer for the ring is here in my vest pocket take it it will never do me any good now frank quickly extracted the ring from the mans pocket and slipped it upon his finger i am dying murmured the man perhaps not well have you taken back to town and see what a doctor can do for you no use i wouldnt live to get there my time has come the hidden mine will never reveal its riches to me he is really dying whispered some one in franks ear he will not live ten minutes the wonder is that he is alive at all who are you and what is the mystery connected with this ring hurriedly asked the boy never mind my name came faintly from the lips of the dying man it would do you no good to know it i have lived a wild life a wicked life this is the end fate brought me to fardale fate showed me the ring that bore the chart to the lost mine the man stopped and closed his eyes while the ghastly pallor spread over his face a hand held a bottle of liquor to his lips and he swallowed a few drops which gave him a few more moments of life again his eyes unclosed once i committed murder for that ring he whispered i killed the mexican who possessed it it was a crazy hermit who cut that map on the stone he discovered one of the richest mines in arizona and a fantasy of his deranged brain led him to cut the chart upon the stone for he cared nothing for the gold himself when he died he gave the ring to a mexican who attended him in his last moments telling him its secret in tombstone the mexican got drunk and boasted of his riches showing the ring that night i killed the greaser and obtained the ring i had a partner and he stole the ring from me how he came to part with it and how it fell into the hands of your father boy is something i do not know he was exhausted and his voice sunk till frank could not catch the words then he lay still short breaths fluttering his lips frank feared the man would not rally again but he did and the boy panted tell me where this mine is located what part of arizona does the chart represent with a last great effort the dying man whispered northwest from tombstone lies the santa catarina mountains there there is his eyes grew glassy the last faint breath fluttered over his lips the man of mystery was dead the man in black was buried in the cemetery just outside fardale village and the small stone which frank merriwell caused to be placed at the head of his grave bears the word unknown the man had died just as his lips were about to reveal the location of the country depicted by the chart cut on the black stone of the ring that had caused so much trouble he had mentioned the santa catarina mountains but he had not told what part of the large range the chart depicted if he had lived thirty seconds longer i should have learned his secret should have known how to reach the lost mine by aid of the chart now you may be able to reach the mine after all said bart encouragingly you have the ring and you know its value when you leave school you may go west and search for your mine for it certainly belongs to you now you may find somebody in the santa catarina region that will recognize this portion of the country depicted here long before that the mine may be found by some one else it is possible but hardly probable if it were so easy to find that man would not have made such desperate attempts to obtain possession of the ring well i am not going to kick i have the ring and his knife did not end my life as it would if i had not dodged he slit open my sleeve from the shoulder to the elbow and brought the blood oh youre a lucky dog laughed bart you are sure to come out on top every time wat snell found it convenient to take a vacation but he returned to the academy later although he found himself regarded with scorn by all save a certain few of his own sort had frank seen fit he could have had wat expelled but it seemed that if the fellow had any sense of shame the way he was treated by the other cadets was quite punishment enough sometimes frank and bart would get out the drawing the latter boy had made from the lines on the ring and they would study over it a long time but they always found it baffling and they finally gave up in despair still frank clung to both ring and chart hoping they would some day prove valuable to him chapter xxxvii baby a year had passed since frank entered fardale military academy a year crowded with events and adventures such as made its memory both pleasant and painful the time of the june encampment had again arrived frank was no longer a plebe and the glistening chevrons on his sleeves told that the first year in the academy had not been wasted he was now cadet corporal merriwell the graduates had departed and the furlough men were away at their homes a new squad of plebes had been admitted to the school and the yearlings mad with joy at being released from plebedom themselves were trying every scheme their fertile brains could devise for making miserable the lives of their successors during the first two weeks that the plebes had been in the academy the opportunities for hazing them had been few but immediately on getting into camp the mischievous lads who had suffered the year before not a few of whom had sworn that nothing in the wide world nothing nothing nothing could tempt them to molest a fourthclass man lost no time in getting after the new stiffs as the plebes were sometimes called at fardale the yearlings were eager to find fags among the plebes and they generally succeeded in inducing the new boys to bring buckets of water sweep the tent floors make beds clean up and do all sorts of work which the older cadets should have done themselves and were supposed to do while the penalty for exacting the performance of any menial or degrading task as well as for hazing was courtmartial and possible dismissal the yearling generally succeeded in getting the work done without giving orders or making demands so the plebes could not say they had been coerced into doing those things against their will each yearling sought to have a particular fag to attend to him and his wishes and no cadet could demand service of another fellows fag without danger of bringing about trouble at first frank had resolved to astonish his companions by attending to his own duties entirely by himself and having no fag but it was shortly after the new boys came to fardale that he saw something that made him change his mind among the plebes was a rather timidlooking redcheeked lad who seemed even further out of his element than did his awkward companions he was shy and retiring blushed easily and at times had trouble in finding his voice such a fellow was certain to attract attention at any school and he was soon singled out as a particular object for chaffing by the yearlings he blushed to the roots of his hair on being called baby mammas boy little tootsywootsy and other names of the sort applied to him by the cadets his real name was fred davis and of the nicknames given him baby seemed to stick the best so it was not long before he came to be known by that almost altogether the officers and instructors being the only ones who did not use it in addressing him at the outset fred was unfortunate in being singled out for guying by hugh bascomb who was a bully by nature and whose ideas of fun were likely to be of a vicious order bascomb saw he could plague davis and he kept at the little fellow piling it on unmercifully in fact he seemed to take a strong dislike to the boy with the pink cheeks whom he derisively designated as the dolly boy and he lost no opportunity to humiliate davis it happened that on a certain occasion bascomb desired that fred should lie for him but to his surprise the timid plebe absolutely and firmly declined to lie i i cant do it sir stammered the little fellow id do it if i could but i cant why not pray fiercely demanded bascomb towering above the shrinking lad and scowling blackly thats what i want to know why not because i promised mother i would not lie and she she has confidence in me oh she she has mocked bascomb you make me sick you do i never took any stock in mamma boys now youre going to do as i want you to or ill make it hot for you i shall not lie sir all right wait till you get into camp oh we wont do a thing to you from that time bascomb did his best to set his companions against davis a fact which frank soon noted knowing that bascomb was at heart a bully frank immediately saw that davis would have a hard life during his first months in the academy franks sympathy went out to the little fellow who had been so tenderly reared that he knew very little of the harsh ways of the world outside his own home he resolved that the little plebe should be given a fair show somehow frank divined that bascomb intended to secure davis for his fag and he resolved to balk the bully in this so it came about that on the day that the plebes marched into camp with their bundles under their arms merriwell found an opportunity to take davis into his tent and instruct him in cleaning shoes and setting things to order fred attended to these things cheerfully never dreaming that they were not a part of his regular duties when he had finished merriwell said that is very satisfactory mr davis immediately after tattoo you may come round and be shown how to make up beds in the meantime if any one else should require you to perform service of a similar nature in any tent other than your own you may inform them that you have already received instructions from me and that the state of your health will prevent you from doing too much labor of the kind do you understand i think so sir very good you may go franks duties kept him very busy during the most of the day he had little time to look after davis and he scarcely gave his fag a thought till after supper when the dusk of evening was settling over the cove and the plebe hotels had been surrounded at various points by mischievous yearlings then he took a fancy to stroll around and see how baby was getting along on his way down the street he passed the tent occupied by bascomb he might have walked on but the low fierce voice of the big cadet caught his ear and he distinctly heard these words whats that you refuse to bring water for me have done this kind of work already for merriwell so corporal merriwell has been compelling a plebe to perform menial services well that might cost him those pretty stripes on his sleeves what do i care for him i want you to bring that water and you will bring it but he told me not to do work of this kind for anybody else but myself came the faltering voice of fred davis oh he did well thats interesting i suppose by that he means to lay claim to you i wonder what lieutenant gordan would say if he knew what one of his particular pets has been up to well see who is best man in this affair bring that water i i dont want to sir well it doesnt make any difference about that youll bring it whether you want to or not if you dont i will what will you do in that case bascomb quietly asked frank as he stepped lightly and quickly into the tent and confronted the big cadet who was towering over fred davis in a threatening attitude bascomb recoiled with a muttered exclamation of dismay chapter xxxviii sport with a plebe merriwell bascombs face showed he was little pleased by the appearance of frank i believe you were about to tell mr davis what you would do in case he declined to bring a bucket of water for you sir said the yearling with chevrons pray proceed this this is an intrusion grated bascomb really so and franks eyebrows were uplifted in mock surprise i presumed i would be welcome to the tent of a classmate well you are not welcome here growled the big fellow what are you going to do about it nothing if you havent the instincts of a gentleman frank interrupted with a laugh really that sounds fine from your lips mr bascomb he exclaimed you were trying to intimidate one smaller and weaker than yourself a moment ago and yet you have the nerve to talk of gentlemanly instincts you seem to be venturing on unfamiliar grounds sir bascomb glared he longed to punch merriwells head but he felt that frank was anxious for him to attempt a move of the sort youre a nice chap to talk of intimidation when you have already forced baby to fag for you he cried hotly i think mr davis will attest that i neither forced him nor asked him to perform any task for me i simply gave him a few instructions that were sure to be of material benefit to him but i heard you demanding service and seeking to compel it with threats you know what the penalty is for such conduct and i suppose you are just the kind of a fellow to blow all right go ahead i scarcely like your tone or your language mr bascomb but i am not going to pick it up here and now however you have accused me of making mr davis a fag i presume you know there is a rule in this school that no man has a right to demand service of another mans fag knowing this you tried to make mr davis perform your duties about the tent werent you treading on rather dangerous ground sir bascomb looked at the floor and muttered something you may not have realized what you were doing merriwell went on in which case you are pardonable to a certain degree but i warn you to let nothing of this kind occur again or you will have the entire camp down on you i know what you mean grated bascomb i am very glad you do came coolly from franks lips i hoped to make my meaning plain and i have something more to say since the arrival of the new boys you have seemed to single mr davis out as an especial object for ridicule and torment i dont know that you have done so because mr davis is small and scarcely a match for you but it looks that way now bascomb if i were in your place i would let up if you persist you are bound to get yourself into serious trouble i am going to see that davis has a fair show and the fellow who crowds him too hard will have some difficulty with me bascomb forced a mocking laugh you seem to fancy you can set yourself up against the whole battalion he sneered i dont believe any plebe ever got through this school without taking his medicine and i scarcely think you will be able to pull this one through that way the fellows are not very fond of pets thats all right the only thing i ask of you is that you let davis alone perhaps i will and perhaps i wont you will if you know what is good for you again the big fellow glared through the gathering darkness but frank met the gaze squarely and bascombs eyes dropped thats all i have to say came quietly from frank you may go now mr davis dont forget you are to receive instructions in making beds after you answer to your name at tattoo no sir i will not forget said the little plebe and making a salute he hurried away glad to escape from bascombs clutches frank stood looking straight at his big classmate who made a pretense of disregarding him you should take warning by what has happened to several of your particular friends bascomb he finally said harkins resigned to escape courtmartial and dismissal gage deserted and ran away and snell has become the most unpopular fellow in the academy and all because all because they ran against you snarled bascomb madly you have had the greatest luck of any fellow i ever saw but there is a turning point somewhere you never miss an opportunity to jump on a fellow and now you are making a statement that you know is absolutely false sir exclaimed merriwell i have never crowded any fellow and i have never lost an opportunity to cover as far as possible and honorable any wrongdoing a fellow cadet may have been led into you may not know that i could have caused snells expulsion in disgrace if i had wished but it is true oh you are very generous exceedingly magnanimous all the matter is people dont know it you are at liberty to think what you like about it i have warned you and you will do well to heed my warning that is all i have to say frank left the tent and continued on his way crowds of cadets gathered here and there near certain plebe hotels told where the yearlings were enjoying sport at the expense of the new boys as frank came near to the first collection the familiar voice of his former tentmate hans dunnerwust attracted his attention forcing his way toward the center of the laughing throng he found hans catechising a tall lank country boy named ephraim gallup who was repeatedly forced to explain that he was from varmont by gum which expression seemed to delight the listening lads more and more with each repetition vere vos dot varmont sir demanded hans with a great show of dignity vos it a cidy alretty yet or vos it a village oh

fingers touching the seams of his trousers and the palms of his hands turned to the front lifted his left foot and scratched his right shin with his heel till a sharp rap on the ankle brought the foot down to the ground again and caused him to brace up stiffly drawling gol darned if i wouldnt be so scat id surrender on ther spot ter ther redheaded gals in bloomers these words do not look very

the boys eyes while several of the others made ephraim submit and stand with his little fingers still glued to the seams of his trousers in a few seconds the boy from vermont was securely blindfolded

mile the grinning yearlings lost no time in slipping quietly away from that locality and taking positions at a distance where they could watch what followed all alone in the street in front of his tent stood the blindfolded plebe bellowing the words at the full capacity of his voice and repeating them over and over in a very few seconds lieutenant gordan the regular army officer at the academy came marching briskly down the street in the dusk his face so red that it almost seemed to glow like a light stopping short in front of the lone plebe he called sir ephraim kept on with an there he saw the boys an gals ez thick ez hasty poodin sir came sharply from the lieutenant ephraim began the stanza over again roaring it louder than before if possible yankee dewdle came to taown long with capn goodwin sir cried lieutenant gordan git aout snorted the boy from vermont im here ter sing an im goin ter fill ther bill by gum then he began at the first of the stanza and howled straight through it for all that the lieutenant spoke to him twice in the dusky shadows not far away the cadets were convulsed with laughter they could not suppress sir thundered lieutenant gordan you are making a fool of yourself ef you dont shut up an stop interruptin me ill be gol darned ef i dont kick you clean inter the middle uv next week you aint ther feller that sot me ter singin fer your voice is of a diffrunt color than his naow you keep mum ur ill take this handkerchief off my eyes spit on my hands an sail right into you by thunder then ephraim began once more yankee dewdle came to taown long with the exasperated lieutenant snatched the handkerchief from ephraims eyes almost bursting with rage if you dont quit this howling ill lodge you in the guardhouse he declared the boy came near smashing the lieutenant with his fist and then seeing who it was he gave a gasp and nearly fainted on the spot wheres them fellers he murmured looking around for his tormentors by gum theyve slipped ive bin fooled after giving him some sharp advice the lieutenant sent him into his tent and departed chapter xxxix an open insult the spirit of mischief seemed to break loose in the camp that night a dozen times were some of the plebes hauled out of bed and slid around the streets enveloped in their own blankets ridden on a tentpole or an old wheelbarrow tossed in tent flies or nearly smothered with smoke that filled their tents from the burning of some vilesmelling stuff time after time was the guard turned out to capture the perpetrators of these tricks but still alarm followed alarm and not one of the jokers was captured every inspection seemed to show the older cadets all in their beds and sleeping with amazing soundness considering the racket that was going on lieutenant gordan was at his wits end for never had there been such an outbreak in camp since his coming to fardale and he began to believe there was something radically wrong about the system as enforced at the academy the professors were driven from their tents and compelled to take refuge in the academy in order to get any sleep and they all felt like resigning their positions and seeking occupations in other walks of life at west point such things were once possible but the introduction of long rows of gas lamps put an end to it by illuminating the camp so that the pranks could not be performed without the greatest danger of detection at fardale the gas lamps were missing and a dark night during the first weeks of each yearly encampment was certain to be a wild night it happened that fred davis had been assigned to guard duty on this particular night and for a long time none of the disturbances took place on his post at length however when things had been quiet for an ominous length of time fred saw three figures coming swiftly toward him through the darkness halt he commanded promptly who comes there the corporal of the guard was the reply given in a muffled tone of voice advance corporal of the guard and give the countersign then followed a suspicious hesitation fred fancied he heard a faint sound in his rear but before he could make a move a blanket was thrown over his head and he was hurled to the ground he struggled with surprising strength but he was helpless in the hands of his assailants his musket had been torn from his hands and he seemed to feel something slitting and tearing his clothing once he was struck or kicked with great violence after a few moments of this treatment davis managed to get his head clear of the enfolding blanket and shout for help his cries produced another alarm in camp and his assailants quickly took to flight leaving him in a badly battered condition fred got upon his feet and was standing dazed and bewildered when the corporal of the guard actually appeared with the guard at his back lieutenant gordan who had been on the alert for another outbreak showed up at the same time but davis was so bewildered that it was several moments before he could answer their questions it was finally found that he had been robbed of his gun his belt slashed and his uniform cut in half a dozen different places so it was quite ruined by this time lieutenant gordan was thoroughly angry and he declared he would give his time and attention during the next week to the discovery and punishment of the perpetrators of the outrage there is going to be an end to this hazing of sentries he asserted somebody shall be made an example of and well see if that will do any good fred was told to go to his tent and get to bed and he was only too glad to do so somehow in the morning the report got around that davis had been stabbed or cut in the attack upon him frank lost no time in investigating finding his fag attending to duties about his own tent in answer to merriwells questions fred said he had not been cut in any way but his clothing had been mutilated and he had been robbed of his gun cartridgebox and bayonetscabbard he showed frank his clothing and the latter was scarcely less indignant than lieutenant gordan had been this is not fun merriwell declared it is malicious and wanton brutality and i fancy i can lay my hands on the fellow who was at the bottom of it the search for freds rifle had proved unsuccessful and so he was given another from the armory while a new uniform was ordered for him lieutenant gordan came around and questioned the unlucky plebe again concerning the assault upon him but it had been too dark for him to recognize any of his assailants and the voice of the fellow who had announced himself as corporal of the guard had been muffled and disguised it now began to appear that the unusual activity during the night had been for the purpose of drawing the attention to the side of the camp opposite davis post so that the attack upon him might be carried out successfully the boys found enough to think of and talk about during such opportunities as were given them at dinner the conversation was almost entirely about the tumultuous events of the night and by keeping eyes and ears open frank sought to discover who knew the most concerning those things which had taken place bascomb seemed in high spirits over and over in a sarcastic way he repeated lieutenant gordans assertion that such actions were outrageous and must be stopped appearing very grave as he did so but winking slyly to some particular friend and frank noted every fellow to whom bascomb winked the big fellow could not keep his bullying propensities suppressed and the sight of fred davis seemed to arouse him singling out the little plebe he took a station at the opposite side of the table observing it is really too bad anybody should haze a pretty boy like him look at the tender blue in his eyes and the delicate pink in his cheeks isnt he just too sweet to live oh the fellows wont do a thing to him here not a thing fred paid no attention to bascomb although the hot blood rushed to his face the bully continued before you gentlemen masticating his rations sits a section edition of the late lamented george washington those who are conversant with history are aware that little george found it impossible to tell a lie evidently baby has heard of george and seeks to emulate the father of his country for he also finds it extremely difficult to tell a lie gentlemen you may at this very moment be regarding a future president of the united states the thought should overcome you with awe bascombs friends snickered and the big yearling proceeded to address himself directly to davis look here baby he said i want you to tell us just what happened to you last night we want to know the exact facts of the case with a trace of spirit davis looked up and asked dont you sir dont i what demanded bascomb harshly dont you know what do you mean by that how should i know i thought you might remember said fred in a low tone that was enough to give the bully his opportunity to rave and bluster that is an insult he fiercely declared glaring at the little plebe as if he longed to devour him such an insinuation is an insult do you mean to say that i had anything to do with the assault upon you i dont mean to say anything more about it oh you dont that is actually an open defiance but i am going to put a question to you and see if you will refuse to answer me what do you know about it i know enough to mind my own business frank laughed softly and it was bascombs turn to flush angrily you are very cool about it grated the bully reaching out and picking up a glass of water perhaps this will make you still cooler he flung the water full and fair into fred davis face chapter xl for the under dog in an instant every lad save davis was on his feet for all knew what naturally followed an act of this sort but the natural order of events did not take place davis slowly and carefully wiped the water from his face with the napkin his hand trembled a little and his cheeks were pale the color having fled from them in a moment frank had taken a quick step forward ready to see fair play although it was generally known that davis was a peaceful sort of a fellow who would not get into trouble if he could avoid it still all expected he would show resentment at this open insult bascomb stood with an insolent sneer on his face waiting as davis made no move he broke into a short laugh theres courage for you gentlemen he said scornfully why the fellow hasnt as much spirit as a dead mouse frank was about to speak when davis slowly rose to his feet i suppose i am expected to fight in a case like this he said his voice shaking some of the cadets who were always eager to see a fight of any sort no matter how unevenly the antagonists might be matched quickly said thats right you must fight i have never done such a thing in my life declared davis but i do feel like it now you have laughed at me because i promised my mother that i would not lie and i will give you a chance to laugh again i promised her i would not fight and i shall keep my word baby boy mammas petsie softie these terms of derision came from several sources and frank was swift to note every one bascomb laughed again you are altogether too good to live baby he said you make me sick frank had kept quiet as long as was possible he saw that davis did not mean to fight and he made a resolve to save the plebe if possible by taking up his quarrel with two swift steps merriwell confronted bascomb sir he said speaking rapidly and in a low tone i have been a witness to this entire affair well sneered the big yearling i want to say that i think davis perfectly right in refusing to fight you you are larger and older than he is you have nearly if not quite twice as much strength as he has and your reputation is that of a slugger he would not stand a show with you and you know it for which reason you have seemed to select him as an object of your bullying attentions frank looked bascomb straight in the eye and the big fellows face grew black with anger what do you want he muttered i want to tell you what i think of you and i am going to do so davis has been reared like a gentleman and it is but natural that he should recoil from contact with such as you do you mean to say i am no gentleman that is exactly what i mean to say sir no gentleman ever plays the bully as you have done bascomb made a move as if he would do something desperate and on the instant two of his particular friends caught hold of him saying hastily not now old man not here it would spoil everything now bascomb was not longing for a fight with merriwell and he would gladly have done something to cause the officers to interfere but to his regret he saw that he had been too slow about it so he sullenly muttered all right fellows i wont smash him here but youll meet him later youll have to eagerly said rupert reynolds a fellow who made a pretension of being sporty and who was a great admirer of gamecocks and prizefighters for which reason he had grown very friendly with the slugger of the academy this affair must be settled in the regular manner i didnt suppose id have to fight the whole academy came sulkily from the bully if every sneak in school had somebody to step in and fight his battles things would soon undergo a change as he said this he cast a contemptuous glance at davis who was looking on in a helpless way you may fight or not as you like said frank serenely but you know what i think of a bully who is too cowardly to tackle a fellow he fears may be his match and then unmindful that bascomb made another move and was held back by his friends frank turned his back and walked round the table to davis come he said we will go there was a murmur of applause when he turned away with davis at his side still frank knew very well that he had taken an unpopular stand by espousing the cause of a plebe who did not seem to have nerve enough to stand up for his own rights and he was breaking all precedent and traditions by a show of friendliness for his own fag however frank was a lad who firmly believed in standing by the right no matter whether the cause were popular or not and his sympathy was invariably with the under dog in the fight he could not bear to see the weak oppressed by the strong his generous heart had gone out to the lad who had been so tenderly and delicately reared and who declined to lie or fight because he had promised his mother he would not do such things somehow davis did not seem at all like a sissyboy to merriwell who believed the plebe had a great deal of moral courage if he were not physically brave and frank had come to believe that moral courage is a higher qualification than physical courage in this world there are two classes of heroes and one class is likely to be grievously misunderstood first comes the physical hero the fellow who defiantly faces dangers that are sufficient to turn to ice the blood of another and yet may succumb to some simple temptation that he knows will lead him into wrongdoing then comes the moral hero who resists the strongest temptations to do wrong who fights and conquers in many a silent battle with his passions and desires who bravely faces ridicule and scorn because he is confident that he is doing right yet who quails cowers trembles and flees in the face of physical danger who will say which is the greater hero as soon as they were in the open air davis turned to merriwell his voice shaking as he said you must not fight with that fellow on my account why not asked frank because you must not it would not be right he is big and strong but i am not afraid of him that may be true and still it is not right for you to fight in my place that will not help me any i can see that i will not be thought any better of if you fight in my place you must not fight him fred was very agitated and excited the matter rests entirely with bascomb now said frank calmly i have expressed my opinion of him in public and i shall be forced to back up my words if he challenges me chapter xli birds of a feather reynolds and bascomb came from dinner arm in arm your time has come to knock out this fellow merriwell hugh declared the big fellows sporty companion youll have to do it it looks that way admitted bascomb but there was something ludicrously dubious in both his face and voice looks that way exclaimed rupert in a fiery manner of course it looks that way theres nothing else to be done and i should think youd be well satisfied with the opportunity but i am not sure i can do it confessed the bully hesitatingly do it why you ought to do it with one hand tied behind your back but bascomb was not so easily reassured i have boxed with him said the big fellow and i know he is not easy fruit for anybody you boxed in the gym yes and there it was necessary to conform to certain rules of course that wasnt much like a genuine fight i know it but i found it impossible to hit him a soaker with my left he is up to all the tricks thats all right fight him in the evening where you are not liable to be interrupted till you have finished him the darkness will be an advantage to you for he cannot see to guard or avoid all your heavy blows and you will soon do him up if you work it right you can get him into a straight fight from start to finish so it will not be a matter of rounds which would accrue to his advantage once you get at him you can follow him up till he is done for reynolds words gave bascomb new courage i dont know but you are right he said the darkness would be to my advantage and i ought to be able to get in a knockout blow sooner or later by jupiter i believe i can polish him off of course you can exclaimed his delighted companion merriwell has put on a big front and succeeded in making everybody believe he is a terror but the time has come to cook his goose give him a good licking and he will not be so high and mighty his popularity will mighty soon begin to wane you do not seem to love him not much the cad has called me down on parade several times me too id like to get a grip on him that would disgrace him and cause his dismissal you are not the first fellow who has thought that way but somehow the cad has the luck to get out of every trap set for him and he turns the tables on anybody who tries to trap him he cant be that lucky always i should hope not shall i act for you bascomb hesitated something told him that frank could fight quite as well with his bare fists as he could box with gloves but how could he retreat if he did not meet merriwell he would be regarded with scorn by every one and like wat snell who had refused to meet bart hodge be ostracised in the school davis ought to fight me first he muttered oh hang that plebe cried reynolds contemptuously he doesnt count with merriwell you can attend to him when you have disposed of merriwell if you go into this business determined to finish the fellow youll be sure to do it knock him out some way fair or foul i suppose a fellow might get at him foul in the dark and not be detected sure only he wants to be slick about it say i can tell you a trick sh dont speak too loud dunnerwust and mulloy are a little distance behind and theyre both particular friends to merriwell so reynolds lowered his voice and talked rapidly to bascomb in a low tone the bully listened eagerly finally slapping his thigh and crying thats the scheme that will do it shall i see him and make arrangements for tonight yes but wait till the last minute take him after supper all right its settled then all settled and merriwell will have a dandy pair of eyes on him tomorrow dunnerwust and mulloy had been watching bascomb and reynolds vot you pelief dose shneaks vos down to aind id asked

belave so it came about that frank was warned that bascomb and reynolds had apparently been plotting frank acted as first sergeant and that very afternoon both bascomb and reynolds appeared in ranks with their belts disarranged this was an open defiance and of course was something merriwell could not overlook fall out bascomb and arrange your belt he commanded sharply you too reynolds you know very well that you have no right in ranks in that shape fall out bascomb and reynolds obeyed in a sullen way the big fellow beginning to mutter merriwell had started back to his post but he whirled sharply saying silence sir this is the third time i have been compelled to warn you against muttering in ranks you will be severely dealt with in case you repeat the offense once more he turned but he had not taken five steps before he heard some one say whos playing the bully now frank turned again but bascomb did not appear to have spoken and reynolds looked innocent having fixed their belts they were again in ranks standing at ease not a word did frank say but his face expressed a great deal no further murmurs were heard and the drill was soon in progress but frank knew his enemies had tried to place him in a false light before the corps chapter xlii the challenge that night immediately after supper rupert reynolds appeared at the door of franks tent mr merriwell said reynolds stiffly i am here in the interest of my friend mr bascomb i presumed as much came quietly from franks lips you have openly insulted mr bascomb and he demands an immediate apology frank whistled is that all he exclaimed with a queer twist of his face and a twinkle in his eyes you will find this a very serious matter sir said reynolds with an assumption of great dignity mr bascomb may also find it serious will you apologize you may tell mr bascomb that i will apologize to him when he is man enough to apologize to fred davis and publicly acknowledge that he treated the little plebe in an unmanly and bullying manner reynolds made a scornful gesture mr bascomb will not do anything of the kind very well i shall not apologize to him then you must fight him i will do so with the greatest of pleasure oh you wont find much fun in it sneered reynolds it isnt going to be that kind of a fight bascomb is thirsting for your life it was with the greatest difficulty i persuaded him not to challenge you to fight a duel with deadly weapons he said he would take satisfaction in meeting you in an affair of honor where he could run a blade through your body or perforate you with a bullet frank whistled again why he has become very courageous since he took to bullying boys he is really bloodthirsty he is determined to square accounts with you sir he says you have been boning military at his expense for some time just to show your authority which he knows is absolutely false frank flashed back i have reprimanded him when compelled to do so by his utter disregard of what is right that may be your opinion mr bascomb thinks differently he demands that this fight take place without delay the sooner the better what do you say to making the time immediately after dark i am agreeable as lieutenant gordan has been watching the old boathouse of late it will be necessary to have the fight take place elsewhere all right it may be stopped if it is anywhere in this vicinity yes black bluff is but a mile away thats all why not go there the place is satisfactory to me then it is settled be on hand with your second as soon as possible after dark i will reynolds walked away with his head held very high and his neck very stiff of course the boys had been expecting frank would receive a challenge and no small number had been watching the two lads immediately on ruperts departure franks friends came swarming around him asking scores of questions pwhat did th by want wid yez frankie asked barney mulloy eagerly oh not much smiled frank who did not believe in letting the entire gathering know exactly what had happened and what was going to take place he informed me that bascomb demands an apology of course i did not apologize which may lead bascomb to challenge me an he didnt challenge yez alridy wurra wurra oi thought there moight be a foight on hand so oi did dots vots der madder mit me sighed hans dunnerwust in disappointment it vos peen so long alretty yet since i haf seen a scrap

chuckled the funloving irish lad mursha wont thot be fun oi dunno oill hiv thim roight away and off he darted as frank expected he found ephraim once more surrounded by a mob who were having sport at his expense fortunately for merriwells scheme the country boy was rather angry and felt more like fighting than doing anything else mr gallup said frank as he forced his way through the throng and confronted the vermonter i am here in behalf of a friend whom you have sorely insulted git aout with yer nonsense retorted ephraim i wish youd quit yer foolin an let a feller alone you will discover this is not fooling sir said frank sternly my friend demands that you fight him immediately will you do it wal i be twisted if i dont snorted ephraim as he spat on his hands and prepared to remove his coat where is ther consarned critter ill bark his nose quickern a brindle caow kin kick over a pail of milk by gum chapter xliii doughty duelist ephraim was in earnest hold on said frank quickly what

to have somebody to look out for you and see that you have fair play by chaowder ephraim gallup kin look aout for hisself an dont you fergit it but it is absolutely necessary that you have a second ill act for mr gallup said sammy smiles he may depend on me to stand behind him as long as he stands in front of me youll do well ez anyboddy all right mr smiles said frank with a wink at sammy come aside and we will make all arrangements it did not take long to make arrangements but as every one who knew about it was anxious to see the fun it was not a little difficult for them all to get out of camp without attracting too much attention there was a strip of woods close by however and the boys succeeded in vanishing into this cover one by one after which they soon hastened to the spot where the encounter between dunnerwust and gallup was to take place the seconds took good care to have the two principals on hand and barney mulloy was there with the old horsepistols which he kept carefully concealed frank took hans aside and said this affair has assumed a much more serious aspect than seemed possible at first vos dot yankee abologized alretty yet asked hans anxiously far from it the dutch boy gave a groan of dismay but stiffened up to say dot seddles his coose i knocks uf him der sduffins oudt but he refused to fight that way and as he is the challenged party i was forced to allow him to select the weapons he chose pistols bistols gasped hans turning pale yes dot vos murter in der virst degree i dont meed dot veller mit bistols but you will have to meet him now if you refuse you will be drummed out of school you will be tarred and feathered bud i dond like dot peesness uf sdanding oop to be shod ad mit a pullet oudt uf a bistol somepody mighd ged hurt aind id oh

oxcuse me now dont show the white feather urged frank that yankee has done this to scare you i dont believe he really thinks you will dare meet him with pistols and so he is going to make a laughing stock of you vos dot his game vell i pets you your life he makes der piggest misdake vot he nefer seen thats the stuff if you brace right up and pretend you are eager to fight with pistols the chances are ten to one hell back down before the word is given to fire vell uf dot veller dond dink i vos apout grazy for dot tuel you can kick me mit der neck in frank saw that he had fixed it all right with hans and he wondered what success sammy smiles was having with his second sammy was not finding it very easy to convince ephraim it was his duty to fight a genuine duel with pistols and he was talking swiftly for it was past sunset and would become dark in a very short time i be hanged ef this air aint ther biggest scrape i was ever in gasped the lank country boy wiping the cold sweat from his forehead i wish id stayed away frum this thunderin skewl an bin contented ter keep right on hoein taturs an cuttin grass daown on dads old farm say aint ther no way this air matter kin be settled up

yankees havent any courage and that youll run oh he has has he grated ephraim bust his skin he doesnt believe youll dare fight him continued sammy concealing a grin with his hand thats what hes counting on if you put on a bold front youll scare him out of his shoes ill bet hell run away before the word is given to fire think so asked the vermonter eagerly do ye really of course look how much more of him there is than there is of you why youd be sure to hit him the first shot while he has not one chance in a hundred of hitting you he has been chuckling over the way your long legs will look when you run away that settles it by the jumping blizzards give me holt of that air hosspistil ill show him whuther a yankeell run ur not by chaowder thats the stuff complimented the delighted sammy reaching up to pat the tall plebe on the back stick to that and you will scare him into convulsions you must look as fierce and desperate as you can so hell think you are thirsting for his gore the preliminaries were soon over and the valiant duelists were placed facing each other at a distance of fifteen paces the old pistols loaded with heavy charges of powder but minus bullets were thrust into their hands chapter xliv a comedy duel both hans and ephraim were ghastly pale the dutch lads teeth were chattering and the yankee boys knees shook beneath him but both tried to put on a bold front are ye ready jintlemin demanded barney mulloy who had been chosen to give the word vait a moment commanded hans waving his hand frantically at barney i vos goin to gif dot feller a shance to

thunderin dark i cant see ter hit ther middle button on the dutchmans coat vos you goin to abologize shouted hans be you goin to run away demanded ephraim uf you dond abologize i voss a dead man cried the dutch lad threateningly ef you dont run away youre a dead man declared the vermonter now it happened that sammy smiles had brought along some stale eggs which he had been keeping for some festive occasion and he had given one of them to frank while they had come to a perfect understanding as to the proper manner and the right moment to use them with the eggs concealed in their hands they were waiting for barney to give the word come come jintlemin called the irish lad sharply take yer positions fer oim goin t give th worrud this is your last chance to run away dutchy faltered ephraim who seemed to be losing confidence dis vos your lasd obbortunity to abologize yankee said hans rather weakly ready to foire at th worrud called barney hans teeth were plainly heard to rattle together like

away pointed the pistols at something and fired bang bang frank and sammy smiles let the eggs fly and the aim of both was accurate sammys egg struck hans behind the right ear and spattered all over the side of the dutch lads head while franks egg landed on ephraims neck i vos a deadt man squawked the dutch lad as he went over in a heap im shot by gum squealed the yankee as his knees collapsed and he measured his long length upon the ground smoke cried barney mulloy grasping his nose with both hands it smells loike yed both been corpuses fer a long toime by jove gasped frank that odor is strong enough to lift a safe the other witnesses of the duel roared with laughter but hans was bellowing and ephraim was groaning so loudly that neither of them heard the sounds of mirth i can feel mein prains runnin all ofer der side uf mein headt howled hans send for a doctor shrieked ephraim im covered with blood my jubilee vein is cut clean in two an ther blood is runnin down my neck i vos dyin ill be dead in a minute sammy smiles held fast to his nose and made haste to bend over his principal whom he pretended to examine bring bandages he shouted help me to stop him from bleeding to death its nary a bit of use groaned the vermonter no feller ever lived with his jubilee vein cut in two merciful goodness cried frank in pretended horror as he hovered over hans also taking care to cling to his nose the whole top of his head is shot away the dutch boy gave a wild despairing wail und you said dot feller vos goin to run avay dunder und blitsens i vos a fool dot i dond run avay meinseluf pefore mein prains he shot oudt never mind said frank you will die like a hero and well bury you with all the honors of war yah snorted hans dot vos nice i dond pelieve i dond care apout dot

pullet id vos fun i am afraid you are not a success as a hero vell i dudder peen a success as a coward und kept avay from dot pullet in the meantime ephraim had recovered from the shock sufficiently to detect the powerful odor of the stale egg that had struck him great gum he gurgled what was that dutchmans pistol loaded with something must have crawled inter ther pesky thing an died there do you really smell anything chuckled sammy smiles do i howled the yankee boy sitting up and gasping for breath i ruther think i do by gum you must be mistaken being seriously wounded you imagine it it is the result of your injury is that so wal he wildly panted if thats ther case i hope ill die soon an git aout of my misery the spectators were convulsed with merriment and ephraim began to smell a rat if indeed it were possible to smell anything but the ancient eggs say he snorted you fellers dont act like there was anybody dyin around here an by chaowder this smell is jest ther same ez i struck when i crawled under dads old barn to find where the speckled hen was layin an crunched up some aigs that hed bin there two or three months ef that dutchman loaded his pistol with a ripe aig an shot

shimminy hans also scrambled up and immediately took to his heels with the tall yankee in hot pursuit leaving the spectators of this ridiculous duel to exhaust themselves with merriment chapter xlv another kind of a fight it had already grown quite dark the fun for the time being was over but there was an engagement of quite a different nature to take place barely had the dutch boy disappeared with the vermonter at his heels when frank and several others of the party slipped away into the shadows and made for black bluff bascomb and a large number of his friends were waiting when frank arrived and merriwell heard the big fellow sneeringly observe he has really come at last i didnt know but he was going to take water i was afraid id lose the satisfaction of giving him the licking he needs frank bit his lip and remained silent bart hodge was on hand and he was quickly at franks side where have you been he asked i was beginning to fear bascomb had put up some kind of a job to keep you away so he could claim you were afraid to meet him i have been acting as second in another affair said frank i want you to represent me in this will you you have no need to ask that for you must know that it will give me pleasure i want to see you give that big brute the drubbing he merits so he will keep still for a while he has been trying to injure you ever since you entered the academy and he has said here tonight that he proposed doing me up to square an old score after he had finished you i tried to get him to take me first for i told him there wouldnt be anything left for me to fight when you were through with him he said he was going to polish you off easily and he has been whispering and laughing with that sneaking reynolds somehow i feel as if they have put up some kind of a job to get the best of you and that is why they feel so well you want to be on your guard for tricks old man i will assured frank as he began to peel for the fight go over and make arrangements with reynolds if you can get him to agree to make it a goasyouplease till the best man whips you will suit me all right ill stand for that away went hodge to consult with reynolds and frank did not dream that he had proposed just the kind of a fight that bascomb and his second most desired the wind was coming in across the bay and the sea was moaning at the ragged base of black bluff on the heights of which the fight was to take place there were scudding clouds in the sky but the night did not promise to be very dark it did not take hodge long to complete arrangements with reynolds and he soon returned to inform frank that it was to be one straight fight from start to finish with no rests till one or the other whipped frank had not supposed there would be near so many spectators present and he well knew that the most of those assembled were fellows who were secretly envious of him because of his popularity although nearly all had made protestations of friendship in the past frank did not care for the friendship of such fellows as there was nothing in the world he despised more than a hypocrite he could respect a foe who was open and frank but he had no use for anybody who wore two faces fred davis had not been told where the fight was to take place but he had scented it in some way and he came panting to the spot just as merriwell and bascomb were about to meet he rushed straight to frank exclaiming you must not fight on my account you shall not you havent any right to do it this must stop here bart said merriwell to hodge speaking quietly and firmly turn this boy over to mulloy and tell him to keep davis from making any fuss but you must listen to me cried the little plebe on the verge of tears people sometimes get killed in fights if you are badly hurt ill never forgive myself cant i do something to stop it why i will apologize to bascomb and that would simply place you more in contempt and would not let me out in the least boy take him away mulloy frank spoke to the irish lad who was now at hand see that he doesnt get into trouble seeing it was impossible to put an end to the contest fred gave up in despair merriwell and bascomb now faced each other there was no demand that they should shake hands and neither offered to do so the boys formed a circle around them and at the word they leaped at each other and the fray had begun bascomb made an effort to clinch immediately but frank landed two blows that sent him staggering this was an advantage which merriwell followed up and bascomb was forced to keep falling back for some moments shifting the battleground considerably from the point where the struggle began spat spat spat sounded the blows but it was not always an easy thing to tell who was getting the worst of it to and fro forward and back moved the fighting lads their movements being breathlessly followed by the spectators sometimes it would seem that one of the lads had the advantage and then it would appear to be the other with his hands clasped together and his heart beating wildly fred davis strained his eyes to see it all to him every moment seemed an hour of acute agony and suspense bart hodge and barney mulloy were both intensely interested and excited but neither of them entertained a doubt but what barring accident frank would come forth the victor the breathing of the fighting boys became short and loud and bascomb occasionally muttered fierce words merriwell fought silently and fiercely at length the tigerish determination of bascombs foe began to drive the big fellow back again several times he clinched frank but his hold was quickly broken on each occasion three times both went down but the strength of neither seemed sufficient to get the advantage and hold the other at length as they were apparently on the point of grappling again bascomb was seen to make a quick move of one hand and frank immediately cried my eyes oh i am blinded they are burning instantly there was the greatest excitement foul play by the eternal skies shouted bart hodge leaping forward instantly someone gave him a blow that sent him reeling howld on ye imps roared barney ye cant play your dirty thricks here keep them away grated bascomb keep them away and ill fix this fellow now frank heard the bullys voice but he could not see bascomb with a cry of unutterable fury merriwell leaped for his foe caught him grappled with him then was seen such a mad struggle as not one of the boys present had ever before witnessed merriwell seemed like a tiger that had been stung to ungovernable rage and bascomb exerted every bit of skill and strength he possessed round and round they whirled away they reeled and then a cry of surprise and horror suddenly broke from the crowd the beginning of the fight had been at a long distance from the brink of the bluff but all at once it was discovered that in the darkness they had shifted about till they were close to the verge and unconsciously they were staggering swiftly to the edge stop them shouted hodge quick or they will go over fred davis leaped forward clutched at the struggling lads but could not hold them in a twinkling they tore away and reeled on others would have interfered but it was too late both hodge and mulloy did their best but bascomb and merriwell escaped their outstretched hands then another cry of horror went up the fighting lads were tottering on the brink they realized their peril at last but before they could make a move to save themselves they went over merciful heaven gasped hodge that is the end of them both chapter xlvi result of the contest for a moment the horrorstricken witnesses stood and stared through the darkness at the place where the foes had disappeared over the brink of the bluff and no one seemed capable of making a move or saying a thing immediately after those bloodchilling words came from the lips of bartley hodge fred davis was the first to recover down upon the ground he flung himself peering over the verge of the bluff and calling frank frank merriwell immediately there was a faint muffled answer from near at hand thank heaven fred almost wept he has not fallen into the sea he is near at hand i can hear him frank where are you here clinging to this vine was the faint reply the thing is giving it will tear away quick grasp my wrists fred saw that the dark form was dangling immediately below and without delay he reached down and found a pair of hands which were clinging madly to a stout vine the vine was really giving way and davis instantly grasped both wrists of the imperiled lad ive got him boys he shouted joyously pull us up pull us up i can hold fast if you pull us up at once he has hold of one of my hands now he will not let go pull us up and he will be saved lay hold here shouted hodge grasping davis by the shoulder down on your faces two of you and clutch merriwell the moment he is lifted far enough for you to grasp him work lively now are you ready all ready came the chorus then hoist away lads and up he comes so with a strong pull the imperiled youth was dragged up over the brink to safety falling prostrate and panting at the feet of his rescuers poor bascomb exclaimed one of the boys i am afraid he is done for not much panted the boy they had just saved but that was a mighty close call whats this shrieked fred davis dropping to his knees and staring into the face of the fellow he had helped to rescue this isnt merriwell its bascomb exclamations of astonishment came from every lip for all had thought they were rescuing frank great jupiter gasped bart hodge it must be that merriwell went clean down the face of the bluff an thot manes he is a dead by declared barney mulloy fred davis quickly leaped to the brink and wildly shouted frank merriwell frank merriwell where are you frank frank no answer save the moaning of the wind and the gurgle of the sea which came up from the base of the bluff like the last strangling sound from the throat of a drowning person he is gone a feeling of unutterable horror came over the little party on the bluff for they all seemed to realize what a terrible thing had happened fred davis fell to sobbing and moaning again and again he sent his voice down the face of the bluff shouting into the darkness that hovered over the surging sea frank merriwell oh frank where are you frank frank a nightbird swept past and answered his shouts with an eerie cry but the voice of frank merriwell did not come up out of the darkness below its no use came hoarsely and hopelessly from the lips of bart hodge merriwell is a goner it was most remarkable that bascomb caught hold of that vine and so escaped fred davis sprang to his feet and rushed at bascomb who was cowering and shivering in the midst of the boys you killed him screamed the little plebe youre responsible for his death it was murder thots roight came from barney mulloy bascomb cowered and retreated before davis all his bullying spirit was gone and he shivered when the little fellow declared it was murder you shall be hanged wildly cried fred shaking his clinched hands in bascombs face i will testify against you you shall be arrested and hanged take him away somebody muttered bascomb hoarsely touch me if you dare defied davis who seemed quite beside himself i have been a coward long enough and i am not afraid of you all now if i hadnt been a coward i should have fought here tonight instead of merriwell and he would be alive now oh ill never forgive myself for letting him fight in my place but ill do my best to avenge ill swear he was murdered thats rot said rupert reynolds rather weakly it was a clean case of accident i am not sure about that came significantly from the lips of bart hodge we all heard merriwell cry out that he had been blinded that meant something there was foul play here and the parties who were in the dirty game must suffer for it faith an thots roight bart me by exclaimed barney mulloy its as clane a lad as iver brathed thot wint over black bluff to his death th noight an somebody will pay dear fer this pace av worruk bascomb still remained silent seeming incapable of offering any defense it is useless to waste any more time here said hodge sharply this awful business must be reported in camp we must get boats from the boathouse and search for merriwells body he started away and the boys began to follow him bascomb stood quite still and saw his late supporters with the exception of reynolds draw away and leave him as if he were some creature to be avoided oh thats the way he grated bitterly theyre afraid they will be mixed in it some way and so they sneak i am left to face the music alone brace up old man urged reynolds you may not be in such a very bad box i dont see how they can do anything but expel you from the academy and it is likely i will have to take the same medicine as i was your second oh youre trying to show a bright side but i tell you reynolds there is something worse than expulsion to follow this what do you mean you heard that plebe davis declare he would charge me with murder sure but hes deranged for the moment he will make the charge just the same and ill have to face it but it cannot be proved against you i am not so sure if i hadnt flung red pepper in merriwells eyes id have a better show now it will look as if i did that to blind him so i might force him over the bluff i dont believe anybody can think you as bad as that you certainly had no desire to do anything more than whip merriwell by some means fair or foul it is easy enough to say that but im afraid it will not be easy to make people believe it i swear reynolds its a terrible thing to have anything like this hanging over a fellow why it has taken all the nerve out of me id give my right hand to see frank merriwell alive and well at this moment dont go to pieces that way bascomb entreated rupert youve got to keep a stiff backbone come lets hurry after the others reynolds got hold of bascombs arm and fairly dragged him after the other lads who were making their way toward camp each step that brought the big fellow nearer camp made him more desperate finally he declared im going to know what hodge and mulloy mean to do then he hastened forward till he came upon bart and barney who were accompanied by fred davis look here fellows said bascomb ive got some questions to ask you well ask them directed hodge shortly as the boys halted and clustered again i want to know if you actually think i am wicked enough to wish to kill a fellow cadet and classmate as fer mesilif oi dunno admitted barney yure a big scoundrel but oi dont loike ter think any fellys villain enough to do murther but it looks mighty black for you bascomb said bart we all heard merriwell cry out that he was blinded and then you seemed to drag him straight for the brink of the bluff it was an accident declared bascomb hoarsely i did not dream we were anywhere near the edge of the bluff it was not accident cried fred davis it was murder and i will swear to it you hear that came huskily from the lips of the accused if you fellows stand by him i am done for well have to be given time to think it over no that is wrong for youll be forced to make some explanation as soon as you get into camp well simply tell the truth that will ruin me which cannot be helped the truth is the only thing that will stand in a case like this all right theres no show for me bascomb turned about in a blind way and reynolds caught him by the arm asking where are you going what are you going to do i dont know was the hopeless reply it doesnt make any difference where i go or what i do now the most of the boys moved toward camp again leaving reynolds talking earnestly with bascomb before the camp was reached reynolds came running and panting after them bascomb has gone crazy he cried he said he was going to kill himself and he broke away from me and ran into the woods it is terrible chapter xlvii alive i dont know but suicide is his easiest way out of this scrape said hodge it is the only way he can escape hanging came from fred davis who seemed to be aroused to a point of relentless hatred for bascomb merciful goodness came faintly from reynolds who seemed to be weakening what a dreadful affair this is id give anything in my power to give if i were well out of it an yed be gittin out chape at thot me hearty declared barney mulloy if id ever dreamed what would come of it horses couldnt have dragged me into the affair almost whimpered reynolds an now yere in it it wont do yez nivver a bit av good to whoine me by all you can do is brace up and face it out said hodge thats what the rest of us will have to do its likely well all be fired from the academy for our shares in the business i wouldnt mind that if it would bring merriwell back all right asserted reynolds and there was a sincere sound in his voice wed all take our medicine without a murmur if it would restore him to life he was the whitest boy that ever breathed i think youre right admitted rupert i dont like him but i presume that was my fault perhaps i was jealous because he was so popular he never did me a mean turn och an he nivver did anybody thot quickly put in barney it wur ivver a good turn av it wur anything at all at all and so talking of franks virtues the boys approached the camp it was decided among them that hodge should report the affair to lieutenant gordan and they should all get into camp without being challenged if possible for this purpose they separated and slipped in one by one by various ways hodge himself found a little difficulty in getting past the sentinel by whom he did not wish to be challenged and taken in custody as there would be a certain amount of red tape business that would delay him from seeking the lieutenant immediately and making his report he finally succeeded in getting into camp and hurried directly to his own tent as he entered he was surprised to see a lamp had been lighted and somebody was wringing out a towel in the waterbucket at the same time having his head and face well swathed with another towel that was dripping wet well who in thunder are you and what are you up to here demanded bart indignantly the fellow with the towel about his head pulled enough of it away from his mouth to reply hello bart i am soaking the red pepper out of my eyes and incidentally bathing my bruises at the same time i couldnt see to guard for all of bascombs blows hodge reeled backward and came near collapsing he caught hold of the tent pole at the front and clung to it for support frank he cried faintly thats my name affirmed the other as he unwound the towel from about his head and looked at bart with a pair of very red eyes you look as if you saw a ghost well i couldnt be more surprised if i saw a whole regiment of ghosts is it really you alive to be sure but but didnt you go over black bluff yes then how do you happen to be here it cant be you fell all the way down into the water and then swam out no then what did happen for mercy sake tell me and relieve me of this suspense why i didnt fall far not more than ten feet i struck on a shelf and lay there stunned and bascomb clung to some vines till we pulled him back to the top of the bluff those vines fell all around the shelf i was on and i was halfcovered with them when i recovered enough to thoroughly realize my position it is likely that while he was clinging to them bascomb partly covered me with them by winding his legs about them thus changing their position after i fell and he covered you so that the vines and the darkness prevented us from seeing you i suppose so but why didnt you answer davis called to you more than twenty times i was stunned and i did not hear him at first when i did hear it was impossible for me to answer although i tried to do so and we went away and left you there yes how did you get off the ledge my strength came to me swiftly when i realized my position as soon as possible realizing i was alone i sought a way to get to the top of the bluff i was successful for i found some clefts in the rock for my feet and aided by the vines i climbed up then i lost little time in getting into camp for i didnt know what sort of a report you fellows would bring i did not expect to reach camp ahead of you but it seems that i did although i had not been in the tent two minutes when you showed up up to this moment hodge had held off as if not quite able to believe it possible frank had escaped now with a cry of joy he sprang forward and embraced his comrade this is the happiest moment of my life frank he declared with tears of joy in his eyes why i was about to report you as dead and start out an expedition to search for your body i couldnt have felt so bad had you been my own brother davis is distracted he has charged bascomb with murder and swears he will stick to it in court mulloy was also inclined to look on it as a case of murder and bascomb became so scared that he ran away while we were returning to camp reynolds said bascomb swore he was going to commit suicide frank straightened up quickly look here hodge he said you must act and you must act swiftly i do not want to go to lieutenant gordan in this condition but you must go to him and tell him that bascomb seems to be out of his head and has run away threatening to kill himself the lieutenant will be sure to send out a detachment to search for the poor fellow if you see mulloy tell him i am all right and get him to keep davis still the plebe mustnt blow the story all over camp let everybody know i am all right as soon as i can soak this red pepper out of my eyes ill be ready to help in the search for bascomb if i am needed go quickly all right im off hodge darted out of the tent and frank wrapped another wet towel about his head and eyes chapter xlviii babys heroism conclusion all night the search for bascomb continued the cadets carrying on the work in relays hodge had convinced lieutenant gordan that bascomb had suddenly become deranged and had succeeded in having the search instituted without telling the real cause of the disappearance the joy of the boys when they knew merriwell was safe in his own tent had been boundless but they were forced to keep it suppressed fearing that too much of a demonstration would arouse suspicion and create an investigation davis wept for joy at first he could not believe such good news could be true and he had rushed straight to the tent where frank was already receiving congratulations you dont know what a terrible load this lifts from my shoulders cried the little plebe in ecstasy nobody shall ever fight for me again i cant lick anybody but i will stand up and take my thumping when it is necessary i am going to write to mother tomorrow that it is absolutely impossible for a fellow to get along here without fighting and i am going to ask her to release me from my promise i wont lie for anybody but i am going to fight when i have to i do not believe you will be forced into many fights when the boys understand you said frank frank reduced the inflammation in his eyes so he was able to take part in the search and he declined to be relieved continuing in his efforts through the entire night near sunrise with a company of plebes under his command he was beating a piece of woods along the bank of a river about four miles from the academy davis was one of the company the little fellow had grown intensely anxious for the quick discovery of bascomb hoping the big bully had done no harm to himself if he should commit suicide id feel that i must be responsible for that said fred you are altogether too conscientious declared frank there are none of us but hope to find bascomb all right but no one save himself will be to blame if he has taken his life birds were singing their morning songs and there was a rosy tinge spreading upward in the eastern sky the breath of the morning was sweet with the perfume of june but the boys heeded none of the beauties of nature around them for they were fearing that at any moment they might come upon some ghastly thing there in the heart of the green woods all at once they did come upon a haggard palefaced lad who was sitting on a fallen tree and seemed to be waiting for them to approach it was bascomb i have dodged searching parties all night and i am not going to run any thus far did bascomb get and then he saw merriwell he stopped and his jaw fell while he shuddered showing the strongest symptoms of terror his eyes bulged from their sockets and the expression on his face was one of unutterable horror bascomb cried frank i am glad i have found you he stepped toward the big fellow but bascomb leaped to his feet shrieking dont touch me you are dead dead go away and then before another word could be said before anybody could do a thing to prevent it bascomb turned and fled through the woods fled as if pursued by fiends shrieking forth his terror after him cried frank dont let him get away he is so scared that he will surely do himself injury if he escapes the pursuit began and merriwell soon found that fred davis was rather fleet of foot in fact fred was able to keep near to franks side it was a wild chase through the strip of woods impelled by terror bascomb ran as he had never run before under ordinary circumstances frank could have overtaken him easily but this was far from an ordinary case at length however frank and fred began to gain on the fugitive casting wild glances over his shoulder bascomb discovered this and his terror knew no bounds he had been running parallel with the river but he suddenly changed his course and made straight for it he is going to try to drown himself cried frank then an accident happened to merriwell he tripped in some underbrush and fell heavily to the ground when he got upon his feet he saw bascomb leap from quite a high bank into a deep part of the river fred davis was not far from bascombs heels and he was stripping off his coat when the big fellow plunged into the water the coat was flung aside in an instant and then frank saw fred boldly plunge into the water after bascomb by jove exclaimed merriwell the little fellow has courage after all he hurried forward and when he reached the bank he saw a struggle taking place in the river bascomb did not want to be rescued made crazy by the horrors he had experienced through the night and by the sight of merriwell whom he believed a ghost he was determined to drown himself in the river three times davis struck at bascombs temple with his clinched fist and he finally landed with sufficient violence to stun the big fellow then with the skill of a veteran lifesaver the little plebe swung the heavy yearling over his back and struck out for the bank swept down stream by the current frank ran along the bank till davis came near enough to be pulled out with his burden and frank dragged both the waterdripping lads to solid ground by gracious davis you have proved your value this morning cried frank as he clung to the panting little plebe bascomb will owe you his life and no one can call you a coward from this time on the other boys came running to the spot breathing heavily and frank soon explained exactly what had taken place they looked at davis with increased respect and one of them proposed three cheers for baby which were given with a will the sound of the cheering seemed to arouse bascomb he opened his eyes and the first person he saw was frank with a moan and a shudder he covered his eyes with his hands gasping take him away dont let him touch me you have no reason to be afraid of me assured frank quietly i am no ghost i am alive and well no no it cannot be it is the truth i did not go to my death over black bluff as you thought i did fall but i was saved by a rocky shelf then frank slowly and distinctly explained everything finally convincing bascomb that it was really true the horrors of the night he had spent alone in the woods overcame bascomb so that he was quite prostrated having to remain in hospital several days and barely escaping a fever but he was very happy to know that frank still lived and this happiness led to his quick recovery as for frank although bascomb had played a most contemptible trick on him in flinging the red pepper in his eyes he knew the bully had been punished quite enough and he decided to let the matter drop as it was there were many other matters to claim his attention some of which will be related in the next volume of this series entitled frank merriwells foes the report of davis exploit in rescuing bascomb became generally known and instead of being called a coward fred was regarded as something of a hero the boys thought him peculiar but there were not a few who came to uphold him in refusing to fight when he had given his mother his word that he would do nothing of the kind from the time that he dragged bascomb out of the river he had very little trouble in the school and there were ever dozens of champions ready to fight his battles when he did find it necessary to fight but frank had been first to defend the little fellow and there never came a time when fred did not think frank the noblest and bravest lad in all the world
