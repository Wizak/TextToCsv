 chapter one the return of the jackal the summer night was hot in baltimore in the amusement park the music from the different attractions was loud and peoples faces and necks shone with sweat under the colored lights a thin middleaged man a walking stick gripped in his right hand limped through the crowds his name was alexander conklin and he had once been an officer in the central intelligence agency he was at this moment very anxious he did not wish to be in this place at this time suddenly he stopped in shock his eyes on a tall man about his own age morris panov was walking toward him why what had happened conklin looked around in every direction knowing that he and panov were being watched it was too late to stop the psychiatrist from entering the center of the meeting ground but it might not be too late to get them both out conklin moved quickly forward limping and swinging his walking stick against the crowd hitting knees and pushing it at stomachs until people shouted and moved angrily away he then rushed forward and shouted into panovs face through the noise of the crowd what the hell are you doing here the same as i think you are david or should i say jason thats what the message said its a trap there was a scream that was louder than the angry crowd both conklin and panov immediately looked around only meters away a woman had been shot in the throat the crowd went crazy conklin turned trying to see where the shot had come from but saw only moving figures he took hold of panov and pulled him through the screaming frightened bodies toward the far end of the park my god shouted panov was that meant for one of us maybe maybe not replied conklin breathlessly as the sound of police whistles was heard in the distance you said it was a trap because we both got a crazy message from david using a name he hasnt used in five years jason bourne and if im not mistaken your message said that under no condition should we call his house thats right its a trap you move better than i do so get out of here run and find a telephone call his house tell david to take marie and the children and get out of there what somebody found us somebody looking for jason bourne do you know what youre saying alex youre damned right i do its carlos carlos the jackal now get out of here and dont go home take a room at the brookshire hotel in baltimore under the name of morris phillip morris ill meet you there later now hurry the car raced south down a quiet road through the hills of new hampshire the driver was a tall man with a strong face and a look of anger in his eyes beside him sat his attractive wife holding a baby of eight months in the back seat was another child a boy of five asleep under a blanket the father was david webb a university professor but once part of medusa where he was known as jason bourne the assassin we knew it had to happen said marie st jacques webb it was just a question of time its crazy webb said quietly everythings buried top secret how did anybody find alex and mo alex doesnt know but hell start looking theres no one better than alex you said that yourself hes marked now hes a dead man said webb its too soon to say that david hes the best there ever was those were your words yes he may live but not mo theyll take him and fill him up with drugs until he tells them about his whole life then theyll kill him and come after me after us which is why you and the kids are going to the caribbean ill send them dear not me stop it we agreed when jamie was born thats why we gave the money to your brother we now own half of a hotel down a dirt road on an almost unknown island marie looked at her husband and what she saw frightened her more than the thought of the jackal she was not looking at david webb the quiet university professor she was staring at a man they both thought had disappeared from their lives forever alexander conklin limped into the conference room at the central intelligence agency in langley virginia he stood facing a long table large enough to seat thirty people but instead there were only three one was peter holland the grayhaired dci director of central intelligence on each side of him sat casset and valentino his two deputy directors all of them had worked with conklin they knew him well and trusted him as he did them but none appeared pleased to see him the greetings were short and instead of taking a seat near the dci conklin pulled out a chair at the far end of the table and sat down now that weve said hello can we get to the point gentlemen thats not a very polite or friendly way to begin mr conklin said the director just tell me why top secret information that puts a number of lives at risk was released that couldnt happen alex and you know it said casset i dont know it and it did happen a man who is owed more by this country than can ever be repaid is running in terror with his wife and children some of the information in that file was passed on and it worries me deeply because my name is there mine and dr morris panovs we were the only two people known to be close to jason bourne if anybody wants any part of that file it has to be approved by the top level here in langley thats you gentlemen and then i have to be contacted and approve it or if im dead morris panov no one knows the rules better because i wrote them with the full authority of the president of the united states thats a very high level mr conklin said the director yes and if i dont get some answers ill take this straight to the white house and see what they think the two deputy directors started talking at once but holland held up his hand for silence he picked up the telephone on the table please ask mr desole to come to the conference room he said yes i remember desole conklin said he knows everything but if he cant pass it on he says nothing he doesnt lie there was a knock on the door and a middleaged man with glasses walked into the room he crossed to conklins chair good to see you again its been two or three years now more like four steve replied conklin shaking hands hows the keeper of the keys oh its all done by computer now i dont go on foreign trips with an armed guard any more sit down mr desole said the director at this end of the table so alex can study us as we explain to him this morning i received a phone call from edward mcallister chairman of the national security agency mcallister was with you in hong kong mr conklin wasnt he yes he was shot and wounded so badly that he almost died he didnt tell me that but he did say i should give our meeting with you top priority he also told me about the file you are talking about and its level of secrecy i gave this information to mr desole so ill let him tell you what he has learned it hasnt been touched alex said desole quietly its been unopened for four years five months and twentyone days so what happened said conklin softly we have to look elsewhere said the dci but theres another thing most of the information about bourne is still secret even from us i dont want to start opening files that were closed by the white house but theres little we can do to help if were completely uninformed conklin looked at each man trying to come to a difficult decision where do i begin he said with this meeting suggested the director why did you arrange it conklin looked down at the table for a moment then lifted his head a woman was killed last night in an amusement park in baltimore i read about it in the newspaper this morning said desole were you involved asked the director i was there morris panov and i we both received messages from jason bourne asking us to come to the amusement park at ninethirty last night when i saw panov i knew something was wrong so i got him out but that poor woman was killed what do you think of it all asked valentino i just dont know val it was a trap but what kind of trap if the intention was to kill me or panov how could a hired gunman miss at that distance thats if my thinking is right right mr conklin said the dci meaning the assassin carlos the jackal carlos said desole what does he have to do with it jason bourne answered casset bourne was a violent criminal who was killed in the far east five years ago but alex talks as if he was still alive i think you should start at the beginning mr conklin said the director who is jason bourne as the world knew him a man who never existed replied conklin lets start by going back a number of years to the war in vietnam chapter two snake lady a gray pontiac with a cia driver picked webb up at washington national airport and drove him into virginia the car turned into the drive of an expensive garden apartment complex the guard obviously recognized the driver and waved him through as the heavy bar across the entrance was raised only then did the driver speak directly to webb this place is agency property sir you couldnt be safer the driver pulled up outside a white twofloor villa as webb left the car and walked up the steps the door opened how do you like my temporary home said conklin too neat and clean for you webb said they went inside and sat down ive sent mane and the kids off south a long way south webb said i hired a rockwell jet out of logan airport they took off early this morning and ive taken a suite at the mayflower hotel thats good conklin said but we have no information on how he found us ive thought about it webb said it has to be hong kong some people knew and hes made one of them talk somehow conklin thought for a moment its possible he said yes but it doesnt matter hes coming after me thats the important thing i have to go after him hes trying to pull me out so i have to pull him out first and well do it according to your teaching what do you mean asked conklin you once said that in order to set a trap you have to use a large part of the truth even a dangerous amount yes i think i said that once whats the relevance here medusa said webb quietly i want to use medusa now you are out of your mind responded conklin that name is as secret as yours is in fact much more so snake lady webb said quietly thats the key isnt it you remembered just this morning replied webb when marie and the kids were in the air suddenly my mind went back to vietnam every officer in command headquarters who was connected to medusa got himself a tattoo on the inside of his arm yes a woman with snakes for hair you refused to have one but the others were like kids with a secret code they werent kids alex more than a few millionaires were made in command saigon the real kids were being wounded and killed in the jungles while a lot of officers in the south opened swiss bank accounts careful david you could be speaking of some very important people in our government who are they asked webb quietly ive got some ideas but no proof just possibilities based on the way they live on property they shouldnt be able to afford or positions that are a long way above their talents youre describing a network said webb his voice hard make a list alex what the hell has any of this to do with carlos lets say you find three or four names we apply pressure we give them a message a former medusan has had a mental breakdown and hes going to tell everything hes got the information names crimes the numbers of secret swiss bank accounts everything then word is passed on that theres somebody who wants this dangerous man more than they do carlos the jackal said conklin softly and then word gets out calling for a meeting between carloss people and the medusans to discuss assassinating the man the medusans cant come after you themselves because of their high official positions but they can find out your identity and carlos wont suspect them because whoever meets with his messengers has to be a real person in a high position i hear a man from the past a man who never was oh he was alex and now jason bourne is back the senator swore out loud as he turned off the shower and walked to the phone on the wall this is armbruster he said what is it snake lady senator oh my god armbrusters voice was a sudden cry of panic on the other end of the line conklin smiled then the senator controlled himself i have no idea what youre talking about whats a snake whateveritis ive never heard of it well hear it now mr medusa somebodys got it all everything dates stolen war supplies swiss banks youre not making sense youre talking garbage and youre on the list senator that man must have spent fifteen years putting it together and now he wants payment for all that work or he tells everything who who is he for gods sake were working on it stay tight well be back in touch as armbruster hung up the phone he stared at the small ugly tattoo on the underside of his arm over in virginia alex conklin studied his list and made a mark after the name of albert armbruster after another call he added a mark to that of general norman swayne chief of military purchasing at the pentagon he called a senior advisor to the president who had no idea what he was talking about so conklin crossed out his name he then called phillip atkinson ambassador to great britain on a very secure line conklin was a skilled professional he let his words lead to other words encouraging atkinson to talk at the end of the conversation he also had the names of james teagarten commander of nato and jonathan jack burton chairman of the joint chiefs of staff snake lady medusa a network in a hotel suite on the third floor of bostons ritzcarlton hotel a very tall man in a wellcut suit came rushing out of the bedroom and answered the door come in quickly did you bring the information oh yes yes answered the visitor a thin older man in a very old suit how grand you look randolph he continued and how grand this place is so suitable for such a famous professor the information please insisted dr randolph gates harvard professor expert in company law and highly paid consultant to numerous industries oh give me a moment my old friend its been a long time since ive been near a hotel suite i certainly havent stayed in one how things have changed for us over the years i read about you frequently and ive watched you on television you could have been in the same position you know interrupted the impatient gates you were a respected judge unfortunately you didnt play by the rules there are lots of rules i just chose the wrong ones i havent time to talk about that the information please oh yes of course well first the money was delivered to me i reached the engineer at the telephone company who was very happy at your excuse me my generosity i then took the information he gave me to that private detective please interrupted the famous professor of law what did the man find out well he worked at a very high hourly rate i mean i had to use some of my own fee to pay him so i think we should discuss an adjustment dont you who the hell do you think you are i sent you dollars for the telephone man and for the private detective he does good work do we discuss my fee or do i leave they discussed the fee at the end of an angry conversation the former judge had the promise of a check for fifteen thousand dollars and gates had the information that a woman with a fiveyearold child and a baby had flown out of bostons logan airport the jet they used was on government business under maximum security its destination was blackburne airport on the caribbean island of montserrat he also learned that marie st jacquess brother johnny owned a hotel on the island of tranquility not far from montserrat after his visitor left gates made a call to paris an hour later brendan prefontaine former high court judge walked out of the boston five bank with dollars in his pocket it was an exciting experience for a man who had lived with very little money for the past thirty years since his release from prison he had rarely had more than fifty dollars on his person this was a very special day but it was more than very special it was also very disturbing because he had never thought for a minute that randolph gates would pay him anything near the amount he demanded gates had made an enormous error in doing so because he had crossed the line from nasty and greedy to possibly dangerous prefontaine had no idea who the woman and the children were or what their relationship was to randolph gates but he knew that gates intended to harm them it might therefore be profitable for prefontaine to find out a little more today might become tomorrow if he flew to the island of montserrat and began asking questions besides thought the judge he had not had a vacation in years the air france steward rolled the wheelchair slowly toward the jet in pariss orly airport the thin woman in the chair was elderly and an equally elderly man walked beside her he is here captain announced the steward at the aircrafts entrance the captain reached for the womans hand and touched it to his lips then stood straight and shook hands with the old man it is an honor sir said the captain in his native language if theres anything the crew and i can do to make the flight more comfortable for you please dont hesitate to ask you are very kind we are all in your debt all of france it was nothing really later as he sat in his seat drinking wine the old hero of france whose only heroics in world war ii were based on theft and survival reached into his pocket for his papers the passport had his picture on it but that was the only thing he recognized the rest name date and place of birth occupation were all unfamiliar and the attached list of honors was impressive he had been assured that the individual originally possessing the name had no living relatives few friends and had disappeared from his apartment in marseilles supposedly on a world trip from which he was unlikely to return the old man looked at the name he must remember it and respond whenever it was spoken it should not be difficult because it was such a common name and so he repeated it silently to himself again and again jean pierre fontaine jean pierre fontaine jean pierre chapter three the tranquility hotel i talked to marie said conklin from the agency house in virginia how is she and the children asked bourne at a gas station pay phone on the outskirts of manassas in the same state theyre all fine theyre at the hotel she wanted to hear about you i said you were safe and told her not to worry thanks for that they should be safe at the hotel its on the beach the only way to get there except by water is up a dirt road everything is flown in by plane or brought over by boat and the beach is guarded she said johnny isnt taking any chances its why i sent them down there ill call her later did you go to see armbruster conklin asked yes you told him to expect cobra and i said i was cobra and he never questioned it of course i know enough about the old days in saigon and some of the other people in medusa so he believed i was on the inside so did you learn anything well hes rich he talked about having a hundred million dollars in zurich he regularly gets a list of the companies theyre taking control of he said that in six months we would have all the controls we needed in europe alex what are we dealing with there was silence on the line and jason bourne did not interrupt david webb wanted to shout out in anger and confusion but there was no point webb did not matter finally conklin spoke i think were dealing with something we cant handle he said softly this information has to go to peter holland david we cant keep it to ourselves god damn you youre not talking to david bourne did not raise his voice in anger he did not have to his tone was enough this isnt going anywhere unless or until i say it does and i may not ever say it understand me alex i dont owe anybody anything especially not the important people in the city they gave my wife and me too much trouble dont stand in my way dont for gods sake i hear you said conklin i dont know whether im hearing david or jason bourne but i hear you but we have to move fast and im talking to bourne now whats next where are you about ten kilometers from general swaynes house replied bourne breathing deeply ill get there while its light so i can see what its like from the road then after dark ill pay him a surprise visit be careful he may have alarms and dogs things like that im prepared said jason bourne i did some shopping the tranquility hotel had been cut out of three rocky hills above a long beach two rows of villas with balconies extended from each side of a large circular building of heavy stone and thick glass the villas were connected by a path bordered by bushes and low lamps waiters wheeled roomservice tables along the path delivering food and drinks to tranquilitys guests most of whom now sat on their balconies enjoying the end of the caribbean day and as darkness fell other people quietly appeared on the beach these were the armed guards each dressed in a dark brown tropical uniform and with a mac machine pistol on his waist on the opposite side of each jacket and hooked to the cloth was a pair of zeiss ikon x binoculars continually used to look out into the darkness on the large circular balcony of the villa nearest the main building an elderly woman sat in a wheelchair drinking a glass of white wine she heard the voice of her husband talking with the nurse inside then the sound of his quiet footsteps as he walked out to join her i cant believe we are living in this place she said neither can i the telephone inside the villa rang he turned the nurse will get it he said shes strange added the old woman i dont trust her she works for our employer really yes she will pass on his instructions the uniformed nurse appeared in the doorway sir that was paris she turned and signaled for him to follow then crossed the room and unlocked the drawer of a table he walked over to her and glanced down at what was in the drawer side by side were a pair of surgical gloves a handgun with a silencer attached to the barrel and a straight razor these are your tools said the woman handing him the key and your targets are in the last villa on this row you must make yourself familiar with the area by taking long walks on the path as old men do for their health and you must kill them you will do this wearing the gloves and firing the gun into each head then each throat must be cut mother of god the childrens those are the orders the orders are disgusting do you wish me to pass that on to our employer fontaine looked over at the balcony door at his wife in the wheelchair no no of course not when must this be done within the next thirtysix hours then what you may stay here until your wife dies brendan patrick prefontaine was again astonished though he had no reservation the front desk of the tranquility hotel treated him like a very important visitor then only moments after he had booked himself into a villa told him that he already had a villa and asked how the flight from paris was eventually the misunderstanding became clear and the former judge from boston was taken to a lovely small house overlooking the caribbean when he was settled his casual clothes in the closet the craziness continued a bottle of wine some freshcut flowers and a box of belgian chocolates arrived a little later a confused roomservice waiter returned to remove the chocolates apologizing for the fact that they were for another villa the waiter was followed by the assistant manager a mr pritchard who explained that the problem was caused by the similarity between his name prefontaine and that of an important guest from paris a mr fontaine the judge accepted his apology although he would rather have had the chocolates chapter four the farm darkness had fallen on manassas as bourne crept through the woods around general norman swaynes farm he reached a fence high with thick crossed wire bourne wondered why a general who worked in an office would build something so expensive around a farm it was not designed to keep animals in but to keep people out bourne knew there would be no electric alarms because the animals and birds would set them off repeatedly he pulled his small wire cutters out of his back pocket and started to work on the wire with each cut he again understood confirmed by his heavy breathing and the sweat on his face that he was now past fifty and his body knew it it was something not to think about because there were marie and the children and there was nothing he couldnt do if he wanted to david webb had gone from his mind only the hunter jason bourne remained he was through he gripped the fence and pulled the opening toward him then crawled inside he stood up listening his eyes moving in every direction he saw through the branches of the trees the lights of the large house slowly he made his way toward what he knew was the circular drive then reaching the edge of the road he lay flat under a tree collecting his thoughts and his breath as he studied the scene in front of him suddenly there was a flash of light on his far right a door had been opened it belonged to a smaller separate house a log cabin two men and a woman came out and were talking no they were not just talking they were arguing heatedly bourne took the binoculars out of his pocket and put them up to his eyes he studied the three people knowing that the mediumsized protesting man was the pentagons general swayne and the woman with dark hair was his wife but what fascinated him was the tall overweight man nearest the door he knew him he could not remember from where or when which was certainly not unusual because his memory often failed him but he knew that he hated him and that was not usual he could not explain it because no connection came to him where were the images the brief flashes from the past that often filled his mind they did not come he only knew that the man he saw through his binoculars was his enemy then that huge man did a strange thing he put his large left arm around the shoulders of swaynes wife his right arm waving in the air as he shouted at the general swayne turned around and walked across to his house the large man released the generals wife and spoke to her she nodded touched her lips against his and ran after her husband the other man walked back into the cabin and closed the door removing the light bourne knew that he had to reach the man who had been part of his forgotten past he slowly got to his feet and moving from one tree to another made his way toward the cabin he stopped dropping to the ground when he heard the sound of wheels within seconds he saw a small strangely shaped vehicle like a threewheeled golf cart racing out of the shadows of the circular drive it seemed designed for both high speed and balance and thick glass surrounded the driver on all sides glass that bourne knew would stop a bullet then a second threewheeled cart came out of the shadows behind the cabin it stopped only meters from the first one and these words came from an unseen speaker secure the gates release the dogs and continue your rounds the carts swung away in opposite directions and bourne reached into his back pocket and pulled out his dart gun if the dogs hunted together he would have no choice he would have to climb the fence the gun could stop two animals not more there would be no time to reload suddenly a large black dog raced past on the drive it didnt slow down as it passed him it didnt pick up the human smell it was on its way somewhere then another dog appeared this one longhaired it did slow down but as if it was trained to halt at a specific area standing motionless bourne understood these were trained male attack dogs each with its own territory it was a practice used by landowners in the far east vietnam medusa it was coming back to him halfremembered images a young powerful man in uniform that same man older larger had been in the viewfinder of his binoculars only moments ago and years ago that same man had promised supplies and brought nothing bourne remembered taking his gun out and pushing the barrel against the mans forehead one more word and youre dead sergeant the man had been a sergeant you bring us supplies by five oclock tomorrow morning or ill get to saigon and personally blow your head off they got the supplies bournes thoughts came back to the present the longhaired attack dog was suddenly circling in the road its nose picking up the human smell within seconds it found the right direction and ran through the bushes its teeth white in the darkness bourne moved back to the fence raising the dart gun with his right hand his left arm bent and extended the angry animal jumped bourne fired first one dart and then the other as the darts struck the dog bourne wrapped his arm around its head pulling the head to one side while swinging his right knee up into the animals body to push away the sharpnailed feet it was finished in moments moments of quietening anger until the dog fell asleep in bournes arms he lowered it to the ground and once again waited afraid to move until he knew that none of the other animals had heard there was no sound from them but bourne heard one of the carts approaching it stopped near the front gate the driver opened the door and began to throw pieces of food to the black dog bourne knew that he had to stop the cart and force the driver outside without giving him any reason to use his radio to call for help he looked at the sleeping dog at his feet place it in the road no the driver might assume it had been shot from the other side of the fence and call the house what could he do he looked around and saw a fallen branch on the ground he crossed quickly to it and pulled it toward the drive to lay it across the drive might appear too obvious a trap but partially on the road might work the grounds were neat and the guards under the big mans command would want to avoid criticism bourne swung the branch around and pushed it around two meters into the road he heard the door of the cart shut the vehicle rolled forward gathering speed as bourne raced back into the darkness of the tree the drivers single headlight lit up the branch on the road he slowed down and approached it cautiously as if he were unsure what it was then he stopped opened his door stepped out on the drive and walked around the front of the cart big rex youre one bad dog said the driver in a quiet very southern voice what did you pull out of there you stupid animal rex rex you come here stay completely still and put your arms out in front of you said jason bourne walking into view my god who are you somebody who doesnt give a damn whether you live or die said bourne half an hour later with all six attack dogs drugged and carried to their sleeping place bourne opened the entrance gate and let the two guards leave by now they believed that he was working for a higher authority and he had also given them each three hundred dollars they knew he was not a terrorist because they were still alive and they were happy enough to walk off down the road bourne used one of the carts to drive most of the way to the cabin then crept forward and looked through the window the huge sergeant was sitting in an armchair watching television bourne walked around the cabin to the front door he knocked with his left hand in his right was an automatic its open rachel shouted the voice from within bourne twisted the handle and pushed the door back he walked inside no roared the sergeant pushing his great body out of the chair you youre a ghost youre dead try again said jason bourne of medusa the names flanagan isnt it thats what comes to mind youre dead repeated the generals assistant screaming his eyes wide in panic you were killed in hong kong four five years ago you checked we know i know youve got connections in the right places then youre bourne i dont believe this youre the one swayne called cobra i know its confusing youre one of us how did you get in here where are the guards the dogs where are they the dogs are asleep drugged and i sent the guards home suddenly in the distance there was a gunshot bourne spun around then kept turning all the way around the huge sergeant was jumping at him his big hands sliding over bournes shoulders bourne kicked with his right foot catching the sergeants side while he crashed the barrel of the automatic into the base of the mans neck flanagan fell forward onto the floor and bourne hammered his foot into the mans head stunning him into silence a silence that was broken by the continuous screams of a woman racing outside toward the door of the cabin within seconds general norman swaynes wife burst into the room stepping back at the sight in front of her gripping the back of the nearest chair unable to contain her panic hes dead she screamed falling to the floor and reaching for her lover he shot himself eddie he killed himself jason bourne walked to the door of the strange cabin that held so many secrets watching his two prisoners he closed it the woman cried but they were not tears of sorrow only fear the sergeant shook his head raising it his expression a mixture of anger and puzzlement an hour later alex conklin sat back in his chair the phone in his hand shocked by jason bournes astonishing information so where are flanagan and swaynes wife now he said gone i let them go theyd told me everything they knew now youve got to make sure that no one finds out all right all right theres a doctor in falls church that weve used before in special operations ill contact him ill also get somebody to take away the dogs open the gates ok said bourne now put me on tape ill tell you everything flanagan told me hurry ive got a lot to do youre on tape reading from the list he had written down bourne spoke quickly there were the names of seven frequent guests at the generals dinner parties then came the license plates from much more serious twicemonthly meetings last was the unlisted telephone number in new york that flanagan had to call in an emergency there was no name only a machine that took messages that has to be priority one alex well find out whose number it is said conklin the licenses are no problem and ill have casset run the names through the computers without telling desole and swayne weve got to keep the death quiet until we find out who they all are and we can start a wave of fear rolling then we suggest the carlos solution i dont know i can fool the doctor for a day or two but after that hell want somebody higher than me to approve it maybe we should tell peter holland and ask him to approve the delay no said bourne give me two days get me two days within an hour dr ivan jax arrived at the swaynes house he turned off the engine grabbed his medical bag and got out of the car im your doctor he said walking up the steps our friend didnt give your name but i guess im not supposed to have it i guess not agreed bourne extending a hand in a surgical glove as jax approached they entered the house and bourne watched while the doctor quickly expertly worked on the body mercifully wrapping the head in bandages without explaining he cut away parts of the generals clothing examining those parts of the body beneath the fabric finally he carefully rolled the body off the chair and onto the floor are you finished in here he asked looking at bourne ive searched the room doctor if thats what you mean yes i want this room locked up no one must enter it after we leave until our friend says they can i certainly cant guarantee that said bourne then hell have to why your general didnt kill himself he was murdered bourne called conklin the woman said alex conklin from everything you told me it had to be swaynes wife my god it doesnt change anything but it looks that way agreed bourne but if she did kill her husband she didnt tell flanagan and that doesnt make sense no it doesnt conklin paused then spoke quickly let me talk to ivan the doctor hes gone he put the body into his car and left a few minutes ago he said hed call you later and explain he wants to get out of here and no ones to come into this room after i leave until you inform the police ive got to find a way of keeping everybody away from there its almost impossible its perfect our little game will start here bourne hung up the telephone then turned and glanced around the generals study since flanagan and rachel swayne had left almost three hours ago he had searched every part of it as well as the dead guards separate bedroom on the second floor he had placed the items he intended to take on the coffee table he studied them now there were three small notebooks all the same size the first was an appointments book the second a personal telephone book the last was a diary with these were a few notes that swayne had written and his wallet it seemed bourne had found nothing very useful nothing that connected with the modern medusa so he started searching the room again this time taking more time fourteen minutes later he came to the window and found it was covered with spots of blood not only that but it was open just a little but open bourne looked closely and saw what kept it from closing the end of the left curtain had been pulled out and was now stuck beneath the lower frame bourne stepped back puzzled but not really surprised this was what he had been looking for the missing piece in the complex puzzle that was the death of norman swayne somebody had climbed out that window after the shot that had blown the generals head apart somebody who knew the house and the grounds and the dogs a killer from medusa who who had been here flanagan swaynes wife they would know they had to know bourne picked up the telephone on the desk yes answered conklin it wasnt swaynes wife it was somebody from medusa who left by the window but flanagan and swaynes wife must have known who was here pick them up and hold them they lied to me sorry i cant do that theyve disappeared thats crazy if i know you youve had them followed since they left here electronically not physically they booked seats on the ten pm flight to london london interrupted bourne they told me they were going the other way to the pacific to hawaii thats probably where they are going because they didnt check in for the london flight we need to bring in peter holland no not yet give me the two days alex please ill do the best i can chapter five the storm the old man now known as jean pierre fontaine cried silently as he knelt beside the bed his face close to his wifes his tears falling on the cold flesh of her arm she was dead and the note by her white hand said it all now we are both free my love they were both free she from the terrible pain he from the price demanded by the jackal for the comfort of her last days he had known for months that his wife had pills which would end her life quickly if the pain became too great he had frequently searched for them but he had never found them there was a small box beside the bed and it was empty footsteps the nurse she had come out of her room but she must not see his wife lying dead fontaine pushed himself up from the bed wiped his eyes and hurried to the door the nurse stood just outside her arm raised to knock sir you surprised me jean pierre stepped out quickly closing the door behind him regine is finally asleep he whispered this terrible storm has kept her up for most of the night to business said the nurse walking away from the door are you prepared it will be a matter of minutes replied fontaine heading for the table where his killing equipment lay in the locked drawer there is a slight change in the course of action oh the old frenchman said at my age changes are not welcome these are orders from paris do you wish to question them no fontaine shook his head so listen there will be a fire in villa fourteen three away from ours there will no doubt be a great deal of confusion with the storm and everybody shouting and calling for help that will be your signal use the confusion get through and kill the woman and her children but dont go immediately it will take me some time five minutes maybe twenty to do what i have to do wait until i return to villa eleven before you leave may i ask it will take you five minutes maybe twenty to do what youre a fool old man what must be done of course the nurse pulled her raincoat around her and walked to the front door of the villa get your equipment together and be out of here in three minutes she commanded the door swung back with the wind as the woman opened it she went outside into the heavy rain pulling it shut behind her astonished and confused the old frenchman stood still trying to make sense of what was happening the nurse was also a killer so why had he been sent thousands of kilometers to do the work that another person could do just as well and without the pretence of his arrival fontaine walked rapidly to the nurses bedroom door and opened it he began to pull apart the womans room suitcase closet clothes bed dressing table writing desk the desk the drawer was locked a heavy lamp sat on the desk a thick metal base he picked it up pulling out the cord and hit the drawer hard he pulled it open and stared in horror at what he saw next to each other in a plastic case were two hypodermic needles they were filled with yellowish liquid he did not need to know the chemicals liquid death in the veins nor did he have to be told for whom they were intended he pictured the two bodies beside each other in bed it would have looked as if he and his wife had decided to die together how thoroughly the jackal had planned everything but this wasnt the contract that the old man had with his employer his wife was supposed to die naturally when her time came as the old frenchman went outside the heavy rain fell the blasts of wind throwing him off balance as he made his way up the path toward villa fourteen he wiped his face with his left hand his right hand gripping the weapon a gun lengthened by a silencer stop her what was she doing what did the fire she talked about mean then he saw it a huge burst of flame in a window of villa fourteen fontaine reached the front door but it was locked he raised the handgun fired twice and blew the lock apart inside the screams came from beyond the door of the main bedroom the old frenchman moved toward it his legs unsteady with what strength he had left he kicked the door open and saw a scene that he knew had to come from hell the nurse with prefontaines head in a wire was forcing her victim down into the gasoline fire on the floor stop screamed the man known as jean pierre fontaine enough now you are dead through the rising spreading flames the frenchman fired and the nurse died the storm had blown away when the early morning light broke over the eastern horizon the first boats slowly moved out toward the fishing grounds because the catch of the day meant one more days survival marie her brother and the two old men were around a table on the balcony of an unoccupied villa over coffee they had been talking for most of an hour the old false hero of france who had finally betrayed his betrayer and told them everything he knew had been assured that all the correct arrangements would be made for his wife if it was possible he wanted her to be buried on the islands its possible said johnny st jacques because of you my sisters alive because of me young man she might have died would you have killed me asked marie if i had not seen the needles i dont know i might have felt that i owed the jackal your death but certainly not the childrens god you are a killer said the brother quietly i am many things i dont ask forgiveness in this world many of us need forgiveness remarked brendan patrick prefontaine former judge in boston as he touched the raw tender skin of his neck below his burned white hair you see in front of you a criminal justly tried and justly convicted marie looked at him i dont understand why you came here she said well as i told you the man who paid me to find out where youd gone also paid me a large sum of money to keep the information to myself so i thought if the little i knew brought so much much more might come if i learned a little more i want the name of your client said marie we dont need that said st jacques conklin knows it and we dont need the judge here maybe we do said marie he could support conklins story when we tell it to certain people in washington i would be happy to said prefontaine im with you the telephone rang inside the villa johnny st jacques rose out of his chair but was blocked by his sister who raced through the doors into the living room she picked up the phone david its alex said the breathless voice on the line god ive had this thing on redial for three hours are you all right there was a storm it knocked out the phones what about david we need him the jackal will be here tomorrow what how do you know an old man told me never mind just tell david to get here david will be there you know that yes i do because hes jason bourne chapter six night fight it was ten oclock in the morning and they held each other tightly but there was no time for talk only the brief comfort of being together safe together secure in the knowledge that they knew things that the jackal did not know and that knowledge gave them an enormous advantage but it was only an advantage not a guarantee and marie and the children were being flown south to guadeloupes basseterre island they would stay there with the webbs housekeeper mrs cooper all under guard until they were called back to tranquility marie objected but bourne would not give in now they stood on the dock two sea planes in the water at the far end one had brought bourne directly to tranquility from antigua the other was ready for the flight to guadeloupe with mrs cooper and the children already inside hurry marie added bourne i want to ask these two old men some questions a few hours later in a dark storage room on the third floor of the tranquility hotel bourne and the old frenchman sat in front of a window overlooking the east and west paths of the hotel grounds each man held a pair of binoculars watching the people walking on the paths and down the stone stairs leading to the beach suddenly the door opened and judge brendan prefontaine walked quickly breathlessly inside hes here he said three of st jacquess men down the beach to the east couldnt be reached by radio st jacques sent a guard to find them and the man just returned all three were killed each with a bullet in his throat the jackal said the frenchman its his signature he is announcing his arrival the steel band played as the remaining guests finished their dinners and moved through to the dance floor st jacques had provided some loud entertainment for those guests who had stayed in the hotel very few had left after the fire and the deaths most thought the killings were just an isolated incident and were determined to continue their vacations some were old friends of st jacques and loyalty kept them in place in st jacquess office bourne and fontaine stood up as a stronglooking black woman in a nurses uniform entered the room very good my child you look wonderful said the frenchman remember now ill be holding your arm as we walk and talk but when i squeeze you and raise my voice telling you to leave me alone youll do as i say correct yes sir i must hurry away quite angry with you for being so impolite thats it theres nothing to be afraid of its just a game we want to talk to somebody who is very shy are we ready asked bourne were ready replied the frenchman smiling pleasantly at the very puzzled young woman what are you going to do with all the money youre earning tonight my dear the girl smiled shyly i have a good boyfriend im going to buy him a fine present the plan was simple to prepare and like most good plans however complex simple to carry out old fontaines walk through the grounds of the tranquility hotel had been exactly mapped out it began with fontaine and the young woman returning to his villa presumably to check his sick wife before his normal evening walk they stayed on the lighted main path two of st jacquess guards moved through hidden routes in the bushes always near them bourne followed the second man his radio on receive listening to the angry words of fontaine where is that other nurse that lovely girl who takes care of my woman where is she i havent seen her all day bourne raised his head above a low wall and suddenly there were lights colored lights they had reached the path to an old church and the red and blue lights lit the way to a place that the hotels guests sometimes liked to visit it was the last destination before the return route back to fontaines villa st jacques had put a third guard there to prevent entrance then bourne heard the words over the radio the words that would send the false nurse racing away get away from me shouted fontaine i dont like you up ahead the two guards were hiding side by side they turned and looked at bourne he knew that from that moment all decisions were his the unexpected rarely disturbed bourne it did now had fontaine made a mistake had the old man forgotten about the guard on the path and mistaken him for the jackals contact then another possibility came to bournes mind had the guard been killed or bribed replaced by another bourne rose to his feet what he saw stunned him fontaine didnt move his mouth open in shock his wide eyes disbelieving as another old man in a brown suit approached him and threw his arms around the old hero of france fontaine pushed the man away in panic and puzzlement the words burst out of the radio in bournes pocket claude what a surprise you are here the old friend replied in a shaking voice it is a privilege our employer permitted me to see my sister for a final time and to give comfort to my friend her husband he brought you here but of course he did i must take you to him the great man wishes to speak to you but shes dead she took her own life last night he intended to kill us both shut off your radio screamed bourne in the silence of his thoughts it was too late the door of the church opened and a man walked out into the colored lights he was young muscular and blond was the jackal training somebody to take his place come with me please said the blond man his french gentle but commanding you he added addressing the old man in the brown suit stay where you are at the slightest sound fire your gun take the gun out now hold it in your hand bourne watched helplessly as fontaine was taken through the door of the church from the pocket of his jacket there was a sharp sound the frenchmans radio had been found and destroyed bourne crawled forward to the two guards and whispered theyve taken fontaine inside where is the other guard asked the man near bourne bourne shook his head im afraid he may be dead suddenly there came a long scream followed by words screamed in pain no no you are horrible stop stop now cried bourne as he jumped over the wall the lights he shouted shoot them out the taller guards uzi fired and the lines of lights exploded on both sides of the churchs path then a single yellow beam appeared moving quickly in all directions it was a powerful flashlight in the guards left hand the figure of an old man in a brown suit lay curled up on the path his throat cut stop in the name of god stop where you are came fontaines voice from inside the church the open door showing the light of electric candles they approached the entrance automatic weapons leveled prepared for continuous fire but not prepared for what they saw bourne closed his eyes the sight was too painful old fontaine was tied over a table his face running with blood where he had been cut and attached to his body were thin cables that led to various black boxes on both sides of the church go back screamed fontaine run you fools im wired oh god dont feel sorry for me i gladly join my wife this world is too ugly even for me run bourne and the tall guard ran and fell to the ground the explosion was enormous blinding and deafening flames climbed high into the night sky and blew away in the wind then as their hearing returned to normal there was the roar of powerful engines as a huge speedboat moved out of a shadowed section of the bay and sped out to sea the beam of a searchlight shot out lighting up the barriers of rock rising above the waves carlos the jackal had changed he had aged grown thinner and lost some hair he was not the sharp broad muscular image of bournes memory the boats motors screamed as it reached full speed then the words in heavily accented english came from the distant loudspeaker paris jason bourne paris if you dare chapter seven paris steven desole keeper of the deepest secrets for the central intelligence agency forced his overweight body out of the drivers seat he stood in the deserted parking lot of the small shopping center in annapolis maryland where the only source of light came from a closed gas station desole looked at his watch it was threethirty in the morning the headlights of an approaching limousine shot through the darkness at the far end of the parking lot turning toward the cia analyst causing him to shut his eyes he had to make the process of his discovery of the information clear to those men they provided the money that was the means to a life he and his wife dreamed of education at the best universities for their six grandchildren not the state colleges that came with the salary of a government worker the new medusa had offered money and he had come running two men got out of the limousine and approached him what does this webb look like asked albert armbruster as they walked along the edge of the parking lot ive only got some old photographs and physical details from his army files desole said hes rather large tall i mean and now hell be in his late forties or early fifties cant you be more exact than that the other man short and strong with dark eyebrows beneath dark hair looked at desole be specific he added now just a minute protested the analyst the information im giving you is the best i can get and frankly whoever you are i dont like the tone of your voice hes upset said armbruster hes an italian from new york and he doesnt trust anybody who can you trust in new york asked the short dark man laughing armbruster looked at desole again does he have gray eyes he asked well yes that was in the files its cobra armbruster said who desole said he called himself cobra and he knew all about us armbruster and the man from the mafia climbed back into the limousine wheres the other car armbruster asked the italian looked at his watch its parked less than a kilometer down the road the driver will pick up desole on his way back and stay with him until the time is right but this cobra this webb why is he coming after us what does he want theres a connection with that jackal character maybe that doesnt make sense we have no connection with the jackal why should you asked the mafia man grinning youve got us right its a very loose association and dont you forget it cobra webb whoever he is weve got to find him with what he already knew plus what i told him hes dangerous you said swayne was dangerous we took care of him do you want to discuss a price armbruster turned and looked at the calm sicilian face of his companion you mean a contract on cobra on webb ill close for six months change the name then start advertising in the magazines before reopening said john st jacques to his brotherinlaw meanwhile its best to say nothing said bourne well we have to give some explanation ive put out a story about a huge gas explosion but not many people believe it of course to the world outside an earthquake down here would only get a few lines on an inside page it will pass people will find something else to talk about meanwhile its time for me to leave where are you going paris but what can paris solve i can find him i can take him hes got friends over there ive got jason bourne said david webb lie for me johnny tell marie im fine and that i have information about the jackal that only fontaine could have provided which is the truth actually he told me about a cafe in argenteuil called the soldiers heart call marie in a couple of hours and bring them back here its the safest place they can be the next day at ten twentyfive in the morning washington time dr morris panov accompanied by his guard walked out of walter reed hospital after seeing a patient panov thinking about the case looked at his guard suddenly surprised youre a new man arent you i mean i thought i knew all of you yes sir were often sent on short notice the psychiatrist continued across the sidewalk to where his car was usually waiting for him it was a different vehicle this isnt my car he said puzzled get in ordered his guard politely opening the door what a pair of hands from inside the car grabbed him and a uniformed man pulled him into the backseat as the guard followed the one who had been inside pulled mos jacket off his shoulder and pushed up the short sleeve of his summer shirt he stuck a hypodermic needle into panovs arm good night doctor he said call new york he added to the guard mr simon said the frenchman an older man with a small white beard thats right replied bourne shaking hands in a narrow deserted hallway in pariss orly airport i am bernardine francois bernardine an old friend of our friend alexander alex mentioned you said bourne smiling how is he we hear stories rumors out of beijing hong kong some concerning a man named jason bourne ive heard them yes of course but now paris alexander said you would need a place to stay a hotel something small but i know montmartre ill find a place myself what i will need is a car registered under another name preferably of a dead man its been arranged it is in the underground garage on the capucines near the place vendome bernardine reached into his pocket pulled out a set of keys and handed them to bourne an older peugeot in section e there are thousands of them in paris and the license number is on the key ring thank you said bourne this is very good of you i must explain that i owe my life to alexander conklin and that i know who you are and most of what you have done jason bourne bernardine again reached into a pocket and pulled out a card here is my office address im just a consultant now you understand and on the back ive written down my home phone it is a completely secure line call me and whatever you need will be provided remember i am your only friend in paris no one else knows you are here bourne checked into the pontroyal on the rue montalembert then walked along the boulevard saintgermain buying the things he needed whatever he could buy now would save time later fortunately there was no need to persuade old bernardine to supply him with a weapon during the drive into paris from orly the frenchman had handed a taped brown box to bourne inside was an automatic with two boxes of bullets underneath were francs around american dollars tomorrow i will arrange a method for you to obtain money whenever necessary within limits of course no limits bourne had said ill have conklin wire you a hundred thousand just tell him where of government money no mine thanks for the gun bourne returned to his room and glanced at his watch it was almost two oclock washington time and bernardine had told him that conklin would be expecting a call he picked up the phone and called the number in vienna virginia it was picked up at the first ring alex its me what happened marie no interrupted conklin i spoke to her around noon she and the kids are back at the hotel and shes ready to kill me she doesnt believe a word i told her and im

to remove our connection to hell with them im not interested in medusa theyre interested in you they want you i couldnt care less ive only got one priority and hes here then i havent been clear said conklin his voice faint last night i had dinner with mo i told him everything tranquility your flight to paris bernardine everything on a side street in anderlecht five kilometers south of brussels a military car with the flags of a general stopped in front of a sidewalk cafe general james teagarten commander of nato stepped out of the car into the early afternoon sunlight he turned and offered his hand to an attractive female major who smiled her thanks as she climbed out after him teagarten led her across the wide sidewalk toward the cafe all the tables were occupied except one at the far end where a small card said reserved the owner with two waiters behind him came quickly to meet his important guest when the commander was seated a bottle of wine was presented and the menu discussed a relaxed hour later teagarten and his lady were interrupted by the generals driver a middleaged army sergeant whose expression showed his anxiety the commander of nato had received a message over his secure phone and the driver had written it down he handed teagarten the note the general stood up his sunburned face turning pale as he glanced around the now halfempty cafe he reached into his pocket and dropped some belgian franc notes on the table come on he said to the woman major lets go you he turned to his driver get the car started what is it asked his lunch companion london over the wire desole and armbruster are dead oh my god how i dont know but were getting out of here come on the general and his lady rushed across the wide sidewalk and into the military vehicle the car shot forward traveling less than fifty meters when it happened a great explosion blew the military vehicle into the sky pieces of glass and metal and lines of blood filling the narrow street in anderlecht later that afternoon the waiter in the sidewalk cafe called to his boss as police firefighters and ambulance crews continued their bloody business in the road what is it replied the upset owner of the cafe still shaking from the hard questioning he had gone through from the police and the journalists i am ruined he said we will be known as the cafe of death sir look the waiter pointed at the table where the general and his lady had sat the police have examined it said the owner across the glass top of the table in capital letters written in red lipstick was a name jason bourne chapter eight the soldiers heart bourne had moved to a cheaper hotel and changed his appearance he was wearing faded pants and an old french army shirt he had a days growth of beard and his hair and eyebrows were colored red out on the street he knew he had to walk a number of blocks before he found a taxi taxis were not the fashion in this section of montparnasse neither was the noisy crowd around a newspaper kiosk at the second corner people were shouting many waving their arms holding newspapers in their fists anger and puzzlement in their voices he walked faster reached the stand threw down his coins and grabbed a newspaper the breath went out of him as he tried to control the shock waves that swept through him teagarten killed the assassin jason bourne madness what had happened was he losing what was left of his mind he broke away from the crowd and leaned against the stone wall of a building breathing hard alex a telephone what happened he screamed into the mouthpiece to vienna virginia calm down said conklin quietly where are you bernardine will pick you up and get you out hell make arrangements and put you on a plane to new york wait a minute the jackal did this didnt he weve been told that it was a contract from some crazy people in beirut that may be true or it may not but to answer your question of course it was the jackal so he blamed it on me carlos blamed it on me hes smart ill say that for him you come after him and he uses a contract that keeps you there hidden in paris then we turn it around while he thinks im running and hiding im walking right into his nest youre crazy you get out while we can still get you out sorry alex this is exactly where i want to be well maybe i can change your mind i spoke to marie a couple of hours ago shes flying to paris to find you she cant thats what i said but she wouldnt listen she said she knew all the places you and she used thirteen years ago that youd use them again shes on her way bourne put down the phone and walked away morris panov sat in a chair by a window looking out over the green fields of a farm somewhere he assumed in maryland he was in a small secondfloor bedroom his bare right arm confirming what he already knew he had been drugged repeatedly his mind emptied his thoughts and secrets brought chemically to the surface the damage he had done was incalculable he understood that but what he did not understand was why he was still alive and being treated so well the door opened and his guard walked in a short well built man with an accent that panov placed somewhere in the northeastern united states over his left arm were the psychiatrists clothes ok doc you have to get dressed i made sure everything was cleaned and pressed the guard handed panov his clothes come on put them on doc were going on a little trip i suppose it would be foolish to ask where said panov getting out of the chair very foolish valuable cried the mafia boss in his living room in brooklyn heights of course you fool panov has worked on the heads of some of the top people in washington his files must be worth the price of detroit youll never get them louis said the middleaged man in an expensive suit theyll be taken out of your reach well were working on that five million is still the price for this bournewebb character right louis de fazio said with a condition i dont like conditions mr lawyer i dont like them at all i dont think youll be offended go on therell be two million dollars extra because we insist you include webbs wife and his government friend conklin agreed now to the rest of the business he laid an envelope on the table this contains payment for armbruster and teagarten according to panov interrupted the mafia boss they know about two more of you an ambassador in london and that senior officer in washington you want us to take care of them possibly later not now they both know very little and nothing about the financial operations ill let you know bryce ogilvie of the manhattan law firm ogilvie spofford crawford and cohen rose from his seat and left the room morris panov sat in the front seat of the car with his guard his hands loosely almost politely tied and with a cloth around his eyes they had been driving for about thirty minutes in silence when the guard spoke you know doc i have a nephew my sisters kid whos a doctor too i paid for him to go through medical school he keeps asking me where the money came from thats very generous of you but im surprised he hasnt said anything about your mouth my mouth what the hells wrong with my mouth the yellow on your teeth and the fading pink of your gums so theyve always been like that it might be nothing but he should have spotted it it could be serious when did you last see a dentist i dont like dentists you should see one you could have problems silence then seven minutes later what kind of problems anything from infection to more serious stuff silence four minutes later whats the most serious mouth cancer if its caught in time it can be stopped with minor bone removal if not the entire jaw might have to go panov could feel the car swing to one side as the driver momentarily lost control silence a minute and a half later the whole jaw its either that or the whole of the patients life you think i could have something like that im not a dentist i cant say for sure youre a doctor arent you i mean you went to medical school yes so look at me i cant i cant see anything panov suddenly felt the guards thick strong hand pulling the cloth off his head the car was dark inside except for the front window the windows were almost black go on look the mafia man turned his head toward panov his thick lips parted and his teeth showing its too dark in here replied mo seeing what he wanted to see in the front window they were on a narrow country road wherever he was being taken he was being driven there by an extremely indirect route open the window shouted the guard his head still twisted his eyes still on the road panov lowered the window on his side seeing nothing but trees and bushes there we are he continued raising his loosely tied hands to the mafia mans mouth his eyes however not on that mouth but on the road ahead oh my god he cried what screamed the guard infection its everywhere in the upper and lower jaws the worst sign oh god a huge tree up ahead on the lefthand side of the empty road morris panov put his tied hands on the wheel lifting his body off the seat as he pushed the wheel to the left then at the last second before the car hit the tree he threw himself to the right curling up for protection the crash was enormous broken glass and crushed metal accompanied the rising mists of steam and the growing fires underneath that would soon reach a gas tank the guard was still breathing not dead his face bleeding panov pulled him out of the wreck and into the grass as far as he could just before the car exploded panov released his loosely tied hands and picked the pieces of glass out of the guards face he then checked for broken bones but it seemed that the man had been lucky panov searched the guards clothing astonished at the money that was there about dollars and the various drivers licenses five different identities from five different states he took the money and the licenses to give to alex conklin but he left the wallet there were photographs of the mans family goodbye my friend thought panov as he crawled over to the road stood up and smoothed his clothes trying to look as respectable as possible he started to walk continuing north in the direction the car had been taking the soldiers heart was not on a boulevard or an avenue instead it was in a deadend alley around the corner from a closed factory in what had to be the ugliest part of argenteuil bourne limped through the door and made his way to the crowded bar he bought a beer and looked around the place was full of men who looked like soldiers or former soldiers fights started from time to time and were stopped by the muscular waiters bourne took out a piece of paper and wrote on it the nest of a blackbird is worth a million francs object private business advice if interested be at the old factory around the corner in thirty minutes where is the harm an additional francs for being there alone bourne folded the paper over a hundredfranc note and signaled the barman slowly the man moved his large body forward and leaned his thick tattooed arms on the bar what is it he asked i have written a message for you replied bourne i am a man who carries wounds but im not a poor man bourne passed the paper and the banknote then turned and headed for the door outside he hurried up the broken sidewalk toward the alleys entrance he stood still moving only his hand to feel the hard steel and the security of his automatic ten minutes passed then fifteen then the door of the cafe opened and the barman came out bourne watched as he walked across the street i am here said the barman and i am grateful your name santos i believe you mentioned francs in your note its here bourne held out the money thank you said santos walking forward and accepting the bills take him he added suddenly bourne heard running footsteps behind him before he could reach his weapon something heavy crashed down on his head chapter nine the blackbird were alone said the voice across the dark room as bourne opened his eyes the barman sat in a large armchair bourne felt the angry swelling on the top of his head theres no break no blood only what i imagine is a very painful lump said the jackals man thats accurate especially the last part at your side on a table is an ice bag you should use it bourne reached down grabbed the cold bag and brought it to his head you are very kind he said coldly what do you know about a blackbird said the barman do we do business a million francs worth it seems to me that if a buyer mentions such an amount in the first offer he will go higher the jackals man said a million and a half maybe even two but im not the buyer im the middleman i was given permission to pay one million take it or leave it i have other options do you really certainly not if youre a dead body found floating in the seine without any identification i see bourne looked around the darkened flat it was very different from the dirty cafe below the furniture was tastefully selected not elegant but certainly not cheap mildly astonishing were the bookshelves covering the wall between the two windows the academic in bourne wished he could read the titles they might give him a clearer picture of this strange huge man whose speech might have been formed at the sorbonne his eyes returned to the barman then i cant assume ill leave here alive no answered the jackals man of course youre losing any chance of collecting a million francs or as you suggested maybe a great deal more then may i suggest said the barman crossing his thick arms in front of him as if he were a priest and glancing at the tattoos on his skin that a man who has such large available funds will not only part with them in exchange for his life but will happily deliver the information requested to avoid unnecessary and severe pain the jackals man suddenly shouted what do you know about a blackbird who told you about the soldiers heart where do you come from and who are you and who is your client bourne froze his body tense but his mind spinning racing he had to get out obviously i dont wish to die for a client or be hurt to protect his information so ill tell you what i know which isnt much first the funds are not available to me personally i meet with a man in london to whom i deliver the information and he releases an account in bern switzerland to a name and number any name any number that i give him second what do i know about a blackbird and the soldiers heart i was told that an old man i suspect he was french approached a wellknown public figure and told him he was the target of an assassination who believes a drunk old man unfortunately the assassination took place but fortunately an assistant to the victim was by his side when the old man warned him even more fortunate the assistant is extremely close to my client and the assassination was a welcome event to both the assistant secretly passed on the old mans information a blackbird is sent a message through a cafe known as the soldiers heart in argenteuil who am i my offices are hotel rooms in various cities im currently registered under the name of simon at the hotel pontroyal where i keep my passports and other papers bourne paused his open hands outstretched ive told you the entire truth as i know it not the entire truth said the barman who is your client ill be killed if i tell you ill kill you now if you dont he picked up bournes hunting knife the blade shone in the light of the floor lamp my client my clients are a group of powerful men in the united states they guard their names like nuclear secrets but i know of one and he should be enough for you who find out for yourself find out that im telling you the truth and in the process make yourself so rich that you can do anything you want to do for the rest of your life wheres the harm i can be refused my clients refused theres no trap my clients dont want to see the blackbird they want to hire him how could this be done how can i be satisfied invent a high position for yourself and reach the american ambassador in london the name is atkinson tell him youve received secret instructions from snake lady ask him if you should accept them snake lady whats that medusa they call themselves medusa where the hell are you shouted alexander conklin in virginia i dont know panov replied they drugged me alex i talked we assumed that we have to know where you are others are looking for you too a guy in a truck gave me a lift and i jumped off in the first town but i didnt see a sign wait a minute theres a drugstore across the street the sign says battle fords best will that help there was a sigh on the line yes if you knew anything about the civil war youd know it too find your way to the old battleground at fords bluff there are signs everywhere a helicopter will be there in thirty minutes and dont say anything to anybody bourne walked into the hotel pontroyal and immediately approached the night concierge taking out a franc note and placing it quietly in the mans hand the name is simon he said smiling ive been away any messages no messages mr simon was the quiet reply but two men are outside one on the montalembert the other across on the rue du bac they are watching or waiting for somebody bourne removed a thousandfranc note and gave it to the man i pay for such eyes and i pay well keep watching of course sir reaching his room bourne saw that everything was as he had left it the bed oh god he needed to rest to sleep he couldnt do it any longer something was happening inside him less energy less breath he wanted to lie down no there was marie there was bernardine he went to the telephone and dialed the number nothing the old man said she is not on any international flight currently in the air or scheduled for departure i even checked the transfers from london lisbon stockholm and amsterdam nothing there has to be she wouldnt change her mind its not like her and she wouldnt know how to avoid immigration i repeat shes not listed on any flight from any country coming into paris damn i will keep trying my friend according to alex one should never underestimate your marie francois bernardine woke up suddenly frowning disturbed she wouldnt change her mind the words of the husband who knew her best shes not listed on any flight from any country coming into paris his own words paris the important word was paris but suppose it was not paris bernardine crawled rapidly out of bed in the early morning light he shaved washed dressed and walked down into the street to his peugeot fiftyeight minutes later he swung the car into the parking lot of a small plain brick building in orly airport it was a branch of the department of immigration an important one known as the office of air entries where computers kept uptodate records of every traveler flying into france at all the international airports nineteen minutes later he had his answer but the information was too late bernardine found a payphone and dialed the pontroyal yes said the voice of jason bourne its francois i apologize for waking you i was just getting up whats happening im out at orly and im afraid i have bad news your wife flew into marseilles slightly over two hours ago not paris marseilles why is that bad news cried bourne we know where she is we can oh god i see what you mean she can take a train hire a car she can even fly up to paris under any name she wants to use bournes watch read one oclock when two men walked out of the alley and across the street santos will see you now said one of them i dont see him you have to come with us he does not leave the soldiers heart why do i not like that there is no reason for such feelings as i said earlier he has peace in his heart bourne was led down the alley past the cafes entrance to a small break in the buildings one by one bourne between the two men they made their way to the back of the cafe bourne was led through an unexpectedly beautiful garden to a small outside elevator it barely held the three of them when the iron gate was closed the silent messenger pressed a button in the darkness and spoke we are here santos camellia bring us up camellia asked bourne he knows everything is all right said the other man if not my friend might have said rose what would happen then you dont want to think about it the elevator stopped and the quiet messenger opened a thick steel door bourne was led into the familiar room with its tasteful expensive furniture you may leave my friends said santos from an armchair the two messengers instead of heading for the back of the room and the elevator opened a door in the left wall and disappeared sit down mr simon said santos how is your head the swellings gone down thank you bourne sat on the large couch i understand you have peace in your heart and a desire for three million francs then you were satisfied with your call to london yes no one could have programmed the ambassador into reacting the way he did he was very frightened there is a snake lady and she creates extraordinary fear in high places now you say that you and you alone must reach the blackbird may i ask why because if one drunk old man can talk about the soldiers heart then others may do so you can be traced by the police my clients want no connection with you even through you later ill disappear you wont though maybe you should think about doing so here i brought you something bourne sat forward on the couch and reached into his back pocket he pulled out a roll of franc notes held together by a rubber band he threw it over to santos who caught it in midair francs in advance give me the information i need and ill deliver it to london whether or not the blackbird accepts my clients offer you will still receive the balance of the three million santos got up from the chair and walked across to a card table if you will please come over here bourne rose from the couch and walked over to the card table suddenly astonished spread across the table were his three passports as well as the gun and the knife taken from him last night ill accept your money now said santos but instead of you flying to london london will fly to paris tomorrow morning when he arrives at the pontroyal youll call me ill give you my private number of course then well have an exchange the money for the information ill do what i can said bourne two hours later he called bernardine my god it is four oclock in the morning so i can assume you have something important to tell this seventyyearold man ive got a problem youve got too many problems but never mind what is it im as close as i can be but i need another man what kind of man my contact with the jackal expects an englishman to fly over from london this morning with two million eight hundred thousand francs far less money than you have i assume yes but im being watched so i cant go to the bank and i dont have an englishman to bring what i cant get to the pontroyal i can get the money for you sign a paper releasing it to me give the paper to the hotel concierge and ill pick it up fine what about the englishman this morning not a problem old boy said the frenchman in a perfect english accent soon after fourthirty in the afternoon bernardine walked into the pontroyal dressed in a dark suit that was obviously british he went to the elevator and eventually after two wrong turns reached bournes room heres the money he said dropping a small case on the floor he sat down at the desk took two automatics and three grenades from his pockets and placed them in a row i will relax now what the hell is that are they cried bourne when you go out to do your business you will leave the door open replied bernardine if somebody comes down that narrow passage he will see a grenade in my hand that makes sense said bourne going to the door out on the montalembert he walked to the corner leaned against the wall and waited a man walked across the street toward him it was the talkative messenger from last night his hand in his jacket pocket wheres the money wheres the information answered bourne the money first thats not the arrangement without warning bourne grabbed him by the jacket pulling him forward off his feet bourne moved up his free hand and gripped the messengers throat his fingers digging into the mans flesh you go back to santos and tell him hes got a oneway ticket to hell i dont deal this way enough said the low voice its owner coming around the corner on bournes right the huge figure of santos approached let him go simon he is nothing it is now only you and me bourne released the messenger who looked at santos responding to a gesture of his bosss large head the man raced away your englishman arrived said santos when they were alone he carried a small case i saw myself so i shall give you the information what i am going to tell you mr simon is known by only four people in the world however if you even hint at argenteuil as your source of information ill know it immediately and you will never leave the pontroyal alive the contact can be made so quickly with a telephone number but you will not place the call for at least an hour from the moment we part if you do again i will know it and again i tell you youre a dead man an hour agreed only three other people have this number why not choose one that youre not particularly fond of so that i can mention him if its necessary santos smiled thinly moscow he said softly high up in dzerzhinsky square the kgb the blackbird is building a network in moscow always moscow hes fascinated by it ilich ramirez sanchez thought bourne trained at novgorod dismissed by the kgb as a madman the jackal ill remember that if its needed the number please santos said it twice with the words that bourne had to say he spoke slowly obviously impressed that bourne wrote nothing down is that all clear yes said bourne if everything goes as i hope it will how do you want me to get you the money call me youve got my number i will leave argenteuil and come to you and never return to argenteuil good luck santos something tells me you deserve it no one more so goodbye santos walked away and bourne his heart beating fast headed back to the pontroyal bernardine he said entering his room put the weapons away weve struck gold in what way an hour announced bourne fortythree minutes from now write this down francois bourne repeated the phone number given to him by santos can you find out where that number is it might take some time and cost money the money doesnt matter and ill pay more for less time bernardine picked up the phone former judge bernard prefontaine watched randolph gates cry as the professor sat forward on the couch in bostons ritz carlton hotel his face in his hands so you got into trouble in france randy my god how did you find out you know i cant possibly tell you that but these things leave a trace the trace in this case was a file held by army intelligence conklin had found a reference to it in swaynes diary and asked casset to investigate you dont know what it was like said gates i was setting up a business deal when i was kidnapped then i was thrown into a plane and flown to marseilles where the most horrible things happened to me i was kept in a room and every few hours i was given drugs for more than six weeks women were brought in movies made i wasnt myself so you became the jackals man in the world of high finance its how he found me the deal i was trying to do was opposed by some people in the far east they hired him oh my god hell kill me yes he probably will sorry about that randy what am i going to do theres a way first a long rest at a private health center but even before that your complete cooperation right now if you help the jackal will be killed and youll be free randy ill do anything how do you reach him i have a telephone number gates took his wallet from his pocket and dug into it with trembling fingers only four people alive have it the hour was over and bourne left the hotel walking slowly crossing four streets until he saw a public phone by the river seine it was dark now and the boats on the river were dotted with lights he breathed steadily controlling himself as he went inside put in a coin and dialed yes it was a womans voice blackbirds circle in the sky said bourne repeating santoss words in french they make a great deal of noise but one is silent a mans voice came on the line who is this the jackal it was the jackal the smooth fast french could not hide the latin american accent somebody who was trusted by somebody who knows you with this number i can offer you the contract of your career of your life you can name your price but those who pay are among the most powerful men in the united states this is a very strange call very unusual all i need is your interest at this point if the answer is yes i can reveal more if its no well i tried but i am forced to go elsewhere the newspapers say he was in brussels only yesterday ill find him there was a sharp intake of breath at the mention of brussels and the unspoken name of jason bourne yes or no blackbird silence finally the jackal spoke call me back in two hours he ordered hanging up the phone it was done bourne leaned against the pay phone the sweat pouring down his face and breaking out on his neck the pontroyal he had to get back to bernardine it was carlos he announced closing the door and crossing to the bedside phone while taking santoss card out of his pocket he dialed seconds later he spoke the birds confirmed he said give me a name any name the pause was brief the case will be left with the concierge send one of your men if he uses that name the concierge will give it to him count the money and send my passports back to me bourne hung up and turned to bernardine we have an address on the boulevard lefebvre for that phone the frenchman said and told bourne the number im leaving said jason bourne taking bernardines automatic off the desk and putting two grenades in his pocket do you mind take them replied the frenchman pulling another gun from his belt but why ive got at least a couple of hours and i want to look around alone how else if we call for support i risk being gunned down or spending the rest of my life in jail for an assassination i was not involved with in belgium bernardine stared at the ringing telephone wondering whether to pick it up he had to yes jason its you isnt it maybe i have the wrong room alex this is you francois what are you doing there wheres jason things have happened so fast i know hes been trying to reach you its been a difficult day weve got panov back thats good news ive got other news a telephone number where the jackal can be reached weve got it and an address our man left an hour ago for gods sake how did you get it a complex process that i believe only your man could have handled hes very imaginative lets compare said conklin whats yours bernardine said the number he had written down on bournes instructions the silence on the phone was a silent scream theyre different said conklin finally theyre different a trap said bernardine god its a trap chapter ten the meurice twice bourne had passed the dark quiet row of old stone houses on the boulevard lefebvre he then returned to the rue dalesia and found a sidewalk cafe he ordered coffce as the waiter returned to the service bar bourne pulled out his small notebook and pen shutting his eyes for a moment then opening them and drawing everything he could remember there were three pairs of attached houses separated by narrow alleys each double complex was three floors high each front entrance reached by climbing a steep flight of brick steps at either end of the row were vacant lots the address of the jackals telephone number was the final structure on the right though maybe he occupied the whole row bourne left the cafe and walked slowly as an older man might walk toward the boulevard lefebvre the closer he came to the last corner the more he became aware of the rising and falling sounds from different directions police cars what had happened bourne ran to the edge of the building in front of the lefebvre what were they doing five police cars arrived from different directions each stopping in front of the building on the right then a large police van appeared its searchlight shooting out as a group of blackuniformed men with automatic weapons leaped out into the street and crouched behind the police cars fools to give carlos a warning was to lose the jackal killing was his profession and escape was part of it for gods sake who had done this on police authority all residents will leave the building the orders came over a loudspeaker and echoed down the street you have one minute before we break into the house the door above the flight of brick steps on the right opened and a nun dressed in black appeared how dare you she roared this is the evening prayer time and you disturb us you should be asking forgiveness for your sins not interrupting those who beg god to forgive theirs nicely said sister said the voice over the loudspeaker but we have other information and we insist on searching your house he knew that voice it was bernardine what had happened was bernardine his enemy after all was it all an act the blackuniformed group raced to the base of the brick steps an official in plain clothes the obvious leader of the assault joined his unit on the sidewalk below the steps then he and his men raced up the brick stairs through the door held open by the angry nun bourne held his place at the edge of the building his eyes on the strange scene on lefebvre twelve minutes passed then the assault team left several members bowing and kissing the hand of the real or pretending nun bernardine screamed the official approaching the first police car you are finished out never are you to talk to anybody in the deuxieme again if i had my way youd be shot nuns get out of my car before i shoot you by accident bernardine got out of the police car his old unsteady legs barely able to maintain balance the police cars and the van raced away bourne had to wait his eyes moving from bernardine to the front entrance of the jackals house and it was the jackals house the nun proved it carlos could never let go of his lost faith he often used it as cover but it was much more than that much more bernardine walked into the shadows of a storefront across from the house of the nuns bourne reached the corner and ran down the sidewalk for gods sake what happened he cried its a trap my friend said bernardine what alex and i confirmed it the telephone numbers were different i gather that you didnt make your call to carlos no i had the address and i wanted him to wait whats the difference this is the house oh this is where your mr simon was supposed to go and if he was truly mr simon he would be taken to another place but if he was not mr simon but somebody else then he would be shot bang another dead body in search of the jackal youre wrong insisted bourne carlos isnt going to allow anybody to kill me except himself those are his orders he hid watched and waited at fiveseventeen two bicycles ridden by nuns stopped in front of the house the door opened and three more nuns each carrying a bicycle walked out and down the brick steps to join them they started up the street carloss nun behind the others bourne moved out from the storefront and ran after them at an intersection of the rue lecourbe in montparnasse a number of trucks prevented carloss nun from keeping up with the others she waved them on and turned into a narrow side street suddenly moving faster than before bourne did not have to increase his speed a sign on the building fronting the street said dead end there was no other way out he found the bicycle chained to a street lamp and waited in the darkness of a doorway he leaned against the stone breathing heavily feeling the tiredness in his legs only a few short years ago there would have been none the sound of a handle turning broke the stillness of the street followed by the noise of a heavy door being opened it was the entrance to the apartment in front of the chained bicycle bourne watched the woman rush to the lamppost he walked forward youll be late for prayers he said the woman spun around bourne gripped her arm with his left hand and tore off her large white hat with his right the sight of the face in front of him came as a shock my god he whispered i know you paris years ago your name is lavier jacqueline lavier you had one of those dress shops les classiques a contact point for carlos in the faubourg i thought you were dead the womans sharp middleaged face twisted in anger she tried to break out of his grip but bourne crashed her against the wall youre wrong said the woman her green eyes wide its true i am lavier but im not the woman you knew you knew my sister jacqueline i am dominique lavier we were close in age and looked very like each other jason bourne you know who i am all paris the jackals paris knows who you are not by sight but they know you are here and they know youre tracking carlos and youre part of that paris i am good god lady he killed your sister she knew the rules she betrayed him and at my age my choices are limited i took jacquis place at les classiques just like that it wasnt difficult jacqui supposedly went to switzerland for some work on her face and i returned to paris after eight weeks of preparation and went into the killing game i was gradually led into it in the beginning i was told that jacqueline had died in a boating accident and that i would be well paid to carry on in her place by the time i found out the truth well he was paying me well and i was afraid of him its all an old story said bourne this is now thirteen years later what happens now i dont know my choices are zero arent they one or the other of you will kill me i suppose maybe not help me take him and youre free of both of us you can go to the mediterranean and live in peace and comfort carlos cant reach you because hell be dead and does this comfort come from you yes i see is that what you offered santos a comfortable disappearance bourne looked at his prisoner so it was santos after all he said softly lefebvre was a trap god the jackals smart santos is dead the soldiers heart is closed down what stunned bourne stared again at the lavier woman that was his reward for trapping me no for betraying carlos i dont understand carloss eyes and ears are everywhere santos was observed sending several heavy boxes out with his main food supplier a man was sent to the supplier and opened the boxes books interrupted bourne quietly and he will kill me too he will know i have spoken to you she looked around he has eyes everywhere i am not important to him i can tell the authorities nothing of substance because i have never seen him but he will still kill me i see bourne stepped back from his prisoner i can get you out he said quietly out of paris out of europe beyond carloss reach do you want that as eagerly as santos did answered lavier i will willingly trade my loyalty from him to you why because he is old and grayfaced and is not as good as you you offer me life he offers death thats a reasonable decision then said bourne do you have any money with you i mean i have several hundred francs why its not enough continued bourne reaching into his pocket and taking out a roll of franc notes heres he said handing her the money buy some clothes somewhere im sure you know how and take a room at the the meurice hotel on the rue de tivoli what name should i use what suits you how about brielle a lovely town beside the sea why not give me ten minutes to get out of here and then leave ill see you at the meurice at noon with all my heart jason bourne lets forget the name bourne walked out of the deadend street and went to the nearest taxi station within minutes a happy taxi driver accepted a hundred francs to wait in place at the end of the line his passenger sitting low in the back seat waiting to hear the words the nun comes out sir cried the driver she enters the first taxi follow it said bourne sitting up on the avenue victor hugo laviers taxi slowed down and stopped in front of a public phone stop here ordered bourne climbing out the moment the driver swung into the side of the street bourne walked quickly silently to the telephone behind the nun he could hear her clearly as he stood three meters away the meurice she shouted into the phone the name is brielle hell be there at noon yes yes ill stop at my apartment change clothes and be there in an hour lavier hung up and turned shocked by the sight of bourne no she screamed yes im afraid said bourne hes old and grayfaced those were your words dominique quite descriptive for somebody who never met carlos a little later an angry bernardine walked out of the hotel pontroyal and approached the taxi this is mad he said get in said bourne on the far side of the woman dressed as a nun bernadine did so staring at her meet one of the jackals more talented performers the taxi made a uturn and entered the rue du bac were going to the meurice added bourne im sure theres a reason stated bernardine its the jackals final trap for me answered bourne thanks to the persuasive lady here he expects me to be there and ill be there ill call in the deuxieme i still have some friends there no said bourne i cant take the chance one man could send out an alarm let me help said dominique lavier i can help i listened to your help before lady and it was leading me to my own death no thanks that was before not now this old man mentions that hell call in the deuxieme the deuxieme mr bourne even if i survived id no doubt be sent to some horrible prison halfway across the world oh ive heard stories of the deuxieme besides continued lavier looking at bourne without me in different clothing at the meurice carlos wont come near it shes right said bourne leaning forward and looking past lavier at bernardine i think we can trust her now shes got an apartment on the montaigne she can change clothes there after a short period of silence bernardine spoke whats your address on the avenue montaigne marie sat at the table in her small suite at the meurice hotel reading the newspapers but concentration was out of the question her anxiety had kept her awake after she returned to the hotel soon after midnight having visited five cafes she and david had used so many years ago in paris finally after four in the morning exhaustion had allowed her to sleep now she knew she had to go out again to keep looking for david she put down her coffee cup picked up her coat and left the room the ride down to the ground floor seemed to last forever because of an american couple who kept complaining that not enough people in paris spoke english finally the elevator doors opened and marie walked rapidly out into the crowded meurice hallway as she crossed the floor toward the entrance she suddenly stopped as an elderly man in a dark suit sat straight up in a heavy leather chair on her right he stared at her his eyes wide open in shock marie st jacques he whispered my god get out of here i beg your what the old frenchman quickly with difficulty rose to his feet you cannot be seen here mrs webb he said his voice in a whisper dont look at me look at your watch keep your head down the retired deuxieme officer glanced away his lips barely moving go out of the door on the far left hurry no replied marie you know me but i dont know you who are you a friend of your husband my god is he here the question is why are you here i stayed at this hotel once before i thought he might remember it he did but in the wrong way im afraid now leave i wont i have to find him where is he you will leave or you may find only his dead body you cannot do this to him youll kill him get out of here now her eyes halfblinded with anger and with tears marie started toward the left side of the door what could she do what should she do david was somewhere in the hotel help me for gods sake jason tell me what to do jason yes jason help me out in the street she stood frozen as taxis and limousines broke off from the traffic and pulled up beside the meurice a large black limousine with a small religious badge on its passenger door moved to a stop both doors beside the sidewalk were opened by the doorman as five priests got out one from the front seat four from the large back section the last four priests immediately moved through the crowds to stand two at the front of the vehicle two at the back suddenly marie saw a figure crossing the rue de rivoli it was a tall man in dark clothes and he was limping avoiding the traffic but the limp was false the leg straightened if only for a moment it was david another no more than two meters from her also saw what she saw a small radio was immediately brought to the mans lips david marie screamed gunshots filled the rue de rivoli the crowds panicked many running into the hotel many more racing away the old frenchman who had recognized her came crashing out of the front entrance firing into the black limousine my friend roared bernardine here shouted bourne where is she to your right next to a single gunshot exploded from the glass double doors of the meurice bernardine fell to the sidewalk a second gunshot ended his life marie could not move crying out of control she fell to her knees then onto the street were getting out of here can you understand that said jason bourne his voice not the voice of david webb yes yes marie awkwardly got to her feet held by the husband she either knew or did not know lets go bernardine gave us our exit run with me hold my hand chapter eleven the kgb bourne and marie drove south to the small city of corbeilessonnes where there was a new shopping center several kilometers west of the highway from a public telephone bourne placed a call to vienna virginia but alex conklin wasnt there instead there was the voice of a recorded operator saying the telephone number you have called is no longer in service bourne called the apartment in washington and heard another recorded voice this is alex it said ill be away for some time visiting a place where a grave error was made call me in five or six hours its now ninethirty in the morning eastern standard time out juliet stunned his mind spinning bourne hung up the phone and stared at marie somethings happened and i have to make sense of it his last words were out juliet juliet marie said hotel india juliet its the international radio operators alphabet juliets for j and j is for jason what was the rest hes visiting somewhere where a grave error was made a what he said to call him in five or six hours he was visiting a place where a grave error grave my god its rambouillet the cemetery where he tried to kill me thirteen years ago when he thought id changed sides thats it rambouillet not in five or six hours objected marie whenever he left the message he couldnt fly to paris and then drive to rambouillet in five hours he was in washington of course he could weve both done it before an army jet out of andrews air force base to paris bourne suddenly looked at his watch its still only around noon in the islands lets find another phone johnny tranquility you really think i cant stop thinking interrupted bourne rushing ahead theres a phone inside over there he said approaching the huge windows of an ice cream shop get me a chocolate one he said leading marie into the crowded store bourne crossed to the phone immediately understanding why it was not used the noise of the store was almost unbearable three minutes later holding his hand against his left ear bourne had the unexpected comfort of hearing tranquility hotels most annoying employee over the phone this is mr pritchard tranquility hotels assistant manager may i inquire as to the nature of your you can shut up shouted bourne get johnny st jacques on the phone now this is his brotherinlaw of course sir one moment please johnny david where are you that doesnt matter get out of there take the kids and mrs cooper and get out we know all about it alex conklin called several hours ago and said somebody named holland would reach us i gather hes the chief of your intelligence service he is did he yeah about twenty minutes after i talked to alex he told us were being taken out by helicopter around two oclock this afternoon david what the hell is going on wheres marie shes all right ill explain everything later just do as holland says did he say where you were being taken he didnt want to but no american is going to order me and your kids around my canadian sisters kids he said we were going to a safe house in virginia its on a piece of land in fairfax with no public entry and its own airfield i know the place said bourne its called tannenbaum hes right its the best of the safe houses he likes us i asked you before wheres marie shes with me she found you later johnny ill reach you in fairfax bourne hung up the phone they met at rambouillet and drove to a small country restaurant alex conklin mo panov jason bourne and marie webb the family was together they sat around a table at the back the owner said that the cooking was extraordinary but since nobody was hungry bourne paid for four starters to keep the owner happy well be working with the soviets conklin said its all right holland arranged it and i know the contact ive known him for years but washington doesnt know that i know him his name is krupkin dimitri krupkin and he can be bought and paid for for how much marie asked considering his position in the paris kgb id say around american dollars offer him thirtyfive marie said and go up to seventy five under pressure up to a hundred if necessary of course for gods sake cried bourne were talking about us about the jackal give him anything he wants we have the money too easily bought by us too easily bought by the other side is she right asked bourne staring at conklin normally of course but in this case it would have to be something like a diamond mine nobody wants carlos in the dead file more than the soviets and the man who brings in his dead body will be the hero of the kremlin remember carlos was trained at novgorod moscow never forgets that then do as she says buy him said bourne i understand conklin leaned forward ill call him tonight pay phone to pay phone and get it settled then ill arrange a meeting tomorrow maybe lunch somewhere outside paris why not here asked bourne its quiet and ill know how to get here why not agreed conklin ill talk to the owner he turned to the others but not the four of us just jason and me i assumed that said bourne coldly marie must not be involved she must not be seen or heard is that clear david said marie angrily you cannot and will not order me around do you understand that loud and clear lady then maybe you should go back to the states so you wont have to listen to me jason bourne rose from the table pushing the chair behind him tomorrows going to be a busy day so i have to get some sleep ill be in the car for two minutes you decide whether to stay or go im sure alex can get you out of france bourne turned and walked away go to him said panov quickly you know whats happening i cant handle it mo dont handle it just be with him youre the only support hes got you dont even have to talk just be there with him hes become the killer again then provide him with that link to david webb it has to be there marie oh god i love him so much cried the wife rushing to her feet and racing after the man who was her husband but not her husband was that the right advice mo asked conklin i dont know alex i just dont think he should be alone with his terrors none of us should thats not psychiatry its just common sense sometimes you sound like a real doctor you know that the algerian section of paris lies between the tenth and eleventh districts barely three blocks where the low buildings are parisian but the sounds and the smells are arabic a long black limousine entered this district the badge of the roman catholic church in gold on the doors it stopped in front of a woodframed threefloor house where an old priest got out and walked to the door he pressed a button that rang a bell on the second floor yes said the metallic voice from upstairs i am a messenger from the american embassy answered the visitor i cant leave my vehicle but we have an urgent message for you ill be right down said the frenchalgerian driver who worked for the americans three minutes later the man came out of the building what are you dressed like that for he asked the messenger who stood by the large car covering the badge on the door im the embassys catholic priest my son a member of staff would like a word with you he opened the car door yes sir what can i do for you said the driver as he bent down to look inside the limousine where did you take our people asked the shadowed figure in the darkness what people said the algerian concern in his voice the two you picked up at the airport several hours ago the limping man and his friend if youre from the embassy and they want you to know theyll call and tell you wont they youll tell me a third powerfully built man in a drivers uniform appeared from behind the trunk of the car he walked rapidly forward raising his arm and crashing a stick down on the algerians head he pushed his victim inside the old man dressed as a priest climbed in behind him pulling the door shut as the driver ran around to the front seat the limousine raced away an hour later on the deserted rue houdon the algerians bruised and bleeding dead body was pushed out of the large car inside the figure in shadows addressed the priest get your car and remain outside the limping ones hotel report any movements and go where he goes dont fail me never sir dimitri krupkin was seated at a table in the country restaurant staring across the table at alex conklin who sat beside the unidentified bourne so my dear old enemy krupkin said how and where will i be paid according to our agreement last night on the telephone how and where do you want to be paid asked bourne ah ha you are my employer sir ill be paying you yes i shall write down the name of a bank and the number of an account in geneva the soviet said he reached into his pocket for a pen but was not able to use it because a man in his early thirties walked rapidly up to the table what is it sergei asked krupkin you have been followed an old man in a gray car he arrived soon after you did looked at the name of the restaurant then used the car telephone that old mans from the jackal said bourne carlos cried krupkin his blue eyes angry the jackals after you aleksei no him answered conklin pointing at bourne good god with what weve learned in moscow its all making sense so i have the honor to meet the famous jason bourne a great pleasure sir we have the same aim where carlos is concerned do we not if your men are good we may achieve that aim before the end of the next hour lets get out of here and use the back way the kitchen hes found me and you can bet hes coming out here for me but he doesnt know that we know that lets go as the three men rose from the table krupkin gave instructions to his assistant have the car brought around to the back sergei of course comrade the assistant hurried back to the entrance they left through the kitchen and waited in krupkins citroen on the edge of a field suddenly a dark brown limousine shot up the road from the highway to paris it pulled to a stop in front of the restaurant and two men leaped out of the side door their faces covered their hands holding automatic weapons a third man came out of the vehicle wearing a priests black clothing suddenly there was an earsplitting scream of revenge from the jackal as the terrorists rushed inside their weapons on automatic fire now cried sergei the citroen swung out on the road rushing toward the limousine but in a split second its progress was stopped a huge explosion took place on the right the old man the informer and the gray car in which he was sitting were blown up sending the citroen to the left into a fence get out shouted sergei pulling bourne from the seat onto the dirt by the fence as his stunned superior and alex conklin crawled out behind him lets go cried bourne he blew up the car they ran to the front doors of the restaurant and burst inside the next sixty seconds were like a scene from hell the waiter and two male customers were dead lying on the floor with blood running from their heads women screamed sergei suddenly rushed forward his weapon on automatic fire in a back corner of the room he had spotted a figure whom bourne had not seen the killer leaped out of the shadows and the soviet shot him but it was not carlos where was the jackal in there shouted sergei pointing to the kitchen both men moved toward the swinging doors but were partially blown back by an explosion from within a grenade had been thrown the smoke blew out into the dining room bourne crashed through the doors and threw himself flat silence another scene from another hell a section of the outside wall had been blown away the owner and his cook were dead blood streaming across the floor bourne slowly rose to his feet his legs in great pain he looked through the smoke his eyes finally settling on a large piece of paper fixed to the wall by a kitchen knife he approached it and read the words printed in black pen the trees of tannenbaum will burn and so will the children sleep well jason bourne the mirrors of his life exploded into a thousand pieces of glass there was nothing else to do except scream chapter twelve the apartment the gray citroen was parked a hundred meters away from the entrance of dominique laviers apartment building on the fashionable avenue montaigne krupkin conklin and bourne sat in the back sergei could be seen walking out of the glass doors he crossed the wide street toward the citroen reached the car and climbed in behind the wheel everything is as it should be he said looking around the lady has not returned and the apartment is number twentyone second floor right front side it has been swept thoroughly there are no hidden microphones that makes sense the jackal could hardly have been checking personnel all over paris it all gets so complicated i have arranged entry to madame laviers flat with the concierge i have identified you all as belonging to the deuxieme good said krupkin and then to bourne and conklin lets go in the entrance hall krupkin nodded at the formally dressed concierge behind the counter the door is open said the concierge avoiding direct eye contact laviers flat showed that she worked in the world of fashion the walls were covered with photographs of people in the business attending important shows and events both conklin and the russian immediately began examining the tables picking up handwritten notes then krupkins radio suddenly gave out two sharp sounds it must be sergei he said youre in place comrade yes the assistants quiet voice came from the radio the lavier woman has just entered the building good alex put the notes down lavier is coming the sound of a key turning a lock echoed through the living room the three men turned to the door as a shocked dominique lavier walked inside her astonishment however was brief she calmly replaced the key in her purse and spoke in english well kruppie i might have known you were mixed up in this ah the charming jacqueline or may we drop the pretence domie kruppie cried conklin domie comrade krupkin is one of the more public kgb officers in paris said lavier putting her purse on the table it has its advantages said krupkin i understand youve met our tall american friend here so i think it is only right i should introduce you to his friend aleksei konsolikov i dont believe you hes not soviet youre right he may introduce himself if he wishes to the names conklin alex conklin miss lavier and im american however my parents were russian and i speak the language as well as they did so my friend krupkin cant deceive me when were in soviet company im hurt said krupkin but that isnt important here you will work with us domie ill work with you kruppie i only ask that jason bourne makes clear his offer to me with carlos im a caged animal but without him i have no money name your price said bourne write it down said conklin glancing at krupkin let me see said lavier walking across to the desk im within a few years of sixty from one direction or the other and i will have maybe fifteen to twenty years she wrote a figure on a piece of paper and walked across to bourne id prefer not to argue i believe its fair bourne took the paper and read the amount its fair he said handing the note back to lavier add how and where you want it paid and ill make the arrangements when we leave here the money will be there in the morning lavier looked into bournes eyes i believe you she said bending over the desk and writing her instructions she gave the paper back to him the deal is made sir and may god give us the kill if he does not we are dead bourne nodded ive several questions he said do you want to sit down yes lavier crossed to the sofa and settled into it what happened at the meurice hotel said bourne how did it happen your woman i assume it was your woman screamed as you crossed the street the rest you saw for yourself how could you have told me to take a room at the meurice knowing she was there i didnt know we were here in paris thirteen years ago my memory of that time isnt good but the name meurice means something maybe we stayed there maybe thats why she chose it anyway what is our position now carlos still trusts me he blames everything on the woman your wife im told and has no reason to hold me responsible bourne nodded how can you reach him i cannot directly but i can get a message to him i call several old men at cheap cafes and they call others somehow the messages get through very quickly conklin moved closer to her i want you to send the most urgent message you have ever sent to the jackal you must talk to him directly its an emergency and you can talk about it with nobody except carlos himself about what said krupkin what could be so urgent that the jackal will agree to a meeting like our mr bourne he worries about traps conklin shook his head and limped to a side window deep in thought he looked down at the street my god it could work he whispered to himself what could work asked bourne dimitri hurry call the embassy and have them send the biggest most impressive limousine you have the force and urgency of conklins command had its effect the russian walked rapidly to the telephone and dialed then spoke into the phone in russian its done said the kgb officer and now i think you should give me a good reason for doing it moscow replied conklin still looking out the window what are you saying roared krupkin weve got to get carlos out of paris said conklin turning where better than moscow in this city hes got all the firepower an untraceable network of gunmen and messengers and many places to hide london amsterdam brussels rome theyd all be better for us but the best is moscow oddly its the one place in the world that he cant resist and also the one thats the least welcoming alex youre losing your mind krupkin said what could domie say that would make him go to moscow thats easy the kgb in moscow is getting closer to the jackals man in dzerzhinsky square they know hes one of lets say ten or fifteen officers in the highest ranks when they find him carlos cant do anything with the kgb worse hell lose an informer who knows much too much about him to the men who ask painful questions but how would domie know that said krupkin come over here conklin said just you for the moment and stay away from the window look around the side of one of the curtains the soviet did as he was told what do you see asked conklin gesturing to an old brown car below on the street krupkin did not bother to reply instead he took his radio from his pocket and pressed a button sergei theres a brown car about eighty meters down the street we know sir interrupted the assistant were watching it its an old man who hardly moves except to look out of the window does he have a car telephone no comrade and if he leaves the car hell be followed so there can be no outside calls unless you direct otherwise thank you sergei the jackals man said bourne stepping forward now do you understand asked conklin speaking to krupkin of course replied the kgb official after we leave carlos is told that a soviet embassy vehicle was sent to pick us up and for what other reason would we be here except to question madame lavier naturally with me was a tall man who might be jason bourne and another shorter man with a disabled leg so confirming that it was jason bourne our connection is therefore made and observed and again naturally during our questioning of madame lavier tempers rose and references were made to the jackals informer in dzerzhinsky square which only id known about through dealing with santos at the soldiers heart said bourne quietly so dominique has a believable observer an old man from carloss army of old men to support the information she delivers alex that brain of yours hasnt lost its power i hear a professor i once knew i thought hed left us he has not for long i hope chapter thirteen moscow buckingham pritchard sat next to his uniformed uncle cyril sylvester pritchard deputy director of immigration in the office of the crown governor sir henry sykes at government house on the island of montserrat beside them on the deputy directors right was their attorney the finest local lawyer sykes could persuade to advise the pritchards if a case was brought against them for helping terrorists jonathan lemuel now retired after many years of experience in the highest english courts sir henry sat behind his desk and glanced in shock at lemuel who raised his eyes to the ceiling in disbelief the cause of sir henrys shock and jonathan lemuels disbelief was the result of the following exchange between sykes and the deputy director of immigration mr pritchard youve admitted that your nephew overheard a telephone conversation between john st jacques and his brotherinlaw the american mr david webb also your nephew buckingham pritchard admits calling you with certain information contained in that conversation you then told him that you had to contact paris immediately is this true it is all completely true sir henry whom did you reach in paris whats the telephone number with respect sir i am sworn to secrecy what did you say mr pritchard my nephew and i are part of an international organization involving the great leaders of the world and we have been sworn to secrecy enough shouted sykes the veins in his head standing out you have both been complete fools youve been tricked by an international terrorist who is wanted all over the world do you know the penalty for helping such a killer it is death by hanging now whats that number in paris under the circumstances said the deputy director speaking calmly despite the fact that his hand shook as he reached for his notebook ill write it down for you one asks for a blackbird in french sir henry as krupkin entered moscows hotel metropole with bourne and conklin the manager quietly said comrade there is an urgent message for you he walked rapidly up to the kgb man and pushed a folded note into his hand i was told to deliver it to you personally you have done so and i thank you krupkin watched the man walk away then opened the paper i must call dzerzhinsky immediately he said turning its the extension number of my assistant come lets hurry in the suite the doors of the two bedrooms were opposite each other the space between them was a large sitting room complete with a bar help yourselves said krupkin heading for a telephone on the desk by the way youll find your weapons in your bedside table drawers each is a graz burya automatic krupkin dialed a number and spoke in russian he shook his head as he hung up the telephone we must go immediately go where conklin said weve just got here weve taken an apartment on the sadovaya thats moscows widest street mr bourne well be using it as our headquarters the car was parked some way from the hotel where it would be less obvious a hotel employee got it for them and krupkin drove them across the city the luxury apartment on the busy sadovaya was one of many in an old stone building that like the hotel metropole reflected old russia the walls were covered with red wallpaper and the furniture was elegant but to the right of the large livingroom fireplace was a more modern item a large black television set with a video cassette player in the apartment was a strongly built man in an untidy uniform his shirt open at the neck for you i have no name he said you can call me captain although my rank is higher the kgb officer walked to the huge television set and switched it on st basils in red square said krupkin looking at the screen its a museum now but occasionally they hold a small religious service the screen shook as the man carrying the video camera moved inside the building then it became steady it showed an elderly man in a black raincoat he was walking beside one of the side walls rodchenko said the captain the great rodchenko the man on the screen moved into a corner where two large candles threw shadows on the stone walls rodchenko approached another man a priest losing his hair thin his skin dark its him cried bourne its carlos then a third man appeared on the screen joining the other two and conklin shouted my god he roared hold it there the kgb officer paused the tape the other one do you recognize him david i know him but i dont know him replied bourne quietly as images going back years began filling his mind there were explosions white blinding lights with figures running in a jungle a captain with a snake lady tattooed on his arm its ogilvie said conklin his voice distant bryce ogilvie my god they did link up medusa found the jackal chapter fourteen a gunfight in his bedroom at the hotel metropole conklin quickly replaced the telephone taking his graz burya automatic out of the bedside table drawer and pushing it into his belt he crossed to the livingroom door bourne was standing in front of a window was that krupkin asked bourne it was move away from there carlos bourne immediately stepped back and turned to conklin he knows were in moscow he asked then added he knows where we are the answers are yes to both questions last night he killed rodchenko and also krupkins two agents who were following him god hes gone mad but why do you think one of the agents suffered a lot of pain before he died he was our driver from the airport he was also the son of a friend of krupkins not trained for what he had to suffer krupkin thinks he probably talked im sorry about the loss of life i mean that i wish it could have happened another way said bourne we cant do anything about that now krupkins on his way with an assault team but he hasnt told the hotel staff the place has to look normal yes well take him here bourne noticed the gun in conklins belt he gestured at the weapon thats a little obvious isnt it for whom room service replied bourne i phoned for some breakfast and a large pot of coffee no i promised krupkin that we wouldnt let anybody in here thats ridiculous almost my words but this is his country not ours wait a minute said bourne suppose hes right bourne reached under his jacket pulled out his own graz burya and started for the hallway door of the suite what are you doing cried conklin get over there ordered bourne pointing to the far left corner of the room ill leave the door unlocked and when the steward gets here tell him to come in in russian what about you theres a recess down the hall ill wait there bourne opened the door glanced up and down the passage and rushed out he raced to the recess occupied by a pepsi machine and crouched by the right interior wall he waited his knees and legs aching pains he never felt a few years ago and then he heard the sounds of rolling wheels they grew louder and louder as a cart covered with a tablecloth passed and moved to the door of the suite the floor steward was a young man in his twenties blond and short cautiously he knocked on the door not carlos thought bourne getting painfully to his feet he could hear conklins voice telling the steward to enter and as the young man opened the door pushing the cart inside bourne calmly replaced his weapon he bent over rubbing his right leg it happened suddenly a figure in black came out of an unseen recess farther down the passage racing past the machine bourne spun back into the wall it was the jackal madness at full force carlos hit the steward with his right shoulder pushing the young man across the hallway and crashing the cart over on its side food and coffee spilling across the carpeted floor suddenly the steward moved to his left as astonishingly he pulled a weapon from his belt the jackal either sensed or caught the movement in the corner of his eye he spun around his machine pistol on rapid fire pinning the blond russian into the wall bullets tearing through the stewards head and body in that long horrible moment the barrel of bournes graz burya caught in the waistline of his pants he tore the fabric as the eyes of carlos swept up centering on his own anger and victory in the assassins stare bourne pulled the gun loose spinning crouching back into the small recess as the jackals bullets blew apart the front of the soft drink machine on his stomach bourne moved across the opening the graz burya raised and firing as fast as he could at the same time there were other gunshots not those of a machine pistol conklin was firing from inside the suite they had carlos in their cross fire it was possible it could all end in a hotel passage in moscow let it happen let it happen the jackal roared angry at having been hit bourne threw himself back into the recess again he crouched like an angry caged animal the wounded carlos kept firing bursts from his weapon two frightened screams came from the far end of the hallway one male one female a couple had been wounded or killed in the storm of bullets get down conklin screamed from across the passage take cover bourne did as he was told pushing himself into the corner of the recess protecting his head as much as possible the first explosion shook the walls somewhere and then a second one much nearer in the hallway itself grenades smoke mixed with the broken glass gunshots nine one after another a graz burya automatic alex bourne got up from the corner of the recess and moved through the opening conklin stood outside the door of their suite he searched the pockets of his pants he ran around the corner into the other passage my guns empty and i dont have any more bullets i do and im a lot faster than you said bourne reloading his gun get back in there and call downstairs tell them to clear the area krupkin said i dont care what he said tell them to shut down the elevators close all stair exits and stay away from this floor bourne raced down the hallway slowing as he approached the couple who lay on the carpet each moved in pain their clothes were spotted with blood but they moved he turned and shouted to conklin get help up through here he ordered pointing at an exit door down the passage theyre alive he moved on but he knew already that it was too late to catch up with carlos a day later bourne conklin and krupkin sat in the living room of the hotel suite waiting for news the door opened and the kgb officer who called himself a captain entered he looked at the three men and spat out one word novgorod what the men cried together you the officer addressed bourne switching to english you understood i know the name bourne said he broke into a weapons store at kubinka he killed the staff there though some escaped he stole guns plastic explosives heatseeking missiles the store is on the road to novgorod hes going back to the place of his birth said krupkin to the training camp where ilich ramirez sanchez became carlos the jackal hes going there because he was thrown out marked for death as a madman what will he do in novgorod asked bourne quietly who knows he intends to leave his mark no doubt in answer to the people he believes betrayed him more than thirty years ago he probably has papers to get him inside i cant believe he hasnt but well stop him dont even try said bourne he may or may not use the papers like me he doesnt need them to get inside but if he senses something is wrong and he will hell kill a number of good men and still get in what are you saying asked krupkin cautiously get me inside ahead of him with a detailed map of the whole complex and a document that allows me to go wherever i want to youve lost your senses cried krupkin an american an assassin inside novgorod i havent the slightest interest in your training facility my only concern is carlos i want him dead and so do you all right said conklin from his chair his eyes on the ceiling he looked straight at krupkin lets deal you get him into novgorod and you keep ogilvie weve already got him aleksei you havent washington knows hes here so so i can say you lost him and theyll believe me think of it no world court embarrassments none of the problems caused by holding an american accused of international crimes you take over the medusa operation with no complications and who better to be in charge than you a cultured man with experience of living in the west forget the house in geneva kruppie how about a villa on the black sea it is a most intelligent and attractive offer said krupkin thoughtfully no no no shouted the kgb officer this is crazy oh for gods sake shut up roared krupkin were talking about things you cannot possibly understand what like a young child criticized by an adult the officer was both surprised and frightened by krupkins words very well said krupkin his own eyes now on the ceiling the order will be issued secretly its origins untraceable how fast can i get there asked bourne theres a lot i have to organize we have an airport in vnokova under our control no more than an hour away first i must make arrangements hand me a telephone you my stupid comrade the officer moved quickly bringing a phone to krupkins table one more thing bourne said have tass put out an immediate news release with heavy coverage in the newspapers radio and television that the assassin known as jason bourne died of his wounds here in moscow dont give too much detail but they will need to know something of what happened here this morning thats not difficult tass is an obedient servant of the state chapter fifteen novgorod novgorod it was a work of great inventiveness cut out of the immense forests along the volkhov river from the moment bourne appeared from the deep underground tunnel below the water with its guards gates and many cameras he was close to being in a state of shock the american compound presumably like those of the other countries was broken up into sections built on areas up to a kilometer square each distinctly separate from the others one area on the banks of the river might be the heart of a maine village by the ocean another further inland a small southern town another a busy city street each was completely real with the appropriate vehicles police stores and drugstores gas stations and office buildings the people tass the official news service of the soviet union who worked there dressed as local people would obviously as important as the physical appearances was language not just the use of excellent english but the mastery of regional differences as bourne wandered from one section to another he heard all around him the distinctive sounds of new england of texas of the midwest and the large eastern cities it was all unbelievable bourne followed the signs everything was in english to the city of rockledge florida he was going to meet a man called benjamin at a lunch counter in the local woolworth store he was looking for a man in his midtwenties with a budweiser baseball cap on the high chair beside him saving the place it was time three thirtyfive in the afternoon he saw him the sandyhaired russian was seated at the far right end of the counter there were half a dozen men and women along the row talking to one another over soft drinks and snacks bourne approached the empty seat glanced down at the cap and spoke politely is this taken he asked im waiting for somebody replied the young kgb trainer im just having a quick coke ill be out of here in a few minutes sit down said benjamin removing the hat and putting it on his head a waiter came by and bourne ordered his drink arrived and the kgb trainer continued quietly so youre archie and youre benjamin nice to know you well both find out if thats a fact wont we do we have a problem i dont approve of you being here ive lived in the united states and i sound american but i dont like americans listen to me ben interrupted bourne his eyes forcing the trainer to look at him i havent the slightest interest in the purpose of novgorod although the whole complex is a lot more impressive than disneyland benjamin tried hard not to laugh and failed come on said bourne lets take a walk eight hours later at exactly am the telephone in the command suite screamed benjamin leaped off the couch and grabbed the phone yes where when and hes inside yes he put the phone down and turned to bourne its unbelievable at the spanish tunnel across the river two guards are dead and on this side the officer of the guard was found fifty meters away from his post a bullet in his throat they ran the video tapes and all they saw was an unidentified man walking through carrying a bag in a guards uniform what else asked bourne coldly on the other side was a dead farm worker holding torn papers in his hand he was lying between the two murdered guards one of them only wearing his shorts and shoes how did he do it the farm worker was working for him carlos must have paid him a lot and sent him in with rotten false papers then run in himself the officer appeared at the right time and caught the farm worker and in the confusion carlos got through the tunnel but the papers he used everything had to be checked against the computer those were krupkins instructions i think you have to accept that carlos has somebody inside here somebody with authority thats possible agreed the young trainer rapidly so lets go and when we get outside we stop somewhere and you get me what i need ok thats been approved the jackal braked the huge fuel truck at the west german border he adjusted the coarse shirt that covered a spanish generals uniform and as the guard came out of the gatehouse carlos spoke in russian using the same words he had used at every other crossing dont ask me to speak the stupid language you talk here i deliver gas i dont spend time in classrooms heres my key i barely speak it myself comrade said the guard laughing as he accepted the small flat object and pushed it into the computerized machine the heavy iron barrier moved up into the vertical position the guard returned the key and the jackal sped through into a small west berlin in the narrow copy of a main street he slowed down and pulled the gas release the fuel flowed out into the street he then reached into the open bag on the seat beside him took out the small pretimed plastic explosives and as he had done throughout the southern compounds to the border of france threw them through the lowered windows on both sides of the truck toward the wooden buildings he thought would burn best he sped into the munich section then to the port of bremerhaven on the river and finally into bonn flooding the street throwing out the explosives he had barely fifteen minutes before the first explosions took place in all of west germany followed by explosions in the other compounds each spaced eight minutes apart timed to create maximum effect and while the fire engines raced here and there and the frightened people tried to escape ilich ramirez sanchez would burn paris then would come england and finally the largest compound in novgorod the united states of america country of the secondrate assassin jason bourne carlos checked his bag what remained were the most dangerous instruments of death found in the weapons store of kubinka four rows of short heatseeking missiles twenty in all when they were sent into the sky each would seek the sources of fire and do its work bourne stopped the jeep at the entrance to the french compound and handed the guard his computerized card quickly please he said in french the guard walked rapidly to the security machine as an enormous fuel truck heading the other way passed through into england the guard returned and the iron barrier was raised bourne accelerated and saw in a matter of moments a threefloor copy of the eiffel tower slow down said benjamin touching his arm what is it stop cried the young trainer shut off the engine bourne drove to the side of the road and switched off whats the matter with you benjamin was looking around him his eyes on the clear night sky no clouds he said no storms so what i want to get up to the spanish compound there it goes again now bourne heard it far away the sound of distant thunder but the night was clear it happened again and again and again one deep sound after another there shouted the young soviet standing up in the jeep and pointing to the north what is it thats fire young man answered bourne softly as he also stood up and stared at the yellow light in the distant sky and my guess is its the spanish compound he was initially trained there and thats what he came back to do to blow the place up its his revenge get down weve got to get up there no youre wrong benjamin interrupted quickly lowering himself into the seat as bourne started the engine and pulled the jeep into gear spains no more than eight kilometers from here those fires are a lot farther away just show me the fastest route said bourne pressing the accelerator to the floor as they came in sight of the spanish border the explosions were louder and the night sky turned a brighter shade of yellow the guards at the gate were talking quickly into their telephones and handheld radios the sounds of police cars and fire engines were joining the shouting and the screaming whats happening shouted benjamin leaping from the jeep and speaking russian im senior staff he added slipping the card into the release equipment sending the barrier up tell me madness comrade shouted an officer from the gatehouse window unbelievable first west germany all over there are explosions and fires in the streets and buildings going up in flames then it happens in italy rome burns down and in the greek section and still the explosions continue another wall phone rang inside the gatehouse the officer of the guard picked it up then screamed at the top of his lungs madness its complete madness are you certain what is it roared benjamin rushing to the window egypt he screamed his ear pressed to the telephone israel fires everywhere bombs everywhere get back here shouted bourne benjamin ran to the jeep and jumped in as bourne accelerated through the gate it was the fuel truck that damned fuel truck that passed us at the french border that was him yes but where are we going benjamin shouted itll end in the american compound it has to the copy of the white house fell in flames and pennsylvania avenue was on fire bourne stopped the jeep in the street beside the river and again there were frightened crowds the police were shouting through loudspeakers first in english then in russian explaining that the river was wired and that the electricity would kill anybody trying to swim across the searchlights showed the floating bodies of those who had tried this in the northern compounds the tunnel the tunnel open the tunnel bourne leaped out of the jeep pocketing three flares and fought his way through the crowds benjamin ran after him there in the fencedoff parking lot was the fuel truck he broke through the guards holding up his computerized release card and ran up to a captain with an ak on his waist my identification is with the name archie and you can check it immediately of course we know of you the officer cried but what can i do this is an uncontrollable situation has anybody passed through the tunnel in the last half hour no one absolutely no one our orders are to keep it closed good get on the loudspeakers and tell the crowds to break up tell them the crisis has passed and the danger with it how can i the fires are everywhere the explosions everywhere do as he says roared benjamins voice behind bourne who gives me such orders shouted the officer check my authority friend but do it quickly answered benjamin holding out his card move you fool attention the voice came from the many loudspeakers around the tunnel as the explosions began to die down the crisis has passed stay by the banks of the river and we will look after you these are orders from our superiors comrades but were being attacked shouted a man at the front of the panicked crowd open the tunnel and let us out or youll have to shoot us down open the tunnel the people cried the protesting voices grew louder can you operate the tunnels machinery bourne shouted yes everybody on the senior staff can its part of the job the iron gates you told me about of course where are the controls the guardhouse get in there shouted bourne to benjamin taking one of the flares out of his fieldjacket pocket and handing it to him when you see one of my flares go over the crowd lower those gates on this side only this side understood what for my rules ben do it then light this flare and throw it out the window so ill know its done then what something you may not want to do but you have to take the gun from the captains body and force the crowd shoot it back into the street rapid fire into the ground in front of them or above them do whatever you have to do the trainer named benjamin looked angrily at bourne then turned and began fighting his way to the guardhouse bourne studied the fenced parking area counting the other vehicles in addition to the fuel truck there were nine parked by the fencesix cars and three vans all americanmade or good copies bourne crouched and crawled forward he reached the waisthigh fence the noise behind him continuous deafening then from an opening he could not see two police cars raced inside uniformed men leaped out from every door and ran to the open gate that led to the guardhouse and tunnel there was a break in space in time in men three men had come out of the second car but now there were four but he was not the same the uniform was not the same the officers cap had a gold ribbon and the shape was wrong for the us army what was it and suddenly bourne understood his memory went back years to madrid it was a spanish uniform that was it carlos had entered through the spanish compound and as his russian was excellent he was using the highranking uniform to make his escape from novgorod bourne got to his feet his automatic in his hand and ran across the lot his left hand reaching into his field jacket pocket for a flare he pulled the release and threw it above the cars benjamin would not see it from the guardhouse and mistake it for the signal to close the gates of the tunnel look out roared one of the escaping men turning around and panicked at the sight of the blinding flare run shouted another racing toward the open section of the fence bourne counted the seven figures as one by one they ran away from the last car and passed through the opening joining the excited crowds at the mouth of the tunnel the eighth man did not appear the spanish officers uniform was not in sight the jackal was trapped now bourne took out a flare pulled the release and threw it with all his strength at the guardhouse do it ben he screamed in silence as he took out the last grenade do it now a thunderous roar came from the tunnel frightened protests from the crowd then two rapid bursts of automatic gunfire were followed by commands over the speakers shouted in russian bourne dropped to the ground looking at the undersides of the vehicles a pair of legs in boots behind the third car on the left he gripped the grenade in his right hand pulled the pin and threw it under the car toward the legs only at the last moment realizing that he had made a terrible error the legs behind the car did not move the boots remained in place because they were only boots bourne threw himself away from the car onto the ground and curled his body into the smallest mass he could manage the explosion was deafening pieces of glass and metal stinging bournes back and legs he got to his feet in the smoke and fire as he did so the ground was torn up around him he ran toward the protection of the nearest vehicle a squareshaped van he was hit twice in the shoulder and thigh youre nothing compared to me jason bourne screamed carlos the jackal his automatic weapon on rapid fire you never were youre a pretender a fraud then come and get me bourne moved to the drivers door pulled it open then ran to the back of the vehicle where he crouched his face to the edge his colt next to his cheek the jackal stopped his continuous fire bourne understood carlos faced the open door unsure indecisive only seconds to go metal against metal a gun barrel was pushed against the door shutting it now bourne spun around the edge of the van his weapon firing into the spanish uniform blowing the gun out of the jackals hands one two three the bullets flew through the air and then they stopped they stopped as the gun stuck refusing to fire carlos dropped to the ground for his weapon his left arm limp and bleeding but his right hand still strong bourne pulled out his knife and leaped forward slicing the blade down toward the jackals arm he was too late carlos held the weapon bournes hand held the hot barrel hold on hold on you cant let it go twist it use the knife with a last desperate effort bourne pushed up and crashed carlos back into the side of the van striking his wounded shoulder again and again the jackal screamed dropping the weapon then kicked it under the van where the blow came from bourne at first did not know he only knew that the left side of his head seemed suddenly to split in two then he realized that he had done it to himself he had slipped on the bloodcovered ground and had crashed into the side of the van it did not matter nothing mattered carlos the jackal was racing away with the confusion everywhere there were a hundred ways he could get out of novgorod it had all been for nothing still there was his last grenade why not bourne removed it pulled the pin and threw it over the van into the center of the parking area the explosion followed and bourne got to his feet maybe the grenade would tell benjamin something warn him to keep his eyes on the area barely able to walk bourne started for the break in the fence that led to the guardhouse and the tunnel oh god marie i failed im so sorry nothing it was all for nothing and then as if all novgorod were having a final laugh at

against the glass as the tunnel filled with the waters of the volkhov river then within the silence of the growing moving liquid there was an object a thing a body bourne stared in shock unable to release the cry that was in him he gathered what strength he had left and ran unsteadily to the wall of glass breathlessly he placed his hands against it and looked at the scene barely centimeters in front of him the dead body of carlos the jackal kept crashing back and forward into the steel bars of the gate his features twisted in hate jason bourne watched in satisfaction his mouth tight the face of a killer a killer among killers who had won briefly however the softer eyes of david webb appeared forming the face of a man for whom the weight of a world he hated had been removed the end
