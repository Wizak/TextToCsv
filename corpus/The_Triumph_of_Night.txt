 i it was clear that the sleigh from weymore had not come and the shivering young traveller from boston who had counted on jumping into it when he left the train at northridge junction found himself standing alone on the open platform exposed to the full assault of nightfall and winter the blast that swept him came off new hampshire snowfields and icehung forests it seemed to have traversed interminable leagues of frozen silence filling them with the same cold roar and sharpening its edge against the same bitter blackandwhite landscape dark searching and swordlike it alternately muffled and harried its victim like a bullfighter now whirling his cloak and now planting his darts this analogy brought home to the young man the fact that he himself had no cloak and that the overcoat in which he had faced the relatively temperate air of boston seemed no thicker than a sheet of paper on the bleak heights of northridge george faxon said to himself that the place was uncommonly wellnamed it clung to an exposed ledge over the valley from which the train had lifted him and the wind combed it with teeth of steel that he seemed actually to hear scraping against the wooden sides of the station other building there was none the village lay far down the road and thither since the weymore sleigh had not come faxon saw himself under the necessity of plodding through several feet of snow he understood well enough what had happened his hostess had forgotten that he was coming young as faxon was this sad lucidity of soul had been acquired as the result of long experience and he knew that the visitors who can least afford to hire a carriage are almost always those whom their hosts forget to send for yet to say that mrs culme had forgotten him was too crude a way of putting it similar incidents led him to think that she had probably told her maid to tell the butler to telephone the coachman to tell one of the grooms if no one else needed him to drive over to northridge to fetch the new secretary but on a night like this what groom who respected his rights would fail to forget the order faxons obvious course was to struggle through the drifts to the village and there rout out a sleigh to convey him to weymore but what if on his arrival at mrs culmes no one remembered to ask him what this devotion to duty had cost that again was one of the contingencies he had expensively learned to look out for and the perspicacity so acquired told him it would be cheaper to spend the night at the northridge inn and advise mrs culme of his presence there by telephone he had reached this decision and was about to entrust his luggage to a vague man with a lantern when his hopes were raised by the sound of bells two sleighs were just dashing up to the station and from the foremost there sprang a young man muffled in furs weymore no these are not the weymore sleighs the voice was that of the youth who had jumped to the platform a voice so agreeable that in spite of the words it fell consolingly on faxons ears at the same moment the wandering stationlantern casting a transient light on the speaker showed his features to be in the pleasantest harmony with his voice he was very fair and very young hardly in the twenties faxon thought but his face though full of a morning freshness was a trifle too thin and finedrawn as though a vivid spirit contended in him with a strain of physical weakness faxon was perhaps the quicker to notice such delicacies of balance because his own temperament hung on lightly quivering nerves which yet as he believed would never quite swing him beyond a normal sensibility you expected a sleigh from weymore the newcomer continued standing beside faxon like a slender column of fur mrs culmes secretary explained his difficulty and the other brushed it aside with a contemptuous oh mrs culme that carried both speakers a long way toward reciprocal understanding but then you must be the youth broke off with a smile of interrogation the new secretary yes but apparently there are no notes to be answered this evening faxons laugh deepened the sense of solidarity which had so promptly established itself between the two his friend laughed also mrs culme he explained was lunching at my uncles today and she said you were due this evening but seven hours is a long time for mrs culme to remember anything well said faxon philosophically i suppose thats one of the reasons why she needs a secretary and ive always the inn at northridge he concluded oh but you havent though it burned down last week the deuce it did said faxon but the humour of the situation struck him before its inconvenience his life for years past had been mainly a succession of resigned adaptations and he had learned before dealing practically with his embarrassments to extract from most of them a small tribute of amusement oh well theres sure to be somebody in the place who can put me up no one you could put up with besides northridge is three miles off and our place in the opposite direction is a little nearer through the darkness faxon saw his friend sketch a gesture of selfintroduction my names frank rainer and im staying with my uncle at overdale ive driven over to meet two friends of his who are due in a few minutes from new york if you dont mind waiting till they arrive im sure overdale can do you better than northridge were only down from town for a few days but the house is always ready for a lot of people but your uncle faxon could only object with the odd sense through his embarrassment that it would be magically dispelled by his invisible friends next words oh my uncle youll see i answer for him i daresay youve heard of him john lavington john lavington there was a certain irony in asking if one had heard of john lavington even from a post of observation as obscure as that of mrs culmes secretary the rumour of john lavingtons money of his pictures his politics his charities and his hospitality was as difficult to escape as the roar of a cataract in a mountain solitude it might almost have been said that the one place in which one would not have expected to come upon him was in just such a solitude as now surrounded the speakers at least in this deepest hour of its desertedness but it was just like lavingtons brilliant ubiquity to put one in the wrong even there oh yes ive heard of your uncle then you will come wont you weve only five minutes to wait young rainer urged in the tone that dispels scruples by ignoring them and faxon found himself accepting the invitation as simply as it was offered a delay in the arrival of the new york train lengthened their five minutes to fifteen and as they paced the icy platform faxon began to see why it had seemed the most natural thing in the world to accede to his new acquaintances suggestion it was because frank rainer was one of the privileged beings who simplify human intercourse by the atmosphere of confidence and good humour they diffuse he produced this effect faxon noted by the exercise of no gift but his youth and of no art but his sincerity and these qualities were revealed in a smile of such sweetness that faxon felt as never before what nature can achieve when she deigns to match the face with the mind he learned that the young man was the ward and the only nephew of john lavington with whom he had made his home since the death of his mother the great mans sister mr lavington rainer said had been a regular brick to him but then he is to every one you know and the young fellows situation seemed in fact to be perfectly in keeping with his person apparently the only shade that had ever rested on him was cast by the physical weakness which faxon had already detected young rainer had been threatened with tuberculosis and the disease was so far advanced that according to the highest authorities banishment to arizona or new mexico was inevitable but luckily my uncle didnt pack me off as most people would have done without getting another opinion whose oh an awfully clever chap a young doctor with a lot of new ideas who simply laughed at my being sent away and said id do perfectly well in new york if i didnt dine out too much and if i dashed off occasionally to northridge for a little fresh air so its really my uncles doing that im not in exile and i feel no end better since the new chap told me i neednt bother young rainer went on to confess that he was extremely fond of dining out dancing and similar distractions and faxon listening to him was inclined to think that the physician who had refused to cut him off altogether from these pleasures was probably a better psychologist than his seniors all the same you ought to be careful you know the sense of elderbrotherly concern that forced the words from faxon made him as he spoke slip his arm through frank rainer s the latter met the movement with a responsive pressure oh i am awfully awfully and then my uncle has such an eye on me but if your uncle has such an eye on you what does he say to your swallowing knives out here in this siberian wild rainer raised his fur collar with a careless gesture its not that that does it the colds good for me and its not the dinners and dances what is it then faxon goodhumouredly insisted to which his companion answered with a laugh well my uncle says its being bored and i rather think hes right his laugh ended in a spasm of coughing and a struggle for breath that made faxon still holding his arm guide him hastily into the shelter of the fireless waitingroom young rainer had dropped down on the bench against the wall and pulled off one of his fur gloves to grope for a handkerchief he tossed aside his cap and drew the handkerchief across his forehead which was intensely white and beaded with moisture though his face retained a healthy glow but faxons gaze remained fastened to the hand he had uncovered it was so long so colourless so wasted so much older than the brow he passed it over its queer a healthy face but dying hands the secretary mused he somehow wished young rainer had kept on his glove the whistle of the express drew the young men to their feet and the next moment two heavilyfurred gentlemen had descended to the platform and were breasting the rigour of the night frank rainer introduced them as mr grisben and mr balch and faxon while their luggage was being lifted into the second sleigh discerned them by the roving lanterngleam to be an elderly greyheaded pair of the average prosperous business cut they saluted their hosts nephew with friendly familiarity and mr grisben who seemed the spokesman of the two ended his greeting with a genial and many many more of them dear boy which suggested to faxon that their arrival coincided with an anniversary but he could not press the enquiry for the seat allotted him was at the coachmans side while frank rainer joined his uncles guests inside the sleigh a swift flight behind such horses as one could be sure of john lavingtons having brought them to tall gateposts an illuminated lodge and an avenue on which the snow had been levelled to the smoothness of marble at the end of the avenue the long house loomed up its principal bulk dark but one wing sending out a ray of welcome and the next moment faxon was receiving a violent impression of warmth and light of hothouse plants hurrying servants a vast spectacular oak hall like a stagesetting and in its unreal middle distance a small figure correctly dressed conventionally featured and utterly unlike his rather florid conception of the great john lavington the surprise of the contrast remained with him through his hurried dressing in the large luxurious bedroom to which he had been shown i dont see where he comes in was the only way he could put it so difficult was it to fit the exuberance of lavingtons public personality into his hosts contracted frame and manner mr laving ton to whom faxons case had been rapidly explained by young rainer had welcomed him with a sort of dry and stilted cordiality that exactly matched his narrow face his stiff hand and the whiff of scent on his evening handkerchief make yourself at home at home he had repeated in a tone that suggested on his own part a complete inability to perform the feat he urged on his visitor any friend of franks delighted make yourself thoroughly at home ii in spite of the balmy temperature and complicated conveniences of faxons bedroom the injunction was not easy to obey it was wonderful luck to have found a nights shelter under the opulent roof of overdale and he tasted the physical satisfaction to the full but the place for all its ingenuities of comfort was oddly cold and unwelcoming he couldnt have said why and could only suppose that mr lavingtons intense personality intensely negative but intense all the same must in some occult way have penetrated every corner of his dwelling perhaps though it was merely that faxon himself was tired and hungry more deeply chilled than he had known till he came in from the cold and unutterably sick of all strange houses and of the prospect of perpetually treading other peoples stairs i hope youre not famished rainers slim figure was in the doorway my uncle has a little business to attend to with mr grisben and we dont dine for half an hour shall i fetch you or can you find your way down come straight to the diningroom the second door on the left of the long gallery he disappeared leaving a ray of warmth behind him and faxon relieved lit a cigarette and sat down by the fire looking about with less haste he was struck by a detail that had escaped him the room was full of flowers a mere bachelors room in the wing of a house opened only for a few days in the dead middle of a new hampshire winter flowers were everywhere not in senseless profusion but placed with the same conscious art that he had remarked in the grouping of the blossoming shrubs in the hall a vase of arums stood on the writingtable a cluster of strangehued carnations on the stand at his elbow and from bowls of glass and porcelain clumps of freesiabulbs diffused their melting fragrance the fact implied acres of glass but that was the least interesting part of it the flowers themselves their quality selection and arrangement attested on some ones part and on whose but john lavingtons a solicitous and sensitive passion for that particular form of beauty well it simply made the man as he had appeared to faxon all the harder to understand the halfhour elapsed and faxon rejoicing at the prospect of food set out to make his way to the diningroom he had not noticed the direction he had followed in going to his room and was puzzled when he left it to find that two staircases of apparently equal importance invited him he chose the one to his right and reached at its foot a long gallery such as rainer had described the gallery was empty the doors down its length were closed but rainer had said the second to the left and faxon after pausing for some chance enlightenment which did not come laid his hand on the second knob to the left the room he entered was square with dusky picturehung walls in its centre about a table lit by veiled lamps he fancied mr lavington and his guests to be already seated at dinner then he perceived that the table was covered not with viands but with papers and that he had blundered into what seemed to be his hosts study as he paused frank rainer looked up oh heres mr faxon why not ask him mr lavington from the end of the table reflected his nephews smile in a glance of impartial benevolence certainly come in mr faxon if you wont think it a liberty mr grisben who sat opposite his host turned his head toward the door of course mr faxons an american citizen frank rainer laughed thats all right oh no not one of your pinpointed pens uncle jack havent you got a quill somewhere mr balch who spoke slowly and as if reluctantly in a muffled voice of which there seemed to be very little left raised his hand to say one moment you acknowledge this to be my last will and testament rainers laugh redoubled well i wont answer for the last its the first anyway its a mere formula mr balch explained well here goes rainer dipped his quill in the inkstand his uncle had pushed in his direction and dashed a gallant signature across the document faxon understanding what was expected of him and conjecturing that the young man was signing his will on the attainment of his majority had placed himself behind mr grisben and stood awaiting his turn to affix his name to the instrument rainer having signed was about to push the paper across the table to mr balch but the latter again raising his hand said in his sad imprisoned voice the seal oh does there have to be a seal faxon looking over mr grisben at john lavington saw a faint frown between his impassive eyes really frank he seemed faxon thought slightly irritated by his nephews frivolity whos got a seal frank rainer continued glancing about the table there doesnt seem to be one here mr grisben interposed a wafer will do lavington you have a wafer mr lavington had recovered his serenity there must be some in one of the drawers but im ashamed to say i dont know where my secretary keeps these things he ought to have seen to it that a wafer was sent with the document oh hang it frank rainer pushed the paper aside its the hand of god and im as hungry as a wolf lets dine first uncle jack i think ive a seal upstairs said faxon mr lavington sent him a barely perceptible smile so sorry to give you the trouble oh i say dont send him after it now lets wait till after dinner mr lavington continued to smile on his guest and the latter as if under the faint coercion of the smile turned from the room and ran upstairs having taken the seal from his writingcase he came down again and once more opened the door of the study no one was speaking when he entered they were evidently awaiting his return with the mute impatience of hunger and he put the seal in rainers reach and stood watching while mr grisben struck a match and held it to one of the candles flanking the inkstand as the wax descended on the paper faxon remarked again the strange emaciation the premature physical weariness of the hand that held it he wondered if mr lavington had ever noticed his nephews hand and if it were not poignantly visible to him now with this thought in his mind faxon raised his eyes to look at mr lavington the great mans gaze rested on frank rainer with an expression of untroubled benevolence and at the same instant faxons attention was attracted by the presence in the room of another person who must have joined the group while he was upstairs searching for the seal the newcomer was a man of about mr lavingtons age and figure who stood just behind his chair and who at the moment when faxon first saw him was gazing at young rainer with an equal intensity of attention the likeness between the two men perhaps increased by the fact that the hooded lamps on the table left the figure behind the chair in shadow struck faxon the more because of the contrast in their expression john lavington during his nephews clumsy attempt to drop the wax and apply the seal continued to fasten on him a look of halfamused affection while the man behind the chair so oddly reduplicating the lines of his features and figure turned on the boy a face of pale hostility the impression was so startling that faxon forgot what was going on about him he was just dimly aware of young reiners exclaiming your turn mr grisben of mr grisbens protesting no no mr faxon first and of the pens being thereupon transferred to his own hand he received it with a deadly sense of being unable to move or even to understand what was expected of him till he became conscious of mr grisbens paternally pointing out the precise spot on which he was to leave his autograph the effort to fix his attention and steady his hand prolonged the process of signing and when he stood up a strange weight of fatigue on all his limbs the figure behind mr lavingtons chair was gone faxon felt an immediate sense of relief it was puzzling that the mans exit should have been so rapid and noiseless but the door behind mr lavington was screened by a tapestry hanging and faxon concluded that the unknown lookeron had merely had to raise it to pass out at any rate he was gone and with his withdrawal the strange weight was lifted young rainer was lighting a cigarette mr balch inscribing his name at the foot of the document mr lavington his eyes no longer on his nephew examining a strange whitewinged orchid in the vase at his elbow every thing suddenly seemed to have grown natural and simple again and faxon found himself responding with a smile to the affable gesture with which his host declared and now mr faxon well dine iii i wonder how i blundered into the wrong room just now i thought you told me to take the second door to the left faxon said to frank rainer as they followed the older men down the gallery so i did but i probably forgot to tell you which staircase to take coming from your bedroom i ought to have said the fourth door to the right its a puzzling house because my uncle keeps adding to it from year to year he built this room last summer for his modern pictures young rainer pausing to open another door touched an electric button which sent a circle of light about the walls of a long room hung with canvases of the french impressionist school faxon advanced attracted by a shimmering monet but rainer laid a hand on his arm he bought that last week but come along ill show you all this after dinner or he will rather he loves it does he really love things rainer stared clearly perplexed at the question rather flowers and pictures especially havent you noticed the flowers i suppose you think his manners cold it seems so at first but hes really awfully keen about things faxon looked quickly at the speaker has your uncle a brother brother no never had he and my mother were the only ones or any relation who who looks like him who might be mistaken for him not that i ever heard of does he remind you of some one yes thats queer well ask him if hes got a double come on but another picture had arrested faxon and some minutes elapsed before he and his young host reached the diningroom it was a large room with the same conventionally handsome furniture and delicately grouped flowers and faxons first glance showed him that only three men were seated about the diningtable the man who had stood behind mr lavingtons chair was not present and no seat awaited him when the young men entered mr grisben was speaking and his host who faced the door sat looking down at his untouched soupplate and turning the spoon about in his small dry hand its pretty late to call them rumours they were devilish close to facts when we left town this morning mr grisben was saying with an unexpected incisiveness of tone mr lavington laid down his spoon and smiled interrogatively oh facts what are facts just the way a thing happens to look at a given minute you havent heard anything from town mr grisben persisted not a syllable so you see balch a little more of that petite marmite mr faxon between frank and mr grisben please the dinner progressed through a series of complicated courses ceremoniously dispensed by a prelatical butler attended by three tall footmen and it was evident that mr lavington took a certain satisfaction in the pageant that faxon reflected was probably the joint in his armour that and the flowers he had changed the subject not abruptly but firmly when the young men entered but faxon perceived that it still possessed the thoughts of the two elderly visitors and mr balch presently observed in a voice that seemed to come from the last survivor down a mineshaft if it does come it will be the biggest crash since mr lavington looked bored but polite wall street can stand crashes better than it could then its got a robuster constitution yes but speaking of constitutions mr grisben intervened frank are you taking care of yourself a flush rose to young rainers cheeks why of course isnt that what im here for youre here about three days in the month arent you and the rest of the time its crowded restaurants and hot ballrooms in town i thought you were to be shipped off to new mexico oh ive got a new man who says thats rot well you dont look as if your new man were right said mr grisben bluntly faxon saw the lads colour fade and the rings of shadow deepen under his gay eyes at the same moment his uncle turned to him with a renewed intensity of attention there was such solicitude in mr lavingtons gaze that it seemed almost to fling a shield between his nephew and mr grisbens tactless scrutiny we think franks a good deal better he began this new doctor the butler coming up bent to whisper a word in his ear and the communication caused a sudden change in mr lavingtons expression his face was naturally so colourless that it seemed not so much to pale as to fade to dwindle and recede into something blurred and blottedout he half rose sat down again and sent a rigid smile about the table will you excuse me the telephone peters go on with the dinner with small precise steps he walked out of the door which one of the footmen had thrown open a momentary silence fell on the group then mr grisben once more addressed himself to rainer you ought to have gone my boy you ought to have gone the anxious look returned to the youths eyes my uncle doesnt think so really youre not a baby to be always governed by your uncles opinion you came of age today didnt you your uncle spoils you thats whats the matter the thrust evidently went home for rainer laughed and looked down with a slight accession of colour but the doctor use your common sense frank you had to try twenty doctors to find one to tell you what you wanted to be told a look of apprehension overshadowed rainer gaiety oh come i say what would you do he stammered pack up and jump on the first train mr grisben leaned forward and laid his hand kindly on the young mans arm look here my nephew jim grisben is out there ranching on a big scale hell take you in and be glad to have you you say your new doctor thinks it wont do you any good but he doesnt pretend to say it will do you harm does he well then give it a trial itll take you out of hot theatres and night restaurants anyhow and all the rest of it eh balch go said mr balch hollowly go at once he added as if a closer look at the youths face had impressed on him the need of backing up his friend young rainer had turned ashypale he tried to stiffen his mouth into a smile do i look as bad as all that mr grisben was helping himself to terrapin you look like the day after an earthquake he said the terrapin had encircled the table and been deliberately enjoyed by mr lavingtons three visitors rainer faxon noticed left his plate untouched before the door was thrown open to readmit their host mr lavington advanced with an air of recovered composure he seated himself picked up his napkin and consulted the goldmonogrammed menu no dont bring back the filet some terrapin yes he looked affably about the table sorry to have deserted you but the storm has played the deuce with the wires and i had to wait a long time before i could get a good connection it must be blowing up for a blizzard uncle jack young rainer broke out mr grisbens been lecturing me mr lavington was helping himself to terrapin ah what about he thinks i ought to have given new mexico a show i want him to go straight out to my nephew at santa paz and stay there till his next birthday mr lavington signed to the butler to hand the terrapin to mr grisben who as he took a second helping addressed himself again to rainer jims in new york now and going back the day after tomorrow in olyphants private car ill ask olyphant to squeeze you in if youll go and when youve been out there a week or two in the saddle all day and sleeping nine hours a night i suspect you wont think much of the doctor who prescribed new york faxon spoke up he knew not why i was out there once its a splendid life i saw a fellow oh a really bad case whod been simply made over by it it does sound jolly rainer laughed a sudden eagerness in his tone his uncle looked at him gently perhaps grisbens right its an opportunity faxon glanced up with a start the figure dimly perceived in the study was now more visibly and tangibly planted behind mr lavingtons chair thats right frank you see your uncle approves and the trip out there with olyphant isnt a thing to be missed so drop a few dozen dinners and be at the grand central the day after tomorrow at five mr grisbens pleasant grey eye sought corroboration of his host and faxon in a cold anguish of suspense continued to watch him as he turned his glance on mr lavington one could not look at lavington without seeing the presence at his back and it was clear that the next minute some change in mr grisbens expression must give his watcher a clue but mr grisbens expression did not change the gaze he fixed on his host remained unperturbed and the clue he gave was the startling one of not seeming to see the other figure faxons first impulse was to look away to look anywhere else to resort again to the champagne glass the watchful butler had already brimmed but some fatal attraction at war in him with an overwhelming physical resistance held his eyes upon the spot they feared the figure was still standing more distinctly and therefore more resemblingly at mr lavingtons back and while the latter continued to gaze affectionately at his nephew his counterpart as before fixed young rainer with eyes of deadly menace faxon with what felt like an actual wrench of the muscles dragged his own eyes from the sight to scan the other countenances about the table but not one revealed the least consciousness of what he saw and a sense of mortal isolation sank upon him its worth considering certainly he heard mr lavington continue and as rainers face lit up the face behind his uncles chair seemed to gather into its look all the fierce weariness of old unsatisfied hates that was the thing that as the minutes laboured by faxon was becoming most conscious of the watcher behind the chair was no longer merely malevolent he had grown suddenly unutterably tired his hatred seemed to well up out of the very depths of balked effort and thwarted hopes and the fact made him more pitiable and yet more dire faxons look reverted to mr lavington as if to surprise in him a corresponding change at first none was visible his pinched smile was screwed to his blank face like a gaslight to a whitewashed wall then the fixity of the smile became ominous faxon saw that its wearer was afraid to let it go it was evident that mr lavington was unutterably tired too and the discovery sent a colder current through faxons veins looking down at his untouched plate he caught the soliciting twinkle of the champagne glass but the sight of the wine turned him sick well well go into the details presently he heard mr lavington say still on the question of his nephews future lets have a cigar first no not here peters he turned his smile on faxon when weve had coffee i want to show you my pictures oh by the way uncle jack mr faxon wants to know if youve got a double a double mr lavington still smiling continued to address himself to his guest not that i know of have you seen one mr faxon faxon thought my god if i look up now theyll both be looking at me to avoid raising his eyes he made as though to lift the glass to his lips but his hand sank inert and he looked up mr lavingtons glance was politely bent on him but with a loosening of the strain about his heart he saw that the figure behind the chair still kept its gaze on rainer do you think youve seen my double mr faxon would the other face turn if he said yes faxon felt a dryness in his throat no he answered ah its possible ive a dozen i believe im extremely usuallooking mr lavington went on conversationally and still the other face watched rainer it was a mistake a confusion of memory faxon heard himself stammer mr lavington pushed back his chair and as he did so mr grisben suddenly leaned forward lavington what have we been thinking of we havent drunk franks health mr lavington reseated himself my dear boy peters another bottle he turned to his nephew after such a sin of omission i dont presume to propose the toast myself but frank knows go ahead grisben the boy shone on his uncle no no uncle jack mr grisben wont mind nobody but you today the butler was replenishing the glasses he filled mr lavingtons last and mr lavington put out his small hand to raise it as he did so faxon looked away well then all the good ive wished you in all the past years i put it into the prayer that the coming ones may be healthy and happy and many and many dear boy faxon saw the hands about him reach out for their glasses automatically he reached for his his eyes were still on the table and he repeated to himself with a trembling vehemence i wont look up i wont i wont his finders clasped the glass and raised it to the level of his lips he saw the other hands making the same motion he heard mr grisbens genial hear hear and mr batchs hollow echo he said to himself as the rim of the glass touched his lips i wont look up i swear i wont and he looked the glass was so full that it required an extraordinary effort to hold it there brimming and suspended during the awful interval before he could trust his hand to lower it again untouched to the table it was this merciful preoccupation which saved him kept him from crying out from losing his hold from slipping down into the bottomless blackness that gaped for him as long as the problem of the glass engaged him he felt able to keep his seat manage his muscles fit unnoticeably into the group but as the glass touched the table his last link with safety snapped he stood up and dashed out of the room iv in the gallery the instinct of selfpreservation helped him to turn back and sign to young rainer not to follow he stammered out something about a touch of dizziness and joining them presently and the boy nodded sympathetically and drew back at the foot of the stairs faxon ran against a servant i should like to telephone to weymore he said with dry lips sorry sir wires all down weve been trying the last hour to get new york again for mr lavington faxon shot on to his room burst into it and bolted the door the lamplight lay on furniture flowers books in the ashes a log still glimmered he dropped down on the sofa and hid his face the room was profoundly silent the whole house was still nothing about him gave a hint of what was going on darkly and dumbly in the room he had flown from and with the covering of his eyes oblivion and reassurance seemed to fall on him but they fell for a moment only then his lids opened again to the monstrous vision there it was stamped on his pupils a part of him forever an indelible horror burnt into his body and brain but why into his just his why had he alone been chosen to see what he had seen what business was it of his in gods name any one of the others thus enlightened might have exposed the horror and defeated it but he the one weaponless and defenceless spectator the one whom none of the others would believe or understand if he attempted to reveal what he knew he alone had been singled out as the victim of this dreadful initiation suddenly he sat up listening he had heard a step on the stairs some one no doubt was coming to see how he was to urge him if he felt better to go down and join the smokers cautiously he opened his door yes it was young rainers step faxon looked down the passage remembered the other stairway and darted to it all he wanted was to get out of the house not another instant would he breathe its abominable air what business was it of his in gods name he reached the opposite end of the lower gallery and beyond it saw the hall by which he had entered it was empty and on a long table he recognized his coat and cap he got into his coat unbolted the door and plunged into the purifying night the darkness was deep and the cold so intense that for an instant it stopped his breathing then he perceived that only a thin snow was falling and resolutely he set his face for flight the trees along the avenue marked his way as he hastened with long strides over the beaten snow gradually while he walked the tumult in his brain subsided the impulse to fly still drove him forward but he began feel that he was flying from a terror of his own creating and that the most urgent reason for escape was the need of hiding his state of shunning other eyes till he should regain his balance he had spent the long hours in the train in fruitless broodings on a discouraging situation and he remembered how his bitterness had turned to exasperation when he found that the weymore sleigh was not awaiting him it was absurd of course but though he had joked with rainer over mrs culmes forgetfulness to confess it had cost a pang that was what his rootless life had brought him to for lack of a personal stake in things his sensibility was at the mercy of such trifles yes that and the cold and fatigue the absence of hope and the haunting sense of starved aptitudes all these had brought him to the perilous verge over which once or twice before his terrified brain had hung why else in the name of any imaginable logic human or devilish should he a stranger be singled out for this experience what could it mean to him how was he related to it what bearing had it on his case unless indeed it was just because he was a stranger a stranger everywhere because he had no personal life no warm screen of private egotisms to shield him from exposure that he had developed this abnormal sensitiveness to the vicissitudes of others the thought pulled him up with a shudder no such a fate was too abominable all that was strong and sound in him rejected it a thousand times better regard himself as ill disorganized deluded than as the predestined victim of such warnings he reached the gates and paused before the darkened lodge the wind had risen and was sweeping the snow into his race the cold had him in its grasp again and he stood uncertain should he put his sanity to the test and go back he turned and looked down the dark drive to the house a single ray shone through the trees evoking a picture of the lights the flowers the faces grouped about that fatal room he turned and plunged out into the road he remembered that about a mile from overdale the coachman had pointed out the road to northridge and he began to walk in that direction once in the road he had the gale in his face and the wet snow on his moustache and eyelashes instantly hardened to ice the same ice seemed to be driving a million blades into his throat and lungs but he pushed on the vision of the warm room pursuing him the snow in the road was deep and uneven he stumbled across ruts and sank into drifts and the wind drove against him like a granite cliff now and then he stopped gasping as if an invisible hand had tightened an iron band about his body then he started again stiffening himself against the stealthy penetration of the cold the snow continued to descend out of a pall of inscrutable darkness and once or twice he paused fearing he had missed the road to northridge but seeing no sign of a turn he ploughed on at last feeling sure that he had walked for more than a mile he halted and looked back the act of turning brought immediate relief first because it put his back to the wind and then because far down the road it showed him the gleam of a lantern a sleigh was coming a sleigh that might perhaps give him a lift to the village fortified by the hope he began to walk back toward the light it came forward very slowly with unaccountable sigsags and waverings and even when he was within a few yards of it he could catch no sound of sleighbells then it paused and became stationary by the roadside as though carried by a pedestrian who had stopped exhausted by the cold the thought made faxon hasten on and a moment later he was stooping over a motionless figure huddled against the snowbank the lantern had dropped from its bearers hand and faxon fearfully raising it threw its light into the face of frank rainer rainer what on earth are you doing here the boy smiled back through his pallour what are you id like to know he retorted and scrambling to his feet with a clutch oh faxons arm he added gaily well ive run you down faxon stood confounded his heart sinking the lads face was grey what madness he began yes it is what on earth did you do it for i do what why i i was just taking a walk i often walk at night frank rainer burst into a laugh on such nights then you hadnt bolted bolted because id done something to offend you my uncle thought you had faxon grasped his arm did your uncle send you after me well he gave me an awful rowing for not going up to your room with you when you said you were ill and when we found youd gone we were frightened and he was awfully upset so i said id catch you youre not ill are you ill no never better faxon picked up the lantern come lets go back it was awfully hot in that diningroom yes i hoped it was only that they trudged on in silence for a few minutes then faxon questioned youre not too done up oh no its a lot easier with the wind behind us all right dont talk any more they pushed ahead walking in spite of the light that guided them more slowly than faxon had walked alone into the gale the fact of his companions stumbling against a drift gave faxon a pretext for saying take hold of my arm and rainer obeying gasped out im blown so am i who wouldnt be what a dance you led me if it hadnt been for one of the servants happening to see you yes all right and now wont you kindly shut up rainer laughed and hung on him oh the cold doesnt hurt me for the first few minutes after rainer had overtaken him anxiety for the lad had been faxons only thought but as each labouring step carried them nearer to the spot he had been fleeing the reasons for his flight grew more ominous and more insistent no he was not ill he was not distraught and deluded he was the instrument singled out to warn and save and here he was irresistibly driven dragging the victim back to his doom the intensity of the conviction had almost checked his steps but what could he do or say at all costs he must get rainer out of the cold into the house and into his bed after that he would act the snowfall was thickening and as they reached a stretch of the road between open fields the wind took them at an angle lashing their faces with barbed thongs rainer stopped to take breath and faxon felt the heavier pressure of his arm when we get to the lodge cant we telephone to the stable for a sleigh if theyre not all asleep at the lodge oh ill manage dont talk faxon ordered and they plodded on at length the lantern ray showed ruts that curved away from the road under treedarkness faxons spirits rose theres the gate well be there in five minutes as he spoke he caught above the boundary hedge the gleam of a light at the farther end of the dark avenue it was the same light that had shone on the scene of which every detail was burnt into his brain and he felt again its overpowering reality no he couldnt let the boy go back they were at the lodge at last and faxon was hammering on the door he said to himself ill get him inside first and make them give him a hot drink then ill see ill find an argument there was no answer to his knocking and after an interval rainer said look here wed better go on no i can perfectly you shant go to the house i say faxon redoubled his blows and at length steps sounded on the stairs rainer was leaning against the lintel and as the door opened the light from the hall flashed on his pale face and fixed eyes faxon caught him by the arm and drew him in it was cold out there he sighed and then abruptly as if invisible shears at a single stroke had cut every muscle in his body he swerved drooped on faxons arm and seemed to sink into nothing at his feet the lodgekeeper and faxon bent over him and somehow between them lifted him into the kitchen and laid him on a sofa by the stove the lodgekeeper stammering ill ring up the house dashed out of the room but faxon heard the words without heeding them omens mattered nothing now beside this woe fulfilled he knelt down to undo the fur collar about rainers throat and as he did so he felt a warm moisture on his hands he held them up and they were red v the palms threaded their endless line along the yellow river the little steamer lay at the wharf and george faxon sitting in the verandah of the wooden hotel idly watched the coolies carrying the freight across the gangplank he had been looking at such scenes for two months nearly five had elapsed since he had descended from the train at northridge and strained his eyes for the sleigh that was to take him to weymore weymore which he was never to behold part of the interval the first part was still a great grey blur even now he could not be quite sure how he had got back to boston reached the house of a cousin and been thence transferred to a quiet room looking out on snow under bare trees he looked out a long time at the same scene and finally one day a man he had known at harvard came to see him and invited him to go out on a business trip to the malay peninsula youve had a bad shakeup and itll do you no end of good to get away from things when the doctor came the next day it turned out that he knew of the plan and approved it you ought to be quiet for a year just loaf and look at the landscape he advised paxon felt the first faint stirrings of curiosity whats been the matter with me anyway well overwork i suppose you must have been bottling up for a bad breakdown before you started for new hampshire last december and the shock of that poor boys death did the rest ah yes rainer had died he remembered he started for the east and gradually by imperceptible degrees life crept back into his weary bones and leaden brain his friend was patient and considerate and they travelled slowly and talked little at first faxon had felt a great shrinking from whatever touched on familiar things he seldom looked at a newspaper and he never opened a letter without a contraction of the heart it was not that he had any special cause for apprehension but merely that a great trail of darkness lay on everything he had looked too deep down into the abyss but little by little health and energy returned to him and with them the common promptings of curiosity he was beginning to wonder how the world was going and when presently the hotelkeeper told him there were no letters for him in the steamers mailbag he felt a distinct sense of disappointment his friend had gone into the jungle on a long excursion and he was lonely unoccupied and wholesomely bored he got up and strolled into the stuffy readingroom there he found a game of dominoes a mutilated picturepuzzle some copies of zions herald and a pile of new york and london newspapers he began to glance through the papers and was disappointed to find that they were less recent than he had hoped evidently the last numbers had been carried off by luckier travellers he continued to turn them over picking out the american ones first these as it happened were the oldest they dated back to december and january to faxon however they had all the flavour of novelty since they covered the precise period during which he had virtually ceased to exist it had never before occurred to him to wonder what had happened in the world during that interval of obliteration but now he felt a sudden desire to know to prolong the pleasure he began by sorting the papers chronologically and as he found and spread out the earliest number the date at the top of the page entered into his consciousness like a key slipping into a lock it was the seventeenth of december the date of the day after his arrival at northridge he glanced at the first page and read in blazing characters reported failure of opal cement company lavingtons name involved gigantic exposure of corruption shakes wall street to its foundations he read on and when he had finished the first paper he turned to the next there was a gap of three days but the opal cement investigation still held the centre of the stage from its complex revelations of greed and ruin his eye wandered to the death notices and he read rainer suddenly at northridge new hampshire francis john only son of the late his eyes clouded and he dropped the newspaper and sat for a long time with his face in his hands when he looked up again he noticed that his gesture had pushed the other papers from the table and scattered them at his feet the uppermost lay spread out before him and heavily his eyes began their search again john lavington comes forward with plan for reconstructing company offers to put in ten millions of his own the proposal under consideration by the district attorney ten millions ten millions of his own but if john lavington was ruined pazon stood up with a cry that was it then that was what the warning meant and if he had not fled from it dashed wildly away from it into the night he might have broken the spell of iniquity the powers of darkness might not have prevailed he caught up the pile of newspapers and began to glance through each in turn for the headline wills admitted to probate in the last of all he found the paragraph he sought and it stared up at him as if with rainers dying eyes that that was what he had done the powers of pity had singled him out to warn and save and he had closed his ears to their call and washed his hands of it and fled washed his hands of it that was the word it caught him back to the dreadful moment in the lodge when raising himself up from rainers side he had looked at his hands and seen that they were red
