lawrence xxi to cyriack skinner xxii to the same xxiii on his deceased wife notes preface the purpose held in view by those who place the study of milton in high school english courses is twofold first that youth may seasonably become acquainted with a portion of our great classic poetry and secondly that they may in this poetry encounter and learn to conquer difficulties more serious than those they have met in the literature they have hitherto read it is for the teacher to see to it that both these aims are attained the pupil must read with interest and he must expect at the same time to have to do some strenuous thinking and not to object to turning over many books the average pupil will not at first read anything of milton with perfect enjoyment he will with his wonted docility commit passages to memory and he will do his best to speak these passages with the elocution on which you insist but the taste for this poetry is an acquired one and in the acquisition usually costs efforts quite alien to the prevailing conceptions of reading as a pleasurable recreation the task of pedagogy at this point becomes delicate first of all the teacher must recognize the fact that his class will not however good their intentions leap to a liking for comus or lycidas or even for the nativity ode it is of no use to assign stanzas or lines as lessons and to expect these to be studied to a conclusion like a task of french translation the only way not to be disappointed in the performance of the class is to expect nothing it will be well at first except where the test is quite simple for the teacher to read it himself making comment in the way of explanation as he goes on now and then he will stop and have a little quiz to hold attention when classical allusions come up requiring research the teacher will tell in what books the matter may be looked up and will show how other poets or milton elsewhere have played with the same piece of history or mythology thus a poem may be dealt with for a number of days repetition is to a certain extent excellent the verses begin to sink into the young minds the measure appeals to the inborn sense of rhythm the poem is caught by the ear like a piece of music the utterance of it becomes more like singing than speaking in fact the great secret of teaching poetry in school is to get rid of the commonplace manner of speech befitting a recitation in language or science and to put in practice the obvious truth that verse has its own form which is very different from the form of prose but repetition may go too far overfamiliarity may beget indifference other poems await the attention of the class the teacher who really means to interest his classes and begins by being interested and interesting himself will rarely fail to accomplish his purpose the principal obstacle to success here is the necessity that frequently exists of conforming to the custom of examining marking and ranking a practice that thwarts genuine personal influence formalizes all procedures and tends to deaden natural interest by substituting for it the artificial interest of school standing the milton lesson must be a serious one because it is given to the study of the serious work of the gravest and most highminded of men and it must be an enjoyable one because it deals with the verse of the most musical of poets and because one mood of joy is the only mood in which literature can be profitably studied as to the difficulties which the learner first encounters when he comes to milton these grow sometimes out of the diction sometimes out of the syntax and sometimes out of the poets figures and allusions some difficulties can be explained at once and completely others cannot be explained at all with any reasonable hope of touching the beginners mind with matter that he can appropriate often the young reader slips over points of possible learned annotation without the least consciousness that here great scholarship might make an imposing display perfectly useless is it to set forth for the pupil the interesting echoes from ancient poets which generations of delving scholars have accumulated in their notes to milton pleasing as these are to mature readers the rule should be to expound and illustrate sufficiently to remove those perplexities which really tease the pupils mind and cause him to feel dissatisfaction with himself in many cases our only course is to postpone exposition and to trust that the learner will grow up to the insight which he as yet does not possess and which we cannot possibly give him a learned writer like milton who has read all antiquity and who has no purpose of writing for children inevitably contemplates a public of men approximately his equals in culture and expects to find fit audience though few but many of the difficulties that confront the beginner in milton ask only to be explained at once by some one who has had more experience in the older literature archaic forms of words and expressions with which the ripe student is familiar worry the tyro and must be accounted for often the common dictionaries will give all needed help but the best means of acquiring speedy familiarity with obsolete and rare forms is a milton concordance such as that of bradshaw in connection with the century dictionary or with the oxford dictionary so far as this goes these means of easy research should be at hand i find that pupils often need a pretty sharp spur to make them use even their abridged dictionaries but so far as concerns acquaintance with the vocabulary of poetic diction nothing will do except the dictionary habit accompanied by an effort of the memory to retain what has been learned difficulties that lurk in an involved syntax the pupil may usually be expected to solve by study but such a peculiar construction as that in sonnet x will probably have to be explained to him in the puritan theology and its implications he cannot take much interest and will of course not be asked to do so but high school students of milton will ordinarily in their historical courses have come down to the times in which the poet lived will understand his relation to public events and will appreciate his feeling toward the english ecclesiastical system puritanism a phenomenon of the most tremendous importance at a certain period of english history has so completely disappeared from the modern world that the utterances of a seventeenthcentury poet professedly a partisan on matters of church and state no longer exasperate and can barely even interest students of literature to read either paradise lost or the divine comedy we must find the poets cosmical and his theological standpoint we have no right to be surprised or shocked at his conceptions we must take him as he is and let him lead us through the universe as he has planned it so long as we set up our modern views as a standard and by this standard judge the ancient men we fail in hospitality of thought and come short of our duty as readers this consideration suggests yet another purpose in setting youth to the reading of milton by no means an ancient poet he takes us nevertheless to a world different from our own and in some sense helps us out of the modern time in which our lives have fallen to show us how other ages conceived of god and heaven the mark of an educated man is respect for the past the old philosophies and religions do not startle and repel him his ancestors were once in those stages of belief in some stage of this vast movement of thought he and his fellows are at the present moment this largeness of view can be fruitfully impressed on youth only by letting them read under wise guidance the older poets outlines of the life of milton john milton was born in london on the ninth of december queen elizabeth had then been dead five years and the literature which we call elizabethan was still being written by the men who had begun their careers under her reign spenser had died in the theatres were yet in the enjoyment of full popularity and the playwriters were producing works that continued the traditions and the manner of the elizabethan drama shakespeare had still eight years to live and at least four of the great plays to write bacons fame was already great but the events of eighteen years were to cloud his reputation and establish his renown jonson great as a writer of masks was to live till he might have seen in comus how a young and scholarly puritan humanist thought that a mask should be conceived born thus in the fifth year of the first of the stuarts milton lived to witness all the vicissitudes of english politics in which that family was involved except the very last he did not see the revolution of surviving for fourteen years the restoration of charles ii he died in at the age of sixtysix miltons social position can be inferred from the fact that his father was what was then called a scrivener that is he kept an office in his dwelling and was employed to draw up contracts wills and other legal documents this occupation implied knowledge at least of the forms of the law though not of its history or principles it did not imply liberal education though it brought its practitioner doubtless more or less into contact with men of really professional standing in the science of jurisprudence perhaps the elder milton cherished a deeper conviction of the value of classic culture than do those who simply inherit and take as a matter of course the custom of devoting years to the study of ancient languages and literatures evidently the father thought he saw in his son that promise of intellectual vigor and of sound moral stamina which justified the innovation in his family of sending his boy to the university his preparation for college milton got under private masters and at the famous public school of st pauls which was near his home this preparation consisted chiefly in exercises in latin composition and literature and was both thorough and effectual at sixteen when he went to college he had already composed latin verse and he read and wrote latin with facility in milton entered christs college cambridge here he remained as a student seven years or till taking in course his ab and am degrees and in spite of his studious habits and his aversion to the rough and wayward customs of student life winning more and more and at last having in full measure the respect of his fellowcollegians during these years he wrote but did not publish in latin or english no less than twentyfive pieces of verse among them poems of no less note than the nativity ode and the sonnet on arriving at the age of twentythree the lines on shakespeare were also composed in this period and appeared in print among the poems prefixed to the second shakespeare folio in returning at the close of his university course to the paternal residence the poet came not to london but to the village of horton in buckinghamshire where his father had taken a house in order to live in the country now had to be debated the question of a profession hitherto the son had seemed silently to acquiesce in the understood hope of the family that he would devote himself to a career in the church but during his university years of study and observation his views had become fixed his mind had advanced to selfdetermination and he could not remain content with a future that seemed to hamper his intellectual freedom this difference between father and son was settled apparently without strife by the elder mans entire yielding to the desires of the younger the son could not as we can well understand if we have read even only a little of his verse or his prose be otherwise than strenuous insistent and masterful to his father he was of course filial and respectful we may imagine him even gentle but conciliatory yielding the point being a vital one it was not in his nature to be what the young milton desired was to lead a life devoted to literature or more specifically to poetry this meant that he wished still to study a long time to fathom all learning in all tongues in college he had besides latin mastered greek french italian and hebrew his conception of a poet was of a most profoundly learned man he had become aware of the existence of vast areas of knowledge that he had not yet explored other young men turned aside without misgiving from the ambition to know everything and eagerly entered into useful and lucrative professions but milton scorns the thought of applying learning to the service of material gain this is his poetical conception of his duty as a scholar it will dominate the spirit of his life work to understand his feelings at this time both toward his father and toward his ideals we must read the latin poem ad patrem of which professor masson gives an english translation at horton therefore milton remains still subsisting on his fathers bounty having come back thither at the age of twentythree he continues to live at home for nearly six years not yet practising any art by which to earn a livelihood occasionally he goes on scholarly errands to london which is not far distant he devotes himself simply to study and having the poetic temperament he cannot help devoting himself also to observation of nature his learning becomes immense his appetite is insatiable to the horton time belong the minor poems not already produced during the student years at cambridge of the circumstances in which the several poems were written an account is given in the notes in this volume this early or minor verse of milton is elicited by passing events and is considered to concern only himself and a few friends for immediate fame he takes no thought he feels his immaturity his ambition contemplates a distant future and he meditates plans as yet undefined and vague of some great work that the world shall not willingly let die very important in miltons intellectual development is his journey to france and italy on which he set out in april as an indication of his social position in england we must note that he carries with him letters of introduction which secure to him notice and recognition from men of rank or of notable literary and scientific standing he goes abroad as a cultivated private gentleman known to have achieved distinction as a student undoubtedly his chief qualification for holding his own in learned italian society was his command of languages especially of latin unless indeed we are to put before his linguistic accomplishments the refined and gentlemanly personal bearing which was his birthright and which in his years of intense application to books he had not forfeited in italy he associated with men whose intellectual interests were the universal ones of science in which he was as much at home as they thus he possessed a perfect outfit of the endowments and the acquisitions which a traveller needs to make his travel fruitful to himself and honorable to his country in italy he made friends among men of note and established relations which were to have their importance in his future life but most memorable among his italian experiences was his visit to the aged galileo who was then a prisoner to the inquisition for teaching that the earth moves round the sun the modern astronomy was then winning its way among men of thought very much as the doctrine of evolution has been winning its way during the last half century few minds surrendered instantly and without misgiving to the new conception milton has still many years to meditate the question before he comes to the composition of paradise lost when his scheme of the physical universe will have to recognize the requirements of poetic art and the prevalence of ancient beliefs regarding the origin and order of the cosmos from the fact that the poet puts the earth in the centre of the universe that he adopts in fact the ptolemaic system though he knew the copernican we are not entitled to infer that he held a fixed conviction in the matter and that on direct examination as to his views he would have absolutely professed one theory and rejected the other the poet has all rights of choice and may be said to know best where to stand to take his view of the world milton remained abroad some sixteen months and was home again in august the horton household was now broken up the father going to live first with his younger son christopher at reading and afterward to spend his last years in the family of john in london where he died in with his removal to london in a distinct period in miltons life comes to an end he has hitherto been uninterruptedly acquiring knowledge both by studious devotion to books and by observation of human life in foreign lands he has read all the great literatures in ancient and modern languages he has felt the poetic impulse and has proved to himself that he has at command creative power his purpose still is to produce a poem but this poem of his aspirations is distinctly a great and majestic affair and not at all a continuation of such work as that which he has hitherto given to his friends and which he esteems as prolusions of his youth the poetic waitingtime which milton now in full vigor of manhood prescribes for himself he is constrained both by inner conviction and by external necessity to fill with hard and earnest work henceforth for a score of years he ceases almost entirely to write verse and he earns his living he becomes a householder in london where as the father had gained his livelihood by drawing up contracts and mortgages for his fellowcitizens the son proceeds to gain his by teaching their boys latin to the work of teaching milton addressed himself with intelligence and predilection about education he had ideas of his own which he applied in practice and advocated in writing his tract on education is a document of importance in the history of pedagogy and is besides one of those memorable pieces of english prose which every student of literature whatever his professional aims must include in his reading he kept his school in his own house where he boarded some of his pupils we could not imagine john milton going into a great public school like st pauls to serve as underteacher to one of the tyrannical headmasters of the day the only school befitting his absolutely convinced and masterful spirit is one in which he reigns supreme the great subject is latin and so thoroughly is latin taught that finally other subjects are explained through the medium of this language he had himself brought from his school and college days very decided discontent with the methods then in vogue this discontent he expresses in language of peculiar energy and even harshness he is a true reformer in milton then thirtyfive years old married mary powell a girl of just half his own age daughter of a royalist residing near oxford we must imagine this young wife as coming to preside somewhat in the capacity of matron over a family of boys held severely to their tasks of study by a master in whom the sense of humor was almost entirely lacking and whose discipline was of the sternest that she could not endure the situation was but natural very soon after the wedding she went home with the understanding that she was to make a short visit to her parents and sisters but she did not return for two years her husband summoned her but she would not come back in she at last repented of her waywardness sought reconciliation and was forgiven these two years had wrought a change in mary powell milton she was now ready to live with her husband and did so till her death in she left him three daughters the youngest of whom deborah lived till and was known to addison and his contemporaries from whom she received distinguished honors in reading milton we find that all the vicissitudes of his life reflect themselves in his works so that the political and social events in which he is personally concerned usurp his attention color his views and often become his themes thus he is not like shakespeare a critic of the whole of humanity but is usually an advocate or an accuser of the leaders in church and state and of the principles which they profess he is by nature a partisan all the energy of his mind goes into denunciation or vindication his experience of wedded life made him an advocate of easier divorce and determined in him a mood which expressed itself in writings that naturally brought upon him obloquy even from those who held him most in honor it would be most interesting to know something of the daily routine of miltons school to ascertain what his pupils knew and could do when he had done with them but we must remember that during all the years of his teaching the great revolution was in progress that all men of thought were profoundly stirred on public questions and that milton himself was a politician and an eager partisan of the cause of parliament he did not consider himself a teacher finally and for good his school did not develop into anything great or conspicuous and never became an object of curiosity while yet engaged in such teaching as he found to do he had written the pamphlets on education and on divorce and also the famous one entitled areopagitica a speech for the liberty of unlicensed printing to the parliament of england this is the best worth reading of all his prose writings the subject of it is perfectly intelligible still and its english shows to perfection the qualities of the great miltonic style after the execution of charles i jan it became more than ever necessary for all thoughtful men to express their convictions for a people to put to death its king by judicial process was an unheard of event those who considered that the parliament had acted within the law and could not have done otherwise with due regard to the welfare of the nation had to convince doubting and timid citizens at home and also so far as was possible to placate critics in other nations who still believed that the king could do no wrong for all europe interested itself in this tremendous act of the english parliament within a fortnight after the death of the king milton published his pamphlet on the tenure of kings and magistrates this work so impressed the parliamentary leaders as a thorough and unanswerable argument in defence of their cause that they sought out its author and in march appointed him to the important post of secretary for foreign tongues miltons perfect command of latin now stood him in good stead here was an uncompromising puritan fully the equal of the foreign ecclesiastics in theology and capable of holding his own in latin composition with the most famous humanists of the time latin was then the language of international intercourse miltons duty was to translate into and from latin the despatches that passed between his own and foreign governments he also composed original treatises some in english and some in latin the most important of which continued his justification of the national act of regicide the importance of these writings was very great miltons services to the puritan cause can today hardly be appreciated it was the constant aim of royalists at home and abroad to represent england as having fallen under the control of ignorant fanatics of ambitious barbarous bloodthirsty men by his very personality his knowledge of affairs his familiarity with ancient and medival history and above all by his fluency in latin invective milton thwarted attempts to disparage his countrymen as lawless barbarians he helped to maintain the good name of his country as a land of intellectual light and of respect for ancient usage foreigners who attempted personal vilification found him ready to meet them with their own weapons the poet of comus now shows himself a controversialist of unbounded energy in shortly before the death of his wife milton became totally blind henceforward the duties of his secretaryship had to be performed with the aid of an amanuensis he continued however to fill the office till just before the end of the protectorate in in november he married katharine woodcocke who lived but till march she left an infant which died a month after the mother miltons duties as secretary for foreign tongues must have brought him one would think into some sort of personal relation with cromwell and the other great parliamentary leaders the poet leaves us in no doubt as to the high esteem in which he held these men but no gossip of the time admits us to a glimpse of their intercourse with each other it falls to milton to eulogize cromwell it never came in cromwells way to put on record his estimate of milton with the restoration of royalty in the person of charles ii in miltons public activity of course ceased and the second period of his life comes to an end we saw his first period devoted to preparation and to early essays in poetry with the distinct conception that poetry was yet to be the great work of his life in his second period he expresses himself in verse but rarely and briefly but produces controversial prose now in english now in latin in this second period he works as teacher or as public secretary for payment supporting himself and family when the third period begins he loses all employment goes into closest retirement a widower with three daughters growing up from childhood and devotes himself to the poetry that he has always contemplated as the object of his ambition he has now been blind eight years in view of the conspicuous part that milton had taken in defending the right of parliament to bring a king to the scaffold it is surprising that of the restoration he was not included in the number of those marked out for the punishment of death he was for some time undoubtedly in danger fortunately he was overlooked or perhaps was purposely neglected as being henceforce harmless in february he married his third wife elizabeth minshull who faithfully cared for him till his death in during this last period of his life milton composed and published his major poems paradise lost paradise regained and samson agonistes for paradise lost he received from his publisher five pounds in cash with promise of five pounds when thirteen hundred copies should have been sold and of two more payments each of the same sum when two more editions of the same size should have been disposed of the last years of his life milton appears to have spent in comparative comfort his three daughters had gone out to learn trades it seems he had given them no education it may be they showed no desire or aptitude for instruction far more probably however he took no interest in their education his ideal of womanhood as may be gathered from numerous passages in his poems is as far as possible removed from the modern conception of sexual equality as to opportunity for education and for training to selfdetermination he shared in this respect the views that prevailed during his day in all classes of society and he maintained these views as a parent no less than as the poet of paradise besides the poems named above as produced during this last period of his life milton published also in these years several prose works which have now little value except as showing the bent and occupation of his mind among these may be named a small latin grammar written in english which he had composed long before and a history of britain to the norman conquest though the immediate sale of paradise lost was not large according to our ideas it was yet sufficient to indicate a very respectable interest in the reading public of the day we must remember that it appeared in the corrupt time of the restoration when the prevailing literary fashion was wholly adverse to seriousness and ideality the age was spiritually degenerate milton himself considered that he lived an age too late the great poem had no royal or noble sponsors to give it vogue yet it made its way by no means had all minds become frivolous the minor poems had been published by themselves in these had always had their readers the prose pamphlets of the secretary for foreign tongues were at least by a small class of observant persons known to be the work of the author of comus and lycidas there were not wanting men to take a sympathetic interest in the fate of the poet in his retirement and to note the appearance of paradise lost as a literary event thus it was that milton lived to have some slight foretaste of the honor which two centuries have bestowed on his memory visitors came to see him in his modest dwelling in an unfashionable quarter of london foreigners occasionally came to satisfy their curiosity dryden the chief poet who wrote in the spirit of the restoration called to talk with the author of paradise lost and to suggest improvements in the form of the poem which he thought should be in rhyme the recognition which the poet thus got in his lifetime is small only in comparison with the immense fame he has won since his death milton has now become an object of the profoundest curiosity his life has been investigated by professor masson with a minute scrutiny into detail such as has been devoted to no other writer but shakespeare his works are perpetually reprinted in all imaginable forms whether of cheapness or of sumptuous elegance they are read as textbooks in schools by hosts of youth our beliefs regarding the great themes of the sacred scriptures are so colored by the miltonic epics that we hardly know today just what part of our conceptions we owe to the bible and what to the poet next to the shakespearean dramas the poems of milton are the largest single influence that knits the englishspeaking race into one vast brotherhood all students of milton have to acknowledge their indebtedness to professor david masson of edinburgh who has devoted years of labor to research in every department of miltonic lore massons great life of milton in connexion with the history of his time is far too bulky for use except for reference on special points the index volume makes the enormous work accessible as occasion requires to his edition of the poetical works masson prefixes a life which will suffice for all the needs likely to arise in school yet again masson is the writer of the article on milton in the encyclopdia britannica a most complete presentment of everything a student ordinarily needs to know in the series of classical writers is a little book or primer on milton written by stopford a brooke in the english men of letters series the milton is the work of mark pattison the latest good account of milton is the book entitled simply john milton by walter raleigh professor at university college liverpool this is a remarkably vigorous and illuminating piece of criticism perhaps the most interesting writing on a milton subject is the book by mrs anne manning the maiden and married life of mary powell afterward mrs milton and the sequel thereto deborahs diary this the student must read with the full understanding that it is a work of fiction it is right to warn young readers against the natural tendency to give their time to critical and expository books and articles before they make acquaintance with originals almost every essayist of note has written on milton there is danger lest we accept opinions at second hand the only opinions on milton to which we have any right are those we form from our own reading of his works miltons minor poems on the morning of christs nativity composed i this is the month and this the happy morn wherein the son of heavens eternal king of wedded maid and virgin mother born our great redemption from above did bring for so the holy sages once did sing that he our deadly forfeit should release and with his father work us a perpetual peace ii that glorious form that light unsufferable and that farbeaming blaze of majesty wherewith he wont at heavens high counciltable to sit the midst of trinal unity he laid aside and here with us to be forsook the courts of everlasting day and chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay iii say heavenly muse shall not thy sacred vein afford a present to the infant god hast thou no verse no hymn or solemn strain to welcome him to this his new abode now while the heaven by the suns team untrod hath took no print of the approaching light and all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright iv see how from far upon the eastern road the starled wizards haste with odors sweet oh run prevent them with thy humble ode and lay it lowly at his blessed feet have thou the honor first thy lord to greet and join thy voice unto the angel quire from out his secret altar touched with hallowed fire the hymn i it was the winter wild while the heavenborn child all meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies nature in awe to him had doffed her gaudy trim with her great master so to sympathize it was no season then for her to wanton with the sun her lusty paramour ii only with speeches fair she woos the gentle air to hide her guilty front with innocent snow and on her naked shame pollute with sinful blame the saintly veil of maiden white to throw confounded that her makers eyes should look so near upon her foul deformities iii but he her fears to cease sent down the meekeyed peace she crowned with olive green came softly sliding down through the turning sphere his ready harbinger with turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing and waving wide her myrtle wand she strikes a universal peace through sea and land iv no war or battles sound was heard the world around the idle spear and shield were high uphung the hooked chariot stood unstained with hostile blood the trumpet spake not to the armed throng and kings sat still with awful eye as if they surely knew their sovran lord was by v but peaceful was the night wherein the prince of light his reign of peace upon the earth began the winds with wonder whist smoothly the waters kissed whispering new joys to the mild ocean who now hath quite forgot to rave while birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave vi the stars with deep amaze stand fixed in steadfast gaze bending one way their precious influence and will not take their flight for all the morning light or lucifer that often warned them thence but in their glimmering orbs did glow until their lord himself bespake and bid them go vii and though the shady gloom had given day her room the sun himself withheld his wonted speed and hid his head for shame as his inferior flame the newenlightened world no more should need he saw a greater sun appear than his bright throne or burning axletree could bear viii the shepherds on the lawn or ere the point of dawn sat simply chatting in a rustic row full little thought they than that the mighty pan was kindly come to live with them below perhaps their loves or else their sheep was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep ix when such music sweet their hearts and ears did greet as never was by mortal finger strook divinelywarbled voice answering the stringed noise as all their souls in blissful rapture took the air such pleasure loth to lose with thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close x nature that heard such sound beneath the hollow round of cynthias seat the airy region thrilling now was almost won to think her part was done and that her reign had here its last fulfilling she knew such harmony alone could hold all heaven and earth in happier union xi at last surrounds their sight a globe of circular light that with long beams the shamefaced night arrayed the helmed cherubim and sworded seraphim are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed harping in loud and solemn quire with unexpressive notes to heavens newborn heir xii such music as tis said before was never made but when of old the sons of morning sung while the creator great his constellations set and the wellbalanced world on hinges hung and cast the dark foundations deep and bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep xiii ring out ye crystal spheres once bless our human ears if ye have power to touch our senses so and let your silver chime move in melodious time and let the bass of heavens deep organ blow and with your ninefold harmony make up full consort to the angelic symphony xiv for if such holy song enwrap our fancy long time will run back and fetch the age of gold and speckled vanity will sicken soon and die and leprous sin will melt from earthly mould and hell itself will pass away and leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day xv yea truth and justice then will down return to men orbed in a rainbow and like glories wearing mercy will sit between throned in celestial sheen with radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering and heaven as at some festival will open wide the gates of her high palacehall xvi but wisest fate says no this must not yet be so the babe yet lies in smiling infancy that on the bitter cross must redeem our loss so both himself and us to glorify yet first to those ychained in sleep the wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep xvii with such a horrid clang as on mount sinai rang while the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake the aged earth aghast with terror of that blast shall from the surface to the centre shake when at the worlds last session the dreadful judge in middle air shall spread his throne xviii and then at last our bliss full and perfect is but now begins for from this happy day the old dragon under ground in straiter limits bound not half so

great sun begins his state robed in flames and amber light the clouds in thousand liveries dight while the ploughman near at hand whistles oer the furrowed land and the milkmaid singeth blithe and the mower whets his scythe and every shepherd tells his tale under the hawthorn in the dale straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures whilst the landskip round it measures russet lawns and fallows gray

bosomed high in tufted trees where perhaps some beauty lies the cynosure of neighboring eyes hard by a cottage chimney smokes from betwixt two aged oaks where corydon and thyrsis met are at their savory dinner set of herbs and other country messes which the neathanded phyllis dresses and then in haste her bower she leaves with thestylis to bind the sheaves or if the earlier season lead to the tanned haycock in the mead sometimes with secure delight the upland hamlets will invite when the merry bells ring round and the jocund rebecks sound to many a youth and many a maid dancing in the chequered shade and young and old come forth to play on a sunshine holiday till the livelong daylight fail then to the spicy nutbrown ale with stories told of many a feat how faery mab the junkets eat

been led astray through the heavens wide pathless way and oft as if her head she bowed stooping through a fleecy cloud oft on a plat of rising ground i hear the faroff curfew sound over some widewatered shore swinging slow with sullen roar or if the air will not permit some still removed place will fit where glowing embers through the room teach light to counterfeit a gloom far from all resort of mirth save the cricket on the hearth or the bellmans drowsy charm to bless the doors from nightly harm or let my lamp at midnight hour be seen in some high lonely tower where i may oft outwatch the bear with thrice great hermes or unsphere the spirit of plato to unfold what worlds or what vast regions hold the immortal mind that hath forsook her mansion in this fleshly nook and of

ending on the rustling leaves with minutedrops from off the eaves and when the sun begins to fling his flaring beams me goddess bring to arched walks of twilight groves and shadows brown that sylvan loves of pine or monumental oak where the rude axe with heaved stroke was never heard the nymphs to daunt or fright them from their hallowed haunt there in close covert by some brook where no profaner eye may look hide me from days garish eye while the bee with honeyed thigh that at her flowery work doth sing and the waters murmuring with such consort as they keep entice the dewyfeathered sleep and let some strange mysterious dream wave at his wings in airy stream of lively portraiture displayed softly on my eyelids laid and as i wake sweet music breathe above about or underneath sent by some spirit to mortals good or the unseen genius of the wood but let my due feet never fail to walk the studious cloisters pale and love the high embowed roof with antique pillars massyproof and storied windows richly dight casting a dim religious light there let the pealing organ blow to the fullvoiced quire below in service high and anthems clear as may with sweetness through mine ear dissolve me into ecstasies and bring all heaven before mine eyes and may at last my weary age find out the peaceful hermitage the hairy gown and mossy cell where i may sit and rightly spell of every star that heaven doth shew and every herb that sips the dew till old experience do attain to something like prophetic strain these pleasures melancholy give and i with thee will choose to live arcades part of an entertainment presented to the countess dowager of derby at harefield by some noble persons of her family who appear on the scene in pastoral habit moving toward the seat of state with this song i song look nymphs and shepherds look what sudden blaze of majesty is that which we from hence descry too divine to be mistook this this is she to whom our vows and wishes bend here our solemn search hath end fame that her high worth to raise seemed erst so lavish and profuse we may justly now accuse of detraction from her praise less than half we find expressed envy bid conceal the rest mark what radiant state she spreads in circle round her shining throne shooting her beams like silver threads this this is she alone sitting like a goddess bright in the centre of her light might she the wise latona be or the towered cybele mother of a hundred gods juno dares not give her odds who had thought this clime had held a deity so unparalleled as they come forward the genius of the wood appears and turning toward them speaks gen stay gentle swains for though in this disguise i see bright honor sparkle through your eyes of famous arcady ye are and sprung of that renowned flood so often sung

was all in honor and devotion meant to the great mistress of yon princely shrine whom with low reverence i adore as mine and with all helpful service will comply to further this nights glad solemnity and lead ye where ye may more near behold what shallowsearching fame hath left untold which i full oft amidst those shades alone have sat to wonder at and gaze upon for know by lot from jove i am the power of this fair wood and live in oaken bower to nurse the saplings tall and curl the grove with ringlets quaint and wanton windings wove and all my plants i save from nightly ill of noisome winds and blasting vapors chill and from the boughs brush off the evil dew and heal the harms of thwarting thunder blue or what the cross direlooking planet smites or hurtful worm with cankered venom bites when evening gray doth rise i fetch my round over the mount and all this hallowed ground and early ere the odorous breath of morn awakes the slumbering leaves or tasselled horn shakes the high thicket haste i all about number my ranks and visit every sprout with puissant words and murmurs made to bless but else in deep of night when drowsiness hath locked up mortal sense then listen i to the celestial sirens harmony that sit upon the nine infolded spheres and sing to those that hold the vital shears and turn the adamantine spindle round on which the fate of gods and men is wound such sweet compulsion doth in music lie to lull the daughters of necessity and keep unsteady nature to her law and the low world in measured motion draw after the heavenly tune which none can hear of human mould with gross unpurged ear and yet such music worthiest were to blaze the peerless height of her immortal praise whose lustre leads us and for her most fit if my inferior hand or voice could hit inimitable sounds yet as we go whateer the skill of lesser gods can show i will assay her worth to celebrate and so attend ye toward her glittering state where ye may all that are of noble stem approach and kiss her sacred vestures hem ii song oer the smooth enamelled green where no print of step hath been follow me as i sing and touch the warbled string under the shady roof of branching elm starproof follow me i will bring you where she sits clad in splendor as befits her deity such a rural queen all arcadia hath not seen iii song nymphs and shepherds dance no more by sandy ladons lilied

pair of sirens pledges of heavens joy sphereborn harmonious sisters voice and verse wed your divine sounds and mixed power employ dead things with inbreathed sense able to pierce and to our highraised phantasy present that undisturbed song of pure concent aye sung before the sapphirecolored throne to him that sits thereon with saintly shout and solemn jubilee where the bright seraphim in burning row their loud uplifted angeltrumpets blow and the cherubic host in thousand quires touch their immortal harps of golden wires with those just spirits that wear victorious palms hymns devout and holy psalms singing everlastingly that we on earth with undiscording voice may rightly answer that melodious noise as once we did till disproportioned sin jarred against natures chime and with harsh din broke the fair music that all creatures made to their great lord whose love their motion swayed in perfect diapason whilst they stood in first obedience and their state of good o may we soon again renew that song and keep in tune with heaven till god ere long to his celestial consort us unite to live with him and sing in endless morn of light comus a masque presented at ludlow castle the persons the attendant spirit afterwards in the habit of thyrsis comus with his crew the lady first brother second brother sabrina the nymph the first scene discovers a wild wood the attendant spirit descends or enters spirit before the starry threshold of joves court my mansion is where those immortal shapes of bright aerial spirits live insphered in regions mild of calm and serene air above the smoke and stir of this dim spot which men call earth and with lowthoughted care confined and pestered in this pinfold here strive to keep up a frail and feverish being unmindful of the crown that virtue gives after this mortal change to her true servants amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats yet some there be that by due steps aspire to lay their just hands on that golden key that opes the palace of eternity to such my errand is and but for such i would not soil these pure ambrosial weeds with the rank vapors of this sinworn mould but to my task neptune besides the sway of every salt flood and each ebbing stream took in by lot twixt high and nether jove imperial rule of all the seagirt isles that like to rich and various gems inlay the unadorned bosom of the deep which he to grace his tributary gods by course commits to several government and gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns and wield their little tridents but this isle the greatest and the best of all the main he quarters to his bluehaired deities and all this tract that fronts the falling sun a noble peer of mickle trust and power has in his charge with tempered awe to guide an old and haughty nation proud in arms where his fair offspring nursed in princely lore are coming to attend their fathers state and newintrusted sceptre but their way lies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood the nodding horror of those shady brows threats the forlorn and wandering passenger and here their tender age might suffer peril but that by quick command from sovran jove i was despatched for their defence and guard and listen why for i will tell you now what never yet was heard in tale or song from old or modern bard in hall or bower bacchus that first from out the purple grape crushed the sweet poison of misused wine after the tuscan mariners transformed coasting the tyrrhene shore as the winds listed on circes island fell who knows not circe the daughter of the sun whose charmed cup whoever tasted lost his upright shape and downward fell into a grovelling swine this nymph that gazed upon his clustering locks with ivy berries wreathed and his blithe youth had by him ere he parted thence a son much like his father but his mother more whom therefore she brought up and comus named who ripe and frolic of his fullgrown age roving the celtic and iberian fields at last betakes him to this ominous wood and in thick shelter of black shades imbowered excels his mother at her mighty art offering to every weary traveller his orient liquor in a crystal glass to quench the drouth of phoebus which as they taste for most do taste through fond intemperate thirst soon as the potion works their human countnance the express resemblance of the gods is changed into some brutish form of wolf or bear or ounce or tiger hog or bearded goat all other parts remaining as they were and they so perfect in their misery not once perceive their foul disfigurement but boast themselves more comely than before and all their friends and native home forget to roll with pleasure in a sensual sty therefore when any favored of high jove chances to pass through this adventurous glade swift as the sparkle of a glancing star i shoot from heaven to give him safe convoy as now i do but first i must put off these my skyrobes spun out of iris woof and take the weeds and likeness of a swain that to the service of this house belongs who with his soft pipe and smoothdittied song well knows to still the wild winds when they roar and hush the waving woods nor of less faith and in this office of his mountain watch likeliest and nearest to the present aid of this occasion but i hear the tread of hateful steps i must be viewless now comus enters with a charmingrod in one hand his glass in the other with him a rout of monsters headed like sundry sorts of wild beasts but otherwise like men and women their apparel glistering they come in making a riotous and unruly noise with torches in their hands comus the star that bids the shepherd fold now the top of heaven doth hold and the gilded car of day his glowing axle doth allay in the steep atlantic stream and the slope sun his upward beam shoots against the dusky pole pacing toward the other goal of his chamber in the east meanwhile welcome joy and feast midnight shout and revelry tipsy dance and jollity braid your locks with rosy twine dropping odors dropping wine rigor now is gone to bed and advice with scrupulous head strict age and sour severity with their grave saws in slumber lie we that are of purer fire imitate the starry quire who in their nightly watchful spheres lead in swift round the months and years the sounds and seas with all their finny drove now to the moon in wavering morrice move and on the tawny sands and shelves trip the pert fairies and the dapper elves by dimpled brook and fountainbrim the woodnymphs decked with daisies trim their merry wakes and pastimes keep what hath night to do with sleep night hath better sweets to prove venus now wakes and wakens love come let us our rites begin tis only daylight that makes sin which these dun shades will neer report hail goddess of nocturnal sport darkveiled cotytto to whom the secret flame of midnight torches burns mysterious dame that neer art called but when the dragon womb of stygian darkness spets her thickest gloom and makes one blot of all the air stay thy cloudy ebon chair wherein thou ridest with hecat and befriend us thy vowed priests till utmost end of all thy dues be done and none left out ere the blabbing eastern scout the nice morn on the indian steep from her cabined loophole peep and to the telltale sun descry our concealed solemnity come knit hands and beat the ground in a light fantastic round the measure break off break off i feel the different pace of some chaste footing near about this ground run to your shrouds within these brakes and trees our number may affright some virgin sure for so i can distinguish by mine art benighted in these woods now to my charms and to my wily trains i shall ere long be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed about my mother circe thus i hurl my dazzling spells into the spongy air of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion and give it false presentments lest the place and my quaint habits breed astonishment and put the damsel to suspicious flight which must not be for thats against my course i under fair pretence of friendly ends and wellplaced words of glozing courtesy baited with reasons not unplausible wind me into the easyhearted man and hug him into snares when once her eye hath met the virtue of this magic dust i shall appear some harmless villager whom thrift keeps up about his country gear but here she comes i fairly step aside and hearken if i may her business hear the lady enters lady this way the noise was if mine ear be true my best guide now methought it was the sound of riot and illmanaged merriment such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds when for their teeming flocks and granges full in wanton dance they praise the bounteous pan and thank the gods amiss i should be loth to meet the rudeness and swilled insolence of such late wassailers yet oh where else shall i inform my unacquainted feet in the blind mazes of this tangled wood my brothers when they saw me wearied out with this long way resolving here to lodge under the spreading favor of these pines stepped as they said to the next thicketside to bring me berries or such cooling fruit as the kind hospitable woods provide they left me then when the grayhooded even like a sad votarist in palmers weed rose from the hindmost wheels of phoebus wain but where they are and why they came not back is now the labor of my thoughts tis likeliest they had engaged their wandering steps too far and envious darkness ere they could return had stole them from me else o thievish night why shouldst thou but for some felonious end in thy dark lantern thus close up the stars that nature hung in heaven and filled their lamps with everlasting oil to give due light to the misled and lonely traveller this is the place as well as i may guess whence even now the tumult of loud mirth was rife and perfect in my listening ear yet nought but single darkness do i find what might this be a thousand fantasies begin to throng into my memory of calling shapes and beckoning shadows dire and airy tongues that syllable mens names on sands and shores and desert wildernesses these thoughts may startle well but not astound the virtuous mind that ever walks attended by a strong siding champion conscience o welcome pureeyed faith whitehanded hope thou hovering angel girt with golden wings and thou unblemished form of chastity i see thee visibly and now believe that he the supreme good to whom all things ill are but as slavish officers of vengeance would send a glistering guardian if need were to keep my life and honor unassailed was i deceived or did a sable cloud turn forth her silver lining on the night i did not err there does a sable cloud turn forth her silver lining on the night and casts a gleam over this tufted grove i cannot hallo to my brothers but such noise as i can make to be heard farthest ill venture for my newenlivened spirits prompt me and they perhaps are not far off song sweet echo sweetest nymph that livst unseen within thy airy shell by slow meanders margent green and in the violetembroidered vale where the lovelorn nightingale nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair that likest thy narcissus are o if thou have hid them in some flowery cave tell me but where sweet queen of parley daughter of the sphere so mayst thou be translated to the skies and give resounding grace to all heavens harmonies comus can any mortal mixture of earths mould breathe such divine enchanting ravishment sure something holy lodges in that breast and with these raptures moves the vocal air to testify his hidden residence how sweetly did they float upon the wings of silence through the emptyvaulted night at every fall smoothing the raven down of darkness till it smiled i have oft heard my mother circe with the sirens three amidst the flowerykirtled naiades culling their potent herbs and baleful drugs who as they sung would take the prisoned soul and lap it in elysium scylla wept and chid her barking waves into attention and fell charybdis murmured soft applause yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense and in sweet madness robbed it of itself but such a sacred and homefelt delight such sober certainty of waking bliss i never heard till now ill speak to her and she shall be my queen hail foreign wonder whom certain these rough shades did never breed unless the goddess that in rural shrine dwellst here with pan or sylvan by blest song forbidding every bleak unkindly fog to touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood lady nay gentle shepherd ill is lost that praise that is addressed to unattending ears not any boast of skill but extreme shift how to regain my severed company compelled me to awake the courteous echo to give me answer from her mossy couch comus what chance good lady hath bereft you thus lady dim darkness and this leavy labyrinth comus could that divide you from nearushering guides lady they left me weary on a grassy turf comus by falsehood or discourtesy or why lady to seek i the valley some cool friendly spring comus and left your fair side all unguarded lady lady they were but twain and purposed quick return comus perhaps forestalling night prevented them lady how easy my misfortune is to hit comus imports their loss beside the present need lady no less than if i should my brothers lose comus were they of manly prime or youthful bloom lady as smooth as hebes their unrazored lips comus two such i saw what time the labored ox in his loose traces from the furrow came and the swinked hedger at his supper sat i saw them under a green mantling vine that crawls along the side of yon small hill plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots their port was more than human as they stood i took it for a faery vision of some gay creatures of the element that in the colors of the rainbow live and play i the plighted clouds i was awestrook and as i passed i worshiped if those you seek it were a journey like the path to heaven to help you find them lady gentle villager what readiest way would bring me to that place comus due west it rises from this shrubby point lady to find out that good shepherd i suppose in such a scant allowance of starlight would overtask the best landpilots art without the sure guess of wellpractised feet comus i know each lane and every alley green dingle or bushy dell of this wild wood and every bosky bourn from side to side my daily walks and ancient neighborhood and if your stray attendance be yet lodged or shroud within these limits i shall know ere morrow wake or the lowroosted lark from her thatched pallet rouse if otherwise i can conduct you lady to a low but loyal cottage where you may be safe till further quest lady shepherd i take thy word and trust thy honestoffered courtesy which oft is sooner found in lowly sheds with smoky rafters than in tapestry halls and courts of princes where it first was named and yet is most pretended in a place less warranted than this or less secure i cannot be that i should fear to change it eye me blest providence and square my trial to my proportioned strength shepherd lead on the two brothers eld bro unmuffle ye faint stars and thou fair moon that wontst to love the travellers benison stoop thy pale visage through an amber cloud and disinherit chaos that reigns here in double

long levelled rule of streaming light and thou shalt be our star of arcady or tyrian cynosure sec bro or if our eyes be barred that happiness might we but hear the folded flocks penned in their wattled cotes or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops or whistle from the lodge or village cock count the nightwatches to his feathery dames twould be some solace yet some little cheering in this close dungeon of innumerous boughs but oh that hapless virgin our lost sister where may she wander now whither betake her from the chill dew amongst rude burs and thistles perhaps some cold bank is her bolster now or gainst the rugged bark of some broad elm leans her unpillowed head fraught with sad fears what if in wild amazement and affright or while we speak within the direful grasp of savage hunger or of savage heat eld bro peace brother be not overexquisite to cast the fashion of uncertain evils for grant they be so while they rest unknown what need a man forestall his date of grief and run to meet what he would most avoid or if they be but false alarms of fear how bitter is such selfdelusion i do not think my sister so to seek or so unprincipled in virtues book and the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever as that the single want of light and noise not being in danger as i trust she is not could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts and put them into misbecoming plight virtue could see to do what virtue would by her own radiant light though sun and moon were in the flat sea sunk and wisdoms self oft seeks to sweet retired solitude where with her best nurse contemplation she plumes her feathers and lets grow her wings that in the various bustle of resort were all toruffled and sometimes impaired he that has light within his own clear breast may sit i the

the pensive secrecy of desert cell far from the cheerful haunt of men and herds and sits as safe as in a senatehouse for who would rob a hermit of his weeds his few books or his beads or maple dish or do his gray hairs any violence but beauty like the fair hesperian tree laden with blooming gold had need the guard of dragonwatch with unenchanted eye to save her blossoms and defend her fruit from the rash hand of bold incontinence you may as well spread out the unsunned heaps of misers treasure by an outlaws den and tell me it is safe as bid me hope danger will wink on opportunity and let a single helpless maiden pass uninjured in this wild surrounding waste of night or loneliness it recks me not i fear the dread events that dog them both lest some illgreeting touch attempt the person of our unowned sister eld bro i do not brother infer as if i thought my sisters state secure without all doubt or controversy yet where an equal poise of hope and fear does arbitrate the event my nature is that i incline to hope rather than fear and gladly banish squint suspicion my sister is not so defenceless left as you imagine she has a hidden strength which you remember not sec bro what hidden strength unless the strength of heaven if you mean that eld bro i mean that too but yet a hidden strength which if heaven gave it may be termed her own tis chastity my brother chastity she that has that is clad in complete steel and like a quivered nymph with arrows keen may trace huge forests and unharbored heaths infamous hills and sandy perilous wilds where through the sacred rays of chastity no savage fierce bandite or mountaineer will dare to soil her virgin purity yea there where very desolation dwells by grots and caverns shagged with horrid shades she may pass on with unblenched majesty be it not done in pride or in presumption some say no evil thing that walks by night in fog or fire by lake or moorish fen blue meagre hag or stubborn unlaid ghost that breaks his magic chains at curfew time no goblin or swart faery of the mine hath hurtful power oer true virginity do ye believe me yet or shall i call antiquity from the old schools of greece to testify the arms of chastity hence had the huntress dian her dread bow fair silvershafted queen forever chaste wherewith she tamed the brinded lioness and spotted mountainpard but set at nought the frivolous bolt of cupid gods and men feared her stern frown and she was queen o the woods what was that snakyheaded gorgon shield that wise minerva wore unconquered virgin wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone but rigid looks of chaste austerity and noble grace that dashed brute violence with sudden adoration and blank awe so dear to heaven is saintly chastity that when a soul is found sincerely so a thousand liveried angels lackey her driving far off each thing of sin and guilt and in clear dream and solemn vision tell her of things that no gross ear can hear till oft converse with heavenly habitants begin to cast a beam on the outward shape the unpolluted temple of the mind and turns it by degrees to the souls essence till all be made immortal but when lust by unchaste looks loose gestures and foul talk but most by lewd and lavish act of sin lets in defilement to the inward parts the soul grows clotted by contagion imbodies and imbrutes till she quite lose the divine property of her first

in all his mothers witcheries and here to every thirsty wanderer by sly enticement gives his baneful cup with many murmurs mixed whose pleasing poison the visage quite transforms of him that drinks

baits and guileful spells to inveigle and invite the unwary sense of them that pass unweeting by the way this evening late by then the chewing flocks had taen their supper on the savory herb of knotgrass dewbesprent and were in fold i sat me down to watch upon a bank with ivy canopied and interwove with flaunting honeysuckle and began wrapt in a pleasing fit of melancholy to meditate my rural minstrelsy till fancy had her fill but ere a close the wonted roar was up amidst the woods and filled the air with barbarous dissonance at which i ceased and listened them a while till an unusual stop of sudden silence gave respite to the drowsyflighted steeds that draw the litter of closecurtained sleep at last a soft and solemnbreathing sound rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes and stole upon the air that even silence was took ere she was ware and wished she might deny her nature and be never more still to be so displaced i was all ear and took in strains that might create a soul under the ribs of death but oh ere long too well i did perceive it was the voice of my most honored lady your dear sister amazed i stood harrowed with grief and fear and o poor hapless nightingale thought i how sweet thou singst how near the deadly snare then down the lawns i ran with headlong haste through paths and turnings often trod by day till guided by mine ear i found the

care and utmost shifts how to secure the lady from surprisal brought to my mind a certain shepherd lad of small regard to see to yet well skilled in every virtuous plant and healing herb that spreads her verdant leaf to the morning ray he loved me well and oft would beg me sing which when i did he on the tender grass would sit and hearken even to ecstasy and in requital ope his leathern scrip and show me simples of a thousand names telling their strange and vigorous faculties amongst the rest a small unsightly root but of divine effect he culled me out the leaf was darkish and had prickles on

may be used which once of meliboeus old i learnt the soothest shepherd that eer piped on plains there is a gentle nymph not far from hence that with moist curb sways the smooth severn stream sabrina is her name a virgin pure whilom she was the daughter of locrine that had the sceptre from his father brute she guiltless damsel flying the mad pursuit of her enraged stepdame guendolen commended her fair innocence to the flood that stayed her flight with his crossflowing course the waternymphs that in the bottom played held up their pearled wrists and took her in bearing her straight to aged nereus hall who piteous of her woes reared her lank head and gave her to his daughters to imbathe in nectared lavers strewed with asphodel and through the porch and inlet of each sense dropt in ambrosial oils till she revived and underwent a quick immortal change made goddess of the river still she retains her maiden gentleness and oft at eve visits the herds along the twilight meadows helping all urchin blasts and illluck signs that the shrewd meddling elf delights to make which she with precious vialed liquors heals for which the shepherds at their festivals carol her goodness loud in rustic lays and throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream of pansies pinks and gaudy daffodils and as the old swain said she can unlock the clasping charm and thaw the numbing spell if she be right invoked in warbled song for maidenhood she loves and will be swift to aid a virgin such as was herself in hardbesetting need this will i try and add the power of some adjuring verse song sabrina fair listen where thou art sitting under the glassy cool translucent wave in twisted braids of lilies knitting the loose train of thy amberdropping hair listen for dear honors sake goddess of

rushyfringed bank where grow the willow and the osier dank my sliding chariot stays thick set with agate and the azurn sheen of turkis blue and emerald green that in the channel strays whilst from off

i come to pluck your berries harsh and crude and with forced fingers rude shatter your leaves before the mellowing year bitter constraint and sad occasion dear compels me to disturb your season due for lycidas is dead dead ere his prime young lycidas and hath not left his peer who would not sing for lycidas he knew himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme he must not float upon his watery bier

string hence with denial vain and coy excuse so may some gentle muse with lucky words favor my destined urn and as he passes turn and bid fair peace be to my sable shroud for we were nursed upon the selfsame hill fed the same flock by fountain shade and rill together both ere the high lawns appeared under the opening eyelids of the morn we drove afield and both together heard what time the grayfly winds her sultry horn battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night oft till the star that rose at evening bright toward heavens descent had sloped his westering wheel meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute tempered to the oaten flute rough satyrs danced and fauns with cloven heel from the glad sound would not be absent long and old damoetas loved to hear our song but oh the heavy change now thou art gone now thou art gone and never must return thee shepherd thee the woods and desert caves with wild thyme and the gadding vine oergrown and all their echoes mourn the willows and the hazel copses green shall now no more be seen fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays as killing as the canker to the rose or taintworm to the weanling herds that graze or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear when first the whitethorn blows such lycidas thy loss to shepherds ear where were ye nymphs when the remorseless deep closed oer the head of your loved lycidas for neither were ye playing on the steep where your old bards the famous druids lie nor on the shaggy top of mona high nor yet where deva spreads her wizard stream ay me i fondly dream had ye been there for what could that have done what could the muse herself that orpheus bore the muse herself for her enchanting son whom universal nature did lament when by the rout that made the hideous roar his gory visage down the stream was sent down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore alas what boots it with uncessant care to tend the homely slighted shepherds trade and strictly meditate the thankless muse were it not better done as others use to sport with amaryllis in the shade or with the tangles of neras hair fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise that last infirmity of noble mind to scorn delights and live laborious days but the fair guerdon when we hope to find and think to burst out into sudden blaze comes the blind fury with the abhorred shears and slits the thinspun life but not the praise phoebus replied and touched my trembling ears fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil nor in the glistering foil set off to the world nor in broad rumor lies but lives and spreads aloft

rigged with curses dark that sunk so low that sacred head of thine next camus reverend sire went footing slow his mantle hairy and his bonnet sedge inwrought with figures dim and on the edge like to

iron shuts amain he shook his mitred locks and stern bespake how well could i have spared for thee young swain enow of such as for their bellies sake creep and intrude and climb into the fold of other care they little reckoning make than how to scramble at the shearers feast and shove away the worthy bidden guest blind mouths that scarce themselves know how to hold a sheephook or have learnt aught else the least that to the faithful herdmans art belongs what recks it them what need they they are sped and when they list their lean and flashy songs grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw the hungry sheep look up and are not fed but swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw rot inwardly and foul contagion spread besides what the grim wolf with privy paw daily devours apace and nothing said but that twohanded engine at the door stands ready to smite once and smite no more return alpheus the dread voice is past that shrunk thy streams return sicilian muse and call the vales

looks throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes that on the green turf suck the honeyed showers and purple all the ground with vernal flowers bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies the tufted crowtoe and pale jessamine the white pink and the pansy freaked with jet the glowing violet the muskrose and the wellattired woodbine with cowslips wan that hang the pensive head and every flower that sad embroidery wears bid amaranthus all his beauty shed and daffadillies fill their cups with tears to strew the laureate hearse where lycid lies for so to interpose a little ease let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise ay me whilst thee the shores and sounding seas wash far away whereer thy bones are hurled whether beyond the stormy hebrides where thou perhaps under the whelming tide visitst the bottom of the monstrous world or whether thou to our moist vows denied sleepst by the fable of bellerus old where the great vision of the guarded mount looks toward namancos and bayonas hold look homeward angel now and melt with ruth and o ye dolphins waft the hapless youth weep no more woeful shepherds weep no more for lycidas your sorrow is not dead sunk though he be beneath the watery floor so sinks the daystar in the ocean bed and yet anon repairs his drooping head and tricks his beams and with newspangled ore flames in the forehead of the morning sky so lycidas sunk low but mounted high through the dear might of him that walked the waves where other groves and other streams along with nectar pure his oozy locks he laves and hears the unexpressive nuptial song in the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love there entertain him all the saints above in solemn troops and sweet societies that sing and singing in their glory move and wipe the tears forever from his eyes now lycidas the shepherds weep no more henceforth thou art the genius of the shore in thy large recompense and shalt be good to all that wander in that perilous flood thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills while the still morn went out with sandals gray he touched the tender stops of various quills with eager thought warbling his doric lay and now the sun had stretched out

love sweetness goodness in her person shined so clear as in no face with more delight but oh as to embrace me she inclined i waked she fled and day brought back my night notes on the morning of christs nativity from his sixteenth year milton had been wont to write freely in latin verse on miscellaneous poetic themes sometimes expressing his thoughts on events of the day and sometimes addressing letters to his friends on purely personal matters from these latin poems which therefore in some sense belong to english literature we obtain valuable insight into his course of life and his way of thinking what milton wrote in foreign languages is indispensable for the information it gives us about himself its content is important but as poetry implies a fusing of content and form into an artistic unity if one of these elements is foreign the result is nondescript and cannot be ranged under the head of english literature in the strict sense of the term it is in one of miltons own latin pieces that we find our best commentary on the hymn on the nativity the sixth latin elegy is an epistle to his intimate college friend charles diodati making a stay in the country the last twelve lines of which may be freely translated as follows but if you shall wish to know what i am doing if indeed you think it worth your while to know whether i am doing anything at all we are singing the peacebringing king born of heavenly seed and the happy ages promised in the sacred books and the crying of the infant god lying in a manger under a poor roof who dwells with his father in the realms above and the starry sky and the squadrons singing on high and the gods suddenly driven away to their own fanes those gifts we have indeed given to the birthday of christ that first light brought them to me at dawn thee also they await sung to our native pipes thou shalt be to me in lieu of a judge for me to read them to this means of course that the poet is composing a christmas hymn in his native language we must note his age at this time twentyone years he is a student at cambridge the poem remains the great christmas hymn in our literature the ode on the nativity says professor saintsbury is a test of the readers power to appreciate poetry in four stanzas the poet speaks in his own person he too must with the wise men from the east bring such gifts as he has to offer to the infant god his offering is the humble ode which follows we must take note of the change in the metric form which marks the transition from the introduction to the ode in the stanzas of the former the lines all have five accents except the last which has six while in the latter four lines have three accents each one has four two have five and one has six notice also the occasional hypermetric lines

polluted the turning sphere for poetical purposes milton everywhere adopts the popular astronomy of his day which was based on the ancient ie the ptolemaic or geocentric system of the universe copernicus had already taught the modern heliocentric theory of the solar system and his innovations were not unknown to milton who however consistently adheres to the old conceptions in milton therefore we find the earth the centre of the visible universe while the sun the planets and the fixed stars revolve about it in their several spheres these spheres are nine in number arranged concentrically like the coats of an onion about the earth and if of solid matter are to be conceived as being of perfectly transparent crystal beginning with the innermost they present themselves in the following order the moon mercury venus the sun mars jupiter saturn the fixed stars the primum mobile in par lost iii the ninth sphere appears as that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs the trepidation talked and the primum mobile or the first moved becomes the tenth and outermost of the series the last two spheres contain no stars we see then what we must understand by the oftrecurring spheres in miltons poetry in the line down through the turning sphere however the singular sphere is obviously used to mean the whole aggregate of spheres composing the starry universe with turtle

it bred about the time of the winter solstice in a nest floating on the sea and that it charmed the wind and waves so that the sea was specially calm during the period usually identified with a species of kingfisher hence a poetic name of this bird their precious influence the word influence is originally a term of astrology a flowing in or influent course of the planets their virtue infused

announce the deposition and expulsion of the pagan deities and the ruin of the ancient religions in accordance with his custom of grouping selected proper names in abundance thus giving vividness and concreteness to his story and sonority to his verse the poet here illustrates the triumph of the new dispensation by citing the names of various gods from the roman greek syrian and egyptian mythologies apollo the great god whose oracle was at delphi or delphos spell as in comus and often genius a latin word signifying a tutelary or guardian spirit supposed to preside over a person or

shakespeare known as the first folio was published in when milton was fifteen years old the second shakespeare folio appeared in among the commendatory verses by various hands prefixed after the fashion of the time to the latter volume was a little piece of eight couplets in which some then unknown rhymer expressed his admiration of the great poet collecting his poems for publication in milton included these couplets gave them the date and the title on shakespeare which they have since borne in his works the fact that he wrote the verses two years before their publication in the shakespeare folio shows that he did not produce them to order for the special occasion it is interesting to note that milton at twentytwo was an appreciative reader of shakespeare the lines themselves give no hint of great poetic genius they are a fair specimen of the conventional labored eulogy in vogue at the time starypointing to make the decasyllabic verse the poet takes the liberty of prefixing to the present participle the y which properly belongs only to the past a livelong monument instead of livelong the first issue of the lines in the shakespeare folio of has lasting the change is miltons appearing in his revision of his poems in does it seem to be an improvement and that each heart hath took the conjunction that simply repeats the whilst thy unvalued book in hamlet i

make the word sepulchred fit metrically into the iambic verse lallegro and il penseroso the year in which the poems were composed is uncertain masson regards as the probable date the exquisite poems to which milton gave the italian titles lallegro the mirthful or jovial man and il penseroso the melancholy or saturnine man should be regarded each as the pendant and complement of the other and should be read as a single whole the poet knew both moods and takes both standpoints with equal grace and heartiness the essential idea of thus contrasting the mirthful and the melancholy temperament he found ready to his hand robert burton had prefaced his anatomy of melancholy published in with a series of not unpleasing though by no means graceful amoebean stanzas in which two speakers alternately represent melancholy one as sweet and divine and the other as harsh sour and damned undoubtedly milton knew his burton but if he got his main idea from this source he made his poems thoroughly miltonic by his art of visualizing in delicious pictures the various phases of his abstract theme the poems are wholly poetical equally free from obscurity of thought and from obscurity of expression each poem is prefaced with a vigorous exorcism of the spirit to which it is hostile this is couched in alternate three and five accent iambics preparing a delicious rhythmic effect when the metre changes in the invocation to the octosyllable with or without anacrusis in lallegro we accompany the mirthful man through an entire day of his pleasures from early morning to late evening the melancholy man moves through a programme less definitely and regularly planned the scenes of his delights are mostly in the hours of the night when the sun is up he hides himself from days garish eye lallegro of cerberus and blackest midnight born milton follows the example of the ancient poets in announcing the parentage of the principal beings whom he brings upon his stage moreover he uses the ancient freedom in assigning mythical pedigrees not only adopting no authority as a canon but allowing his own fancy to invent origins as suits his purpose he knew the greek and latin poets and assumed for himself the privilege which they exercised of shaping the myths as they pleased we are not therefore to seek in milton a reproduction of any system of mythology cerberus was the terrible threeheaded dog of pluto his station was at the entrance to the lower world or the stygian cave the stygian cave is so called from the styx the infernal river the flood of deadly hate some uncouth

hear the lark etc lallegro begins his day with early morning here we must imagine him as having risen and gone forth where he can see the sky and can look about him to see what is going on in the farmyard then to come in spite of sorrow and at my window bid goodmorrow it must be lallegro himself who comes to the window and as he is outside he comes to look in through the shrubbery and bid good

introduced with a new grammatical subject where corydon and thyrsis met the proper names in lines add to the poem a pleasing touch of pastoral simplicity and cheerfulness they are taken from the common stock of names which originally devised by the greek idyllists for their shepherds and shepherdesses have by the pastoral poets of all subsequent ages been appropriated to their special use corydon and thyrsis stand for farmlaborers phyllis and thestylis for their wives or housekeepers the day of lallegro has now advanced to dinnertime phyllis has been preparing the frugal meal as we could surmise from the smoking chimney as soon as the dinner is over the women go out to work with the men in the harvest field bower means simply dwelling in the tanned haycock we see the hay dried

comedy as the buskin does tragedy compare il penseroso or sweetest shakespeare fancys child warble his native woodnotes wild the couplet seems intended to convey the idea of a counterpart or contrast to the learned sock of jonson so considered it is by no means an unhappy characterization the last of the unreproved pleasures that lallegro wishes he may enjoy seems not so much planned to follow the

invoked mirth in lallegro under her greek name euphrosyne the poet finds no corresponding greek designation for melancholy to us melancholy seems a name unhappily chosen but see how milton applies it

ethiopian prince black and celebrated for his beauty recall virgils nigri memnonis arma that starred ethiop queen cassiopeia wife of the ethiopian king cepheus boasted that she was more beautiful than

would leave us to infer that the robe of melancholy is of a deep rich color so dark as to be almost black dr murray quotes from southeys thalaba the ebony with darkness feeds its boughs of raven grain what objection is there to making the grain in miltons passage black and sable stole of cypress lawn dr murray thus defines cypress lawn a light transparent material resembling cobweb lawn or crape

shepherds thereafter made their pipes at a solemn music the poet listens to what in the phrase of his time is a solemn music but which we should name a sacred concert the poem is unalloyed lyric expressing the rapture to which the music has lifted his soul we must remember that milton was himself an amateur musician and in his days of darkness found habitual diversion at his organ indications of a susceptible and appreciative ear for musical harmony are frequent throughout the poems the sapphirecolored throne see ezekiel i consort is the word from which we derive our concert comus during the reigns of elizabeth james i and charles i the mask was one of the most popular forms of dramatic entertainment having a function and a character peculiar to itself it flourished side by side with the regular plays of the theatrical stage and gave large scope to the genius of poets composers and scenic artists the mask was usually designed to grace some important occasion in which members of the upper classes of society or even royal personages were concerned when the occasion called for particularly brilliant display and had been long foreseen the preparations for it would involve immense outlays for costumes theatrical machinery for new music and for a libretto by a playwriter of the greatest note when the mask was purely a private one like arcades and comus it was all the fashion for the gentle youths and maidens for gentlemen and ladies of the highest rank to take upon themselves the parts of the drama to rehearse them assiduously and finally to enact them on the private stage or on the lawn in the presence of a select audience the mask thus differentiated itself from the stage play in that it was not given for the pecuniary behoof of a company of actors but represented rather expenditure for the simple purpose of producing grand effects to act in a mask was an honor when common players were social outcasts the mask was got up for the occasion and was not intended to keep the boards and attract a paying public when the august ceremonial was over the poet had his manuscript to increase the bulk of his works and the composer had his score to furnish airs that might be played and sung in drawingrooms if they had the good fortune to be popular such was the origin of the poem which milton in all the editions published during his lifetime entitled simply a maske presented at ludlow castle but which editors since his day have agreed to name comus the occasion of the poem was the coming of the earl of bridgewater to ludlow castle to enter upon his official residence there as lord president of wales the person chiefly concerned in the scenic musical and histrionic preparations of the mask was miltons esteemed friend the most accomplished musical composer of the day henry lawes lawes composed the music and arranged the stage business he seems to have taken upon himself the part of the attendant spirit lawes knew to whom to apply for the allimportant matter of the book the words or the poetry of the piece for he had learned to know miltons qualifications as a maskpoet in the fragment which we have under the name arcades with good music even for commonplace lyric verse and with sprightly declamation even of conventional dialogue the thing as we know from modern instances might have been carried off by gorgeous costumes and shrewdly devised scenic effects most of the masks of the time fell at once into oblivion but lawes had secured for his poet john milton and the consequence thereof is that the earl of bridgewater is now chiefly heard of because at ludlow castle there was enacted in the form of a mask written by milton a drama which is still read and reread by every englishspeaking person who reads any serious poetry though ludlow castle has long been a venerable ruin for his plot the poet feigned that the young children of the earl two sons and a daughter in coming to ludlow had to pass unattended through a forest in which the boys became separated from the girl and she fell into the hands of the enchanter comus the attendant spirit appears to the youths with his magic herb and with the further assistance of the waternymph sabrina at last makes all right and the children are restored to their parents in the midst of festive rejoicing the poem is dramatic because it is acted and spoken or sung in character by its persons it is allegorical because it inculcates a moral and more is meant than meets the ear in parts it is pastoral both because the chief personage appears in the guise of a shepherd and because its motive largely depends on the superstitions and traditions of simple ignorant folk in the longer speeches where events are narrated with some fulness it becomes epic lastly in

contribution to a volume of elegiac verses in greek latin and english composed by many college friends of edward king who was drowned in the wreck of the vessel in which he was crossing the irish channel in its main intention lycidas is an elegy because it professes to mourn one who is dead and extols his virtues in its form it is almost wholly pastoral because it feigns an environment of shepherds allegorizing college life as the life of men tending flocks and the occupations of earnest students as the careless diversions of rustic swains four times the pastoral note is rudely interrupted by the intervention of majestic beings who speak in awful tones from another world and whose voices instantly check all familiar rustic speech compelling it to wait till they have announced their messages from above the supernal powers who thus descend to take their parts in the office of mourning are phoebus apollo hippotades god of the winds camus god of the river cam and st peter this mingling of classic hebrew and christian conceptions is a marked characteristic of all miltons poetry thus lycidas is neither wholly elegiac nor wholly pastoral from the lips of st peter

leaves before the mellowing year either because he is to mourn the death of a young man or because he feels in himself a lack of inward ripeness to treat his theme worthily perhaps for both reasons he shatters the leaves with forced fingers rude in the sense that his subject is not of his own choosing a sad duty is imposed upon him forbidding further delay on any personal grounds lycidas is one of the stock names of pastoral poetry the poem though most serious in its main motive and intention is to have a pastoral coloring throughout note the impressive repetitions dead dead and the recurrences of the name lycidas in the next two lines he knew himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme edward king had in accordance with the college custom of his time written verses apparently all in latin of

labor this love of fame is an infirmity but not a debasing one it leaves the mind noble remember however that the author of the imitation of christ prayed da mihi nesciri the blind fury with the abhorred shears milton here seems to ascribe to the furies erinyes the function belonging to the fates parc moir the three fates were klotho the spinner lachesis the assigner of lots and atropos the unchanging it was the duty of atropos to cut the thread of life at the appointed time a querulous thought comes to the poets mind our lives are obscure and laborious sustained only by the hope of future fame but before we attain our reward comes death and our ambition is brought to naught but not the praise phoebus replied and touched my trembling ears the fury cannot destroy the praise which necessarily belongs to doing well praise here means the essential praise which naturally inheres in excellence and not the being talked about by men the speaker is now phoebus the august god apollo the pure one who protects law and order and promotes whatever is good and beautiful who reveals the will of zeus and presides over prophecy phoebus has now an admonition to give and he touches the

italy on which is situated mantua the birthplace of the poet virgil the great pastoral poet theocritus is said to have been born at syracuse thus arethusa and the mincius typify the pastoral tone in which milton conceives and constructs his poem but the intervention of the great god apollo has frighted the bucolic muses to whom therefore the poet explains it line now i am on good terms again with

become applicable till the execution of archbishop laud an event not to take place till eight years after the composition of the poem it has been suggested that milton had in mind the two houses of parliament or the parliament and the army as the agency through which reform was to be effected we must remember that milton in could not foresee the civil war he may have meant to combine certain scriptural expressions into a mysteriously suggestive and oracular prediction without having in view any single and definite possibility return alpheus the alpheus was a river of the peloponnesus said

the pastoral tone of lightness and simplicity could not be maintained while st peter spoke but now the sicilian muse returns all the more lovely for the contrast with the stern malediction that has

consequence it matters not whether all these flowers could or could not be collected at the same season or whether they could be found at the time of the year when lycidas died the passage offers a

the shepherd pipe doric means simply pastoral because the idylls of the first pastoral poets were written in the doric dialect of greek had stretched out all the hills had caused the shadows of the hills to prolong themselves eastward on the plain the poet seems to feign that he spent a day in the composition of lycidas sonnets of poems in strict sonnet form that is containing neither more nor less than fourteen decasyllable iambic lines interlocked by some scheme of symmetrical rhyme not in couplets milton left twentythree of which five are in italian of the three sonnets in english omitted from this edition two have reference to the violent controversy occasioned by miltons publications in advocacy of greater freedom of divorce and are rough and polemic in style the third is omitted on account of its unimportance and lack of distinction in their dates the twentythree sonnets range from the poets twentythird to his fiftieth year they are the only form of verse in which he indulges during that middle period of his life which was abandoned to political partisanship on the side of the parliament in the civil war and to the service of the government during the commonwealth and the protectorate if as is now widely believed shakespeares sonnets are artificial and tell us little or nothing about their author those of milton are purely natural and subjective and tell us nothing else but what their writer was thinking and feeling their themes are his veritable moods and passions the mood is now friendly amiable and serene now bitter strenuous indignant vindictive wordsworth in his sonnet scorn not the sonnet thus refers to miltons sparing use of this poetic form and when a damp fell round the path of milton in his hand the thing became a trumpet whence he blew soulanimating strains alas too few the shakespearean sonnet consists of three quatrains followed by a couplet the usual english form up to the seventeenth century milton adopted the italian or petrarchian model which has continued to be the standard sonnet form in our modern poetry in the miltonic or italian sonnet a group of eight lines linked by two rhymes each occurring four times is followed by a group of six lines linked by three rhymes each occurring twice the octave and the sextet are severed from each other by the noncontinuance of the rhymes of the former into the latter at

the rude bird of hate this gives to the cuckoo altogether too bad a character the bird has on the whole a fair standing in english poetry we must think of the very pleasing ode to the cuckoo written either by michael bruce or by john logan as well as of the passage in which shakespeare makes lucrece ask line why should the worm intrude the maiden bud or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows nests look up other nightingale and cuckoo songs for example keatss ode to a nightingale and wordsworths the cuckoo at laverna ii this sonnet milton appears to have sent with a prose letter to a friend who had remonstrated with him on the life of desultory study which he was so long continuing to lead in this letter he professes the principle of not taking thought of being late so it gave advantage to be more fit he adds that you may see that i am something suspicious of myself and do take notice of a certain belatedness in me i am the bolder to send you some of my nightward thoughts some little while ago because they come in not altogether unfitly made up in a petrarchian stanza which i told you of timelyhappy wise with the wisdom proportionate to ones years similar compounds of two adjectives in shakespeare are very frequent for example holycruel headyrash properfalse devilishholy coldpale even equal adequate viii the occasion of this sonnet was the near approach of the royalist army to london early in the civil war the people of the city had reason to fear the entrance of the cavalier troops and the sacking of the houses of citizens obnoxious to the party of the king milton would have been an object of special animosity to victorious royalists and for a short time he had grounds for the acutest anxiety it is not easy to see how in case of actual pillage of the city he could have made use of such an appeal as this the sonnet is probably to be regarded as a work of art constructed when the vicissitudes which it pictures were happily past and when the poets mind had regained its tranquillity note that colonel has three syllables according to the pronunciation prevailing in miltons time look up the etymology of this word the great emathian conqueror alexander the

of his voice and manner whether the great general had ever taken note of the poems written by the secretary who turned his despatches into latin or whether he gave any special heed to the man himself
