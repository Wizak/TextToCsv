doyles the stark munro letters home th march i have missed you very much since your return to america my dear bertie for you are the one man upon this earth to whom i have ever been able to unreservedly open my whole mind i dont know why it is for now that i come to think of it i have never enjoyed very much of your confidence in return but that may be my fault perhaps you dont find me sympathetic even though i have every wish to be i can only say that i find you intensely so and perhaps i presume too much upon the fact but no every instinct in my nature tells me that i dont bore you by my confidences can you remember cullingworth at the university you never were in the athletic set and so it is possible that you dont anyway ill take it for granted that you dont and explain it all from the beginning im sure that you would know his photograph however for the reason that he was the ugliest and queerestlooking man of our year physically he was a fine athlete one of the fastest and most determined rugby forwards that i have ever known though he played so savage a game that he was never given his international cap he was wellgrown five foot nine perhaps with square shoulders an arching chest and a quick jerky way of walking he had a round strong head bristling with short wiry black hair his face was wonderfully ugly but it was the ugliness of character which is as attractive as beauty his jaw and eyebrows were scraggy and roughhewn his nose aggressive and redshot his eyes small and near set light blue in colour and capable of assuming a very genial and also an exceedingly vindictive expression a slight wiry moustache covered his upper lip and his teeth were yellow strong and overlapping add to this that he seldom wore collar or necktie that his throat was the colour and texture of the bark of a scotch fir and that he had a voice and especially a laugh like a bulls bellow then you have some idea if you can piece all these items in your mind of the outward james cullingworth but the inner man after all was what was most worth noting i dont pretend to know what genius is carlyles definition always seemed to me to be a very crisp and clear statement of what it is not far from its being an infinite capacity for taking pains its leading characteristic as far as i have ever been able to observe it has been that it allows the possessor of it to attain results by a sort of instinct which other men could only reach by hard work in this sense cullingworth was the greatest genius that i have ever known he never seemed to work and yet he took the anatomy prize over the heads of all the tenhouraday men that might not count for much for he was quite capable of idling ostentatiously all day and then reading desperately all night but start a subject of your own for him and then see his originality and strength talk about torpedoes and he would catch up a pencil and on the back of an old envelope from his pocket he would sketch out some novel contrivance for piercing a ships netting and getting at her side which might no doubt involve some technical impossibility but which would at least be quite plausible and new then as he drew his bristling eyebrows would contract his small eyes would gleam with excitement his lips would be pressed together and he would end by banging on the paper with his open hand and shouting in his exultation you would think that his one mission in life was to invent torpedoes but next instant if you were to express surprise as to how it was that the egyptian workmen elevated the stones to the top of the pyramids out would come the pencil and envelope and he would propound a scheme for doing that with equal energy and conviction this ingenuity was joined to an extremely sanguine nature as he paced up and down in his jerky quick stepping fashion after one of these flights of invention he would take out patents for it receive you as his partner in the enterprise have it adopted in every civilised country see all conceivable applications of it count up his probable royalties sketch out the novel methods in which he would invest his gains and finally retire with the most gigantic fortune that has ever been amassed and you would be swept along by his words and would be carried every foot of the way with him so that it would come as quite a shock to you when you suddenly fell back to earth again and found yourself trudging the city street a poor student with kirks physiology under your arm and hardly the price of your luncheon in your pocket i read over what i have written but i can see that i give you no real insight into the demoniac cleverness of cullingworth his views upon medicine were most revolutionary but i daresay that if things fulfil their promise i may have a good deal to say about them in the sequel with his brilliant and unusual gifts his fine athletic record his strange way of dressing his hat on the back of his head and his throat bare his thundering voice and his ugly powerful face he had quite the most marked individuality of any man that i have ever known now you will think me rather prolix about this man but as it looks as if his life might become entwined with mine it is a subject of immediate interest to me and i am writing all this for the purpose of reviving my own halffaded impressions as well as in the hope of amusing and interesting you so i must just give you one or two other points which may make his character more clear to you he had a dash of the heroic in him on one occasion he was placed in such a position that he must choose between compromising a lady or springing out of a third floor window without a moments hesitation he hurled himself out of the window as luck would have it he fell through a large laurel bush on to a garden plot which was soft with rain and so escaped with a shaking and a bruising if i have to say anything that gives a bad impression of the man put that upon the other side he was fond of rough horseplay but it was better to avoid it with him for you could never tell what it might lead to his temper was nothing less than infernal i have seen him in the dissectingrooms begin to skylark with a fellow and then in an instant the fun would go out of his face his little eyes would gleam with fury and the two would be rolling worrying each other like dogs below the table he would be dragged off panting and speechless with fury with his wiry hair bristling straight up like a fighting terriers this pugnacious side of his character would be worthily used sometimes i remember that an address which was being given to us by an eminent london specialist was much interrupted by a man in the front row who amused himself by interjecting remarks the lecturer appealed to his audience at last these interruptions are insufferable gentlemen said he will no one free me from this annoyance hold your tongue you sir on the front bench cried cullingworth in his bulls bellow perhaps youll make me said the fellow turning a contemptuous face over his shoulder cullingworth closed his notebook and began to walk down on the tops of the desks to the delight of the three hundred spectators it was fine to see the deliberate way in which he picked his way among the ink bottles as he sprang down from the last bench on to the floor his opponent struck him a smashing blow full in the face cullingworth got his bulldog grip on him however and rushed him backwards out of the class room what he did with him i dont know but there was a noise like the delivery of a ton of coals and the champion of law and order returned with the sedate air of a man who had done his work one of his eyes looked like an overripe damson but we gave him three cheers as he made his way back to his seat then we went on with the dangers of placenta praevia he was not a man who drank hard but a little drink would have a very great effect upon him then it was that the ideas would surge from his brain each more fantastic and ingenious than the last and if ever he did get beyond the borderland he would do the most amazing things sometimes it was the fighting instinct that would possess him sometimes the preaching and sometimes the comic or they might come in succession replacing each other so rapidly as to bewilder his companions intoxication brought all kinds of queer little peculiarities with it one of them was that he could walk or run perfectly straight but that there always came a time when he unconsciously returned upon his tracks and retraced his steps again this had a strange effect sometimes as in the instance which i am about to tell you very sober to outward seeming but in a frenzy within he went down to the station one night and stooping to the pigeonhole he asked the ticketclerk in the suavest voice whether he could tell him how far it was to london the official put forward his face to reply when cullingworth drove his fist through the little hole with the force of a piston the clerk flew backwards off his stool and his yell of pain and indignation brought some police and railway men to his assistance they pursued cullingworth but he as active and as fit as a greyhound outraced them all and vanished into the darkness down the long straight street the pursuers had stopped and were gathered in a knot talking the matter over when looking up they saw to their amazement the man whom they were after running at the top of his speed in their direction his little peculiarity had asserted itself you see and he had unconsciously turned in his flight they tripped him up flung themselves upon him and after a long and desperate struggle dragged him to the police station he was charged before the magistrate next morning but made such a brilliant speech from the dock in his own defence that he carried the court with him and escaped with a nominal fine at his invitation the witnesses and the police trooped after him to the nearest hotel and the affair ended in universal whiskyandsodas well now if after all these illustrations i have failed to give you some notion of the man able magnetic unscrupulous interesting manysided i must despair of ever doing so ill suppose however that i have not failed and i will proceed to tell you my most patient of confidants something of my personal relations with cullingworth when i first made a casual acquaintance with him he was a bachelor at the end of a long vacation however he met me in the street and told me in his loudvoiced volcanic shoulderslapping way that he had just been married at his invitation i went up with him then and there to see his wife and as we walked he told me the history of his wedding which was as extraordinary as everything else he did i wont tell it to you here my dear bertie for i feel that i have dived down too many side streets already but it was a most bustling business in which the locking of a governess into her room and the dyeing of cullingworths hair played prominent parts apropos of the latter he was never quite able to get rid of its traces and from this time forward there was added to his other peculiarities the fact that when the sunlight struck upon his hair at certain angles it turned it all iridescent and shimmering well i went up to his lodgings with him and was introduced to mrs cullingworth she was a timid little sweetfaced greyeyed woman quietvoiced and gentlemannered you had only to see the way in which she looked at him to understand that she was absolutely under his control and that do what he might or say what he might it would always be the best thing to her she could be obstinate too in a gentle dovelike sort of way but her obstinacy lay always in the direction of backing up his sayings and doings this however i was only to find out afterwards and at that my first visit she impressed me as being one of the sweetest little women that i had ever known they were living in the most singular style in a suite of four small rooms over a grocers shop there was a kitchen a bedroom a sittingroom and a fourth room which cullingworth insisted upon regarding as a most unhealthy apartment and a focus of disease though i am convinced that it was nothing more than the smell of cheeses from below which had given him the idea at any rate with his usual energy he had not only locked the room up but had gummed varnished paper over all the cracks of the door to prevent the imaginary contagion from spreading the furniture was the sparest possible there were i remember only two chairs in the sitting room so that when a guest came and i think i was the only one cullingworth used to squat upon a pile of yearly volumes of the british medical journal in the corner i can see him now levering himself up from his lowly seat and striding about the room roaring and striking with his hands while his little wife sat mum in the corner listening to him with love and admiration in her eyes what did we care any one of the three of us where we sat or how we lived when youth throbbed hot in our veins and our souls were all aflame with the possibilities of life i still look upon those bohemian evenings in the bare room amid the smell of the cheese as being among the happiest that i have known i was a frequent visitor to the cullingworths for the pleasure that i got was made the sweeter by the pleasure which i hoped that i gave they knew no one and desired to know no one so that socially i seemed to be the only link that bound them to the world i even ventured to interfere in the details of their little menage cullingworth had a fad at the time that all the diseases of civilisation were due to the abandonment of the openair life of our ancestors and as a corollary he kept his windows open day and night as his wife was obviously fragile and yet would have died before she would have uttered a word of complaint i took it upon myself to point out to him that the cough from which she suffered was hardly to be cured so long as she spent her life in a draught he scowled savagely at me for my interference and i thought we were on the verge of a quarrel but it blew over and he became more considerate in the matter of ventilation our evening occupations just about that time were of a most extraordinary character you are aware that there is a substance called waxy matter which is deposited in the tissues of the body during the course of certain diseases what this may be and how it is formed has been a cause for much bickering among pathologists cullingworth had strong views upon the subject holding that the waxy matter was really the same thing as the glycogen which is normally secreted by the liver but it is one thing to have an idea and another to be able to prove it above all we wanted some waxy matter with which to experiment but fortune favoured us in the most magical way the professor of pathology had come into possession of a magnificent specimen of the condition with pride he exhibited the organ to us in the classroom before ordering his assistant to remove it to the ice chest preparatory to its being used for microscopical work in the practical class cullingworth saw his chance and acted on the instant slipping out of the classroom he threw open the icechest rolled his ulster round the dreadful glistening mass closed the chest again and walked quietly away i have no doubt that to this day the disappearance of that waxy liver is one of the most inexplicable mysteries in the career of our professor that evening and for many evenings to come we worked upon our liver for our experiments it was necessary to subject it all to great heat in an endeavour to separate the nitrogenous cellular substance from the nonnitrogenous waxy matter with our limited appliances the only way we could think of was to cut it into fine pieces and cook it in a frying pan so night after night the curious spectacle might have been seen of a beautiful young woman and two very earnest young men busily engaged in making these grim fricassees nothing came of all our work for though cullingworth considered that he had absolutely established his case and wrote long screeds to the medical papers upon the subject he was never apt at stating his views with his pen and he left i am sure a very confused idea on the minds of his readers as to what it was that he was driving at again as he was a mere student without any letters after his name he got scant attention and i never heard that he gained over a single supporter at the end of the year we both passed our examinations and became duly qualified medical men the cullingworths vanished away and i never heard any more of them for he was a man who prided himself upon never writing a letter his father had formerly a very large and lucrative practice in the west of scotland but he died some years ago i had a vague idea founded upon some chance remark of his that cullingworth had gone to see whether the family name might still stand him in good stead there as for me i began as you will remember that i explained in my last by acting as assistant in my fathers practice you know however that at its best it is not worth more than l a year with no room for expansion this is not large enough to keep two of us at work then again there are times when i can see that my religious opinions annoy the dear old man on the whole and for every reason i think that it would be better if i were out of this i applied for several steamship lines and for at least a dozen house surgeonships but there is as much competition for a miserable post with a hundred a year as if it were the viceroyship of india as a rule i simply get my testimonials returned without any comment which is the sort of thing that teaches a man humility of course it is very pleasant to live with the mater and my little brother paul is a regular trump i am teaching him boxing and you should see him put his tiny fists up and counter with his right he got me under the jaw this evening and i had to ask for poached eggs for supper and all this brings me up to the present time and the latest news it is that i had a telegram from cullingworth this morning after nine months silence it was dated from avonmouth the town where i had suspected that he had settled and it said simply come at once i have urgent need of you cullingworth of course i shall go by the first train tomorrow it may mean anything or nothing in my heart of hearts i hope and believe that old cullingworth sees an opening for me either as his partner or in some other way i always believed that he would turn up trumps and make my fortune as well as his own he knows that if i am not very quick or brilliant i am fairly steady and reliable so thats what ive been working up to all along bertie that tomorrow i go to join cullingworth and that it looks as if there was to be an opening for me at last i gave you a sketch of him and his ways so that you may take an interest in the development of my fortune which you could not do if you did not know something of the man who is holding out his hand to me yesterday was my birthday and i was two and twenty years of age for two and twenty years have i swung around the sun and in all seriousness without a touch of levity and from the bottom of my soul i assure you that i have at the present moment the very vaguest idea as to whence i have come from whither i am going or what i am here for it is not for want of inquiry or from indifference i have mastered the principles of several religions they have all shocked me by the violence which i should have to do to my reason to accept the dogmas of any one of them their ethics are usually excellent so are the ethics of the common law of england but the scheme of creation upon which those ethics are built well it really is to me the most astonishing thing that i have seen in my short earthly pilgrimage that so many able men deep philosophers astute lawyers and clearheaded men of the world should accept such an explanation of the facts of life in the face of their apparent concurrence my own poor little opinion would not dare to do more than lurk at the back of my soul were it not that i take courage when i reflect that the equally eminent lawyers and philosophers of rome and greece were all agreed that jupiter had numerous wives and was fond of a glass of good wine mind my dear bertie i do not wish to run down your view or that of any other man we who claim toleration should be the first to extend it to others i am only indicating my own position as i have often done before and i know your reply so well cant i hear your grave voice saying have faith your conscience allows you to well mine wont allow me i see so clearly that faith is not a virtue but a vice it is a goat which has been herded with the sheep if a man deliberately shut his physical eyes and refused to use them you would be as quick as any one in seeing that it was immoral and a treason to nature and yet you would counsel a man to shut that far more precious gift the reason and to refuse to use it in the most intimate question of life the reason cannot help in such a matter you reply i answer that to say so is to give up a battle before it is fought my reason shall help me and when it can help no longer i shall do without help its late bertie and the fires out and im shivering and you im very sure are heartily weary of my gossip and my heresies so adieu until my next ii home th april well my dear bertie here i am again in your postbox its not a fortnight since i wrote you that great long letter and yet you see i have news enough to make another formidable budget they say that the art of letterwriting has been lost but if quantity may atone for quality you must confess that for your sins you have a friend who has retained it when i wrote to you last i was on the eve of going down to join the cullingworths at avonmouth with every hope that he had found some opening for me i must tell you at some length the particulars of that expedition i travelled down part of the way with young leslie duncan whom i think you know he was gracious enough to consider that a thirdclass carriage and my company were to be preferred to a first class with solitude you know that he came into his uncles money a little time ago and after a first delirious outbreak he has now relapsed into that dead heavy state of despair which is caused by having everything which one can wish for how absurd are the ambitions of life when i think that i who am fairly happy and as keen as a razor edge should be struggling for that which i can see has brought neither profit nor happiness to him and yet if i can read my own nature it is not the accumulation of money which is my real aim but only that i may acquire so much as will relieve my mind of sordid cares and enable me to develop any gifts which i may have undisturbed my tastes are so simple that i cannot imagine any advantage which wealth can give save indeed the exquisite pleasure of helping a good man or a good cause why should people ever take credit for charity when they must know that they cannot gain as much pleasure out of their guineas in any other fashion i gave my watch to a broken schoolmaster the other day having no change in my pocket and the mater could not quite determine whether it was a trait of madness or of nobility i could have told her with absolute confidence that it was neither the one nor the other but a sort of epicurean selfishness with perhaps a little dash of swagger away down at the bottom of it what had i ever had from my chronometer like the quiet thrill of satisfaction when the fellow brought me the pawn ticket and told me that the thirty shillings had been useful leslie duncan got out at carstairs and i was left alone with a hale whitehaired old roman catholic priest who had sat quietly reading his office in the corner we fell into the most intimate talk which lasted all the way to avonmouth indeed so interested was i that i very nearly passed through the place without knowing it father logan for that was his name seemed to me to be a beautiful type of what a priest should be selfsacrificing and pureminded with a kind of simple cunning about him and a deal of innocent fun he had the defects as well as the virtues of his class for he was absolutely reactionary in his views we discussed religion with fervour and his theology was somewhere about the early pliocene he might have chattered the matter over with a priest of charlemagnes court and they would have shaken hands after every sentence he would acknowledge this and claim it as a merit it was consistency in his eyes if our astronomers and inventors and lawgivers had been equally consistent where would modern civilisation be is religion the only domain of thought which is nonprogressive and to be referred for ever to a standard set two thousand years ago can they not see that as the human brain evolves it must take a wider outlook a halfformed brain makes a halfformed god and who shall say that our brains are even halfformed yet the truly inspired priest is the man or woman with the big brain it is not the shaven patch on the outside but it is the sixty ounces within which is the real mark of election you know that you are turning up your nose at me bertie i can see you do it but ill come off the thin ice and you shall have nothing but facts now im afraid that i should never do for a storyteller for the first stray character that comes along puts his arm in mine and walks me off with my poor story straggling away to nothing behind me well then it was night when we reached avonmouth and as i popped my head out of the carriage window the first thing that my eyes rested upon was old cullingworth standing in the circle of light under a gaslamp his frock coat was flying open his waistcoat unbuttoned at the top and his hat a top hat this time jammed on the back of his head with his bristling hair spurting out in front of it in every way save that he wore a collar he was the same cullingworth as ever he gave a roar of recognition when he saw me bustled me out of my carriage seized my carpet bag or gripsack as you used to call it and a minute later we were striding along together through the streets i was as you may imagine all in a tingle to know what it was that he wanted with me however as he made no allusion to it i did not care to ask and during our longish walk we talked about indifferent matters it was football first i remember whether richmond had a chance against blackheath and the way in which the new passing game was shredding the old scrimmages then he got on to inventions and became so excited that he had to give me back my bag in order that he might be able to slap all his points home with his fist upon his palm i can see him now stopping with his face leaning forward and his yellow tusks gleaming in the lamplight my dear munro this was the style of the thing why was armour abandoned eh what ill tell you why it was because the weight of metal that would protect a man who was standing up was more than he could carry but battles are not fought nowadays by men who are standing up your infantry are all lying on their stomachs and it would take very little to protect them and steel has improved munro chilled steel bessemer bessemer very good how much to cover a man fourteen inches by twelve meeting at an angle so that the bullet will glance a notch at one side for the rifle there you have it laddie the cullingworth patent portable bulletproof shield weight oh the weight would be sixteen pounds i worked it out each company carries its shields in gocarts and they are served out on going into action give me twenty thousand good shots and ill go in at calais and come out at pekin think of it my boy the moral effect one side gets home every time and the other plasters its bullets up against steel plates no troops would stand it the nation that gets it first will pitchfork the rest of europe over the edge theyre bound to have it all of them lets reckon it out theres about eight million of them on a war footing let us suppose that only half of them have it i say only half because i dont want to be too sanguine thats four million and i should take a royalty of four shillings on wholesale orders whats that munro about threequarters of a million sterling eh hows that laddie eh what really that is not unlike his style of talk now that i come to read it over only you miss the queer stops the sudden confidential whispers the roar with which he triumphantly answered his own questions the shrugs and slaps and gesticulations but not a word all the time as to what it was that made him send me that urgent wire which brought me to avonmouth i had of course been puzzling in my mind as to whether he had succeeded or not though from his cheerful appearance and buoyant talk it was tolerably clear to me that all was well with him i was however surprised when as we walked along a quiet curving avenue with great houses standing in their own grounds upon either side he stopped and turned in through the iron gate which led up to one of the finest of them the moon had broken out and shone upon the highpeaked roof and upon the gables at each corner when he knocked it was opened by a footman with red plush kneebreeches i began to perceive that my friends success must have been something colossal when we came down to the diningroom for supper mrs cullingworth was waiting there to greet me i was sorry to see that she was pale and wearylooking however we had a merry meal in the old style and her husbands animation reflected itself upon her face until at last we might have been back in the little room where the medical journals served as a chair instead of in the great oakfurnished picturehung chamber to which we had been promoted all the time however not one word as to the object of my journey when the supper was finished cullingworth led the way into a small sittingroom where we both lit our pipes and mrs cullingworth her cigarette he sat for some little time in silence and then bounding up rushed to the door and flung it open it is always one of his strange peculiarities to think that people are eavesdropping or conspiring against him for in spite of his superficial brusqueness and frankness a strange vein of suspicion runs through his singular and complex nature having satisfied himself now that there were no spies or listeners he threw himself down into his armchair munro said he prodding at me with his pipe what i wanted to tell you is that i am utterly hopelessly and irretrievably ruined my chair was tilted on its back legs as he spoke and i assure you that i was within an ace of going over down like a pack of cards came all my dreams as to the grand results which were to spring from my journey to avonmouth yes bertie i am bound to confess it my first thought was of my own disappointment and my second of the misfortune of my friends he had the most diabolical intuitions or i a very telltale face for he added at once sorry to disappoint you my boy thats not what you expected to hear i can see well i stammered it is rather a surprise old chap i thought from the from the from the house and the footman and the furniture said he well theyve eaten me up among them licked me clean bones and gravy im done for my boy unless here i saw a question in his eyes unless some friend were to lend me his name on a bit of stamped paper i cant do it cullingworth said i its a wretched thing to have to refuse a friend and if i had money wait till youre asked munro he interrupted with his ugliest of expressions besides as you have nothing and no prospects what earthly use would your name on a paper be thats what i want to know said i feeling a little mortified none the less look here laddie he went on dyou see that pile of letters on the left of the table yes those are duns and dyou see those documents on the right well those are county court summonses and now dyou see that he picked up a little ledger and showed me three or four names scribbled on the first page thats the practice he roared and laughed until the great veins jumped out on his forehead his wife laughed heartily also just as she would have wept had he been so disposed its this way munro said he when he had got over his paroxysm you have probably heard in fact i have told you myself that my father had the finest practice in scotland as far as i could judge he was a man of no capacity but still there you are he had it i nodded and smoked well hes been dead seven years and fifty nets dipping into his little fishpond however when i passed i thought my best move was to come down to the old place and see whether i couldnt piece the thing together again the name ought to be worth something i thought but it was no use doing the thing in a half hearted way not a bit of use in that munro the kind of people who came to him were wealthy and must see a fine house and a man in livery what chance was there of gathering them into a bowwindowed forty pound ayear house with a grubbyfaced maid at the door what do you suppose i did my boy i took the governors old house that was unlet the very house that he kept up at five thousand a year off i started in rare style and sank my last cent in furniture but its no use laddie i cant hold on any longer i got two accidents and an epileptic twentytwo pounds eight and sixpence thats the lot what will you do then thats what i wanted your advice about thats why i wired for you i always respected your opinion my boy and i thought that now was the time to have it it struck me that if he had asked for it nine months before there would have been more sense in it what on earth could i do when affairs were in such a tangle however i could not help feeling complimented when so independent a fellow as cullingworth turned to me in this way you really think said i that it is no use holding on here he jumped up and began pacing the room in his swift jerky way you take warning from it munro said he youve got to start yet take my tip and go where no one knows you people will trust a stranger quick enough but if they can remember you as a little chap who ran about in knickerbockers and got spanked with a hair brush for stealing plums they are not going to put their lives in your keeping its all very well to talk about friendship and family connections but when a man has a pain in the stomach he doesnt care a toss about all that id stick it up in gold letters in every medical classroom have it carved across the gate of the university that if a man wants friends be must go among strangers its all up here munro so theres no use in advising me to hold on i asked him how much he owed it came to about seven hundred pounds the rent alone was two hundred he had already raised money on the furniture and his whole assets came to less than a tenner of course there was only one possible thing that i could advise you must call your creditors together said i they can see for themselves that you are young and energetic sure to succeed sooner or later if they push you into a corner now they can get nothing make that clear to them but if you make a fresh start elsewhere and succeed you may pay them all in full i see no other possible way out of it i knew that youd say that and its just what i thought myself isnt it hetty well then that settles it and i am much obliged to you for your advice and thats all well say about the matter tonight ive made my shot and missed next time i shall hit and it wont be long either his failure did not seem to weigh very heavily on his mind for in a few minutes he was shouting away as lustily as ever whiskey and hot water were brought in that we might all drink luck to the second venture and this whiskey led us to what might have been a troublesome affair cullingworth who had drunk off a couple of glasses waited until his wife had left the room and then began to talk of the difficulty of getting any exercise now that he had to wait in all day in the hope of patients this led us round to the ways in which a man might take his exercise indoors and that to boxing cullingworth took a couple of pairs of gloves out of a cupboard and proposed that we should fight a round or two then and there if i hadnt been a fool bertie i should never have consented its one of my many weaknesses that whether its a woman or a man anything like a challenge sets me off but i knew cullingworths ways and i told you in my last what a lamb of a temper he has none the less we pushed back the table put the lamp on a high bracket and stood up to one another the moment i looked him in the face i smelled mischief he had a gleam of settled malice in his eye i believe it was my refusal to back his paper which was running in his head anyway he looked as dangerous as he could look with his scowling face sunk forward a little his hands down near his hips for his boxing like everything else about him is unconventional and his jaw set like a rattrap i led off and then in he came hitting with both hands and grunting like a pig at every blow from what i could see of him he was no boxer at all but just a formidable rough and tumble fighter i was guarding with both hands for half a minute and then was rushed clean off my legs and banged up against the door with my head nearly through one of the panels he wouldnt stop then though he saw that i had no space to get my elbows back and he let fly a righthander which would have put me into the hall if i hadnt slipped it and got back to the middle of the room look here cullingworth said i theres not much boxing about this game yes i hit pretty hard dont i if you come boring into me like that im bound to hit you out again i said i want to play light if youll let me the words were not out of my mouth before he was on me like a flash i slipped him again but the room was so small and he as active as a cat that there was no getting away from him he was on me once more with a regular football rush that knocked me off my balance before i knew where i was he got his left on the mark and his right on my ear i tripped over a footstool and then before i could get my balance he had me on the same ear again and my head was singing like a teakettle he was as pleased as possible with himself blowing out his chest and slapping it with his palms as he took his place in the middle of the room say when youve had enough munro said he this was pretty stiff considering that i had two inches the better of him in height and as many stone in weight besides being the better boxer his energy and the size of the room had been against me so far but he wasnt to have all the slogging to himself in the next round if i could help it in he came with one of his windmill rushes but i was on the lookout for him this time i landed him with my left a regular noseender as he came and then ducking under his left i got him a crosscounter on the jaw that laid him flat across his own hearthrug he was up in an instant with a face like a madman you swine he shouted take those gloves off and put your hands up he was tugging at his own to get them off go on you silly ass said i what is there to fight about he was mad with passion and chucked his gloves down under the table by god munro he cried if you dont take those gloves off ill go for you whether you have them on or not have a glass of soda water said i he made a crack at me youre afraid of me munro thats whats the matter with you he snarled this was getting too hot bertie i saw all the folly of the thing i believed that i might whip him but at the same time i knew that we were so much of a match that we would both get pretty badly cut up without any possible object to serve for all that i took my gloves off and i think perhaps it was the wisest course after all if cullingworth once thought he had the whiphand of you you might be sorry for it afterwards but as fate would have it our little barney was nipped in the bud mrs cullingworth came into the room at that instant and screamed out when she saw her husband his nose was bleeding and his chin was all slobbered with blood so that i dont wonder that it gave her a turn james she screamed and then to me what is the meaning of this mr munro you should have seen the hatred in her doves eyes i felt an insane impulse to pick her up and kiss her weve only been having a little spar mrs cullingworth said i your husband was complaining that he never got any exercise its all right hetty said he pulling his coat on again dont be a little stupid are the servants gone to bed well you might bring some water in a basin from the kitchen sit down munro and light your pipe again i have a hundred things that i want to talk to you about so that was the end of it and all went smoothly for the rest of the evening but for all that the little wife will always look upon me as a brute and a bully while as to cullingworthwell its rather difficult to say what cullingworth thinks about the matter when i woke next morning he was in my room and a funnylooking object he was his dressinggown lay on a chair and he was putting up a fiftysix pound dumb bell without a rag to cover him nature didnt give him a very symmetrical face nor the sweetest of expressions but he has a figure like a greek statue i was amused to see that both his eyes had a touch of shadow to them it was his turn to grin when i sat up and found that my ear was about the shape and consistence of a toadstool however he was all for peace that morning and chatted away in the most amiable manner possible i was to go back to my fathers that day but i had a couple of hours with cullingworth in his consulting room before i left he was in his best form and full of a hundred fantastic schemes by which i was to help him his great object was to get his name into the newspapers that was the basis of all success according to his views it seemed to me that he was confounding cause with effect but i did not argue the point i laughed until my sides ached over the grotesque suggestions which poured from him i was to lie senseless in the roadway and to be carried into him by a sympathising crowd while the footman ran with a paragraph to the newspapers but there was the likelihood that the crowd might carry me in to the rival practitioner opposite in various disguises i was to feign fits at his very door and so furnish fresh copy for the local press then i was to die absolutely to expire and all scotland was to resound with how dr cullingworth of avonmouth had resuscitated me his ingenious brain rang a thousand changes out of the idea and his own impending bankruptcy was crowded right out of his thoughts by the flood of halfserious devices but the thing that took the fun out of him and made him gnash his teeth and stride cursing about the room was to see a patient walking up the steps which led to the door of scarsdale his opposite neighbour scarsdale had a fairly busy practice and received his people at home from ten to twelve so that i got quite used to seeing cullingworth fly out of his chair and rush raving to the window he would diagnose the cases too and estimate their money value until he was hardly articulate there you are he would suddenly yell see that man with a limp every morning he goes displaced semilunar cartilage and a three months job the mans worth thirtyfive shillings a week and there im hanged if the woman with the rheumatic arthritis isnt round in her bathchair again shes all sealskin and lactic acid its simply sickening to see how they crowd to that man and such a man you havent seen him all the better for you i dont know what the devil you are laughing at munro i cant see where the fun comes in myself well it was a short experience that visit to avonmouth but i think that i shall remember it all my life goodness knows you must be sick enough of the subject but when i started with so much detail i was tempted to go it ended by my going back again in the afternoon cullingworth assuring me that he would call his creditors together as i had advised and that he would let me know the result in a few days mrs c would hardly shake hands with me when i said goodbye but i like her the better for that he must have a great deal of good in him or he could not have won her love and confidence so completely perhaps there is another cullingworth behind the scenes a softer tenderer man who can love and invite love if there is i have never got near him and yet i may only have been tapping at the shell who knows for that matter it is likely enough that he has never got at the real johnnie munro but you have bertie and i think that youve had a little too much of him this time only you encourage me to this sort of excess by your sympathetic replies well ive done as much as the general post office will carry for fivepence so ill conclude by merely remarking that a fortnight has passed and that i have had no news from avonmouth which does not in the very slightest degree surprise me if i ever do hear anything which is exceedingly doubtful you may be sure that i will put a finish to this long story iii home th october without any figure of speech i feel quite ashamed when i think of you bertie i send you one or two enormously long letters burdened as far as i can remember them with all sorts of useless detail then in spite of your kindly answers and your sympathy which i have done so little to deserve i drop you completely for more than six months by this j pen i swear that it shall not happen again and this letter may serve to bridge the gap and to bring you up to date in my poor affairs in which of all outer mankind you alone take an interest to commence with what is of most moment you may rest assured that what you said in your last letter about religion has had my most earnest attention i am sorry that i have not got it by me to refer to i lent it to charlie but i think i have the contents in my head it is notorious as you say that an unbeliever may be as bigoted as any of the orthodox and that a man may be very dogmatic in his opposition to dogma such men are the real enemies of free thought if anything could persuade me to turn traitor to my reason it would for example be the blasphemous and foolish pictures displayed in some of the agnostic journals but every movement has its crowd of camp followers who straggle and scatter we are like a comet bright at the head but tailing away into mere gas behind however every man may speak for himself and i do not feel that your charge comes home to me i am only bigoted against bigotry and that i hold to be as legitimate as violence to the violent when one considers what effect the perversion of the religious instinct has had during the history of the world the bitter wars christian and mahomedan catholic and protestant the persecutions the torturings the domestic hatreds the petty spites with all creeds equally bloodguilty one cannot but be amazed that the concurrent voice of mankind has not placed bigotry at the very head of the deadly sins it is surely a truism to say that neither smallpox nor the plague have brought the same misery upon mankind i cannot be bigoted my dear boy when i say from the bottom of my heart that i respect every good catholic and every good protestant and that i recognise that each of these forms of faith has been a powerful instrument in the hands of that inscrutable providence which rules all things just as in the course of history one finds that the most farreaching and admirable effects may proceed from a crime so in religion although a creed be founded upon an entirely inadequate conception of the creator and his ways it may none the less be the very best practical thing for the people and age which have adopted it but if it is right for those to whom it is intellectually satisfying to adopt it it is equally so for those to whom it is not to protest against it until by this process the whole mass of mankind gets gradually leavened and pushed a little further upon their slow upward journey catholicism is the more thorough protestantism is the more reasonable protestantism adapts itself to modern civilisation catholicism expects civilisation to adapt itself to it folk climb from the one big branch to the other big branch and think they have made a prodigious change when the main trunk is rotten beneath them and both must in their present forms be involved sooner or later in a common ruin the movement of human thought though slow is still in the direction of truth and the various religions which man sheds as he advances each admirable in its day will serve like buoys dropped down from a sailing vessel to give the rate and direction of his progress but how do i know what is truth you ask i dont but i know particularly well what isnt and surely that is something to have gained it isnt true that the great central mind that planned all things is capable of jealousy or of revenge or of cruelty or of injustice these are human attributes and the book which ascribes them to the infinite must be human also it isnt true that the laws of nature have been capriciously disturbed that snakes have talked that women have been turned to salt that rods have brought water out of rocks you must in honesty confess that if these things were presented to us when we were adults for the first time we should smile at them it isnt true that the fountain of all common sense should punish a race for a venial offence committed by a person long since dead and then should add to the crass injustice by heaping the whole retribution upon a single innocent scapegoat can you not see all the want of justice and logic to say nothing of the want of mercy involved in such a conception can you not see it bertie how can you blind yourself to it take your eyes away from the details for a moment and look at this root idea of the predominant faith is the general conception of it consistent with infinite wisdom and mercy if not what becomes of the dogmas the sacraments the whole scheme which is founded upon this sandbank courage my friend at the right moment all will be laid aside as the man whose strength increases lays down the crutch which has been a good friend to him in his weakness but his changes wont be over then his hobble will become a walk and his walk a run there is no finality can be none since the question concerns the infinite all this which appears too advanced to you today will seem reactionary and conservative a thousand years hence since i am upon this topic may i say just a little more without boring you you say that criticism such as mine is merely destructive and that i have nothing to offer in place of what i pull down this is not quite correct i think that there are certain elemental truths within our grasp which ask for no faith for their acceptance and which are sufficient to furnish us with a practical religion having so much of reason in it that it would draw thinking men into its fold not drive them forth from it when we all get back to these elemental and provable facts there will be some hopes of ending the petty bickerings of creeds and of including the whole human family in one comprehensive system of thought when first i came out of the faith in which i had been reared i certainly did feel for a time as if my lifebelt had burst i wont exaggerate and say that i was miserable and plunged in utter spiritual darkness youth is too full of action for that but i was conscious of a vague unrest of a constant want of repose of an emptiness and hardness which i had not noticed in life before i had so identified religion with the bible that i could not conceive them apart when the foundation proved false the whole structure came rattling about my ears and then good old carlyle came to the rescue and partly from him and partly from my own broodings i made a little hut of my own which has kept me snug ever since and has even served to shelter a friend or two besides the first and main thing was to get it thoroughly soaked into one that the existence of a creator and an indication of his attributes does in no way depend upon jewish poets nor upon human paper or printing ink on the contrary all such efforts to realise him must only belittle him bringing the infinite down to the narrow terms of human thought at a time when that thought was in the main less spiritual than it is at present even the most material of modern minds would flinch at depicting the deity as ordering wholesale executions and hacking kings to pieces upon the horns of altars then having prepared your mind for a higher if perhaps a vaguer idea of the deity proceed to study him in his works which cannot be counterfeited or manipulated nature is the true revelation of the deity to man the nearest green field is the inspired page from which you may read all that it is needful for you to know i confess that i have never been able to understand the position of the atheist in fact i have come to disbelieve in his existence and to look upon the word as a mere term of theological reproach it may represent a temporary condition a passing mental phase a defiant reaction against an anthropomorphic ideal but i cannot conceive that any man can continue to survey nature and to deny that there are laws at work which display intelligence and power the very existence of a world carries with it the proof of a worldmaker as the table guarantees the preexistence of the carpenter granting this one may form what conception one will of that maker but one cannot be an atheist wisdom and power and means directed to an end run all through the scheme of nature what proof do we want then from a book if the man who observes the myriad stars and considers that they and their innumerable satellites move in their serene dignity through the heavens each swinging clear of the others orbit if i say the man who sees this cannot realise the creators attributes without the help of the book of job then his view of things is beyond my understanding nor is it only in the large things that we see the ever present solicitude of some intelligent force nothing is too tiny for that fostering care we see the minute proboscis of the insect carefully adjusted to fit into the calyx of the flower the most microscopic hair and gland each with its definite purposeful function to perform what matter whether these came by special creation or by evolution we know as a matter of fact that they came by evolution but that only defines the law it does not explain it but if this power has cared for the bee so as to furnish it with its honey bag and its collecting forceps and for the lowly seed so as to have a thousand devices by which it reaches a congenial soil then is it conceivable that we the highest product of all are overlooked it is not conceivable the idea is inconsistent with the scheme of creation as we see it i say again that no faith is needed to attain the certainty of a most watchful providence and with this certainty surely we have all that is necessary for an elemental religion come what may after death our duties lie clearly defined before us in this life and the ethical standard of all creeds agrees so far that there is not likely to be any difference of opinion as to that the last reformation simplified catholicism the coming one will simplify protestantism and when the world is ripe for it another will come and simplify that the ever improving brain will give us an ever broadening creed is it not glorious to think that evolution is still living and acting that if we have an anthropoid ape as an ancestor we may have archangels for our posterity well i really never intended to inflict all this upon you bertie i thought i could have made my position clear in a page or so but you can see how one point has brought up another even now i am leaving so much unsaid i can see with such certainty exactly what you will say if you deduce a good providence from the good things in nature what do you make of the evil thats what you will say suffice it that i am inclined to deny the existence of evil not another word will i say upon the subject but if you come back to it yourself then be it on your own head you remember that when i wrote last i had just returned from visiting the cullingworths at avonmouth and that he had promised to let me know what steps he took in appeasing his creditors as i expected i have not had one word from him since but in a roundabout way i did get some news as to what happened from this account which was secondhand and may have been exaggerated cullingworth did exactly what i had recommended and calling all his creditors together he made them a long statement as to his position the good people were so touched by the picture that he drew of a worthy man fighting against adversity that several of them wept and there was not only complete unanimity as to letting their bills stand over but even some talk of a collection then and there to help cullingworth on his way he has i understand left avonmouth but no one has any idea what has become of him it is generally supposed that he has gone to england he is a strange fellow but i wish him luck wherever he goes when i came back i settled down once more to the routine of my fathers practice holding on there until something may turn up and for six months i have had to wait a weary six months they have been you see i cannot ask my father for money or at least i cannot bring myself to take an unnecessary penny of his money for i know how hard a fight it is with him to keep the roof over our heads and pay for the modest little horse and trap which are as necessary to his trade as a goose is to a tailor foul fare the grasping taxman who wrings a couple of guineas from us on the plea that it is a luxury we can just hold on and i would not have him a pound the poorer for me but you can understand bertie that it is humiliating for a man of my age to have to go about without any money in my pocket it affects me in so many petty ways a poor man may do me a kindness and i have to seem mean in his eyes i may want a flower for a girl and must be content to appear ungallant i dont know why i should be ashamed of this since it is no fault of mine and i hope that i dont show it to any one else that i am ashamed of it but to you my dear bertie i dont mind confessing that it hurts my self respect terribly i have often wondered why some of those writing fellows dont try their hands at drawing the inner life of a young man from about the age of puberty until he begins to find his feet a little men are very fond of analysing the feelings of their heroines which they cannot possibly know anything about while they have little to say of the inner development of their heroes which is an experience which they have themselves undergone i should like to try it myself but it would need blending with fiction and i never had a spark of imagination but i have a vivid recollection of what i went through myself at the time i thought as everybody thinks that it was a unique experience but since i have heard the confidences of my fathers patients i am convinced that it is the common lot the shrinking horrible shyness alternating with occasional absurd fits of audacity which represent the reaction against it the longing for close friendship the agonies over imaginary slights the extraordinary sexual doubts the deadly fears caused by nonexistent diseases the vague emotion produced by all women and the halffrightened thrill by particular ones the aggressiveness caused by fear of being afraid the sudden blacknesses the profound selfdistrust i dare bet that you have felt every one of them bertie just as i have and that the first lad of eighteen whom you see out of your window is suffering from them now this is all a digression however from the fact that i have been six months at home and am weary of it and pleased at the new development of which i shall have to tell you the practice here although unremunerative is very busy with its threeandsixpenny visits and guinea confinements so that both the governor and i have had plenty to do you know how i admire him and yet i fear there is little intellectual sympathy between us he appears to think that those opinions of mine upon religion and politics which come hot from my inmost soul have been assumed either out of indifference or bravado so i have ceased to talk on vital subjects with him and though we affect to ignore it we both know that there is a barrier there now with my mother ah but my mother must have a paragraph to herself you met her bertie you must remember her sweet face her sensitive mouth her peering shortsighted eyes her general suggestion of a plump little hen who is still on the alert about her chickens but you cannot realise all that she is to me in our domestic life those helpful fingers that sympathetic brain ever since i can remember her she has been the quaintest mixture of the housewife and the woman of letters with the highbred spirited lady as a basis for either character always a lady whether she was bargaining with the butcher or breaking in a skittish charwoman or stirring the porridge which i can see her doing with the porridgestick in one hand and the other holding her revue des deux mondes within two inches of her dear nose that was always her favourite reading and i can never think of her without the association of its browny yellow cover she is a very wellread woman is the mother she keeps up to date in french literature as well as in english and can talk by the hour about the goncourts and flaubert and gautier yet she is always hard at work and how she imbibes all her knowledge is a mystery she reads when she knits she reads when she scrubs she even reads when she feeds her babies we have a little joke against her that at an interesting passage she deposited a spoonful of rusk and milk into my little sisters carhole the child having turned her head at the critical instant her hands are worn with work and yet where is the idle woman who has read as much then there is her family pride that is a very vital portion of the mother you know how little i think of such things if the esquire were to be snipped once and for ever from the tail of my name i should be the lighter for it but ma foi to use her own favourite expletive it would not do to say this to her on the packenham side she is a packenham the family can boast of some fairly good men i mean on the direct line but when we get on the side branches there is not a monarch upon earth who does not roost on that huge family tree not once nor twice but thrice did the plantagenets intermarry with us the dukes of brittany courted our alliance and the percies of northumberland intertwined themselves with our whole illustrious record so in my boyhood she would expound the matter with hearthbrush in one hand and a glove full of cinders in the other while i would sit swinging my knickerbockered legs swelling with pride until my waistcoat was as tight as a sausage skin as i contemplated the gulf which separated me from all other little boys who swang their legs upon tables to this day if i chance to do anything of which she strongly approves the dear heart can say no more than that i am a thorough packenham while if i fall away from the straight path she says with a sigh that there are points in which i take after the munros she is broadminded and intensely practical in her ordinary moods though open to attacks of romance i can recollect her coming to see me at a junction through which my train passed with a six months absence on either side of the incident we had five minutes conversation my head out of the carriage window wear flannel next your skin my dear boy and never believe in eternal punishment was her last item of advice as we rolled out of the station then to finish her portrait i need not tell you who have seen her that she is younglooking and comely to be the mother of about thirtyfive feet of humanity she was in the railway carriage and i on the platform the other day your husband had better get in or well go without him said the guard as we went off the mother was fumbling furiously in her pocket and i know that she was looking for a shilling ah what a gossip i have been and all to lead up to the one sentence that i could not have stayed at home this six months if it had not been for the company and the sympathy of my mother well now i want to tell you about the scrape that i got myself into i suppose that i ought to pull a long face over it but for the life of me i cant help laughing i have you almost up to date in my history now for what i am going to tell you happened only last week i must mention no names here even to you for the curse of ernulphus which includes eight and forty minor imprecations be upon the head of the man who kisses and tells you must know then that within the boundaries of this city there are two ladies a mother and a daughter whom i shall call mrs and miss laura andrews they are patients of the governors and have become to some extent friends of the family madame is welsh charming in appearance dignified in her manners and high church in her convictions the daughter is rather taller than the mother but otherwise they are strikingly alike the mother is thirtysix and the daughter eighteen both are exceedingly charming had i to choose between them i think entre nous that the mother would have attracted me most for i am thoroughly of balzacs opinion as to the woman of thirty however fate was to will it otherwise it was the coming home from a dance which first brought laura and me together you know how easily and suddenly these things happen beginning in playful teasing and ending in something a little warmer than friendship you squeeze the slender arm which is passed through yours you venture to take the little gloved hand you say good night at absurd length in the shadow of the door it is innocent and very interesting love trying his wings in a first little flutter he will keep his sustained flight later on the better for the practice there was never any question of engagements between us nor any suggestion of harm she knew that i was a poor devil with neither means nor prospects and i knew that her mothers will was her law and that her course was already marked out for her however we exchanged our little confidences and met occasionally by appointment and tried to make our lives brighter without darkening those of any one else i can see you shake your head here and growl like the comfortable married man that you are that such relations are very dangerous so they are my boy but neither of us cared she out of innocence and i out of recklessness for from the beginning all the fault in the matter was mine well matters were in this state when one day last week a note came up to the dad saying that mrs andrews servant was ill and would he come at once the old man had a touch of gout so i donned my professional coat and sallied forth thinking that perhaps i might combine pleasure with business and have a few words with laura sure enough as i passed up the gravel drive which curves round to the door i glanced through the drawing room window and saw her sitting painting with her back to the light it was clear that she had not heard me the hall door was ajar and when i pushed it open no one was in the hall a sudden fit of roguishness came over me i pushed the drawingroom door very slowly wider crept in on tiptoe stole quietly across and bending down i kissed the artist upon the nape of her neck she turned round with a squeal and it was the mother i dont know whether you have ever been in a tighter corner than that bertie it was quite tight enough for me i remember that i smiled as i stole across the carpet on that insane venture i did not smile again that evening it makes me hot now when i think of it well i made the most dreadful fool of myself at first the good lady who as i think i told you is very dignified and rather reserved could not believe her senses then as the full force of my enormity came upon her she reared herself up until she seemed the tallest and the coldest woman i had ever seen it was an interview with a refrigerator she asked me what i had ever observed in her conduct which had encouraged me to subject her to such an outrage i saw of course that any excuses upon my part would put her on the right track and give poor laura away so i stood with my hair bristling and my top hat in my hand presenting i am sure a most extraordinary figure indeed she looked rather funny herself with her palette in one hand her brush in the other and the blank astonishment on her face i stammered out something about hoping that she did not mind which made her more angry than ever the only possible excuse for your conduct sir is that you are under the influence of drink said she i need not say that we do not require the services of a medical man in that condition i did not try to disabuse her of the idea for really i could see no better explanation so i beat a retreat in a very demoralised condition she wrote a letter to my father about it in the evening and the old man was very angry indeed as to the mother she is as staunch as steel and quite prepared to prove that poor mrs a was a very deep designing person who had laid a trap for innocent johnnie so there has been a grand row and not a soul upon earth has the least idea of what it all means except only yourself as you read this letter you can imagine that this has not contributed to make life here more pleasant for my father cannot bring himself to forgive me of course i dont wonder at his anger i should be just the same myself it does look like a shocking breach of professional honour and a sad disregard of his interests if he knew the truth he would see that it was nothing worse than a silly ill timed boyish joke however he never shall know the truth and now there is some chance of my getting something to do we had a letter tonight from christie howden the writers to the signet saying that they desire an interview with me in view of a possible appointment we cant imagine what it means but i am full of hopes i go tomorrow morning to see them and i shall let you know the result goodbye my dear bertie your life flows in a steady stream and mine in a broken torrent yet i would have every detail of what happens to you iv home st december i may be doing you an injustice bertie but it seemed to me in your last that there were indications that the free expression of my religious views had been distasteful to you that you should disagree with me i am prepared for but that you should object to free and honest discussion of those subjects which above all others men should be honest over would i confess be a disappointment the freethinker is placed at this disadvantage in ordinary society that whereas it would be considered very bad taste upon his part to obtrude his unorthodox opinion no such consideration hampers those with whom he disagrees there was a time when it took a brave man to be a christian now it takes a brave man not to be but if we are to wear a gag and hide our thoughts when writing in confidence to our most intimateno but i wont believe it you and i have put up too many thoughts together and chased them whereeversic they would double bertie so just write to me like a good fellow and tell me that i am an ass until i have that comforting assurance i shall place a quarantine upon everything which could conceivably be offensive to you does not lunacy strike you bertie as being a very eerie thing it is a disease of the soul to think that you may have a man of noble mind full of every lofty aspiration and that a gross physical cause such as the fall of a spicule of bone from the inner table of his skull on to the surface of the membrane which covers his brain may have the ultimate effect of turning him into an obscene creature with every bestial attribute that a mans individuality should swing round from pole to pole and yet that one life should contain these two contradictory personalities is it not a wondrous thing i ask myself where is the man the very very inmost essence of the man see how much you may subtract from him without touching it it does not lie in the limbs which serve him as tools nor in the apparatus by which he is to digest nor in that by which he is to inhale oxygen all these are mere accessories the slaves of the lord within where then is he he does not lie in the features which are to express his emotions nor in the eyes and ears which can be dispensed with by the blind and deaf nor is he in the bony framework which is the rack over which nature hangs her veil of flesh in none of these things lies the essence of the man and now what is left an arched whitish puttylike mass some fifty odd ounces in weight with a number of white filaments hanging down from it looking not unlike the medusae which float in our summer seas but these filaments only serve to conduct nerve force to muscles and to organs which serve secondary purposes they may themselves therefore be disregarded nor can we stop here in our elimination this central mass of nervous matter may be pared down on all sides before we seem to get at the very seat of the soul suicides have shot away the front lobes of the brain and have lived to repent it surgeons have cut down upon it and have removed sections much of it is merely for the purpose of furnishing the springs of motion and much for the reception of impressions all this may be put aside as we search for the physical seat of what we call the soul the spiritual part of the man and what is left then a little blob of matter a handful of nervous dough a few ounces of tissue but there somewhere there lurks that impalpable seed to which the rest of our frame is but the pod the old philosophers who put the soul in the pineal gland were not right but after all they were uncommonly near the mark youll find my physiology even worse than my theology bertie i have a way of telling stories backwards to you which is natural enough when you consider that i always sit down to write under the influence of the last impressions which have come upon me all this talk about the soul and the brain arises simply from the fact that i have been spending the last few weeks with a lunatic and how it came about i will tell you as clearly as i can you remember that in my last i explained to you how restive i had been getting at home and how my idiotic mistake had annoyed my father and had made my position here very uncomfortable then i mentioned i think that i had received a letter from christie howden the lawyers well i brushed up my sunday hat and my mother stood on a chair and landed me twice on the ear with a clothes brush under the impression that she was making the collar of my overcoat look more presentable with which accolade out i sallied into the world the dear soul standing on the steps peering after me and waving me success well i was in considerable trepidation when i reached the office for i am a much more nervous person than any of my friends will ever credit me with being however i was shown in at once to mr james christie a wiry sharp thinlipped kind of man with an abrupt manner and that sort of scotch precision of speech which gives the impression of clearness of thought behind it i understand from professor maxwell that you have been looking about for an opening mr munro said he maxwell had said that he would give me a hand if he could but you remember that he had a reputation for giving such promises rather easily i speak of a man as i find him and to me he has been an excellent friend i should be very happy to hear of any opening said i of your medical qualifications there is no need to speak he went on running his eyes all over me in the most questioning way your bachelorship of medicine will answer for that but professor maxwell thought you peculiarly fitted for this vacancy for physical reasons may i ask you what your weight is fourteen stone and you stand i should judge about six feet high precisely accustomed too as i gather to muscular exercise of every kind well there can be no question that you are the very man for the post and i shall be very happy to recommend you to lord saltire you forget said i that i have not yet heard what the position is or the terms which you offer he began to laugh at that it was a little precipitate on my part said he but i do not think that we are likely to quarrel as to position or terms you may have heard perhaps of the sad misfortune of our client lord saltire not to put it briefly then his son the hon james derwent the heir to the estates and the only child was struck down by the sun while fishing without his hat last july his mind has never recovered from the shock and he has been ever since in a chronic state of moody sullenness which breaks out every now and then into violent mania his father will not allow him to be removed from lochtully castle and it is his desire that a medical man should stay there in constant attendance upon his son your physical strength would of course be very useful in restraining those violent attacks of which i have spoken the remuneration will be twelve pounds a month and you would be required to take over your duties tomorrow i walked home my dear bertie with a bounding heart and the pavement like cotton wool under my feet i found just eightpence in my pocket and i spent the whole of it on a really good cigar with which to celebrate the occasion old cullingworth has always had a very high opinion of lunatics for beginners get a lunatic my boy get a lunatic he used to say then it was not only the situation but the fine connection that it opened up i seemed to see exactly what would happen there would be illness in the family lord saltire himself perhaps or his wife there would be no time to send for advice i would be consulted i would gain their confidence and become their family attendant they would recommend me to their wealthy friends it was all as clear as possible i was debating before i reached home whether it would be worth my while to give up a lucrative country practice in order to take the professorship which might be offered me my father took the news philosophically enough with some rather sardonic remark about my patient and me being well qualified to keep each other company but to my mother it was a flash of joy followed by a thunderclap of consternation i had only three undershirts the best of my linen had gone to belfast to be refronted and recuffed the nightgowns were not marked yet there were a dozen of those domestic difficulties of which the mere male never thinks a dreadful vision of lady saltire looking over my things and finding the heel out of one of my socks obsessed my mother out we trudged together and before evening her soul was at rest and i had mortgaged in advance my first months salary she was great as we walked home upon the grand people into whose service i was to enter as a matter of fact my dear said she they are in a sense relations of yours you are very closely allied to the percies and the saltires have percy blood in them also they are only a cadet branch and you are close upon the main line but still it is not for us to deny the connection she brought a cold sweat out upon me by suggesting that she should make things easy by writing to lord saltire and explaining our respective positions several times during the evening i heard her murmur complacently that they were only the cadet branch am i not the slowest of storytellers but you encourage me to it by your sympathetic interest in details however i shall move along a little faster now next morning i was off to lochtully which as you know is in the north of perthshire it stands three miles from the station a great gray pinnacled house with two towers cocking out above the fir woods like a hares ears from a tussock of grass as we drove up to the door i felt pretty solemn not at all as the main line should do when it condescends to visit the cadet branch into the hall as i entered came a grave learned looking man with whom in my nervousness i was about to shake hands cordially fortunately he forestalled the impending embrace by explaining that he was the butler he showed me into a small study where everything stank of varnish and morocco leather there to await the great man he proved when he came to be a much less formidable figure than his retainer indeed i felt thoroughly at my ease with him from the moment he opened his mouth he is grizzled redfaced sharpfeatured with a prying and yet benevolent expression very human and just a trifle vulgar his wife however to whom i was afterwards introduced is a most depressing person pale cold hatchetfaced with drooping eyelids and very prominent blue veins at her temples she froze me up again just as i was budding out under the influence of her husband however the thing that interested me most of all was to see my patient to whose room i was taken by lord saltire after we had had a cup of tea the room was a large bare one at the end of a long corridor near the door was seated a footman placed there to fill up the gap between two doctors and looking considerably relieved at my advent over by the window which was furnished with a wooden guard like that of a nursery sat a tall yellowhaired yellowbearded young man who raised a pair of startled blue eyes as we entered he was turning over the pages of a bound copy of the illustrated london news james said lord saltire this is dr stark munro who has come to look after you my patient mumbled something in his beard which seemed to me suspiciously like damn dr stark munro the peer evidently thought the same for he led me aside by the elbow i dont know whether you have been told that james is a little rough in his ways at present said he his whole nature has deteriorated very much since this calamity came upon him you must not be offended by anything he may say or do not in the least said i there is a taint of this sort upon my wifes side i whispered the little lord her uncles symptoms were identical dr peterson says that the sunstroke was only the determining cause the predisposition was already there i may tell you that the footman will always be in the next room so that you can call him if you need his assistance well it ended by lord and lacquey moving off and leaving me with my patient i thought that i should lose no time in establishing a kindly relation with him so i drew a chair over to his sofa and began to ask him a few questions about his health and habits not a word could i get out of him in reply he sat as sullen as a mule with a kind of sneer about his handsome face which showed me very well that he had heard everything i tried this and tried that but not a syllable could i get from him so at last i turned from him and began to look over some illustrated papers on the table he doesnt read it seems and will do nothing but look at pictures well i was sitting like this with my back half turned when you can imagine my surprise to feel something plucking gently at me and to see a great brown hand trying to slip its way into my coat pocket i caught at the wrist and turned swiftly round but too late to prevent my handkerchief being whisked out and concealed behind the hon james derwent who sat grinning at me like a mischievous monkey come i may want that said i trying to treat the matter as a joke he used some language which was more scriptural than religious i saw that he did not mean giving it up but i was determined not to let him get the upper hand over me i grabbed for the handkerchief and he with a snarl caught my hand in both of his he had a powerful grip but i managed to get his wrist and to give it a wrench round until with a howl he dropped my property what fun said i pretending to laugh let us try again now you take it up and see if i can get it again but he had had enough of that game yet he appeared to be better humoured than before the incident and i got a few short answers to the questions which i put to him and here comes in the text which started me preaching about lunacy at the beginning of this letter what a marvellous thing it is this man from all i can learn of him has suddenly swung clean over from one extreme of character to the other every plus has in an instant become a minus hes another man but in the same case i am told that he used to be only a few months ago mind you most fastidious in dress and speech now he is a foultongued rough he had a nice taste in literature now he stares at you if you speak of shakespeare queerest of all he used to be a very highanddry tory in his opinions he is fond now of airing the most democratic views and in a needlessly offensive way when i did get on terms with him at last i found that there was nothing on which he could be drawn on to talk so soon as on politics in substance i am bound to say that i think his new views are probably saner than his old ones but the insanity lies in his sudden reasonless change and in his violent blurts of speech it was some weeks however before i gained his confidence so far as to be able to hold a real conversation with him for a long time he was very sullen and suspicious resenting the constant watch which i kept upon him this could not be relaxed for he was full of the most apish tricks one day he got hold of my tobacco pouch and stuffed two ounces of my tobacco into the long barrel of an eastern gun which hangs on the wall he jammed it all down with the ramrod and i was never able to get it up again another time he threw an earthenware spittoon through the window and would have sent the clock after it had i not prevented him every day i took him for a two hours constitutional save when it rained and then we walked religiously for the same space up and down the room heh but it was a deadly dreary kind of life i was supposed to have my eye upon him all day with a twohour interval every afternoon and an evening to myself upon fridays but then what was the use of an evening to myself when there was no town near and i had no friends whom i could visit i did a fair amount of reading for lord saltire let me have the run of his library gibbon gave me a couple of enchanting weeks you know the effect that he produces you seem to be serenely floating upon a cloud and looking down on all these pigmy armies and navies with a wise mentor ever at your side to whisper to you the inner meaning of all that majestic panorama now and again young derwent introduced some excitement into my dull life on one occasion when we were walking in the grounds he suddenly snatched up a spade from a grassplot and rushed at an inoffensive undergardener the man ran screaming for his life with my patient cursing at his very heels and me within a few paces of him when i at last laid my hand on his collar he threw down his weapon and burst into shrieks of laughter it was only mischief and not ferocity but when that undergardener saw us coming after that he was off with a face like a cream cheese at night the attendant slept in a campbed at the foot of the patients and my room was next door so that i could be called if necessary no it was not a very exhilarating life we used to go down to family meals when there were no visitors and there we made a curious quartette jimmy as he wished me to call him glum and silent i with the tail of my eye always twisted round to him lady saltire with her condescending eyelids and her blue veins and the goodnatured peer fussy and genial but always rather subdued in the presence of his wife she looked as if a glass of good wine would do her good and he as if he would be the better for abstinence and so in accordance with the usual lopsidedness of life he drank freely and she took nothing but limejuice and water you cannot imagine a more ignorant intolerant narrowminded woman than she if she had only been content to be silent and hidden that small brain of hers it would not have mattered but there was no end to her bitter and exasperating clacking what was she after all but a thin pipe for conveying disease from one generation to another she was bounded by insanity upon the north and upon the south i resolutely set myself to avoid all argument with her but she knew with her womans instinct that we were as far apart as the poles and took a pleasure in waving the red flag before me one day she was waxing eloquent as to the crime of a minister of an episcopal church performing any service in a presbyterian chapel some neighbouring minister had done it it seems and if he had been marked down in a pot house she could not have spoken with greater loathing i suppose that my eyes were less under control than my tongue for she suddenly turned upon me with i see that you dont agree with me dr munro i replied quietly that i did not and tried to change the conversation but she was not to be shaken off why not may i ask i explained that in my opinion the tendency of the age was to break down those ridiculous doctrinal points which are so useless and which have for so long set people by the ears i added that i hoped the time was soon coming when good men of all creeds would throw this lumber overboard and join hands together she half rose almost speechless with indignation i presume said she that you are one of those people who would separate the church from the state most certainly i answered she stood erect in a kind of cold fury and swept out of the room jimmy began to chuckle and his father looked perplexed i am sorry that my opinions are offensive to lady saltire i remarked yes yes its a pity a pity said he well well we must say what we think but its a pity you think it a very great pity i quite expected to get my dismissal over this business and indeed indirectly i may say that i did so from that day lady saltire was as rude to me as she could be and never lost an opportunity of making attacks upon what she imagined to be my opinions of these i never took the slightest notice but at last on an evil day she went for me pointblank so that there was no getting away from her it was just at the end of lunch when the footman had left the room she had been talking about lord saltires going up to london to vote upon some question in the house of lords perhaps dr munro said she turning acidly upon me that is also an institution which has not been fortunate enough to win your approval it is a question lady saltire which i should much prefer not to discuss i answered oh you might just as well have the courage of your convictions said she since you desire to despoil the national church it is natural enough that you should wish also to break up the constitution i have heard that an atheist is always a red republican lord saltire rose wishing i have no doubt to put an end to the conversation jimmy and i rose also and suddenly i saw that instead of moving towards the door he was going to his mother knowing his little tricks i passed my hand under his arm and tried to steer him away she noticed it however and interfered did you wish to speak to me james i want to whisper in your ear mother pray dont excite yourself sir said i again attempting to detain him lady saltire arched her aristocratic eyebrows i think dr munro that you push your authority rather far when you venture to interfere between a mother and her son said she what was it my poor dear boy jimmy bent down and whispered something in her ear the blood rushed into her pale face and she sprang from him as if he had struck her jimmy began to snigger this is your doing dr munro she cried furiously you have corrupted my sons mind and encouraged him to insult his mother my dear my dear said her husband soothingly and i quietly led the recalcitrant jimmy upstairs i asked him what it was that he had said to his mother but got only chuckles in reply i had a presentiment that i should hear more of the matter and i was not wrong lord saltire called me into his study in the evening the fact is doctor said he that lady saltire has been extremely annoyed and grieved about what occurred at lunch today of course you can imagine that such an expression coming from her own son shocked her more than i can tell i assure you lord saltire said i that i have no idea at all what passed between lady saltire and my patient well said he without going into details i may say that what he whispered was a blasphemous wish most coarsely expressed as to the future of that upper house to which i have the honor to belong i am very sorry said i and i assure you that i have never encouraged him in his extreme political views which seem to me to be symptoms of his disease i am quite convinced that what you say is true he answered but lady saltire is unhappily of the opinion that you have instilled these ideas into him you know that it is a little difficult sometimes to reason with a lady however i have no doubt that all may be smoothed over if you would see lady saltire and assure her that she has misunderstood your views upon this point and that you are personally a supporter of a hereditary chamber it put me in a tight corner bertie but my mind was instantly made up from the first word i had read my dismissal in every uneasy glance of his little eyes i am afraid said i that that is rather further than i am prepared to go i think that since there has been for some weeks a certain friction between lady saltire and myself it would perhaps be as well that i should resign the post which i hold in your household i shall be happy however to remain here until you have found some one to take over my duties well i am sorry it has come to this and yet it may be that you are right said he with an expression of relief as to james there need be no difficulty about that for dr patterson could come in tomorrow morning then tomorrow morning let it be i answered very good dr munro i will see that you have your cheque before you go so there was the end of all my fine dreams about aristocratic practices and wonderful introductions i believe the only person in the whole house who regretted me was jimmy who was quite downcast at the news his grief however did not prevent him from brushing my new tophat the wrong way on the morning that i left i did not notice it until i reached the station and a most undignified object i must have looked when i took my departure so ends the history of a failure i am as you know inclined to fatalism and do not believe that such a thing as chance exists so i am bound to think that this experience was given to me for some end it was a preliminary canter for the big race perhaps my mother was disappointed but tried to show it as little as possible my father was a little sardonic over the matter i fear that the gap between us widens by the way an extraordinary card arrived from cullingworth during my absence you are my man said he mind that i am to have you when i want you there was no date and no address but the postmark was bradfield in the north of england does it mean nothing or may it mean everything we must wait and see goodbye old man let me hear equally fully about your own affairs how did the rattray business go off v merton on the moors th march i was so delighted my dear chap to have your assurance that nothing that i have said or could say upon the subject of religion could offend you it is difficult to tell you how pleased and relieved i was at your cordial letter i have no one to whom i can talk upon such matters i am all driven inwards and thought turns sour when one lets it stagnate like that it is a grand thing to be able to tell it all to a sympathetic listener and the more so perhaps when he looks at it all from another standpoint it steadies and sobers one those whom i love best are those who have least sympathy with my struggles they talk about having faith as if it could be done by an act of volition they might as well tell me to have black hair instead of red i might simulate it perhaps by refusing to use my reason at all in religious matters but i will never be traitor to the highest thing that god has given me i will use it it is more moral to use it and go wrong than to forego it and be right it is only a little footrule and i have to measure mount everest with it but its all i have and ill never give it up while theres breath between my lips with all respect to you bertie it is very easy to be orthodox a man who wanted mental peace and material advancement in this world would certainly choose to be so as smiles says a dead fish can float with the stream but it takes a man to swim against it what could be more noble than the start and the starter of christianity how beautiful the upward struggle of an idea like some sweet flower blossoming out amongst rubble and cinders but alas to say that this idea was a final idea that this scheme of thought was above the reason that this gentle philosopher was that supreme intelligence to which we cannot even imagine a personality without irreverence all this will come to rank with the strangest delusions of mankind and then how clouded has become that fine daybreak of christianity its representatives have risen from the manger to the palace from the fishing smack to the house of lords nor is that other old potentate in the vatican with his art treasures his guards and his cellars of wine in a more logical position they are all good and talented men and in the market of brains are worth perhaps as much as they get but how can they bring themselves to pose as the representatives of a creed which as they themselves expound it is based upon humility poverty and selfdenial not one of them who would not quote with approval the parable of the wedding guest but try putting one of them out of their due precedence at the next court reception it happened some little time ago with a cardinal and england rang with his protests how blind not to see how they would spring at one leap into the real first place if they would but resolutely claim the last as the special badge of their master what can we know what are we all poor silly half brained things peering out at the infinite with the aspirations of angels and the instincts of beasts but surely all will be well with us if not then he who made us is evil which is not to be thought surely then all must go very well with us i feel ashamed when i read this over my mind fills in all the trains of thought of which you have the rude ends peeping out from this tangle make what you can of it dear bertie and believe that it all comes from my innermost heart above all may i be kept from becoming a partisan and tempering with truth in order to sustain a case let me but get a hand on her skirt and she may drag me where she will if she will but turn her face from time to time that i may know her youll see from the address of this letter bertie that i have left scotland and am in yorkshire i have been here three months and am now on the eve of leaving under the strangest circumstances and with the queerest prospects good old cullingworth has turned out a trump as i always knew he would but as usual i am beginning at the wrong end so here goes to give you an idea of what has been happening i told you in my last about my lunacy adventure and my ignominious return from lochtully castle when i had settled for the flannel vests which my mother had ordered so lavishly i had only five pounds left out of my pay with this as it was the first money that i had ever earned imsic my life i bought her a gold bangle so behold me reduced at once to my usual empty pocketed condition well it was something just to feel that i had earned money it gave me an assurance that i might again i had not been at home more than a few days when my father called me into the study after breakfast one morning and spoke very seriously as to our financial position he began the interview by unbuttoning his waistcoat and asking me to listen at his fifth intercostal space two inches from the left sternal line i did so and was shocked to hear a wellmarked mitral regurgitant murmur it is of old standing said he but of late i have had a puffiness about the ankles and some renal symptoms which show me that it is beginning to tell i tried to express my grief and sympathy but he cut me short with some asperity the point is said he that no insurance office would accept my life and that i have been unable owing to competition and increased expenses to lay anything by if i die soon which between ourselves is by no means improbable i must leave to your care your mother and the children my practice is so entirely a personal one that i cannot hope to be able to hand over to you enough to afford a living i thought of cullingworths advice about going where you are least known i think said i that my chances would be better away from here then you must lose no time in establishing yourself said he your position would be one of great responsibility if anything were to happen to me just now i had hoped that you had found an excellent opening with the saltires but i fear that you can hardly expect to get on in the world my boy if you insult your employers religious and political view at his own table it wasnt a time to argue so i said nothing my father took a copy of the lancet out of his desk and turned up an advertisement which he had marked with a blue pencil read this said he ive got it before me as i write it runs thus qualified assistant wanted at once in a large country and colliery practice thorough knowledge of obstetrics and dispensing indispensable ride and drive l a year apply dr horton merton on the moors yorkshire there might be an opening there said he i know horton and i am convinced that i can get you the appointment it would at least give you the opportunity of looking round and seeing whether there was any vacancy there how do you think it would suit you of course i could only answer that i was willing to turn my hand to anything but that interview has left a mark upon me a heavy everpresent gloom away at the back of my soul which i am conscious of even when the cause of it has for a moment gone out of my thoughts i had enough to make a man serious before when i had to face the world without money or interest but now to think of the mother and my sisters and little paul all leaning upon me when i cannot stand myself it is a nightmare could there be anything more dreadful in life than to have those whom you love looking to you for help and to be unable to give it but perhaps it wont come to that perhaps my father may hold his own for years come what may i am bound to think that all things are ordered for the best though when the good is a furlong off and we with our beetle eyes can only see three inches it takes some confidence in general principles to pull us through well it was all fixed up and down i came to yorkshire i wasnt in the best of spirits when i started bertie but they went down and down as i neared my destination how people can dwell in such places passes my comprehension what can life offer them to make up for these mutilations of the face of nature no woods little grass spouting chimneys slatecoloured streams sloping mounds of coke and slag topped by the great wheels and pumps of the mines cinderstrewn paths black as though stained by the weary miners who toil along them lead through the tarnished fields to the rows of smokestained cottages how can any young unmarried man accept such a lot while theres an empty hammock in the navy or a berth in a merchant forecastle how many shillings a week is the breath of the ocean worth it seems to me that if i were a poor man well upon my word that if is rather funny when i think that many of the dwellers in those smoky cottages have twice my salary with half my expenses well as i said my spirits sank lower and lower until they got down into the bulb when on looking through the gathering gloom i saw merton printed on the lamps of a dreary dismal station i got out and was standing beside my trunk and my hatbox waiting for a porter when up came a cheerylooking fellow and asked me whether i was dr stark munro im horton said he and shook hands cordially in that melancholy place the sight of him was like a fire on a frosty night he was gaily dressed in the first place check trousers white waistcoat a flower in his button hole but the look of the man was very much to my heart he was ruddy checked and black eyed with a jolly stout figure and an honest genial smile i felt as we clinched hands in the foggy grimy station that i had met a man and a friend his carriage was waiting and we drove out to his residence the myrtles where i was speedily introduced both to his family and his practice the former is small and the latter enormous the wife is dead but her mother mrs white keeps house for him and there are two dear little girls about five and seven then there is an unqualified assistant a young irish student who with the three maids the coachman and the stable boy make up the whole establishment when i tell you that we give four horses quite as much as they can do you will have an idea of the ground we cover the house a large square brick one standing in its own grounds is built on a small hill in an oasis of green fields beyond this however on every side the veil of smoke hangs over the country with the mine pumps and the chimneys bristling out of it it would be a dreadful place for an idle man but we are all so busy that we have hardly time to think whether theres a view or not day and night we are at work and yet the three months have been very pleasant ones to look back upon ill give you an idea of what a days work is like we breakfast about nine oclock and immediately afterwards the morning patients begin to drop in many of them are very poor people belonging to the colliery clubs the principle of which is that the members pay a little over a halfpenny a week all the year round well or ill in return for which they get medicine and attendance free not much of a catch for the doctors you would say but it is astonishing what competition there is among them to get the appointment you see it is a certainty for one thing and it leads indirectly to other little extras besides it amounts up surprisingly i have no doubt that horton has five or six hundred a year from his clubs alone on the other hand you can imagine that club patients since they pay the same in any case dont let their ailments go very far before they are round in the consulting room well then by halfpast nine we are in full blast horton is seeing the better patients in the consulting room i am interviewing the poorer ones in the waiting room and mccarthy the irishman making up prescriptions as hard as he can tear by the club rules patients are bound to find their own bottles and corks they generally remember the bottle but always forget the cork ye must pay a pinny or ilse put your forefinger in says mccarthy they have an idea that all the strength of the medicine goes if the bottle is open so they trot off with their fingers stuck in the necks they have the most singular notions about medicines its that strong that a spoon will stand oop int is one mans description above all they love to have two bottles one with a solution of citric acid and the other with carbonate of soda when the mixture begins to fizz they realise that there is indeed a science of medicine this sort of work with vaccinations bandagings and minor surgery takes us to nearly eleven oclock when we assemble in hortons room to make out the list all the names of patients under treatment are pinned upon a big board we sit round with note books open and distribute those who must be seen between us by the time this is done and the horses in it is halfpast eleven then away we all fly upon our several tasks horton in a carriage and pair to see the employers i in a dog cart to see the employed and mccarthy on his good irish legs to see those chronic cases to which a qualified man can do no good and an unqualified no harm well we all work back again by two oclock when we find dinner waiting for us we may or may not have finished our rounds if not away we go again if we have horton dictates his prescriptions and strides off to bed with his black clay pipe in his mouth he is the most abandoned smoker i have ever met with collecting the dottles of his pipes in the evening and smoking them the next morning before breakfast in the stable yard when he has departed for his nap mccarthy and i get to work on the medicine there are perhaps fifty bottles to put up with pills ointment etc it is quite half past four before we have them all laid out on the shelf addressed to the respective invalids then we have an hour or so of quiet when we smoke or read or box with the coachman in the harness room after tea the evenings work commences from six to nine people are coming in for their medicine or fresh patients wishing advice when these are settled we have to see again any very grave cases which may be on the list and so about ten oclock we may hope to have another smoke and perhaps a game of cards then it is a rare thing for a night to pass without one or other of us having to trudge off to a case which may take us two hours or may take us ten hard work as you see but horton is such a good chap and works so hard himself that one does not mind what one does and then we are all like brothers in the house our talk is just a rattle of chaff and the patients are as homely as ourselves so that the work becomes quite a pleasure to all of us yes horton is a real rightdown good fellow his heart is broad and kind and generous there is nothing petty in the man he loves to see those around him happy and the sight of his sturdy figure and jolly red face goes far to make them so nature meant him to be a healer for he brightens up a sick room as he did the merton station when first i set eyes upon him dont imagine from my description that he is in any way soft however there is no one on whom one could be less likely to impose he has a temper which is easily aflame and as easily appeased a mistake in the dispensing may wake it up and then he bursts into the surgery like a whiff of cast wind his checks red his whiskers bristling and his eyes malignant the daybook is banged the bottles rattled the counter thumped and then he is off again with five doors slamming behind him we can trace his progress when the black mood is on him by those dwindling slams perhaps it is that mccarthy has labelled the cough mixture as the eyewash or sent an empty pillbox with an exhortation to take one every four hours in any case the cyclone comes and goes and by the next meal all is peace once more i said that the patients were very homely any one who is overstarched might well come here to be unstiffened i confess that i did not quite fall in with it at once when on one of my first mornings a club patient with his bottle under his arm came up to me and asked me if i were the doctors man i sent him on to see the groom in the stable but soon one falls into the humour of it there is no offence meant and why should any be taken they are kindly generous folk and if they pay no respect to your profession in the abstract and so rather hurt your dignity they will be as leal and true as possible to yourself if you can win their respect i like the grip of their greasy and blackened hands another peculiarity of the district is that many of the manufacturers and colliery owners have risen from the workmen and have in some cases at least retained their old manners and even their old dress the other day mrs white hortons motherinlaw had a violent sick headache and as we are all very fond of the kind old lady we were trying to keep things as quiet as possible downstairs suddenly there came a bang bang bang at the knocker and then in an instant another rattling series of knocks as if a tethered donkey were trying to kick in the panel after all our efforts for silence it was exasperating i rushed to the door to find a seedy looking person just raising his hand to commence a fresh bombardment what on earths the matter i asked only i may have been a little more emphatic pain in the jaw said he you neednt make such a noise said i other people are ill besides you if i pay my money young man ill make such noise as i like and actually in cold blood he commenced a fresh assault upon the door he would have gone on with his devils tattoo all morning if i had not led him down the path and seen him off the premises an hour afterwards horton whirled into the surgery with a trail of banged doors behind him whats this about mr usher munro he asked he says that you were violent towards him there was a club patient here who kept on banging the knocker said i i was afraid that he would disturb mrs white and so i made him stop hortons eyes began to twinkle my boy said he that club patient as you call him is the richest man in merton and worth a hundred a year to me i have no doubt that he appeased him by some tale of my disgrace and degradation but i have not heard anything of the matter since it has been good for me to be here bertie it has brought me in close contact with the working classes and made me realise what fine people they are because one drunkard goes home howling on a saturday night we are too apt to overlook the ninetynine decent folk by their own firesides i shall not make that mistake any more the kindliness of the poor to the poor makes a man sick of himself and their sweet patience depend upon it if ever there is a popular rising the wrongs which lead to it must be monstrous and indefensible i think the excesses of the french revolution are dreadful enough in themselves but much more so as an index to the slow centuries of misery against which they were a mad protest and then the wisdom of the poor it is amusing to read the glib newspaper man writing about the ignorance of the masses they dont know the date of magna charta or whom john of gaunt married but put a practical uptodate problem before them and see how unerringly they take the right side didnt they put the reform bill through in the teeth of the opposition of the majority of the socalled educated classes didnt they back the north against the south when nearly all our leaders went wrong when universal arbitration and the suppression of the liquor traffic comes is it not sure to be from the pressure of these humble folks they look at life with clearer and more unselfish eyes its an axiom i think that to heighten a nations wisdom you must lower its franchise i often have my doubts bertie if there is such a thing as the existence of evil if we could honestly convince ourselves that there was not it would help us so much in formulating a rational religion but dont let us strain truth even for such an object as that i must confess that there are some forms of vice cruelty for example for which it is hard to find any explanation save indeed that it is a degenerate survival of that warlike ferocity which may once have been of service in helping to protect the community no let me be frank and say that i cant make cruelty fit into my scheme but when you find that other evils which seem at first sight black enough really tend in the long run to the good of mankind it may be hoped that those which continue to puzzle us may at last be found to serve the same end in some fashion which is now inexplicable it seems to me that the study of life by the physician vindicates the moral principles of right and wrong but when you look closely it is a question whether that which is a wrong to the present community may not prove to have been a right to the interests of posterity that sounds a little foggy but i will make my meaning more clear when i say that i think right and wrong are both tools which are being wielded by those great hands which are shaping the destinies of the universe that both are making for improvement but that the action of the one is immediate and that of the other more slow but none the less certain our own distinction of right and wrong is founded too much upon the immediate convenience of the community and does not inquire sufficiently deeply into the ultimate effect i have my own views about natures methods though i feel that it is rather like a beetle giving his opinions upon the milky way however they have the merit of being consoling for if we could conscientiously see that sin served a purpose and a good one it would take some of the blackness out of life it seems to me then that nature still working on the lines of evolution strengthens the race in two ways the one is by improving those who are morally strong which is done by increased knowledge and broadening religious views the other and hardly less important is by the killing off and extinction of those who are morally weak this is accomplished by drink and immorality these are really two of the most important forces which work for the ultimate perfection of the race i picture them as two great invisible hands hovering over the garden of life and plucking up the weeds looked at in ones own day one can only see that they produce degradation and misery but at the end of a third generation from then what has happened the line of the drunkard and of the debauchee physically as well as morally weakened is either extinct or on the way towards it struma tubercle nervous disease have all lent a hand towards the pruning off of that rotten branch and the average of the race is thereby improved i believe from the little that i have seen of life that it is a law which acts with startling swiftness that a majority of drunkards never perpetuate their species at all and that when the curse is hereditary the second generation generally sees the end of it dont misunderstand me and quote me as saying that it is a good thing for a nation that it should have many drunkards nothing of the kind what i say is that if a nation has many morally weak people then it is good that there should be a means for checking those weaker strains nature has her devices and drink is among them when there are no more drunkards and reprobates it means that the race is so advanced that it no longer needs such rough treatment then the allwise engineer will speed us along in some other fashion ive been thinking a good deal lately about this question of the uses of evil and of how powerful a tool it is in the hands of the creator last night the whole thing crystallised out quite suddenly into a small set of verses please jump them if they bore you with either hand gods own best will bide the test and gods own worst will fall but best or worst or last or first he ordereth it all for all is good if understood ah could we understand and right and ill are tools of skill held in his either hand the harlot and the anchorite the martyr and the rake deftly he fashions each aright its vital part to take wisdom he makes to guide the sap where the high blossoms be and lust to kill the weaker branch and drink to trim the tree and holiness that so the bole be solid at the core and plague and fever that the whole be changing evermore he strews the microbes in the lung the bloodclot in the brain with test and test he picks the best then tests them once again he tests the body and the mind he rings them oer and oer and if they crack he throws them back and fashions them once more he chokes the infant throat with slime he sets the ferment free he builds the tiny tube of lime that blocks the artery he lets the youthful dreamer store great projects in his brain until he drops the fungus spore that smears them out again he stores the milk that feeds the babe he dulls the tortured nerve he gives a hundred joys of sense where few or none might serve and still he trains the branch of good where the high blossoms be and wieldeth still the shears of ill to prune and prune his tree so read i this and as i try to write it clear again i feel a second finger lie above mine on the pen dim are these peering eyes of mine and dark what i have seen but be i wrong the wrong is thine else had it never been i am quite ashamed of having been so didactic but it is fine to think that sin may have an object and work towards good my father says that i seem to look upon the universe as if it were my property and cant be happy until i know that all is right with it well it does send a glow through me when i seem to catch a glimpse of the light behind the clouds and now for my big bit of news which is going to change my whole life whom do you think i had a letter from last tuesday week from cullingworth no less it had no beginning no end was addressed all wrong and written with a very thick quill pen upon the back of a prescription how it ever reached me is a wonder this is what he had to say started here in bradfield last june colossal success my example must revolutionise medical practice rapidly making fortune have invention which is worth millions unless our admiralty take it up shall make brazil the leading naval power come down by next train on receiving this have plenty for you to do that was the whole of this extraordinary letter it had no name to it which was certainly reasonable enough since no one else could have written it knowing cullingworth as well as i did i took it with reservations and deductions how could he have made so rapid and complete a success in a town in which he must have been a complete stranger it was incredible and yet there must be some truth in it or he would not invite me to come down and test it on the whole i thought that i had better move very cautiously in the matter for i was happy and snug where i was and kept on putting a little by which i hoped would form a nucleus to start me in practice it is only a few pounds up to date but in a year or so it might mount to something i wrote to cullingworth therefore thanking him for having remembered me and explaining how matters stood i had had great difficulty in finding an opening i said and now that i had one i was loth to give it up save for a permanency ten days passed during which cullingworth was silent then came a huge telegram your letter to hand why not call me a liar at once i tell you that i have seen thirty thousand patients in the last year my actual takings have been over four thousand pounds all patients come to me would not cross the street to see queen victoria you can have all visiting all surgery all midwifery make what you like of it will guarantee three hundred pounds the first year well this began to look more like business especially that last sentence i took it to horton and asked his advice his opinion was that i had nothing to lose and everything to gain so it ended by my wiring back accepting the partnership if it is a partnership and tomorrow morning i am off to bradfield with great hopes and a small portmanteau i know how interested you are in the personality of cullingworth as every one is who comes even at second hand within range of his influence and so you may rely upon it that i shall give you a very full and particular account of all that passes between us i am looking forward immensely to seeing him again and i trust we wont have any rows goodbye old chap my foot is upon the threshold of fortune congratulate me vi the parade bradfield th march it is only two days since i wrote to you my dear old chap and yet i find myself loaded to the muzzle and at full cock again i have come to bradfield i have seen old cullingworth once more and i have found that all he has told me is true yes incredible as it sounded this wonderful fellow seems to have actually built up a great practice in little more than a year he really is with all his eccentricities a very remarkable man bertie he doesnt seem to have a chance of showing his true powers in this matured civilisation the law and custom hamper him he is the sort of fellow who would come right to the front in a french revolution or if you put him as emperor over some of these little south american states i believe that in ten years he would either be in his grave or would have the continent yes cullingworth is fit to fight for a higher stake than a medical practice and on a bigger stage than an english provincial town when i read of aaron burr in your history i always picture him as a man like c i had the kindest of leave takings from horton if he had been my brother he could not have been more affectionate i could not have thought that i should grow so fond of a man in so short a time he takes the keenest interest in my venture and i am to write him a full account he gave me as we parted a black old meerschaum which he had coloured himself the last possible pledge of affection from a smoker it was pleasant for me to feel that if all went wrong at bradfield i had a little harbour at merton for which i could make still of course pleasant and instructive as the life there was i could not shut my eyes to the fact that it would take a terribly long time before i could save enough to buy a share in a practice a longer time probably than my poor fathers strength would last that telegram of cullingworths in which as you may remember he guaranteed me three hundred pounds in the first year gave me hopes of a much more rapid career you will agree with me i am sure that i did wisely to go to him i had an adventure upon the way to bradfield the carriage in which i was travelling contained a party of three at whom i took the most casual of glances before settling down to the daily paper there was an elderly lady with a bright rosy face gold spectacles and a dash of red velvet in her bonnet with her were two younger people who i took to be her son and her daughter the one a quiet gentlelooking girl of twenty or so dressed in black and the other a short thickset young fellow a year or two older the two ladies sat by each other in the far corner and the son as i presume him to be sat opposite me we may have travelled an hour or more without my paying any attention to this little family party save that i could not help hearing some talk between the two ladies the younger who was addressed as winnie had as i noticed a very sweet and soothing voice she called the elder mother which showed that i was right as to the relationship i was sitting then still reading my paper when i was surprised to get a kick on the shins from the young fellow opposite i moved my legs thinking that it was an accident but an instant afterwards i received another and a harder one i dropped my paper with a growl but the moment that i glanced at him i saw how the matter stood his foot was jerking spasmodically his two hands clenched and drumming against his breast while his eyes were rolling upwards until only the rim of his iris was to be seen i sprang upon him tore open his collar unbuttoned his waistcoat and pulled his head down upon the seat crash went one of his heels through the carriage window but i contrived to sit upon his knees while i kept hold of his two wrists dont be alarmed i cried its epilepsy and will soon pass glancing up i saw that the little girl was sitting very pale and quiet in the corner the mother had pulled a bottle out of her bag and was quite cool and helpful he often has them said she this is bromide he is coming out i answered you look after winnie i blurted it out because her head seemed to rock as if she were going off but the absurdity of the thing struck us all next moment and the mother burst into a laugh in which the daughter and i joined the son had opened his eyes and had ceased to struggle i must really beg your pardon said i as i helped him up again i had not the advantage of knowing your other name and i was in such a hurry that i had no time to think what i was saying they laughed again in the most goodhumoured way and as soon as the young fellow had recovered we all joined in quite a confidential conversation it is wonderful how the intrusion of any of the realities of life brushes away the cobwebs of etiquette in half an hour we knew all about each other or at any rate i knew all about them mrs la force was the mothers name a widow with these two children they had given up housekeeping and found it more pleasant to live in apartments travelling from one watering place to another their one trouble was the nervous weakness of the son fred they were now on their way to birchespool where they hoped that he might get some good from the bracing air i was able to recommend vegetarianism which i have found to act like a charm in such cases we had quite a spirited conversation and i think that we were sorry on both sides when we came to the junction where they had to change mrs la force gave me her card and i promised to call if ever i should be in birchespool however all this must be stupid enough to you you know my little ways by this time and you dont expect me to keep on the main line of my story however i am back on the rails now and i shall try to remain there well it was nearly six oclock and evening was just creeping in when we drew up in bradfield station the first thing i saw when i looked out of the window was cullingworth exactly the same as ever striding in his jerky way down the platform his coat flying open his chin thrust forward he is the most underhung man i have ever seen and his great teeth all gleaming like a goodnatured bloodhound he roared with delight when he saw me wrung my hand and slapped me enthusiastically upon the shoulder my dear chap said he well clear this town out i tell you munro we wont leave a doctor in it its all they can do now to get butter to their bread and when we get to work together theyll have to eat it dry listen to me my boy there are a hundred and twenty thousand folk in this town all shrieking for advice and there isnt a doctor who knows a rhubarb pill from a calculus man we only have to gather them in i stand and take the money until my arm aches but how is it i asked as we pushed our way through the crowd are there so few other doctors few he roared by crums the streets are blocked with them you couldnt fall out of a window in this town without killing a doctor but of all thewell there youll see them for yourself you walked to my house at avonmouth munro i dont let my friends walk to my house at bradfield eh what a wellappointed carriage with two fine black horses was drawn up at the station entrance the smart coachman touched his hat as cullingworth opened the door which of the houses sir he asked cullingworths eyes shot round to me to see what i thought of such a query between ourselves i have not the slightest doubt that he had instructed the man to ask it he always had a fine eye for effect but he usually erred by underrating the intelligence of those around him ah said he rubbing his chin like a man in doubt well i daresay dinner will be nearly ready drive to the town residential good gracious cullingworth said i as we started how many houses do you inhabit it sounds as if you had bought the town well well said he laughing we are driving to the house where i usually live it suits us very well though i have not been able to get all the rooms furnished yet then i have a little farm of a few hundred acres just outside the city it is a pleasant place for the week ends and we send the nurse and the child my dear chap i did not know that you had started a family yes its an infernal nuisance but still the fact remains we get our butter and things from the farm then of course i have my house of business in the heart of the city consulting and waiting room i suppose he looked at me with a sort of half vexed half amused expression you cannot rise to a situation munro said he i never met a fellow with such a stodgy imagination id trust you to describe a thing when you have seen it but never to build up an idea of it beforehand whats the trouble now i asked well i have written to you about my practice and ive wired to you about it and here you sit asking me if i work it in two rooms ill have to hire the market square before ive finished and then i wont have space to wag my elbows can your imagination rise to a great house with people waiting in every room jammed in as tight as theyll fit and two layers of them squatting in the cellar well thats my house of business on an average day the folk come in from the county fifty miles off and eat bread and treacle on the doorstep so as to be first in when the housekeeper comes down the medical officer of health made an official complaint of the overcrowding of my waitingrooms they wait in the stables and sit along the racks and under the horses bellies ill turn some of em on to you my boy and then youll know a little more about it well all this puzzled me a good deal as you can imagine bertie for making every allowance for cullingworths inflated way of talking there must be something at the back of it i was thinking to myself that i must keep my head cool and have a look at everything with my own eyes when the carriage pulled up and we got out this is my little place said cullingworth it was the corner house of a line of fine buildings and looked to me much more like a goodsized hotel than a private mansion it had a broad sweep of steps leading to the door and towered away up to five or six stories with pinnacles and a flagstaff on the top as a matter of fact i learned that before cullingworth took it it had been one of the chief clubs in the town but the committee had abandoned it on account of the heavy rent a smart maid opened the door and a moment later i was shaking hands with mrs cullingworth who was all kindliness and cordiality she has i think forgotten the little avonmouth business when her husband and i fell out the inside of the house was even huger than i had thought from the look of the exterior there were over thirty bedrooms cullingworth informed me as he helped me to carry my portmanteau upstairs the hall and first stair were most excellently furnished and carpetted but it all run to nothing at the landing my own bedroom had a little iron bed and a small basin standing on a packing case cullingworth took a hammer from the mantelpiece and began to knock in nails behind the door these will do to hang your clothes on said he you dont mind roughing it a little until we get things in order not in the least you see he explained theres no good my putting a forty pound suite into a bedroom and then having to chuck it all out of the window in order to make room for a hundredpound one no sense in that munro eh what im going to furnish this house as no house has ever been furnished by crums ill bring the folk from a hundred miles round just to have leave to look at it but i must do it room by room come down with me and look at the diningroom you must be hungry after your journey it really was furnished in a marvellous way nothing flash and everything magnificent the carpet was so rich that my feet seemed to sink into it as into deep moss the soup was on the table and mrs cullingworth sitting down but he kept hauling me round to look at something else go on hetty he cried over his shoulder i just want to show munro this now these plain diningroom chairs what dyou think they cost each eh what five pounds said i at a venture exactly he cried in great delight thirty pounds for the six you hear hetty munro guessed the price first shot now my boy what for the pair of curtains they were a magnificent pair of stamped crimson velvet with a twofoot gilt cornice above them i thought that i had better not imperil my newly gained reputation by guessing eighty pounds he roared slapping them with the back of his hand eighty pounds munro what dye think of that everything that i have in this house is going to be of the best why look at this waitingmaid did you ever see a neater one he swung the girl towards me by the arm dont be silly jimmy said mrs cullingworth mildly while he roared with laughter with all his fangs flashing under his bristling moustache the girl edged closer to her mistress looking halffrightened and half angry all right mary no harm he cried sit down munro old chap get a bottle of champagne mary and well drink to more luck well we had a very pleasant little dinner it is never slow if cullingworth is about he is one of those men who make a kind of magnetic atmosphere so that you feel exhilarated and stimulated in their presence his mind is so nimble and his thoughts so extravagant that your own break away from their usual grooves and surprise you by their activity you feel pleased at your own inventiveness and originality when you are really like the wren when it took a lift on the eagles shoulder old peterson you remember used to have a similar effect upon you in the linlithgow days in the middle of dinner he plunged off and came back with a round bag about the size of a pomegranate in his hand what dye think this is munro eh i have no idea our days take eh hetty he undid a string and in an instant a pile of gold and silver rattled down upon the cloth the coins whirling and clinking among the dishes one rolled off the table and was retrieved by the maid from some distant corner what is it mary a half sovereign put it in your pocket what did the lot come to hetty thirtyone pound eight you see munro one days work he plunged his hand into his trouser pocket and brought out a pile of sovereigns which he balanced in his palm look at that laddie rather different from my avonmouth form eh what it will be good news for them i suggested he was scowling at me in an instant with all his old ferocity you cannot imagine a more savagelooking creature than cullingworth is when his temper goes wrong he gets a perfectly fiendish expression in his light blue eyes and all his hair bristles up like a striking cobra he isnt a beauty at his best but at his worst hes really phenomenal at the first danger signal his wife had ordered the maid from the room what rot you do talk munro he cried do you suppose i am going to cripple myself for years by letting those debts hang on to me i understood that you had promised said i still of course it is no business of mine i should hope not he cried a tradesman stands to win or to lose he allows a margin for bad debts i would have paid it if i could i couldnt and so i wiped the slate clean no one in his senses would dream of spending all the money that i make in bradfield upon the tradesmen of avonmouth suppose they come down upon you well well see about that when they do meanwhile i am paying ready money for every mortal thing that comes up the door steps they think so well of me here that i could have had the whole place furnished like a palace from the drain pipes to the flagstaff only i determined to take each room in turn when i was ready for it theres nearly four hundred pounds under this one ceiling there came a tap at the door and in walked a boy in buttons if you please sir mr duncan wishes to see you give my compliments to mr duncan and tell him he may go to the devil my dear jimmy cried mrs cullingworth tell him i am at dinner and if all the kings in europe were waiting in the hall with their crowns in their hands i wouldnt cross that door mat to see them the boy vanished but was back in an instant please sir he wont go wont go what dyou mean cullingworth sat with his mouth open and his knife and fork sticking up what dyou mean you brat what are you boggling about its his bill sir said the frightened boy cullingworths face grew dusky and the veins began to swell on his forehead his bill eh look here he took his watch out and laid it on the table its two minutes to eight at eight im coming out and if i find him there ill strew the street with him tell him ill shred him over the parish he has two minutes to save his life in and one of them is nearly gone the boy bolted from the room and in an instant afterwards we heard the bang of the front door with a clatter of steps down the stairs cullingworth lay back in his chair and roared until the tears shone on his eyelashes while his wife quivered all over with sympathetic merriment ill drive him mad cullingworth sobbed at last hes a nervous chickenlivered kind of man and when i look at him he turns the colour of putty if i pass his shop i usually just drop in and stand and look at him i never speak but just look it paralyses him sometimes the shop is full of people but it is just the same who is he then i asked hes my corn merchant i was saying that i paid my tradesmen as i go but he is the only exception he has done me once or twice you see and so i try to take it out of him by the way you might send him down twenty pounds tomorrow hetty its time for an instalment what a gossip you will think me bertie but when i begin my memory brings everything back so clearly and i write on and on almost unconsciously besides this fellow is such a mixture of qualities that i could never give you any idea of him by myself and so i just try to repeat to you what he says and what he does so that you may build up your own picture of the man i know that he has always interested you and that he does so more now than ever since our fates have drawn us together again after dinner we went into the back room which was the most extraordinary contrast to the front one having only a plain deal table and halfadozen kitchen chairs scattered about on a linoleum floor at one end was an electric battery and a big magnet at the other a packing case with several pistols and a litter of cartridges upon it a rook rifle was leaning tip against it and looking round i saw that the walls were all pocked with bullet marks whats this then i asked rolling my eyes round hetty whats this he asked with his pipe in his hand and his head cocked sideways naval supremacy and the command of the seas said she like a child repeating a lesson thats it he shouted stabbing at me with the amber naval supremacy and command of the seas its all here right under your nose i tell you munro i could go to switzerland tomorrow and i could say to them look here you havent got a seaboard and you havent got a port but just find me a ship and hoist your flag on it and ill give you every ocean under heaven id sweep the seas until there wasnt a matchbox floating on them or i could make them over to a limited company and join the board after allotment i hold the salt water in the cup of this hand every drop of it his wife put her hands on his shoulder with admiration in her eyes i turned to knock out my pipe and grinned over the grate oh you may grin said he he was wonderfully quick at spotting what you were doing youll grin a little wider when you see the dividends coming in whats the value of that magnet a pound a million pounds not a penny under and dirt cheap to the nation that buys it i shall let it go at that though i could make ten times as much if i held on i shall take it up to the secretary of the navy in a week or two and if he seems to be a civil deserving sort of person i shall do business with him its not every day munro that a man comes into his office with the atlantic under one arm and the pacific under the other eh what i knew it would make him savage but i lay back in my chair and laughed until i was tired his wife looked at me reproachfully but he after a moment of blackness burst out laughing also stamping up and down the room and waving his arms of course it seems absurd to you he cried well i daresay it would to me if any other fellow had worked it out but you may take my word for it that its all right hetty here will answer for it wont you hetty its splendid my dear now ill show you munro what an unbelieving jew you are trying to look interested and giggling at the back of your throat in the first place i have discovered a method which i wont tell you of increasing the attractive power of a magnet a hundred fold have you grasped that yes very good you are also aware i presume that modern projectiles are either made of or tipped with steel it may possibly have come to your ears that magnets attract steel permit me now to show you a small experiment he bent over his apparatus and i suddenly heard the snapping of electricity this he continued going across to the packing case is a saloon pistol and will be exhibited in the museums of the next century as being the weapon with which the new era was inaugurated into the breech i place a boxer cartridge specialty provided for experimental purposes with a steel bullet i aim point blank at the dab of red sealing wax upon the wall which is four inches above the magnet i am an absolutely dead shot i fire you will now advance and satisfy yourself that the bullet is flattened upon the end of the magnet after which you will apologise to me for that grin i looked and it certainly was as he had said ill tell you what i would do he cried i am prepared to put that magnet in hettys bonnet and to let you fire six shots straight at her face hows that for a test you wouldnt mind hetty eh what i dont think she would have objected but i hastened to disclaim any share in such an experiment of course you see that the whole thing is to scale my warship of the future carries at her prow and stern a magnet which shall be as much larger than that as the big shell will be larger than this tiny bullet or i might have a separate raft possibly to carry my apparatus my ship goes into action what happens then munro eh what every shot fired at her goes smack on to the magnet theres a reservoir below into which they drop when the electric circuit is broken after every action they are sold by auction for old metal and the result divided as prize money among the crew but think of it man i tell you it is an absolute impossibility for a shot to strike any ship which is provided with my apparatus and then look at the cheapness you dont want armour you want nothing any ship that floats becomes invulnerable with one of these the war ship of the future will cost anything from seven pound ten youre grinning again but if you give me a magnet and a brixton trawler with a sevenpounder gun ill show sport to the finest battleship afloat well there must be some flaw about this i suggested if your magnet is so strong as all that you would have your own broadside boomeranging back upon you not a bit of it theres a big difference between a shot flying away from you with all its muzzle velocity and another one which is coming towards you and only needs a slight deflection to strike the magnet besides by breaking the circuit i can take off the influence when i am firing my own broadside then i connect and instantly become invulnerable and your nails and screws the warship of the future will be bolted together by wood well he would talk of nothing else the whole evening but of this wonderful invention of his perhaps there is nothing in it probably there is not and yet it illustrates the manysided nature of the man that he should not say one word about his phenominal success here of which i am naturally most anxious to hear not a word either upon the important subject of our partnership but will think and talk of nothing but this extraordinary naval idea in a week he will have tossed it aside in all probability and be immersed in some plan for reuniting the jews and settling them in madagascar yet from all he has said and all i have seen there can be no doubt that he has in some inexplicable way made a tremendous hit and tomorrow i shall let you know all about it come what may i am delighted that i came for things promise to be interesting regard this not as the end of a letter but of a paragraph you shall have the conclusion tomorrow or on thursday at the latest goodbye and my remembrance to lawrence if you see him hows your friend from yale vii the parade bradfield th march well you see i am as good as my word bertie and here is a full account of this queer little sample gouged out of real life never to be seen i should fancy by any eye save your own i have written to horton also and of course to my mother but i dont go into detail with them as i have got into the way of doing with you you keep on assuring me that you like it so on your own head be it if you find my experiences gradually developing into a weariness when i woke in the morning and looked round at the bare walls and the basin on the packing case i hardly knew where i was cullingworth came charging into the room in his dressing gown however and roused me effectually by putting his hands on the rail at the end of the bed and throwing a somersault over it which brought his heels on to my pillow with a thud he was in great spirits and squatting on the bed he held forth about his plans while i dressed i tell you one of the first things i mean to do munro said he i mean to have a paper of my own well start a weekly paper here you and i and well make them sit up all round well have an organ of our own just like every french politician if any one crosses us well make them wish they had never been born eh what laddie what dyou think so clever munro that everybodys bound to read it and so scathing that it will just fetch out blisters every time dont you think we could what politics i asked oh curse the politics red pepper well rubbed in thats my idea of a paper call it the scorpion chaff the mayor and the council until they call a meeting and hang themselves id do the snappy paragraphs and you would do the fiction and poetry i thought about it during the night and hetty has written to murdochs to get an estimate for the printing we might get our first number out this day week my dear chap i gasped i want you to start a novel this morning you wont get many patients at first and youll have lots of time but i never wrote a line in my life a properly balanced man can do anything he sets his hand to hes got every possible quality inside him and all he wants is the will to develop it could you write a novel yourself i asked of course i could such a novel munro that when theyd read the first chapter the folk would just sit groaning until the second came out theyd wait in rows outside my door in the hope of hearing what was coming next by crums ill go and begin it now and with another somersault over the end of the bed he rushed from the room with the tassels of his dressing gown flying behind him i daresay youve quite come to the conclusion by this time that cullingworth is simply an interesting pathological study a man in the first stage of lunacy or general paralysis you might not be so sure about it if you were in close contact with him he justifies his wildest flights by what he does it sounds grotesque when put down in black and white but then it would have sounded equally grotesque a year ago if he had said that he would build up a huge practice in a twelvemonth now we see that he has done it his possibilities are immense he has such huge energy at the back of his fertility of invention i am afraid on thinking over all that i have written to you that i may have given you a false impression of the man by dwelling too much on those incidents in which he has shown the strange and violent side of his character and omitting the stretches between where his wisdom and judgment have had a chance his conversation when he does not fly off at a tangent is full of pith and idea the greatest monument ever erected to napoleon buonaparte was the british national debt said he yesterday again we must never forget that the principal export of great britain to the united states is the united states again speaking of christianity what is intellectually unsound cannot be morally sound he shoots off a whole column of aphorisms in a single evening i should like to have a man with a note book always beside him to gather up his waste no you must not let me give you a false impression of the mans capacity on the other hand it would be dishonest to deny that i think him thoroughly unscrupulous and full of very sinister traits i am much mistaken however if he has not fine strata in his nature he is capable of rising to heights as well as of sinking to depths well when we had breakfasted we got into the carriage and drove off to the place of business i suppose you are surprised at hetty coming with us said cullingworth slapping me on the knee hetty munro is wondering what the devil you are here for only he is too polite to ask in fact it had struck me as rather strange that she should as a matter of course accompany us to business youll see when we get there he cried chuckling we run this affair on lines of our own it was not very far and we soon found ourselves outside a square whitewashed building which had a huge dr cullingworth on a great brass plate at the side of the door underneath was printed may be consulted gratis from ten to four the door was open and i caught a glimpse of a crowd of people waiting in the hall how many here asked cullingworth of the page boy a hundred and forty sir all the waiting rooms full yes sir courtyard full yes sir stable full yes sir coachhouse full theres still room in the coachhouse sir ah im sorry we havent got a crowded day for you munro said he of course we cant command these things and must take them as they come now then now then make a gangway cant you this to his patients come here and see the waitingroom pooh what an atmosphere why on earth cant you open the windows for yourselves i never saw such folk there are thirty people in this room munro and not one with sense enough to open a window to save himself from suffocation i tried sir but theres a screw through the sash cried one fellow ah my boy youll never get on in the world if you cant open a window without raising a sash said cullingworth slapping him on the shoulder he took the mans umbrella and stuck it through two of the panes of glass thats the way he said boy see that the screw is taken out now then munro come along and well get to work we went up a wooden stair uncarpeted leaving every room beneath us as far as i could see crowded with patients at the top was a bare passage which had two rooms opposite to each other at one end and a single one at the other this is my consulting room said he leading the way into one of these it was a goodsized square chamber perfectly empty save for two plain wooden chairs and an unpainted table with two books and a stethoscope upon it it doesnt look like four or five thousand a year does it now there is an exactly similar one opposite which you can have for yourself ill send across any surgical cases which may turn up today however i think you had better stay with me and see how i work things i should very much like to said i there are one or two elementary rules to be observed in the way of handling patients he remarked seating himself on the table and swinging his legs the most obvious is that you must never let them see that you want them it should be pure condescension on your part seeing them at all and the more difficulties you throw in the way of it the more they think of it break your patients in early and keep them well to heel never make the fatal mistake of being polite to them many foolish young men fall into this habit and are ruined in consequence now this is my form he sprang to the door and putting his two hands to his mouth he bellowed stop your confounded jabbering down there i might as well be living above a poultry show there you see he added to me they will think ever so much more of me for that but dont they get offended i asked im afraid not i have a name for this sort of thing now and they have come to expect it but an offended patient i mean a thoroughly insulted one is the finest advertisement in the world if it is a woman she runs clacking about among her friends until your name becomes a household word and they all pretend to sympathise with her and agree among themselves that you must be a remarkably discerning man i quarrelled with one man about the state of his gall duct and it ended by my throwing him down the stairs what was the result he talked so much about it that the whole village from which he came sick and well trooped to see me the little country practitioner who had been buttering them up for a quarter of a century found that he might as well put up his shutters its human nature my boy and you cant alter it eh what you make yourself cheap and you become cheap you put a high price on yourself and they rate you at that price suppose i set up in harley street tomorrow and made it all nice and easy with hours from ten to three do you think i should get a patient i might starve first how would i work it i should let it be known that i only saw patients from midnight until two in the morning and that baldheaded people must pay double that would set people talking their curiosity would be stimulated and in four months the street would be blocked all night eh what laddie youd go yourself thats my principle here i often come in of a morning and send them all about their business tell them im going off to the country for a day i turn away forty pounds and its worth four hundred as an advertisement but i understood from the plate that the consultations were gratis so they are but they have to pay for the medicine and if a patient wishes to come out of turn he has to pay halfaguinea for the privilege there are generally about twenty every day who would rather pay that than wait several hours but mind you munro dont you make any mistake about this all this would go for nothing if you had not something slid behind i cure them thats the point i take cases that others have despaired of and i cure them right off all the rest is only to bring them here but once here i keep them on my merits it would all be a flash in the pan but for that now come along and see hettys department we walked down the passage to the other room it was elaborately fitted up as a dispensary and there with a chic little apron mrs cullingworth was busy making up pills with her sleeves turned up and a litter of glasses and bottles all round her she was laughing away like a little child among its toys the best dispenser in the world cried cullingworth patting her on the shoulder you see how i do it munro i write on a label what the prescription is and make a sign which shows how much is to be charged the man comes along the passage and passes the label through the pigeon hole hetty makes it up passes out the bottle and takes the money now come on and clear some of these folk out of the house it is impossible for me to give you any idea of that long line of patients filing hour after hour through the unfurnished room and departing some amused and some frightened with their labels in their hands cullingworths antics are beyond belief i laughed until i thought the wooden chair under me would have come to pieces he roared he raved he swore he pushed them about slapped them on the back shoved them against the wall and occasionally rushed out to the head of the stair to address them en masse at the same time behind all this tomfoolery i watching his prescriptions could see a quickness of diagnosis a scientific insight and a daring and unconventional use of drugs which satisfied me that he was right in saying that under all this charlatanism there lay solid reasons for his success indeed charlatanism is a misapplied word in this connection for it would describe the doctor who puts on an artificial and conventional manner with his patients rather than one who is absolutely frank and true to his own extraordinary nature to some of his patients he neither said one word nor did he allow them to say one with a loud hush he would rush at them thump them on the chests listen to their hearts write their labels and then run them out of the room by their shoulders one poor old lady he greeted with a perfect scream youve been drinking too much tea he cried you are suffering from tea poisoning then without allowing her to get a word in he clutched her by her crackling black mantle dragged her up to the table and held out a copy of taylors medical jurisprudence which was lying there put your hand on the book he thundered and swear that for fourteen days you will drink nothing but cocoa she swore with upturned eyes and was instantly whirled off with her label in her hand to the dispensary i could imagine that to the last day of her life the old lady would talk of her interview with cullingworth and i could well understand how the village from which she came would send fresh recruits to block up his waiting rooms another portly person was seized by the two armholes of his waistcoat just as he was opening his mouth to explain his symptoms and was rushed backward down the passage down the stairs and finally into the street to the immense delight of the assembled patients you eat too much drink too much and sleep too much cullingworth roared after him knock down a policeman and come again when they let you out another patient complained of a sinking feeling my dear said he take your medicine and if that does no good swallow the cork for there is nothing better when you are sinking as far as i could judge the bulk of the patients looked upon a morning at cullingworths as a most enthralling public entertainment tempered only by a thrill lest it should be their turn next to be made an exhibition of well with halfanhour for lunch this extraordinary business went on till a quarter to four in the afternoon when the last patient had departed cullingworth led the way into the dispensary where all the fees had been arranged upon the counter in the order of their value there were seventeen halfsovereigns seventythree shillings and fortysix florins or thirtytwo pounds eight and sixpence in all cullingworth counted it up and then mixing the gold and silver into one heap he sat running his fingers through it and playing with it finally he raked it into the canvas bag which i had seen the night before and lashed the neck up with a boot lace we walked home and that walk struck me as the most extraordinary part of all that extraordinary day cullingworth paraded slowly through the principal streets with his canvas bag full of money outstretched at the full length of his arm his wife and i walked on either side like two acolytes supporting a priest and so we made our way solemnly homewards the people stopping to see us pass i always make a point of walking through the doctors quarter said cullingworth we are passing through it now they all come to their windows and gnash their teeth and dance until i am out of sight why should you quarrel with them what is the matter with them i asked pooh whats the use of being mealymouthed about it said he we are all trying to cut each others throats and why should we be hypocritical over it they havent got a good word for me any one of them so i like to take a rise out of them i must say that i can see no sense in that they are your brothers in the profession with the same education and the same knowledge why should you take an offensive attitude towards them thats what i say dr munro cried his wife it is so very unpleasant to feel that one is surrounded by enemies on every side hettys riled because their wives wouldnt call upon her he cried look at that my dear jingling his bag that is better than having a lot of brainless women drinking tea and cackling in our drawingroom ive had a big card printed munro saying that we dont desire to increase the circle of our acquaintance the maid has orders to show it to every suspicious person who calls why should you not make money at your practice and yet remain on good terms with your professional brethren said i you speak as if the two things were incompatible so they are whats the good of beating about the bush laddie my methods are all unprofessional and i break every law of medical etiquette as often as i can think of it you know very well that the british medical association would hold up their hands in horror if it could see what you have seen today but why not conform to professional etiquette because i know better my boy im a doctors son and ive seen too much of it i was born inside the machine and ive seen all the wires all this etiquette is a dodge for keeping the business in the hands of the older men its to hold the young men back and to stop the holes by which they might slip through to the front ive heard my father say so a score of times he had the largest practice in scotland and yet he was absolutely devoid of brains he slipped into it through seniority and decorum no pushing but take your turn very well laddie when youre at the top of the line but how about it when youve just taken your place at the tail when im on the top rung i shall look down and say now you youngsters we are going to have very strict etiquette and i beg that you will come up very quietly and not disarrange me from my comfortable position at the same time if they do what i tell them i shall look upon them as a lot of infernal blockheads eh munro what i could only say again that i thought he took a very low view of the profession and that i disagreed with every word he said well my boy you may disagree as much as you like but if you are going to work with me you must throw etiquette to the devil i cant do that well if you are too clean handed for the job you can clear out we cant keep you here against your will i said nothing but when we got back i went upstairs and packed up my trunk with every intention of going back to yorkshire by the night train he came up to my room and finding what i was at he burst into apologies which would have satisfied a more exacting man than i am you shall do just exactly what you like my dear chap if you dont like my way you may try some way of your own thats fair enough said i but its a little trying to a mans selfrespect if he is told to clear out every time there is a difference of opinion well well there was no harm meant and it shant occur again i cant possibly say more than that so come along down and have a cup of tea and so the matter blew over but i very much fear bertie that this is the first row of a series i have a presentiment that sooner or later my position here will become untenable still i shall give it a fair trial as long as he will let me cullingworth is a fellow who likes to have nothing but inferiors and dependants round him now i like to stand on my own legs and think with my own mind if hell let me do this well get along very well but if i know the man he will claim submission which is more than i am inclined to give he has a right to my gratitude which i freely admit he has found an opening for me when i badly needed one and had no immediate prospects but still one may pay too high a price even for that and i should feel that i was doing so if i had to give up my individuality and my manhood we had an incident that evening which was so characteristic that i must tell you of it cullingworth has an air gun which fires little steel darts with this he makes excellent practice at about twenty feet the length of the back room we were shooting at a mark after dinner when he asked me whether i would hold a halfpenny between my finger and thumb and allow him to shoot it out a halfpenny not being forthcoming he took a bronze medal out of his waistcoat pocket and i held that tip as a mark kling went the air gun and the medal rolled upon the floor plumb in the centre said he on the contrary i answered you never hit it at all never hit it i must have hit it i am confident you didnt wheres the dart then here said i holding up a bleeding forefinger from which the tail end of the fluff with which the dart was winged was protruding i never saw a man so abjectly sorry for anything in my life he used language of selfreproach which would have been extravagant if he had shot off one of my limbs our positions were absurdly reversed and it was he who sat collapsed in a chair while it was i with the dart still in my finger who leaned over him and laughed the matter off mrs cullingworth had run for hot water and presently with a tweezers we got the intruder out there was very little pain more today than yesterday but if ever you are called upon to identify my body you may look for a star at the end of my right forefinger when the surgery was completed cullingworth writhing and groaning all the time my eyes happened to catch the medal which i had dropped lying upon the carpet i lifted it up and looked at it eager to find some topic which would be more agreeable printed upon it was presented to james cullingworth for gallantry in saving life jan hullo cullingworth said i you never told me about this he was off in an instant in his most extravagant style what the medal havent you got one i thought every one had you prefer to be select i suppose it was a little boy youve no idea the trouble i had to get him in get him out you mean my dear chap you dont understand any one could get a child out its getting one in thats the bother one deserves a medal for it then there are the witnesses four shillings a day i had to pay them and a quart of beer in the evenings you see you cant pick up a child and carry it to the edge of a pier and throw it in youd have all sorts of complications with the parents you must be patient and wait until you get a legitimate chance i caught a quinsy walking up and down avonmouth pier before i saw my opportunity he was rather a stolid fat boy and he was sitting on the very edge fishing i got the sole of my foot on to the small of his back and shot him an incredible distance i had some little difficulty in getting him out for his fishing line got twice round my legs but it all ended well and the witnesses were as staunch as possible the boy came up to thank me next day and said that he was quite uninjured save for a bruise on the back his parents always send me a brace of fowls every christmas i was sitting with my finger in the hot water listening to this rigmarole when he had finished he ran off to get his tobacco box and we could hear the bellowing of his laughter dwindling up the stair i was still looking at the medal which from the dents all over it had evidently been often used as a target when i felt a timid touch upon my sleeve it was mrs cullingworth who was looking earnestly at me with a very distressed expression upon her face you believe far too much what james says said she you dont know him in the least mr munro you dont look at a thing from his point of view and you will never understand him until you do it is not of course that he means to say anything that is untrue but his fancy is excited and he is quite carried away by the humour of any idea whether it tells against himself or not it hurts me mr munro to see the only man in the world towards whom he has any feeling of friendship misunderstanding him so completely for very often when you say nothing your face shows very clearly what you think i could only answer lamely that i was very sorry if i had misjudged her husband in any way and that no one had a keener appreciation of some of his qualities than i had i saw how gravely you looked when he told you that absurd story about pushing a little boy into the water she continued and as she spoke she drew from somewhere in the front of her dress a much creased slip of paper just glance at that please dr munro it was a newspaper cutting which gave the true account of the incident suffice it that it was an ice accident and that cullingworth had really behaved in a heroic way and had been drawn out himself insensible with the child so clasped in his arms that it was not until he had recovered his senses that they were able to separate them i had hardly finished reading it when we heard his step on the stairs and she thrusting the paper back into her bosom became in an instant the same silently watchful woman as ever is he not a conundrum if he interests you at a distance and i take for granted that what you say in your letters is not merely conventional compliment you can think how piquant he is in actual life i must confess however that i can never shake off the feeling that i am living with some capricious creature who frequently growls and may possibly bite well it wont be very long before i write again and by that time i shall probably know whether i am likely to find any permanent billet here or not i am so sorry to hear about mrs swanboroughs indisposition you know that i take the deepest interest in everything that affects you they tell me here that i am looking very fit though i think they ought to spell it with an a viii the parade bradfield th april i am writing this my dear bertie at a little table which has been fitted up in the window of my bedroom every one in the house is asleep except myself and all the noise of the city is hushed yet my own brain is singularly active and i feel that i am better employed in sitting up and writing to you than in tossing about upon my bed i am often accused of being sleepy in the daytime but every now and then nature gets level by making me abnormally wakeful at night are you conscious of the restful influence which the stars exert to me they are the most soothing things in nature i am proud to say that i dont know the name of one of them the glamour and romance would pass away from them if they were all classified and ticketed in ones brain but when a man is hot and flurried and full of his own little ruffled dignities and infinitesimal misfortunes then a star bath is the finest thing in the world they are so big and so serene and so lovely they tell me that the interplanetary spaces are full of the debris of shattered asteroids so perhaps even among them there are such things as disease and death yet just to look at them must remind a man of what a bacillus of a thing he is the whole human race like some sprinkling of impalpable powder upon the surface of one of the most insignificant flywheels of a monstrous machine but theres order in it bertie theres order and where there is order there must be mind and where there is mind there must be sense of justice i dont allow that there can be any doubt as to the existence of that central mind or as to the possession by it of certain attributes the stars help me to realise these it is strange when one looks upon them to think that the churches are still squabbling down here over such questions as whether the almighty is most gratified by our emptying a teaspoonful of water over our babies heads or by our waiting a few years and then plunging them bodily into a tank it would be comic if it were not so tragic this train of thought is the afterswell from an argument with cullingworth this evening he holds that the human race is deteriorating mentally and morally he calls out at the grossness which confounds the creator with a young jewish philosopher i tried to show him that this is no proof of degeneration since the jewish philosopher at least represented a moral idea and was therefore on an infinitely higher plane than the sensual divinities of the ancients his own views of the creator seem to me to be a more evident degeneration he declares that looking round at nature he can see nothing but ruthlessness and brutality either the creator is not allpowerful or else he is not allgood says he either he can stop these atrocities and wont in which case he is not allgood or else he would stop them but cant in which case he is not allpowerful it was a difficult dilemma for a man who professes to stick to reason to get out of of course if you plead faith you can always slip out of anything i was forced to get behind a corner of that buckler with which you have so often turned my own thrusts i said that the dilemma arose from our taking it for granted that that which seemed evil really was evil it lies with you to prove that it isnt said he we may hope that it isnt said i wait until some one tells you that you have cancer of the pyloric end of the stomach said he and he shouted it out again every time i tried to renew the argument but in all soberness i really do think bertie that very much which seems to be saddest in life might be very different if we could focus it properly i tried to give you my views about this in the case of drink and immorality but physically i fancy that it applies more obviously than it does morally all the physical evils of life seem to culminate in death and yet death as i have seen it has not been a painful or terrible process in many cases a man dies without having incurred nearly as much pain during the whole of his fatal illness as would have arisen from a whitlow or an abscess of the jaw and it is often those deaths which seem most terrible to the onlooker which are least so to the sufferer when a man is overtaken by an express and shivered into fragments or when he drops from a fourth floor window and is smashed into a bag of splinters the unfortunate spectators are convulsed with horror and find a text for pessimistic views about the providence which allows such things to be and yet it is very doubtful whether the deceased could his tongue be loosened would remember anything at all about the matter we know as students of medicine that though pain is usually associated with cancers and with abdominal complaints still in the various fevers in apoplexy in blood poisonings in lung diseases and in short in the greater proportion of serious maladies there is little suffering i remember how struck i was when first i saw the actual cautery applied in a case of spinal disease the white hot iron was pressed firmly into the patients back without the use of any anaesthetic and what with the sight and the nauseating smell of burned flesh i felt faint and ill yet to my astonishment the patient never flinched nor moved a muscle of his face and on my inquiring afterwards he assured me that the proceeding was absolutely painless a remark which was corroborated by the surgeon the nerves are so completely and instantaneously destroyed he explained that they have no time to convey a painful impression but then if this be so what becomes of all the martyrs at the stake and the victims of red indians and other poor folk over whose sufferings and constancy we have wondered it may be that providence is not only not cruel itself but will not allow man to be cruel either do your worst and it will step in with a no i wont allow this poor child of mine to be hurt and then comes the dulling of the nerve and the lethargy which takes the victim out of the reach of the tormentor david livingstone under the claws of the lion must have looked like an object lesson of the evil side of things and yet he has left it upon record that his own sensations were pleasurable rather than otherwise i am well convinced that if the newlyborn infant and the man who had just died could compare their experiences the former would have proved to be the sufferer it is not for nothing that the first thing the newcomer into this planet does is to open its toothless mouth and protest energetically against fate cullingworth has written a parable which makes a paragraph for our wonderful new weekly paper the little cheese mites held debate he says as to who made the cheese some thought that they had no data to go upon and some that it had come together by a solidification of vapour or by the centrifugal attraction of atoms a few surmised that the platter might have something to do with it but the wisest of them could not deduce the existence of a cow we are at one he and i in thinking that the infinite is beyond our perception we differ only in that he sees evil and i see good in the working of the universe ah what a mystery it all is let us be honest and humble and think kindly of each other theres a line of stars all winking at me over the opposite roof winking slyly at the silly little person with the pen and paper who is so earnest about what he can never understand well now ill come back to something practical it is nearly a month since i wrote to you last the date is impressed upon my memory because it was the day after cullingworth shot the airdart into my finger the place festered and prevented my writing to any one for a week or two but it is all right again now i have ever so much of different sorts to tell you but really when i come to think of it it does not amount to very much after all first of all about the practice i told you that i was to have a room immediately opposite to cullingworths and that all the surgical cases were to be turned over to me for a few days i had nothing to do except to listen to him romping and scuffling with his patients or making speeches to them from the top of the stairs however a great dr stark munro surgeon has been affixed to the side of the door downstairs opposite cullingworths plate and a proud man was i when first my eyes lit upon it on the fourth day however in came a case he little knew that he was the first that i had ever had all to myself in my life perhaps he would not have looked quite so cheerful if he had realised it poor chap he had little enough to be cheery over either he was an old soldier who had lost a good many teeth but who had continued to find room between his nose and chin for a short black clay pipe lately there appeared a small sore on his nose which had spread and become crusted on feeling it i found it as hard as a streak of glue with constant darting pains passing through it of course there could be no question as to diagnosis it was epitheliomatous cancer caused by the irritation of the hot tobacco smoke i sent him back to his village and two days after i drove over in cullingworths dogcart and removed the growth i only got a sovereign for it but it may be a nucleus for cases the old fellow did most admirably and he has just been in with a most aristocratic curl to his nostrils to tell me that he has bought a box full of churchwardens it was my first operation and i daresay i was more nervous about it than my patient but the result has given me confidence i have fully made up my mind to let nothing pass me come what may i am prepared to do it why should a man wait of course i know that many men do but surely ones nerve is more likely to be strong and ones knowledge fresh now than in twenty years cases came dribbling in from day to day all very poor people and able to pay very poor fees but still most welcome to me the first week i took including that operation fee one pound seventeen and sixpence the second i got two pounds exactly the third i had two pounds five and now i find that this last week has brought in two pounds eighteen so i am moving in the right direction of course it compares absurdly enough with cullingworths twenty pound a day and my little quiet backwater seems a strange contrast to the noisy stream which pours for ever through his room still i am quite satisfied and i have no doubt at all that his original estimate of three hundred pounds for the first year will be amply justified it would be a pleasant thing to think that if anything were really to happen at home i should be able to be of some use to them if things go on as they have begun i shall soon have my feet firmly planted i was compelled by the way to forego an opening which a few months ago would have been the very summit of my ambition you must know possibly i told you that immediately after i passed i put my name down as a candidate for a surgeonship on the books of several of the big steamship lines it was done as a forlorn hope for a man has usually to wait several years before his turn comes round well just a week after i started here i got a telegram one night from liverpool join the decia tomorrow as surgeon not later than eight in the evening it was from staunton merivale the famous south american firm and the decia is a fine ton passenger boat doing the round journey by bahia and buenos ayres to rio and valparaiso i had a bad quarter of an hour i can tell you i dont think i was ever so undecided about anything in my life cullingworth was dead against my going and his influence carried the day my dear chap said he youd knock down the chief mate and hed spread you out with a handspike youd get tied by your thumbs to the rigging youd be fed on stinking water and putrid biscuits ive been reading a novel about the merchant service and i know when i laughed at his ideas of modern seagoing he tried another line youre a bigger fool than i take you for if you go said he why what can it lead to all the money you earn goes to buy a blue coat and daub it with lace you think youre bound for valparaiso and you find yourself at the poorhouse youve got a rare opening here and everything ready to your hand youll never get such another again and so it ended by my letting them have a wire to say that i could not come it is strange when you come to a point where the road of your life obviously divides and you take one turning or the other after vainly trying to be sure about the fingerpost i think after all i chose rightly a ships surgeon must remain a ships surgeon while here there is no horizon to my possibilities as to old cullingworth he is booming along as merrily as ever you say in your last that what you cannot understand is how he got his hold of the public in so short a time that is just the point which i have found it hard to get light upon he told me that after his first coming he had not a patient for a month and that he was so disheartened that he very nearly made a moonlight exodus at last however a few cases came his way and he made such extraordinary cures of them or else impressed them so by his eccentricity that they would do nothing but talk of him some of his wonderful results got into the local press though after my avonmouth experience i should not like to guarantee that he did not himself convey them there he showed me an almanac which had a great circulation in the district it had an entry sandwiched in this way aug reform bill passed aug birth of julius caesar aug extraordinary cure by dr cullingworth of a case of dropsy in bradfield aug battle of gravelotte it reads as if it were one of the landmarks of the latter half of the century i asked him how on earth it got there but i could only learn that the woman was fiftysix inches round the waist and that he had treated her with elaterium that leads me to another point you ask me whether his cures are really remarkable and if so what his system is i answer unhesitatingly that his cures are very remarkable indeed and that i look upon him as a sort of napoleon of medicine his view is that the pharmacopaeal doses are in nearly every instance much too low excessive timidity has cut down the dose until it has ceased to produce a real effect upon the disease medical men according to his view have been afraid of producing a poisonous effect with their drugs with him on the contrary the whole art of medicine lies in judicious poisoning and when the case is serious his remedies are heroic where in epilepsy i should have given thirtygrain doses of bromide or chloral every four hours he would give two drachms every three no doubt it will seem to you very killorcure and i am myself afraid that a succession of coroners inquests may check cullingworths career but hitherto he has had no public scandal while the cases which he has brought back to life have been numerous he is the most fearless fellow i have seen him pour opium into a dysenteric patient until my hair bristled but either his knowledge or his luck always brings him out right then there are other cures which depend i think upon his own personal magnetism he is so robust and loudvoiced and hearty that a weak nervous patient goes away from him recharged with vitality he is so perfectly confident that he can cure them that he makes them perfectly confident that they can be cured and you know how in nervous cases the mind reacts upon the body if he chose to preserve crutches and sticks as they do in the mediaeval churches he might i am sure paper his consulting room with them a favourite device of his with an impressionable patient is to name the exact hour of their cure my dear he will say swaying some girl about by the shoulders with his nose about three inches from hers youll feel better tomorrow at a quarter to ten and at twenty past youll be as well as ever you were in your life now keep your eye on the clock and see if i am not right next day as likely as not her mother will be in weeping tears of joy and another miracle has been added to cullingworths record it may smell of quackery but it is exceedingly useful to the patient still i must confess that there is nothing about cullingworth which jars me so much as the low view which he takes of our profession i can never reconcile myself to his ideas and yet i can never convert him to mine so there will be a chasm there which sooner or later may open to divide us altogether he will not acknowledge any philanthropic side to the question a profession in his view is a means of earning a livelihood and the doing good to our fellow mortals is quite a secondary one why the devil should we do all the good munro he shouts eh what a butcher would do good to the race would he not if he served his chops out gratis through the window hed be a real benefactor but he goes on selling them at a shilling the pound for all that take the case of a doctor who devotes himself to sanitary science he flushes out drains and keeps down infection you call him a philanthropist well i call him a traitor thats it munro a traitor and a renegade did you ever hear of a congress of lawyers for simplifying the law and discouraging litigation what are the medical association and the general council and all these bodies for eh laddie for encouraging the best interests of the profession do you suppose they do that by making the population healthy its about time we had a mutiny among the general practitioners if i had the use of half the funds which the association has i should spend part of them in drainblocking and the rest in the cultivation of disease germs and the contamination of drinking water of course i told him that his views were diabolical but especially since that warning which i had from his wife i discount everything that he says he begins in earnest but as he goes on the humour of exaggeration gets hold of him and he winds up with things which he would never uphold in cold blood however the fact remains that we differ widely in our views of professional life and i fear that we may come to grief over the question what do you think we have been doing lately building a stable no less cullingworth wanted to have another one at the business place as much i think for his patients as his horses and in his audacious way he determined that he would build it himself so at it we went he i the coachman mrs cullingworth and the coachmans wife we dug foundations got bricks in by the cartload made our own mortar and i think that we shall end by making a very fair job of it its not quite as flatchested as we could wish and i think that if i were a horse inside it i should be careful about brushing against the walls but still it will keep the wind and rain out when it is finished cullingworth talks of our building a new house for ourselves but as we have three large ones already there does not seem to be any pressing need talking about horses we had no end of a fuss here the other day cullingworth got it into his head that he wanted a firstclass riding horse and as neither of the carriage ones would satisfy him he commissioned a horse dealer to get him one the man told us of a charger which one of the officers in the garrison was trying to get rid of he did not conceal the fact that the reason why he wished to sell it was because he considered it to be dangerous but he added that captain lucas had given l for it and was prepared to sell it at seventy this excited cullingworth and he ordered the creature to be saddled and brought round it was a beautiful animal coal black with a magnificent neck and shoulders but with a nasty backward tilt to its ears and an unpleasant way of looking at you the horse dealer said that our yard was too small to try the creature in but cullingworth clambered up upon its back and formally took possession of it by lamming it between the ears with the bone handle of his whip then ensued one of the most lively ten minutes that i can remember the beast justified his reputation but cullingworth although he was no horseman stuck to him like a limpet backwards forwards sideways on his fore feet on his hind feet with his back curved with his back sunk bucking and kicking there was nothing the creature did not try cullingworth was sitting alternately on his mane and on the root of his tail never by any chance in the saddle he had lost both stirrups and his knees were drawn up and his heels dug into the creatures ribs while his hands clawed at mane saddle or ears whichever he saw in front of him he kept his whip however and whenever the brute eased down cullingworth lammed him once more with the bone handle his idea i suppose was to break its spirit but he had taken a larger contract than he could carry through the animal bunched his four feet together ducked down his head arched his back like a yawning cat and gave three convulsive springs into the air at the first cullingworths knees were above the saddle flaps at the second his ankles were retaining a convulsive grip at the third he flew forward like a stone out of a sling narrowly missed the coping of the wall broke with his head the iron bar which held some wire netting and toppled back with a thud into the yard up he bounded with the blood streaming down his face and running into our halffinished stables he seized a hatchet and with a bellow of rage rushed at the horse i caught him by the coat and put on a fourteenstone drag while the horse dealer who was as white as a cheese ran off with his horse into the street cullingworth broke away from my grip and cursing incoherently his face slobbered with blood and his hatchet waving over his head he rushed out of the yard the most diabolical looking ruffian you can imagine however luckily for the dealer he had got a good start and cullingworth was persuaded to come back and wash his face we bound up his cut and found him little the worse except in his temper but for me he would most certainly have paid seventy pounds for his insane outburst of rage against the animal i daresay you think it strange that i should write so much about this fellow and so little about anybody else but the fact is that i know nobody else and that my whole circle is bounded by my patients cullingworth and his wife they visit nobody and nobody visits them my living with them brings the same taboo from my brother doctors upon my head although i have never done anything unprofessional myself who should i see in the street the other day but the mcfarlanes whom you will remember at linlithgow i was foolish enough to propose to maimie mcfarlane once and she was sensible enough to refuse me what i should have done had she accepted me i cant imagine for that was three years ago and i have more ties and less prospect of marriage now than then well theres no use yearning for what you cant have and theres no other man living to whom i would speak about the matter at all but life is a deadly lonely thing when a man has no one on his side but himself why is it that i am sitting here in the moonlight writing to you except that i am craving for sympathy and fellowship i get it from you too as much as one friend ever got from another and yet there are some sides to my nature with which neither wife nor friend nor any one else can share if you cut your own path you must expect to find yourself alone upon it heigh ho its nearly dawn and i as wakeful as ever it is chilly and i have draped a blanket round me ive heard that this is the favourite hour of the suicide and i see that ive been tailing off in the direction of melancholy myself let me wind up on a lighter chord by quoting cullingworths latest article i must tell you that he is still inflamed by the idea of his own paper and his brain is in full eruption sending out a perpetual stream of libellous paragraphs doggerel poems social skits parodies and articles he brings them all to me and my table is already piled with them here is his latest brought up to my room after he had undressed it was the outcome of some remarks i had made about the difficulty which our faroff descendants may have in determining what the meaning is of some of the commonest objects of our civilisation and as a corollary how careful we should be before we become dogmatic about the old romans or egyptians at the third annual meeting of the new guinea archaeological society a paper was read upon recent researches on the supposed site of london together with some observations upon hollow cylinders in use among the ancient londoners several examples of these metallic cylinders or tubings were on exhibition in the hall and were passed round for inspection among the audience the learned lecturer prefaced his remarks by observing that on account of the enormous interval of time which separated them from the days when london was a flourishing city it behoved them to be very guarded in any conclusions to which they might come as to the habits of the inhabitants recent research appeared to have satisfactorily established the fact that the date of the final fall of london was somewhat later than that of the erection of the egyptian pyramids a large building had recently been unearthed near the driedup bed of the river thames and there could be no question from existing records that this was the seat of the lawmaking council among the ancient britons or anglicans as they were sometimes called the lecturer proceeded to point out that the bed of the thames had been tunnelled under by a monarch named brunel who is supposed by some authorities to have succeeded alfred the great the open spaces of london he went on to remark must have been far from safe as the bones of lions tigers and other extinct forms of carnivora had been discovered in the regents park having briefly referred to the mysterious structures known as pillarboxes which are scattered thickly over the city and which are either religious in their origin or else may be taken as marking the tombs of anglican chiefs the lecturer passed on to the cylindrical piping this had been explained by the patagonian school as being a universal system of lightningconductors he the lecturer could not assent to this theory in a series of observations extending over several months he had discovered the important fact that these lines of tubing if followed out invariably led to large hollow metallic reservoirs which were connected with furnaces no one who knew how addicted the ancient britons were to the use of tobacco could doubt what this meant evidently large quantities of the herb were burned in the central chamber and the aromatic and narcotic vapour was carried through the tubes to the house of every citizen so that he might inhale it at will having illustrated his remarks by a series of diagrams the lecturer concluded by saying that although true science was invariably cautious and undogmatic it was none the less an incontestable fact that so much light had been thrown upon old london that every action of the citizens daily life was known from the taking of a tub in the morning until after a draught of porter he painted himself blue before retiring to rest after all i daresay this explanation of the london gas pipes is not more absurd than some of our shots about the pyramids or ideas of life among the babylonians well goodbye old chap this is a stupid inconsequential letter but life has been more quiet and less interesting just of late i may have something a little more moving for my next ix the parade bradfield rd april i have some recollection my dear bertie that when i wrote you a rambling disconnected sort of letter about three weeks ago i wound up by saying that i might have something more interesting to tell you next time well so it has turned out the whole game is up here and i am off upon a fresh line of rails altogether cullingworth is to go one way and i another and yet i am glad to say that there has not been any quarrel between us as usual i have begun my letter at the end but ill work up to it more deliberately now and let you know exactly how it came about and first of all a thousand thanks for your two long letters which lie before me as i write there is little enough personal news in them but i can quite understand that the quiet happy routine of your life reels off very smoothly from week to week on the other hand you give me plenty of proof of that inner life which is to me so very much more interesting after all we may very well agree to differ you think some things are proved which i dont believe in you think some things edifying which do not appear to me to be so well i know that you are perfectly honest in your belief i am sure you give me credit for being the same the future wilt decide which of us is right the survival of the truest is a constant law i fancy though it must be acknowledged that it is very slow in action you make a mistake however in assuming that those who think as i do are such a miserable minority the whole essence of our thought is independence and individual judgment so that we dont get welded into single bodies as the churches do and have no opportunity of testing our own strength there are no doubt all shades of opinion among us but if you merely include those who in their private hearts disbelieve the doctrines usually accepted and think that sectarian churches tend to evil rather than good i fancy that the figures would be rather surprising when i read your letter i made a list of all those men with whom i ever had intimate talk upon such matters i got seventeen names with four orthodox cullingworth tried and got twelve names with one orthodox from all sides one hears that every church complains of the absence of men in the congregations the women predominate three to one is it that women are more earnest than men i think it is quite the other way but the men are following their reason and the women their emotion it is the women only who keep orthodoxy alive no you mustnt be too sure of that majority of yours taking the scientific the medical the professional classes i question whether it exists at all the clergy busy in their own limited circles and coming in contact only with those who agree with them have not realised how largely the rising generation has outgrown them and with exceptions like yourself it is not the most lax but the best of the younger men the largerbrained and the largerhearted who have shaken themselves most clear of the old theology they cannot abide its want of charity its limitations of gods favours its claims for a special providence its dogmatism about what seems to be false its conflict with what we know to be true we know that man has ascended not descended so what is the value of a scheme of thought which depends upon the supposition of his fall we know that the world was not made in six days that the sun could never be stopped since it was never moving and that no man ever lived three days in a fish so what becomes of the inspiration of a book which contains such statements truth though it crush me there now you see what comes of waving the red rag let me make a concession to appease you i do believe that christianity in its different forms has been the very best thing for the world during all this long barbarous epoch of course it has been the best thing else providence would not have permitted it the engineer knows best what tools to use in strengthening his own machine but when you say that this is the best and last tool which will be used you are laying down the law a little too much now first of all i want to tell you about how the practice has been going on the week after i wrote last showed a slight relapse i only took two pounds but on the next i took a sudden jump up to three pounds seven shillings and this last week i took three pounds ten so it was steadily creeping up and i really thought that i saw my road clear in front of me when the bolt suddenly fell from the blue there were reasons however which prevented my being very disappointed when it did come down and these i must make clear to you i think that i mentioned when i gave you a short sketch of my dear old mother that she has a very high standard of family honour she really tries to live up to the percyplantagenet blend which is said to flow in our veins and it is only our empty pockets which prevent her from sailing through life like the grande dame that she is throwing largesse to right and left with her head in the air and her soul in the clouds i have often heard her say and i am quite convinced that she meant it that she would far rather see any one of us in our graves than know that we had committed a dishonourable action yes for all her softness and femininity she could freeze ironhard at the suspicion of baseness and i have seen the blood flush from her white cap to her lace collar when she has heard of an act of meanness well she had heard some details about the cullingworths which displeased her when i first knew them then came the smashup at avonmouth and my mother liked them less and less she was averse to my joining them in bradfield and it was only by my sudden movement at the end that i escaped a regular prohibition when i got there the very first question she asked when i told her of their prosperity was whether they had paid their avonmouth creditors i was compelled to answer that they had not in reply she wrote imploring me to come away and saying that poor as our family was none of them had ever fallen so low as to enter into a business partnership with a man of unscrupulous character and doubtful antecedents i answered that cullingworth spoke sometimes of paying his creditors that mrs cullingworth was in favour of it also and that it seemed to me to be unreasonable to expect that i should sacrifice a good opening on account of things with which i had no connection i assured her that if cullingworth did anything from then onwards which seemed to me dishonourable i would disassociate myself from him and i mentioned that i had already refused to adopt some of his professional methods well in reply to this my mother wrote a pretty violent letter about what she thought of cullingworth which led to another from me defending him and showing that there were some deep and noble traits in his character that produced another still more outspoken letter from her and so the correspondence went on she attacking and i defending until a serious breach seemed to be opening between us i refrained from writing at last not out of ill temper but because i thought that if she were given time she would cool down and take perhaps a more reasonable view of the situation my father from the short note which he sent me seemed to think the whole business absolutely irregular and to refuse to believe my accounts of cullingworths practice and receipts this double opposition from the very people whose interests had really been nearest my heart in the whole affair caused me to be less disappointed than i should otherwise have been when it all came to an end in fact i was quite in the humour to finish it myself when fate did it for me now about the cullingworths madam is as amiable as ever and yet somehow unless i am deceiving myself she has changed somewhat of late in her feelings towards me i have turned upon her suddenly more than once and caught the skirt of a glance which was little less than malignant in one or two small matters i have also detected a hardness in her which i had never observed before is it that i have intruded too much into their family life have i come between the husband and the wife goodness knows i have striven with all my little stock of tact to avoid doing so and yet i have often felt that my position was a false one perhaps a young man attaches too much importance to a womans glances and gestures he wishes to assign a definite meaning to each when they may be only the passing caprice of the moment ah well i have nothing to blame myself with and in any case it will soon be all over now and then i have seen something of the same sort in cullingworth but he is so strange a being that i never attach much importance to his variations he glares at me like an angry bull occasionally and then when i ask him what is the matter he growls out oh nothing and turns on his heel then at other times he is so cordial and friendly that he almost overdoes it and i find myself wondering whether he is not acting it must seem ungracious to you that i should speak so of a man who has been my benefactor and it seems so to me also but still that is the impression which he leaves upon me sometimes its an absurd idea too for what possible object could his wife and he have in pretending to be amiable if they did not really feel so and yet you know the feeling that you get when a man smiles with his lips and not with his eyes one day we went to the central hotel billiardroom in the evening to play a match our form is just about the same and we should have bad an enjoyable game if it had not been for that queer temper of his he had been in a sullen humour the whole day pretending not to hear what i said to him or else giving snappy answers and looking like a thundercloud i was determined not to have a row so i took no notice at all of his continual provocations which instead of pacifying him seemed to encourage him to become more offensive at the end of the match wanting two to win i put down the white which was in the jaws of the pocket he cried out that this was bad form i contended that it was folly to refrain from doing it when one was only two off game and on his continuing to make remarks i appealed to the marker who took the same view as i did this opposition only increased his anger and he suddenly broke out into most violent language abusing me in unmeasured terms i said to him if you have anything to say to me cullingworth come out into the street and say it there its a caddish thing to speak like that before the marker he lifted his cue and i thought he was going to strike me with it but he flung it clattering on the floor and chucked half a crown to the man when we got out in the street he began at once in as offensive a tone as ever thats enough cullingworth i said ive stood already rather more than i can carry we were in the bright light of a shop window at that moment he looked at me and looked a second time uncertain what to do at any moment i might have found myself in a desperate street row with a man who was my medical partner i gave no provocation but kept myself keenly on the alert suddenly to my relief he burst out laughing such a roar as made the people stop on the other side of the road and passing his arm through mine he hurried me down the street devil of a temper youve got munro said he by crums its hardly safe to go out with you i never know what youre going to do next eh what you mustnt be peppery with me though for i mean well towards you as youll see before you get finished with me i have told you this trivial little scene bertie to show the strange way in which cullingworth springs quarrels upon me suddenly without the slightest possible provocation taking a most offensive tone and then when he sees he has goaded me to the edge of my endurance turning the whole thing to chaff this has occurred again and again recently and when coupled with the change in mrs cullingworths demeanour makes one feel that something has happened to change ones relations what that something may be i give you my word that i have no more idea than you have between their coldness however and my unpleasant correspondence with my mother i was often very sorry that i had not taken the south american liner cullingworth is preparing for the issue of our new paper he has carried the matter through with his usual energy but he doesnt know enough about local affairs to be able to write about them and it is a question whether he can interest the people here in anything else at present we are prepared to run the paper singlehanded we are working seven hours a day at the practice we are building a stable and in our odd hours we are practising at our magnetic shipprotector with which cullingworth is still well pleased though he wants to get it more perfect before submitting it to the admiralty his mind runs rather on naval architecture at present and he has been devising an ingenious method of preventing woodensided vessels from being crippled by artillery fire i did not think much of his magnetic attractor because it seemed to me that even if it had all the success that he claimed for it it would merely have the effect of substituting some other metal for steel in the manufacture of shells this new project has however more to recommend it this is the idea as put in his own words and as he has been speaking of little else for the last two days i ought to remember them if youve got your armour there laddie it will be pierced says he put up forty feet thick of steel and ill build a gun that will knock it into tooth powder it would blow away and set the folk coughing after i had one shot at it but you cant pierce armour which only drops after the shot has passed through whats the good of it why it keeps out the water thats the main thing after all i call it the cullingworth springshutter screen eh what munro i wouldnt take a quarter of a million for the idea you see how it would work spring shutters are furled all along the top of the bulwarks where the hammocks used to be they are in sections three feet broad we will say and capable when let down of reaching the keel very well enemy sends a shot through section a of the side section a shutter is lowered only a thin film you see but enough to form a temporary plug enemys ram knocks in sections b c d of the side what do you do founder not a bit you lower sections b c and d of cullingworths springshutter screen or you knock a hole on a rock the same thing again its a ludicrous sight to see a big ship founder when so simple a precaution would absolutely save her and its equally good for ironclads also a shot often starts their plates and admits water without breaking them down go your shutters and all is well thats his idea and he is busy on a model made out of the steels of his wifes stays it sounds plausible but he has the knack of making anything plausible when he is allowed to slap his hands and bellow we are both writing novels but i fear that the results dont bear out his theory that a man may do anything which he sets his will to i thought mine was not so bad i have done nine chapters but cullingworth says he has read it all before and that it is much too conventional we must rivet the attention of the public from the start he says certainly his own is calculated to do so for it seems to me to be wild rubbish the end of his first chapter is the only tolerable point that he has made a fraudulent old baronet is running racehorses on the cross his son who is just coming of age is an innocent youth the news of the great race of the year has just been received sir robert tottered into the room with dry lips and a ghastly face my poor boy he cried prepare for the worst our horse has lost cried the young heir springing from his chair the old man threw himself in agony upon the rug no no he screamed it has won most of it however is poor stuff and we are each agreed that the other was never meant for a novelist so much for our domestic proceedings and all these little details which you say you like to hear of now i must tell you of the great big change in my affairs and how it came about i have told you about the strange sulky behaviour of cullingworth which has been deepening from day to day well it seemed to reach a climax this morning and on our way to the rooms i could hardly get a word out of him the place was fairly crowded with patients but my own share was rather below the average when i had finished i added a chapter to my novel and waited until he and his wife were ready for the daily bagcarrying homewards it was halfpast three before he had done i heard him stamp out into the passage and a moment later he came banging into my room i saw in an instant that some sort of a crisis had come munro he cried this practice is going to the devil ah said i hows that its going to little pieces munro ive been taking figures and i know what i am talking about a month ago i was seeing six hundred a week then i dropped to five hundred and eighty then to five seventyfive and now to fivesixty what do you think of that to be honest i dont think much of it i answered the summer is coming on you are losing all your coughs and colds and sore throats every practice must dwindle at this time of year thats all very well said he pacing up and down the room with his hands thrust into his pockets and his great shaggy eyebrows knotted together you may put it down to that but i think quite differently about it what do you put it down to then to you hows that i asked well said he you must allow that it is a very queer coincidence if it is a coincidence that from the day when your plate was put up my practice has taken a turn for the worse i should be very sorry to think it was cause and effect i answered how do you think that my presence could have hurt you ill tell you frankly old chap said he putting on suddenly that sort of forced smile which always seems to me to have a touch of a sneer in it you see many of my patients are simple country folk half imbecile for the most part but then the halfcrown of an imbecile is as good as any other halfcrown they come to my door and they see two names and their silly jaws begin to drop and they say to each other theres two of em here its dr cullingworth we want to see but if we go in well be shown as likely as not to dr munro so it ends in some cases in their not coming at all then there are the women women dont care a toss whether you are a solomon or whether you are hot from an asylum its all personal with them you fetch them or you dont fetch them i know how to work them but they wont come if they think they are going to be turned over to anybody else thats what i put the falling away down to well said i thats easily set right i marched out of the room and downstairs with both cullingworth and his wife behind me into the yard i went and picking up a big hammer i started for the front door with the pair still at my heels i got the forked end of the hammer under my plate and with a good wrench i brought the whole thing clattering on to the pavement that wont interfere with you any more said i what do you intend to do now he asked oh i shall find plenty to do dont you worry about that i answered oh but this is all rot said he picking up the plate come along upstairs and let us see where we stand we filed off once more he leading with the huge brass dr munro under his arm then the little woman and then this rather perturbed and bemuddled young man he and his wife sat on the deal table in the consulting room like a hawk and a turtledove on the same perch while i leaned against the mantelpiece with my hands in my pockets nothing could be more prosaic and informal but i knew very well that i was at a crisis of my life before it was only a choosing between two roads now my main track had run suddenly to nothing and i must go back or find a byepath its this way cullingworth said i i am very much obliged to you and to you mrs cullingworth for all your kindness and good wishes but i did not come here to spoil your practice and after what you have told me it is quite impossible for me to work with you any more well my boy said he i am inclined myself to think that we should do better apart and thats hettys idea also only she is too polite to say so it is a time for plain speaking i answered it and we may as well thoroughly understand each other if i have done your practice any harm i assure you that i am heartily sorry and i shall do all i can to repair it i cannot say more what are you going to do then asked cullingworth i shall either go to sea or else start a practice on my own account but you have no money neither had you when you started ah that was different still it may be that you are right youll find it a stiff pull at first oh i am quite prepared for that well you know munro i feel that i am responsible to you to some extent since i persuaded you not to take that ship the other day it was a pity but it cant be helped we must do what we can to make up now i tell you what i am prepared to do i was talking about it with hetty this morning and she thought as i did if we were to allow you one pound a week until you got your legs under you it would encourage you to start for yourself and you could pay it back as soon as you were able it is very kind of you said i if you would let the matter stand just now i should like just to take a short walk by myself and to think it all over so the cullingworths did their bagprocession through the doctors quarter alone today and i walked to the park where i sat down on one of the seats lit a cigar and thought the whole matter over i was down on my luck at first but the balmy air and the smell of spring and the budding flowers soon set me right again i began my last letter among the stars and i am inclined to finish this one among the flowers for they are rare companions when ones mind is troubled most things on this earth from a womans beauty to the taste of a nectarine seem to be the various baits with which nature lures her silly gudgeons they shall eat they shall propagate and for the sake of pleasing themselves they shall hurry down the road which has been laid out for them but there lurks no bribe in the smell and beauty of the flower its charm has no ulterior motive well i sat down there and brooded in my heart i did not believe that cullingworth had taken alarm at so trifling a decrease that could not have been his real reason for driving me from the practice he had found me in the way in his domestic life no doubt and he had devised this excuse for getting rid of me whatever the reason was it was sufficiently plain that all my hopes of building up a surgical practice which should keep parallel with his medical one were for ever at an end on the whole bearing in mind my mothers opposition and the continual janglings which we had had during the last few weeks i was not very sorry on the contrary a sudden curious little thrill of happiness took me somewhere about the back of the midriff and as a drift of rooks passed cawing over my head i began cawing also in the overflow of my spirits and then as i walked back i considered how far i could avail myself of this money from cullingworth it was not much but it would be madness to start without it for i had sent home the little which i had saved at hortons i had not more than six pounds in the whole world i reflected that the money could make no difference to cullingworth with his large income while it made a vast one to me i should repay him in a year or two at the latest perhaps i might get on so well as to be able to dispense with it almost at once there could be no doubt that it was the representations of cullingworth as to my future prospects in bradfield which had made me refuse the excellent appointment in the decia i need not therefore have any scruples at accepting some temporary assistance from his hands on my return i told him that i had decided to do so and thanked him at the same time for his generosity thats all right said he hetty my dear get a bottle of fez in and we shall drink success to munros new venture it seemed only the other day that he had been drinking my entrance into partnership and here we were the same three sipping good luck to my exit from it im afraid our second ceremony was on both sides the heartier of the two i must decide now where i am to start i remarked what i want is some nice little town where all the people are rich and ill i suppose you wouldnt care to settle here in bradfield asked cullingworth well i cannot see much point in that if i harmed you as a partner i might do so more as a rival if i succeeded it might be at your expense well said he choose your town and my offer still holds good we hunted out an atlas and laid the map of england before us on the table cities and villages lay beneath me as thick as freckles and yet there was nothing to lead me to choose one rather than another i think it should be some place large enough to give you plenty of room for expansion said he not too near london added mrs cullingworth and above all a place where i know nobody said i i can rough it by myself but i cant keep up appearances before visitors what do you say to stockwell said cullingworth putting the amber of his pipe upon a town within thirty miles of bradfield i had hardly heard of the place but i raised my glass well heres to stockwell i cried i shall go there tomorrow morning and prospect we all drank the toast as you will do at lowell when you read this and so it is arranged and you may rely upon it that i shall give you a full and particular account of the result x cadogan terrace birchespool i st may my dear old chap things have been happening and i must tell you all about it sympathy is a strange thing for though i never see you the mere fact that you over there in new england are keenly interested in what i am doing and thinking makes my own life in old england very much more interesting to me the thought of you is like a good staff in my right hand the unexpected has happened so continually in my life that it has ceased to deserve the name you remember that in my last i had received my dismissal and was on the eve of starting for the little country town of stockwell to see if there were any sign of a possible practice there well in the morning before i came down to breakfast i was putting one or two things into a bag when there came a timid knock at my door and there was mrs cullingworth in her dressingjacket with her hair down her back would you mind coming down and seeing james dr munro said she he has been very strange all night and i am afraid that he is ill down i went and found cullingworth looking rather red in the face and a trifle wild about the eyes he was sitting up in bed with the neck of his nightgown open and an acute angle of hairy chest exposed he had a sheet of paper a pencil and a clinical thermometer upon the coverlet in front of him deuced interesting thing munro said he come and look at this temperature chart ive been taking it every quarter of an hour since i couldnt sleep and its up and down till it looks like the mountains in the geography books well have some drugs in eh what munro and by crums well revolutionise all their ideas about fevers ill write a pamphlet from personal experiment that will make all their books clean out of date and theyll have to tear them up and wrap sandwiches in them he was talking in the rapid slurring way of a man who has trouble coming i looked at his chart and saw that he was over degrees his pulse rubadubbed under my fingers and his skin sent a glow into my hand any symptoms i asked sitting down on the side of his bed tongue like a nutmeggrater said he thrusting it out frontal headache renal pains no appetite and a mouse nibbling inside my left elbow thats as far as weve got at present ill tell you what it is cullingworth said i you have a touch of rheumatic fever and you will have to lie by for a bit lie by be hanged he cried ive got a hundred people to see today my boy i must be down there if i have the rattle in my throat i didnt build up a practice to have it ruined by a few ounces of lactic acid james dear you can easily build up another one said his wife in her cooing voice you must do what dr munro tells you well said i youll want looking after and your practice will want looking after and i am quite ready to do both but i wont take the responsibility unless you give me your word that you will do what you are told if im to have any doctoring it must come from you laddie he said for if i was to turn my toes up in the public square theres not a man here who would do more than sign my certificate by crums they might get the salts and oxalic acid mixed up if they came to treat me for theres no love lost between us but i want to go down to the practice all the same its out of the question you know the sequel of this complaint youll have endocarditis embolism thrombosis metastatic abscesses you know the danger as well as i do he sank back into his bed laughing i take my complaints one at a time thank you said he i wouldnt be so greedy as to have all those eh munro what when many another poor devil hasnt got an ache to his back the four posts of his bed quivered with his laughter do what you like laddie but i say mind if anything should happen no tomfoolery over my grave if you put so much as a stone there by crums munro ill come back in the dead of the night and plant it on the pit of your stomach nearly three weeks passed before he could set his foot to the ground again he wasnt such a bad patient after all but he rather complicated my treatment by getting in all sorts of phials and powders and trying experiments upon his own symptoms it was impossible to keep him quiet and our only means of retaining him in bed was to allow him all the work that he could do there he wrote copiously built up models of his patent screen and banged off pistols at his magnetic target which he had rigged tip on the mantelpiece nature has given him a constitution of steel however and he shook off his malady more quickly and more thoroughly than the most docile of sufferers in the meantime mrs cullingworth and i ran the practice together as a substitute for him i was a dreadful failure they would not believe in me in the least i felt that i was as flat as water after champagne i could not address them from the stairs nor push them about nor prophesy to the anaeemic women i was much too solemn and demure after what they had been accustomed to however i held the thing together as best i could and i dont think that he found the practice much the worse when he was able to take it over i could not descend to what i thought was unprofessional but i did my very best to keep the wheels turning well i know that i am a shocking bad storyteller but i just try to get things as near the truth as i can manage it if i only knew how to colour it up i could make some of this better reading i can get along when i am on one line but it is when i have to bring in a second line of events that i understand what c means when he says that i will never be able to keep myself in nibs by what i earn in literature the second line is this that i had written to my mother on the same night that i wrote to you last telling her that there need no longer be a shadow of a disagreement between us because everything was arranged and i was going to leave cullingworth at once then within a couple of posts i had to write again and announce that my departure was indefinitely postponed and that i was actually doing his whole practice well the dear old lady was very angry i dont suppose she quite understood how temporary the necessity was and how impossible it would have been to leave cullingworth in the lurch she was silent for nearly three weeks and then she wrote a very stinging letter and she handles her adjectives most deftly when she likes she went so far as to say that cullingworth was a bankrupt swindler and that i had dragged the family honour in the dirt by my prolonged association with him this letter came on the morning of the very last day that my patient was confined to the house when i returned from work i found him sitting in his dressinggown downstairs his wife who had driven home was beside him to my surprise when i congratulated him on being fit for work again his manner which had been most genial during his illness was as ungracious as before our last explanation his wife too seemed to avoid my eye and cocked her chin at me when she spoke yes ill take it over tomorrow said he what do i owe you for looking after it oh it was all in the days work said i thank you i had rather have strict business he answered you know where you are then but a favour is a thing with no end to it what dyou put it at i never thought about it in that light well think about it now a locum would have cost me four guineas a week four fours sixteen make it twenty well i promised to allow you a pound a week and you were to pay it back ill put twenty pounds to your credit account and youll have it every week as sure as saturday thank you said i if you are so anxious to make a business matter of it you can arrange it so i could not make out and cannot make out now what had happened to freeze them up so but i supposed that they had been talking it over and came to the conclusion that i was settling down too much upon the old lines and that they must remind me that i was under orders to quit they might have done it with more tact to cut a long story short on the very day that cullingworth was able to resume his work i started off for stockwell taking with me only a bag for it was merely a prospecting expedition and i intended to return for my luggage if i saw reason for hope alas there was not the faintest the sight of the place would have damped the most sanguine man that ever lived it is one of those picturesque little english towns with a history and little else a roman trench and a norman keep are its principal products but to me the most amazing thing about it was the cloud of doctors which had settled upon it a double row of brass plates flanked the principal street where their patients came from i could not imagine unless they practised upon each other the host of the bull where i had my modest lunch explained the mystery to some extent by saying that as there was pure country with hardly a hamlet for nearly twelve miles in every direction it was in these scattered farmhouses that the stockwell doctors found their patients as i chatted with him a middleaged dustybooted man trudged up the street theres dr adam said he hes only a newcomer but they say that some o these days hell be starting his carriage what do you mean by a newcomer i asked oh hes scarcely been here ten years said the landlord thank you said i can you tell me when the next train leaves for bradfield so back i came rather heavy at heart and having spent ten or twelve shillings which i could ill afford my fruitless journey seemed a small thing however when i thought of the rising stockwellite with his ten years and his dusty boots i can trudge along a path however rough if it will but lead to something but may kindly fate keep me out of all cul desacs the cullingworths did not receive me cordially upon my return there was a singular look upon both their faces which seemed to me to mean that they were disappointed at this hitch in getting rid of me when i think of their absolute geniality a few days ago and their markedly reserved manner now i can make no sense out of it i asked cullingworth point blank what it meant but he only turned it off with a forced laugh and some nonsense about my thin skin i think that i am the last man in the world to take offence where none is meant but at any rate i determined to end the matter by leaving bradfield at once it had struck me during my journey back from stockwell that birchespool would be a good place so on the very next day i started off taking my luggage with me and bidding a final goodbye to cullingworth and his wife you rely upon me laddie said c with something of his old geniality as we shook hands on parting you get a good house in a central position put up your plate and hold on by your toenails charge little or nothing until you get a connection and none of your professional hawdammy or you are a broken man ill see that you dont stop steaming for want of coal so with that comforting assurance i left them on the platform of the bradfield station the words seem kind do they not and yet taking this money jars every nerve in my body when i find that i can live on bread and water without it i will have no more of it but to do without it now would be for the man who cannot swim to throw off his lifebelt i had plenty of time on my way to birchespool to reflect upon my prospects and present situation my baggage consisted of a large brassplate a small leather trunk and a hatbox the plate with my name engraved upon it was balanced upon the rack above my head in my box were a stethoscope several medical books a second pair of boots two suits of clothes my linen and my toilet things with this and the five pounds eighteen shillings which remain in my purse i was sallying out to clear standingroom and win the right to live from my fellowmen but at least there was some chance of permanency about this and if there was the promise of poverty and hardship there was also that of freedom i should have no lady saltire to toss up her chin because i had my own view of things no cullingworth to fly out at me about nothing i would be my own my very own i capered up and down the carriage at the thought after all i had everything to gain and nothing in the whole wide world to lose and i had youth and strength and energy and the whole science of medicine packed in between my two ears i felt as exultant as though i were going to take over some practice which lay ready for me it was about four in the afternoon when i reached birchespool which is fiftythree miles by rail from bradfield it may be merely a name to you and indeed until i set foot in it i knew nothing of it myself but i can tell you now that it has a population of a hundred and thirty thousand souls about the same as bradfield that it is mildly manufacturing that it is within an hours journey of the sea that it has an aristocratic western suburb with a mineral well and that the country round is exceedingly beautiful it is small enough to have a character of its own and large enough for solitude which is always the great charm of a city after the offensive publicity of the country when i turned out with my brass plate my trunk and my hatbox upon the birchespool platform i sat down and wondered what my first move should be every penny was going to be of the most vital importance to me and i must plan things within the compass of that tiny purse as i sat pondering there came a sight of interest for i heard a burst of cheering with the blare of a band upon the other side of the station and then the pioneers and leading files of a regiment came swinging on to the platform they wore white sunhats and were leaving for malta in anticipation of war in egypt they were young soldiers english by the white facings with a colonel whose moustache reached his shoulders and a number of freshfaced longlegged subalterns i chiefly remember one of the coloursergeants a man of immense size and ferocious face who leaned upon his martini with two little white kittens peeping over either shoulder from the flaps of his knapsack i was so moved at the sight of these youngsters going out to do their best for the dear old country that i sprang up on my box took off my hat and gave them three cheers at first the folk on my side looked at me in their bovine fashion like a row of cows over a wall at the second a good many joined and at the third my own voice was entirely lost so i turned to go my way and the soldier laddies to go theirs and i wondered which of us had the stiffest and longest fight before us i left my baggage at the office and jumped into a tramcar which was passing the station with the intention of looking for lodgings as i judged that they would be cheaper than an hotel the conductor interested himself in my wants in that personal way which makes me think that the poorer classes in england are one of the kindliest races on earth policemen postmen railway guards busmen what good helpful fellows they all are this one reckoned the whole thing out how this street was central but dear and the other was outoftheway but cheap and finally dropped me at a medium shabby genteel kind of thoroughfare called cadogan terrace with instructions that i was to go down there and see how i liked it i could not complain of a limited selection for a to let or apartments was peeping out of every second window i went into the first attractive house that i saw and interviewed the rather obtuse and grasping old lady who owned it a sittingbedroom was to be had for thirteen shillings a week as i had never hired rooms before i had no idea whether this was cheap or dear but i conclude it was the latter since on my raising my eyebrows as an experiment she instantly came down to ten shillings and sixpence i tried another look and an exclamation of astonishment but as she stood firm i gathered that i had touched the bottom your rooms are quite clean i asked for there was a wooden panelling which suggested possibilities quite clean sir no vermin the officers of the garrison come sometimes this took some thinking out it had an ugly sound but i gathered that she meant that there could be no question about the cleanliness since these gentlemen were satisfied so the bargain was struck and i ordered tea to be ready in an hour while i went back to the station to fetch up my luggage a porter brought it up for eightpence saving fourpence on a cab my boy and so i found myself in the heart of birchespool with a base of operations secured i looked out of the little window of my lodgings at the reeking pots and grey sloping roofs with a spire or two spurting up among them and i shook my teaspoon defiantly at them youve got to conquer me said i or else im man enough to conquer you now you would hardly expect that a fellow would have an adventure on his very first night in a strange town but i had a trivial one it is true but fairly exciting while it lasted certainly it reads more like what might happen to a man in a book but you may take it from me that it worked out just as i set it down here when i had finished my tea i wrote a few letters one to cullingworth and one to horton then as it was a lovely evening i determined to stroll out and see what sort of a place it was upon which fate had washed me up best begin as you mean to go on thought i so i donned my frockcoat put on my carefullybrushed tophat and sallied forth with my very respectable metalheaded walking stick in my hand i walked down to the park which is the chief centre of the place and i found that i liked everything i saw of it it was a lovely evening and the air was fresh and sweet i sat down and listened to the band for an hour watching all the family parties and feeling particularly lonely music nearly always puts me into the minor key so there came a time when i could stand it no longer and i set off to find my way back to my lodgings on the whole i felt that birchespool was a place in which a man might very well spend a happy life at one end of cadogan terrace where i am lodging there is a wide open space where several streets meet in the centre of this stands a large lamp in the middle of a broad stone pedestal a foot or so high and ten or twelve across well as i strolled along i saw there was something going on round this lamppost a crowd of people had gathered with a swirl in the centre i was of course absolutely determined not to get mixed up in any row but i could not help pushing my way through the crowd to see what was the matter it wasnt a pretty sight a woman pinched and bedraggled with a baby on her arm was being knocked about by a burly brute of a fellow whom i judged to be her husband from the way in which he cherished her he was one of those redfaced darkeyed men who can look peculiarly malignant when they choose it was clear that he was half mad with drink and that she had been trying to lure him away from some den i was just in time to see him take a flying kick at her amid cries of shame from the crowd and then lurch forward again with the evident intention of having another the mob still expostulating vaguely if bertie it had been old student days i should have sailed straight in as you or any other fellow would have done my flesh crept with my loathing for the brute but i had also to think of what i was and where i was and what i had come there to do however there are some things which a man cannot stand so i took a couple of steps forward put my hand on the fellows shoulder and said in as conciliatory and genial a voice as i could muster come come my lad pull yourself together instead of pulling himself together he very nearly knocked me asunder i was all abroad for an instant he had turned on me like a flash and had struck me on the throat just under the chin my head being a little back at the moment it made me swallow once or twice i can tell you sudden as the blow was i had countered in the automatic sort of way that a man who knows anything of boxing does it was only from the elbow with no body behind it but it served to stave him off for the moment while i was making inquiries about my windpipe then in he came with a rush and the crowd swarming round with shrieks of delight we were pushed almost locked in each others arms on to that big pedestal of which i have spoken go it little un give him beans yelled the mob who had lost all sight of the origin of the fray and could only see that my opponent was two inches the shorter man so there my dear bertie was i within a few hours of my entrance into this town with my top hat down to my ears my highly professional frockcoat and my kid gloves fighting some low bruiser on a pedestal in one of the most public places in the heart of a yelling and hostile mob i ask you whether that was cruel luck or not cullingworth told me before i started that birchespool was a lively place for the next few minutes it struck me as the liveliest i had ever seen the fellow was a round hand hitter but so strong that he needed watching a round blow is as you know more dangerous than a straight one if it gets home for the angle of the jaw the ear and the temple are the three weakest points which you present however i took particular care that my man did not get home but on the other hand i fear that i did not do him much harm either he bored in with his head down and i like a fool broke my knuckles over the top of his impenetrable skull of course theoretically i should either have stepped back and tried an undercut or else taken him into chancery but i must confess to feeling flurried and rattled from the blow i had had as well as from the suddenness of the whole affair however i was cooling down and i daresay should in time have done something rational when the affray came to a sudden and unexpected end this was from the impatience and excitement of the crowd the folk behind wishing to see all that was going on pushed against those in front until halfa dozen of the foremost with i think a woman among them were flung right up against us one of these a rough sailorlike fellow in a jersey got wedged between us and my antagonist in his blind rage got one of his swinging blows home upon this newcomers ear what you yelled the sailor and in an instant he had taken over the whole contract and was at it hammer and tongs with my beauty i grabbed my stick which had fallen among the crowd and backed my way out rather dishevelled but very glad to get off so cheaply from the shouting which i could hear some time after i reached the door of my lodgings i gathered that a good battle was still raging you see it was the merest piece of luck in the world that my first appearance in birchespool was not in the dock of the policecourt i should have had no one to answer for me if i had been arrested and should have been put quite on a level with my adversary i daresay you think i made a great fool of myself but i should like to know how i could have acted otherwise the only thing that i feel now is my loneliness what a lucky fellow you are with your wife and child after all i see more and more clearly that both men and women are incomplete fragmentary mutilated creatures as long as they are single do what they may to persuade themselves that their state is the happiest they are still full of vague unrests of dim illdefined dissatisfactions of a tendency to narrow ways and selfish thoughts alone each is a halfmade being with every instinct and feeling yearning for its missing moiety together they form a complete and symmetrical whole the minds of each strongest where that of the other needs reinforcing i often think that if our souls survive death and i believe they do though i base my believe on very different grounds from yours every male soul will have a female one attached to or combined with it to round it off and give it symmetry so thought the old mormon you remember who used it as an argument for his creed you cannot take your railway stocks into the next world with you he said but with all our wives and children we should make a good start in the world to come i daresay you are smiling at me as you read this from the vantage ground of your two years of matrimony it will be long before i shall be able to put my views into practice well goodbye my dear old chap as i said at the beginning of my letter the very thought of you is good for me and never more so than at this moment when i am alone in a strange city with very dubious prospects and an uncertain future we differ as widely as the poles you and i and have done ever since i have known you you are true to your faith i to my reason you to your family belief i to my own ideas but our friendship shows that the real essentials of a man and his affinity for others depends upon quite other things than views on abstract questions anyway i can say with all my heart that i wish i saw you with that old corncob of yours between your teeth sitting in that ricketty american leather armchair with the villanous lodginghouse antimacassar over the back of it it is good of you to tell me how interested you are in my commonplace adventures though if i had not known that you were so you may be sure that i should never have ventured to inflict any of them upon you my future is now all involved in obscurity but it is obvious that the first thing i must do is to find a fitting house and my second to cajole the landlord into letting me enter into possession of it without any prepayment to that i will turn myself tomorrow morning and you shall know the result whom should i hear from the other day but archie mclagan of course it was a begging letter you can judge how far i am in a state to lose money but in a hot fit i sent him ten shillings which now in my cold i bitterly regret with every good wish to you and yours including your town your state and your great country yours as ever xi oakley villas birchespool th may birchespool is really a delightful place dear bertie and i ought to know something about it seeing that i have padded a good hundred miles through its streets during the last seven days its mineral springs used to be quite the mode a century or more ago and it retains many traces of its aristocratic past carrying it with a certain grace too as an emigre countess might wear the faded dress which had once rustled in versailles i forget the new roaring suburbs with their outgoing manufactures and their incoming wealth and i live in the queer healthgiving old city of the past the wave of fashion has long passed over it but a deposit of dreary respectability has been left behind in the high street you can see the long iron extinguishers upon the railings where the linkboys used to put out their torches instead of stamping upon them or slapping them on the pavement as was the custom in less hightoned quarters there are the very high curbstones too so that lady teazle or mrs sneerwell could step out of coach or sedan chair without soiling her dainty satin shoes it brings home to me what an unstable chemical compound man is here are the stage accessories as good as ever while the players have all split up into hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and carbon with traces of iron and silica and phosphorus a tray full of chemicals and three buckets of water there is the raw material of my lady in the sedan chair its a curious double picture if one could but conjure it up on the one side the highborn bucks the mincing ladies the scheming courtiers pushing and planning and striving every one of them to attain his own petty object then for a jump of a hundred years what is this in the corner of the old vault margarine and chlesterine carbonates sulphates and ptomaines we turn from it in loathing and as we go we carry with us that from which we fly but mind you bertie i have a very high respect for the human body and i hold that it has been unduly snubbed and maligned by divines and theologians our gross frames and our miserable mortal clay are phrases which to my mind partake more of blasphemy than of piety it is no compliment to the creator to depreciate his handiwork whatever theory or belief we may hold about the soul there can i suppose be no doubt that the body is immortal matter may be transformed in which case it may be retransformed but it can never be destroyed if a comet were to strike this globule of ours and to knock it into a billion fragments which were splashed all over the solar system if its fiery breath were to lick up the earths surface until it was peeled like an orange still at the end of a hundred millions of years every tiniest particle of our bodies would exist in other forms and combinations it is true but still those very atoms which now form the forefinger which traces these words so the child with the same wooden bricks will build a wall then strew them on the table then a tower then strew once more and so ever with the same bricks but then our individuality i often wonder whether something of that wilt cling to our atoms whether the dust of johnnie munro will ever have something of him about it and be separable from that of bertie swanborough i think it is possible that we do impress ourselves upon the units of our own structure there are facts which tend to show that every tiny organic cell of which a man is composed contains in its microcosm a complete miniature of the individual of which it forms a part the ovum itself from which we are all produced is as you know too small to be transfixed upon the point of a fine needle and yet within that narrow globe lies the potentiality not only for reproducing the features of two individuals but even their smallest tricks of habit and of thought well if a single cell contains so much perhaps a single molecule and atom has more than we think have you ever had any personal experience of dermoid cysts we had one in cullingworths practice just before his illness and we were both much excited about it they seem to me to be one of those wee little chinks through which one may see deep into natures workings in this case the fellow who was a clerk in the post office came to us with a swelling over his eyebrow we opened it under the impression that it was an abscess and found inside some hair and a rudimentary jaw with teeth in it you know that such cases are common enough in surgery and that no pathological museum is without an example but what are we to understand by it so startling a phenomenon must have a deep meaning that can only be i think that every cell in the body has the power latent in it by which it may reproduce the whole individual and that occasionally under some special circumstances some obscure nervous or vascular excitement one of these microscopic units of structure actually does make a clumsy attempt in that direction but my goodness where have i got to all this comes from the birchespool lampposts and curbstones and i sat down to write such a practical letter too however i give you leave to be as dogmatic and didactic as you like in return cullingworth says my head is like a bursting capsule with all the seeds getting loose poor seed too i fear but some of it may lodge somewhere or not as fate pleases i wrote to you last on the night that i reached here next morning i set to work upon my task you would be surprised at least i was to see how practical and methodical i can be first of all i walked down to the postoffice and i bought a large shilling map of the town then back i came and pinned this out upon the lodginghouse table this done i set to work to study it and to arrange a series of walks by which i should pass through every street of the place you have no idea what that means until you try to do it i used to have breakfast get out about ten walk till one have a cheap luncheon i can do well on threepence walk till four get back and note results on my map i put a cross for every empty house and a circle for every doctor so at the end of that time i had a complete chart of the whole place and could see at a glance where there was a possible opening and what opposition there was at each point in the meantime i had enlisted a most unexpected ally on the second evening a card was solemnly brought up by the landladys daughter from the lodger who occupied the room below on it was inscribed captain whitehall and then underneath in brackets armed transport on the back of the card was written captain whitehall armed transport presents his compliments to dr munro and would be glad of his company to supper at to this i answered dr munro presents his compliments to captain whitehall armed transport and will be most happy to accept his kind invitation what armed transport might mean i had not an idea but i thought it well to include it as he seemed so particular about it himself on descending i found a curiouslooking figure in a gray dressinggown with a purple cord he was an elderly man his hair not quite white yet but well past mouse colour his beard and moustache however were of a yellowish brown and his face all puckered and shot with wrinkles spare and yet puffy with hanging bags under his singular light blue eyes by god dr munro sir said he as he shook my hand i take it as very kind of you that you should accept an informal invitation i do sir by god this sentence was as it proved a very typical one for he nearly always began and ended each with an oath while the centre was as a rule remarkable for a certain suave courtesy so regular was his formula that i may omit it and you suppose it every time that he opened his mouth a dash here and there will remind you its been my practice dr munro sir to make friends with my neighbours through life and some strange neighbours i have had by sir humble as you see me i have sat with a general on my right and an admiral on my left and my toes up against a british ambassador that was when i commanded the armed transport hegira in the black sea in burst up in the great gale in balaclava bay sir and not as much left as you could pick your teeth with there was a strong smell of whisky in the room and an uncorked bottle upon the mantelpiece the captain himself spoke with a curious stutter which i put down at first to a natural defect but his lurch as he turned back to his armchair showed me that he had had as much as he could carry not much to offer you dr munro sir the hind leg of a duck and a sailors welcome not royal navy sir though i have a sight better manners than many that are no sir i fly no false colours and put no r n after my name but im the queens servant by no mercantile marine about me have a wet sir its the right stuff and i have drunk enough to know the difference well as the supper progressed i warmed with the liquor and the food and i told my new acquaintance all about my plans and intentions i didnt realise how lonely i had been until i found the pleasure of talking he listened to it all with much sympathy and to my horror tossed off a whole tumblerfull of neat whisky to my success so enthusiastic was he that it was all i could do to prevent him from draining a second one youll do it dr munro sir he cried i know a man when i see one and youll do it theres my hand sir im with you you neednt be ashamed to grasp it for by though i say it myself its been open to the poor and shut to a bully ever since i could suck milk yes sir youll make a good shipmate and im glad to have you on my poop for the remainder of the evening his fixed delusion was that i had come to serve under him and he read me long rambling lectures about ships discipline still always addressing me as dr munro sir at last however his conversation became unbearable a foul young man is odious but a foul old one is surely the most sickening thing on earth one feels that the white upon the hair like that upon the mountain should signify a height attained i rose and bade him goodnight with a last impression of him leaning back in his dressinggown a sodden cigarend in the corner of his mouth his beard all slopped with whisky and his halfglazed eyes looking sideways after me with the leer of a satyr i had to go into the street and walk up and down for halfanhour before i felt clean enough to go to bed well i wanted to see no more of my neighbour but in he came as i was sitting at breakfast smelling like a barparlour with stale whisky oozing at every pore good morning dr munro sir said he holding out a twitching hand i compliment you sir you look fresh fresh and me with a head like a toyshop we had a pleasant quiet evening and i took nothing to hurt but it is the relaxing air of this place that settles me i cant bear up against it last year it gave me the horrors and i expect it will again youre off househunting i suppose i start immediately after breakfast i take a cursed interest in the whole thing you may think it a impertinence but thats the way im made as long as i can steam ill throw a rope to whoever wants a tow ill tell you what ill do dr munro sir ill stand on one tack if youll stand on the other and ill let you know if i come across anything that will do there seemed to be no alternative between taking him with me or letting him go alone so i could only thank him and let him have carte blanche every night he would turn up halfdrunk as a rule having i believe walked his ten or fifteen miles as conscientiously as i had done he came with the most grotesque suggestions once he had actually entered into negotiations with the owner of a huge shop a place that had been a rapers with a counter about sixty feet long his reason was that he knew an innkeeper who had done very well a little further down on the other side poor old armed transport worked so hard that i could not help being touched and grateful yet i longed from my heart that he would stop for he was a most unsavoury agent and i never knew what extraordinary step he might take in my name he introduced me to two other men one of them a singularlooking creature named turpey who was struggling along upon a woundpension having when only a senior midshipman lost the sight of one eye and the use of one arm through the injuries he received at some unpronounceable pah in the maori war the other was a sadfaced poeticallooking man of good birth as i understood who had been disowned by his family on the occasion of his eloping with the cook his name was carr and his chief peculiarity that he was so regular in his irregularities that he could always tell the time of day by the state of befuddlement that he was in he would cock his head think over his own symptoms and then give you the hour fairly correctly an unusual drink would disarrange him however and if you forced the pace in the morning he would undress and go to bed about teatime with a full conviction that all the clocks had gone mad these two strange waifs were among the craft to whom old whitehall had in his own words thrown a rope and long after i had gone to bed i could hear the clink of their glasses and the tapping of their pipes against the fender in the room below well when i had finished my emptyhouseanddoctor chart i found that there was one villa to let which undoubtedly was far the most suitable for my purpose in the first place it was fairly cheapforty pounds or fifty with taxes the front looked well it had no garden it stood with the welltodo quarter upon the one side and the poorer upon the other finally it was almost at the intersection of four roads one of which was a main artery of the town altogether if i had ordered a house for my purpose i could hardly have got anything better and i was thrilled with apprehension lest some one should get before me to the agent i hurried round and burst into the office with a precipitancy which rather startled the demure clerk inside his replies however were reassuring the house was still to let it was not quite the quarter yet but i could enter into possession i must sign an agreement to take it for one year and it was usual to pay a quarters rent in advance i dont know whether i turned colour a little in advance i said as carelessly as i could it is usual or references well that depends of cousesic upon the references not that it matters much said i heaven forgive me still if it is the same to the firm i may as well pay by the quarter as i shall do afterwards what names did you propose to give he asked my heart gave a bound for i knew that all was right my uncle as you know won his knighthood in the artillery and though i have seen nothing of him i knew that he was the man to pull me out of this tight corner theres my uncle sir alexander munro lismore house dublin said i he would be happy to answer any inquiry and so would my friend dr cullingworth of bradfield i brought him down with both barrels i could see it by his eyes and the curve of his back i have no doubt that that will be quite satisfactory said he perhaps you would kindly sign the agreement i did so and drew my hind foot across the rubicon the die was cast come what might oakley villas was on my hand for a twelvemonth would you like the key now i nearly snatched it out of his hands then away i ran to take possession of my property never shall i forget my feelings my dear bertie when the key clicked in the lock and the door flew open it was my own house all my very own i shut the door again the noise of the street died down and i had in that empty dust strewn hall such a sense of soothing privacy as had never come to me before in all my life it was the first time that i had ever stood upon boards which were not paid for by another then i proceeded to go from room to room with a delicious sense of exploration there were two upon the ground floor sixteen feet square each and i saw with satisfaction that the wall papers were in fair condition the front one would make a consulting room the other a waiting room though i did not care to reflect who was most likely to do the waiting i was in the highest spirits and did a step dance in each room as an official inauguration then down a winding wooden stair to the basement where were kitchen and scullery dimly lit and asphalt floored as i entered the latter i stood staring in every corner piles of human jaws were grinning at me the place was a golgotha in that half light the effect was sepulchral but as i approached and picked up one of them the mystery vanished they were of plasterof paris and were the leavings evidently of the dentist who had been the last tenant a more welcome sight was a huge wooden dresser with drawers and a fine cupboard in the corner it only wanted a table and a chair to be a furnished room then i ascended again and went up the first flight of stairs there were two other good sized apartments there one should be my bedroom and the other a spare room and then another flight with two more one for the servant when i had one and the other for a guest from the windows i had a view of the undulating gray back of the city with the bustle of green tree tops it was a windy day and the clouds were drifting swiftly across the heavens with glimpses of blue between i dont know how it was but as i stood looking through the grimy panes in the empty rooms a sudden sense of my own individuality and of my responsibility to some higher power came upon me with a vividness which was overpowering here was a new chapter of my life about to be opened what was to be the end of it i had strength i had gifts what was i going to do with them all the world the street the cabs the houses seemed to fall away and the mite of a figure and the unspeakable guide of the universe were for an instant face to face i was on my knees hurled down all against my own will as it were and even then i could find no words to say only vague yearnings and emotions and a heartfelt wish to put my shoulder to the great wheel of good what could i say every prayer seemed based on the idea that god was a magnified man that he needed asking and praising and thanking should the cog of the wheel creak praise to the engineer let it rather cog harder and creak less yet i did i confess try to put the agitation of my soul into words i meant it for a prayer but when i considered afterwards the supposing thats and in case ofs with which it was sprinkled it must have been more like a legal document and yet i felt soothed and happier as i went downstairs again i tell you this bertie because if i put reason above emotion i would not have you think that i am not open to attacks of the latter also i feel that what i say about religion is too cold and academic i feel that there should be something warmer and sweeter and more comforting but if you ask me to buy this at the price of making myself believe a thing to be true which all that is nearest the divine in me cries out against then you are selling your opiates too high im a volunteer for gods own forlorn hope and ill clamber up the breech as long as i think i can see the flag of truth waving in front of me well my next two cares were to get drugs and furniture the former i was sure that i could obtain on long credit while the latter i was absolutely determined not to get into debt over i wrote to the apothecaries company giving the names of cullingworth and of my father and ordering twelve pounds worth of tinctures infusions pills powders ointments and bottles cullingworth must i should think have been one of their very largest customers so i knew very well that my order would meet with prompt attention there remained the more serious matter of the furniture i calculated that when my lodgings were paid for i might without quite emptying my purse expend four pounds upon furniture not a large allowance for a good sized villa that would leave me a few shillings to go on with and before they were exhausted cullingworths pound would come in those pounds however would be needed for the rent so i could hardly reckon upon them at all as far as my immediate wants went i found in the columns of the birchespool post that there was to be a sale of furniture that evening and i went down to the auctioneers rooms accompanied much against my will by captain whitehall who was very drunk and affectionate by god dr munro sir im the man thats going to stick to you im only an old sailorman sir with perhaps more liquor than sense but im the queens servant and touch my pension every quarter day i dont claim to be r n but im not merchant service either here i am rotting in lodgings but by dr munro sir i carried seven thousand stinking turks from varna to balaclava bay im with you dr munro and we put this thing through together we came to the auction rooms and we stood on the fringe of the crowd waiting for our chance presently up went a very neat little table i gave a nod and got it for nine shillings then three rather striking looking chairs black wood and cane bottoms four shillings each i gave for those then a metal umbrellastand four and sixpence that was a mere luxury but i was warming to the work a job lot of curtains all tied together in a bundle went up somebody bid five shillings the auctioneers eye came round to me and i nodded mine again for five and sixpence then i bought a square of red drugget for halfacrown a small iron bed for nine shillings three watercolour paintings spring the banjo player and windsor castle for five shillings a tiny fender halfacrown a toilet set five shillings another very small squaretopped table three and sixpence whenever i bid for anything whitehall thrust his blackthorn up into the air and presently i found him doing so on my behalf when i had no intention of buying i narrowly escaped having to give fourteen and sixpence for a stuffed macaw in a glass case it would do to hang in your hall dr munro sir said he when i remonstrated with him i should have to hang myself in my hall soon if i spent my money like that said i ive got as much as i can afford now and i must stop when the auction was over i paid my bill and had my goods hoisted on to a trolly the porter undertaking to deliver them for two shillings i found that i had overestimated the cost of furnishing for the total expense was little more than three pounds we walked round to oakley villa and i proudly deposited all my goods in the hall and here came another extraordinary example of the kindness of the poorer classes the porter when i had paid him went out to his trolly and returned with a huge mat of oakum as ugly a thing as i have ever set eyes upon this he laid down inside my door and then without a word brushing aside every remonstrance or attempt at thanks he vanished away with his trolly into the night next morning i came round to my house my house my boy for good and all after paying off my landlady her bill came to more than i expected for i only had breakfast and tea always dining out as i majestically expressed it however it was a relief to me to get it settled and to go round with my box to oakley villas an ironmonger had fixed my plate on to the railings for halfacrown the evening before and there it was glittering in the sun when i came round it made me quite shy to look at it and i slunk into the house with a feeling that every window in the street had a face in it but once inside there was so much to be done that i did not know what i should turn to first i bought a oneandninepenny broom and set to work you notice that i am precise about small sums because just there lies the whole key of the situation in the yard i found a zinc pail with a hole in it which was most useful for by its aid i managed to carry up all the jaws with which my kitchen was heaped then with my new broom my coat hung on a gasbracket and my shirt sleeves turned to the elbow i cleaned out the lower rooms and the hall brushing the refuse into the yard after that i did as much for the upper floor with the result that i brought several square yards of dust down into the hall again and undid my previous cleaning this was disheartening but at least it taught me to begin at the furthest point in future when i had finished i was as hot and dirty as if it were halftime at a football match i thought of our tidy charwoman at home and realised what splendid training she must be in then came the arranging of the furniture the hall was easily managed for the planks were of a dark colour which looked well of themselves my oakum mat and my umbrella stand were the only things in it but i bought three pegs for sixpence and fastened them up at the side completing the effect by hanging my two hats upon them finally as the expanse of bare floor was depressing i fixed one of my curtains about halfway down it draping it back so that it had a kind of oriental look and excited a vague idea of suites of apartments beyond it was a fine effect and i was exceedingly proud of it from that i turned to the most important point of all the arrangement of my consulting room my experience with cullingworth had taught me one thing at least that patients care nothing about your house if they only think that you can cure them once get that idea into their heads and you may live in a vacant stall in a stable and write your prescriptions on the manger still as this was for many a day to come to be the only furnished room in my house it was worth a little planning to get it set out to the best advantage my red drugget i laid out in the centre and fastened it down with brassheaded nails it looked much smaller than i had hoped a little red island on an ocean of deal board or a postage stamp in the middle of an envelope in the centre of it i placed my table with three medical works on one side of it and my stethoscope and dressers case upon the other one chair went with the table of course and then i spent the next ten minutes in trying to determine whether the other two looked better together a dense block of chairs as it were or scattered so that the casual glance would get the idea of numerous chairs i placed them finally one on the right and one in front of the table then i put down my fender and nailed spring the banjo players and windsor castle on to three of the walls with the mental promise that my first spare halfcrown should buy a picture for the fourth in the window i placed my little square table and balanced upon it a photograph with an ivory mounting and a nice plush frame which i had brought in my trunk finally i found a pair of dark brown curtains among the job lot which i had bought at the sale and these i put up and drew pretty close together so that a subdued light came into the room which toned everything down and made the dark corners look furnished when i had finished i really do not believe that any one could have guessed that the total contents of that room came to about thirty shillings then i pulled my iron bed upstairs and fixed it in the room which i had from the first determined upon as my bedchamber i found an old packing case in the yard a relic of my predecessors removal and this made a very good washhand stand for my basin and jug when it was all fixed up i walked swelling with pride through my own chambers giving a touch here and a touch there until i had it perfect i wish my mother could see it or on second thoughts i dont for i know that her first act would be to prepare gallons of hot water and to holystone the whole place down from garret to cellar and i know by my own small experience what that means well thats as far as ive got as yet what trivial trivial stuff interesting to hardly a soul under heaven save only about three yet it pleases me to write as long as i have your assurance that it pleases you to read pray give my kindest remembrances to your wife and to camelford also if he should happen to come your way he was on the mississippi when last i heard xii oakley villas birchespool th june when i had made all those dispositions which i described with such painful prolixity in my last letter my dear bertie i sat down on my study chair and i laid out the whole of my worldly wealth upon the table in front of me i was startled when i looked at it three halfcrowns a florin and four sixpences or eleven and sixpence in all i had expected to hear from cullingworth before this but at least he was always there a trusty friend at my back immediately upon engaging the house i had written him a very full letter telling him that i had committed myself to keeping it for one year but assuring him that i was quite convinced that with the help which he had promised me i should be able to hold my own easily i described the favourable position of the house and gave him every detail of the rent and neighbourhood that letter would i was sure bring a reply from him which would contain my weekly remittance one thing i had above all determined upon that was that whatever hardships might lie before me i would fight through them without help from home i knew of course that my mother would have sold everything down to her gold eyeglasses to help me and that no thought of our recent disagreement would have weighed with her for an instant but still a man has his feelings you know and i did not propose to act against her judgment and then run howling for help i sat in my house all day with that everpresent sense of privacy and novelty which had thrilled me when i first shut the street door behind me at evening i sallied out and bought a loaf of bread half a pound of tea sweepings they call it and it cost eightpence a tin kettle fivepence a pound of sugar a tin of swiss milk and a tin of american potted meat i had often heard my mother groan over the expenses of housekeeping and now i began to understand what she meant two and ninepence went like a flash but at least i had enough to keep myself going for some days there was a convenient gas bracket in the back room i hammered a splinter of wood into the wall above it and so made an arm upon which i could hang my little kettle and boil it over the flame the attraction of the idea was that there was no immediate expense and many things would have happened before i was called upon to pay the gas bill the back room was converted then into both kitchen and dining room the sole furniture consisted of my box which served both as cupboard as table and as chair my eatables were all kept inside and when i wished for a meal i had only to pick them out and lay them on the lid leaving room for myself to sit beside them it was only when i went to my bedroom that i realised the oversights which i had made in my furnishing there was no mattress and no pillow or bedclothes my mind had been so centred upon the essentials for the practice that i had never given a thought to my own private wants i slept that night upon the irons of my bed and rose up like st lawrence from the gridiron my second suit of clothes with bristowes principles of medicine made an excellent pillow while on a warm june night a man can do well wrapped in his overcoat i had no fancy for secondhand bedclothes and determined until i could buy some new ones to make myself a straw pillow and to put on both my suits of clothes on the colder nights two days later however the problem was solved in more luxurious style by the arrival of a big brown tin box from my mother which was as welcome to me and as much of a windfall as the spanish wreck to robinson crusoe there were too pairs of thick blankets two sheets a counterpane a pillow a campstool two stuffed bears paws of all things in this world two terracotta vases a teacosy two pictures in frames several books an ornamental inkpot and a number of antimacassars and coloured tablecloths it is not until you own a table with a deal top and mahogany legs that you understand what the true inner meaning of an ornamental cloth is right on the top of this treasure came a huge hamper from the apothecaries society with the drugs which i had ordered when they were laid out in line the bottles extended right down one side of the diningroom and half down the other as i walked through my house and viewed my varied possessions i felt less radical in my views and begun to think that there might be something in the rights of property after all and i added to my effects in a marvellous way i made myself an excellent mattress out of some sacking and the straw in which the medicine bottles had been packed again out of three shutters which belonged to the room i rigged up a very effective sidetable for my own den which when covered with a red cloth and ornamented with the bears paws might have cost twenty guineas for all that the patient could say to the contrary i had done all this with a light heart and a good spirit before the paralysing blow which i shall have to tell you about came upon me of course it was obvious from the first that a servant was out of the question i could not feed one far less pay one and i had no kitchen furniture i must open my door to my own patients let them think what they would of it i must clean my own plate and brush down my own front and these duties must be thoroughly done come what might for i must show a presentable outside to the public well there was no great hardship in that for i could do it under the cover of night but i had had a suggestion from my mother which simplified matters immensely she had written to say that if i wished she would send my little brother paul to keep me company i wrote back eagerly to agree he was a hardy cheery little fellow of nine who would i knew gladly share hard times with me while if they became unduly so i could always have him taken home again some weeks must pass before he could come but it cheered me to think of him apart from his company there were a thousand ways in which he might be useful who should come in on the second day but old captain whitehall i was in the back room trying how many slices i could make out of a pound of potted beef when he rang my bell and i only just shut my mouth in time to prevent my heart jumping out how that bell clanged through the empty house i saw who it was however when i went into the hall for the middle panels of my door are of glazed glass so that i can always study a silhouette of my visitors before coming to closer quarters i was not quite sure yet whether i loathed the man or liked him he was the most extraordinary mixture of charity and drunkenness lechery and selfsacrifice that i had ever come across but he brought into the house with him a whiff of cheeriness and hope for which i could not but be grateful he had a large brown paper parcel under his arm which he unwrapped upon my table displaying a great brown jar this he carried over and deposited on the centre of my mantelpiece you will permit me dr munro sir to place this trifle in your room its lava sir lava from vesuvius and made in naples by you may think its empty dr munro sir but it is full of my best wishes and when youve got the best practice in this town you may point to that vase and tell how it came from a skipper of an armed transport who backed you from the start i tell you bertie the tears started to my eyes and i could hardly gulp out a word or two of thanks what a crisscross of qualities in one human soul it was not the deed or the words but it was the almost womanly look in the eyes of this broken drinksodden old bohemian the sympathy and the craving for sympathy which i read there only for an instant though for he hardened again into his usual reckless and half defiant manner theres another thing sir ive been thinking for some time back of having a medical opinion on myself id be glad to put myself under your hands if you would take a survey of me whats the matter i asked dr munro sir said he i am a walking museum you could fit what isnt the matter with me on to the back of a visiting card if theres any complaint you want to make a special study of just you come to me sir and see what i can do for you its not every one that can say that he has had cholera three times and cured himself by living on red pepper and brandy if you can only set the little germs sneezing theyll soon leave you alone thats my theory about cholera and you should make a note of it dr munro sir for i was shipmates with fifty dead men when i was commanding the armed transport hegira in the black sea and i know well what i am talking about i fill in whitehalls oaths with blanks because i feel how hopeless it is to reproduce their energy and variety i was amazed when he stripped for his whole body was covered with a perfect panorama of tattooings with a big blue venus right over his heart you may knock said he when i began to percuss his chest but i am sure theres no one at home theyve all gone visiting one another sir john hutton had a try some years ago why dammy man wheres your liver said he seems to me that some one has stirred you up with a porridge stick said he nothing is in its right place except my heart sir john said i aye by that will never lose its moorings while it has a flap left well i examined him and i found his own account not very far from the truth i went over him carefully from head to foot and there was not much left as nature made it he had mitral regurgitation cirrhosis of the liver brights disease an enlarged spleen and incipient dropsy i gave him a lecture about the necessity of temperance if not of total abstinence but i fear that my words made no impression he chuckled and made a kind of clucking noise in his throat all the time that i was speaking but whether in assent or remonstrance i cannot say he pulled out his purse when i had finished but i begged him to look on my small service as a mere little act of friendship this would not do at all however and he seemed so determined about it that i was forced to give way my fee is five shillings then since you insist upon making it a business matter dr munro sir he broke out i have been examined by men whom i wouldnt throw a bucket of water over if they were burning and i never paid them less than a guinea now that i have come to a gentleman and a friend stiffen me purple if i pay one farthing less so after much argument it ended in the kind fellow going off and leaving a sovereign and a shilling on the edge of my table the money burned my fingers for i knew that his pension was not a very large one and yet since i could not avoid taking it there was no denying that it was exceedingly useful out i sallied and spent sixteen shillings of it upon a new palliasse which should go under the straw mattress upon my bed already you see i was getting to a state of enervating luxury in my household arrangements and i could only lull my conscience by reminding myself that little paul would have to sleep with me when he came however i had not quite got to the end of whitehalls visit yet when i went back i took down the beautiful lava jug and inside i found his card on the back was written you have gone into action sir it may be your fate to sink or to swim but it can never be your degradation to strike die on the last plank and be damned to you or come into port with your ensign flying masthigh was it not fine it stirred my blood and the words rang like a bugle call in my head it braced me and the time was coming when all the bracing i could get would not be too much i copied it out and pinned it on one side of my mantelpiece on the other i stuck up a chip from carlyle which i daresay is as familiar to you as to me one way or another all the light energy and available virtue which we have does come out of us and goes very infallibly into gods treasury living and working through eternities there we are not lost not a single atom of us of one of us now there is a religious sentence which is intellectually satisfying and therefore morally sound this last quotation leads to my second visitor such a row we had i make a mistake in telling you about it for i know your sympathies will be against me but at least it will have the good effect of making you boil over into a letter of remonstrance and argument than which nothing could please me better well the second person whom i admitted through my door was the high church curate of the parish at least i deduced high church from his collar and the cross which dangled from his watch chain he seemed to be a fine upstanding manly fellow in fact i am bound in honesty to admit that i have never met the washy teaparty curate outside the pages of punch as a body i think they would compare very well in manliness i do not say in brains with as many young lawyers or doctors still i have no love for the cloth just as cotton which is in itself the most harmless substance in the world becomes dangerous on being dipped into nitric acid so the mildest of mortals is to be feared if he is once soaked in sectarian religion if he has any rancour or hardness in him it will bring it out i was therefore by no means overjoyed to see my visitor though i trust that i received him with fitting courtesy the quick little glance of surprise which he shot round him as he entered my consultingroom told me that it was not quite what he had expected you see the vicar has been away for two years he explained and we have to look after things in his absence his chest is weak and he cant stand birchespool i live just opposite and seeing your plate go up i thought i would call and welcome you into our parish i told him that i was very much obliged for the attention if he had stopped there all would have been well and we should have had a pleasant little chat but i suppose it was his sense of duty which would not permit it i trust said he that we shall see you at st josephs i was compelled to explain that it was not probable a roman catholic he asked in a not unfriendly voice i shook my head but nothing would discourage him not a dissenter he exclaimed with a sudden hardening of his genial face i shook my head again ah a little lax a little remiss he said playfully and with an expression of relief professional men get into these ways they have much to distract them at least you cling fast no doubt to the fundamental truths of christianity i believe from the bottom of my heart said i that the founder of it was the best and sweetest character of whom we have any record in the history of this planet but instead of soothing him my conciliatory answer seemed to be taken as a challenge i trust said he severely that your belief goes further than that you are surely prepared to admit that he was an incarnation of the godhead i began to feel like the old badger in his hole who longs to have a scratch at the black muzzle which is so eager to draw him does it not strike you i said that if he were but a frail mortal like ourselves his life assumes a much deeper significance it then becomes a standard towards which we might work if on the other hand he was intrinsically of a different nature to ourselves then his existence loses its point since we and he start upon a different basis to my mind it is obvious that such a supposition takes away the beauty and the moral of his life if he was divine then he could not sin and there was an end of the matter we who are not divine and can sin have little to learn from a life like that he triumphed over sin said my visitor as if a text or a phrase were an argument a cheap triumph i said you remember that roman emperor who used to descend into the arena fully armed and pit himself against some poor wretch who had only a leaden foil which would double up at a thrust according to your theory of your masters life you would have it that he faced the temptations of this world at such an advantage that they were only harmless leaden things and not the sharp assailants which we find them i confess in my own case that my sympathy is as strong when i think of his weaknesses as of his wisdom and his virtue they come more home to me i suppose since i am weak myself perhaps you would be good enough to tell me what has impressed you as weak in his conduct asked my visitor stiffly well the more human traits weak is hardly the word i should have used his rebuke of the sabbatarians his personal violence to the hucksters his outbursts against the pharisees his rather unreasoning petulance against the figtree because it bore no fruit at the wrong season of the year his very human feeling towards the housewife who bustled about when he was talking his gratification that the ointment should have been used for him instead of being devoted to the poor his self distrust before the crisis these make me realise and love the man you are a unitarian then or rather perhaps a mere deist said the curate with a combative flush you may label me as you like i answered and by this time i fear that i had got my preaching stop fairly out i dont pretend to know what truth is for it is infinite and i finite but i know particularly well what it is not it is not true that religion reached its acme nineteen hundred years ago and that we are for ever to refer back to what was written and said in those days no sir religion is a vital living thing still growing and working capable of endless extension and development like all other fields of thought there were many eternal truths spoken of old and handed down to us in a book some parts of which may indeed be called holy but there are others yet to be revealed and if we are to reject them because they are not in those pages we should act as wisely as the scientist who would take no notice of kirschoffs spectral analysis because there is no mention of it in albertus magnus a modern prophet may wear a broadcloth coat and write to the magazines but none the less he may be the little pipe which conveys a tiny squirt from the reservoirs of truth look at this i cried rising and reading my carlyle text that comes from no hebrew prophet but from a ratepayer in chelsea he and emerson are also among the prophets the almighty has not said his last say to the human race and he can speak through a scotchman or a new englander as easily as through a jew the bible sir is a book which comes out in instalments and to be continued not finis is written at the end of it my visitor had been showing every sign of acute uneasiness during this long speech of mine finally he sprang to his feet and took his hat from the table your opinions are highly dangerous sir said he it is my duty to tell you so you believe in nothing nothing which limits the power or the goodness of the almighty i answered you have evolved all this from your own spiritual pride and selfsufficiency said he hotly why do you not turn to that deity whose name you use why do you not humble yourself before him how do you know i dont you said yourself that you never went to church i carry my own church about under my own hat said i bricks and mortar wont make a staircase to heaven i believe with your master that the human heart is the best temple i am sorry to see that you differ from him upon the point perhaps it was too bad of me to say that i might have guarded without countering anyhow it had the effect of ending an interview which was becoming oppressive my visitor was too indignant to answer and swept out of the room without a word from my window i could see him hurry down the street a little black angry thing very hot and troubled because he cannot measure the whole universe with his pocket square and compasses think of it and think of what he is an atom among atoms standing at the meeting point of two eternities but what am i a brother atom that i should judge him after all i own to you that it might have been better had i listened to what he had to say and refused to give my own views on the other hand truth must be as broad as the universe which it is to explain and therefore far broader than anything which the mind of man can conceive a protest against sectarian thought must always be an aspiration towards truth who shall dare to claim a monopoly of the almighty it would be an insolence on the part of a solar system and yet it is done every day by a hundred little cliques of mystery mongers there lies the real impiety well the upshot of it all is my dear bertie that i have begun my practice by making an enemy of the man who of the whole parish has the most power to injure me i know what my father would think about it if he knew and now i come to the great event of this morning from which i am still gasping that villain cullingworth has cut the painter and left me to drift as best i may my post comes at eight oclock in the morning and i usually get my letters and take them into bed to read them there was only one this morning addressed in his strange unmistakable hand i made sure of course that it was my promised remittance and i opened it with a pleasurable feeling of expectation this is a copy of what i read when the maid was arranging your room after your departure she cleared some pieces of torn paper from under the grate seeing my name upon them she brought them as in duty bound to her mistress who pasted them together and found that they formed a letter from your mother to you in which i am referred to in the vilest terms such as a bankrupt swindler and the unscrupulous cullingworth i can only say that we are astonished that you could have been a party to such a correspondence while you were a guest under our roof and we refuse to have anything more to do with you in any shape or form that was a nice little morning greeting was it not after i had on the strength of his promise started in practice and engaged a house for a year with a few shillings in my pocket i have given up smoking for reasons of economy but i felt that the situation was worthy of a pipe so i climbed out of bed gathered a little heap of tobaccodust from the linings of my pocket and smoked the whole thing over that lifebelt of which i had spoken so confidingly had burst and left me to kick as best i might in very deep water i read the note over and over again and for all my dilemma i could not help laughing at the mingled meanness and stupidity of the thing the picture of the host and hostess busying themselves in gumming together the torn letters of their departed guest struck me as one of the funniest things i could remember and there was the stupidity of it because surely a child could have seen that my mothers attack was in answer to my defence why should we write a duet each saying the same thing well im still very confused about it all and i dont in the least know what i am going to do more likely to die on the last plank than to get into port with my ensign masthigh i must think it out and let you know the result come what may one thing only is sure and that is that in weal or woe i remain ever your affectionate and garrulous friend xiii oakley villas birchespool th june when i wrote my last letter my dear bertie i was still gasping like a cod on a sandbank after my final dismissal by cullingworth the mere setting of it all down in black and white seemed to clear the matter up and i felt much more cheery by the time i had finished my letter i was just addressing the envelope observe what a continuous narrative you get of my proceedings when i was set jumping out of my carpet slippers by a ring at the bell through the glass panel i observed that it was a respectablelooking bearded individual with a tophat it was a patient it must be a patient then first i realised what an entirely different thing it is to treat the patient of another man as i had done with horton or to work a branch of another mans practice as i had done with cullingworth and to have to do with a complete stranger on your own account i had been thrilling to have one now that he had come i felt for an instant as if i would not open the door but of course that was only a momentary weakness i answered his ring with i fear rather a hypocritical air of insouciance as though i had happened to find myself in the hall and did not care to trouble the maid to ascend the stairs dr stark munro he asked pray step in i answered and waved him into the consultingroom he was a pompous heavystepping thickvoiced sort of person but to me he was an angel from on high i was nervous and at the same time so afraid that he should detect my nervousness and lose confidence in me that i found myself drifting into an extravagant geniality he seated himself at my invitation and gave a husky cough ah said i i always prided myself on being quick at diagnosis bronchial i perceive these summer colds are a little trying yes said he ive had it some time with a little care and treatmenti suggested he did not seem sanguine but groaned and shook his head its not about that ive come said he no my heart turned to lead no doctor he took out a bulging notebook its about a small sum thats due on the meter youll laugh bertie but it was no laughing matter to me he wanted eight and sixpence on account of something that the last tenant either had or had not done otherwise the company would remove the gasmeter how little he could have guessed that the alternative he was presenting to me was either to pay away more than half my capital or to give up cooking my food i at last appeased him by a promise that i should look into the matter and so escaped for the moment badly shaken but still solvent he gave me a good deal of information about the state of his tubes his own not the gas companys before he departed but i had rather lost interest in the subject since i had learned that he was being treated by his club doctor that was the first of my morning incidents my second followed hard upon the heels of it another ring came and from my post of observation i saw that a gipsys van hung with baskets and wickerwork chairs had drawn up at the door two or three people appeared to be standing outside i understood that they wished me to purchase some of their wares so i merely opened the door about three inches said no thank you and closed it they seemed not to have heard me for they rang again upon which i opened the door wider and spoke more decidedly imagine my surprise when they rang again i flung the door open and was about to ask them what they meant by their impudence when one of the little group upon my doorstep said if you please sir its the baby never was there such a change from the outraged householder to the professional man pray step in madam said i in quite my most courtly style and in they all came the husband the brother the wife and the baby the latter was in the early stage of measles they were poor outcast sort of people and seemed not to have sixpence among them so my demands for a fee at the end of the consultation ended first in my giving the medicine for nothing and finally adding fivepence in coppers which was all the small change i had a few more such patients and i am a broken man however the two incidents together had the effect of taking up my attention and breaking the blow which i had had in the cullingworth letter it made me laugh to think that the apparent outsider should prove to be a patient and the apparent patient an outsider so back i went in a much more judicial frame of mind to read that precious document over again and to make up my mind what it was that i should do and now i came to my first real insight into the depths which lie in the character of cullingworth i began by trying to recall how i could have torn up my mothers letters for it is not usual for me to destroy papers in this manner i have often been chaffed about the way in which i allow them to accumulate until my pockets become unbearable the more i thought about it the more convinced i was that i could not have done anything of the sort so finally i got out the little house jacket which i had usually worn at bradfield and i examined the sheaves of letters which it contained it was there bertie almost the very first one that i opened was the identical one from which cullingworth was quoting in which my mother had described him in those rather forcible terms well this made me sit down and gasp i am i think one of the most unsuspicious men upon earth and through a certain easygoing indolence of disposition i never even think of the possibility of those with whom i am brought in contact trying to deceive me it does not occur to me but let me once get on that line of thought let me have proof that there is reason for suspicion and then all faith slips completely away from me now i could see an explanation for much which had puzzled me at bradfield those sudden fits of ill temper the occasional illconcealed animosity of cullingworth did they not mark the arrival of each of my mothers letters i was convinced that they did he had read them then read them from the pockets of the little house coat which i used to leave carelessly in the hall when i put on my professional one to go out i could remember for example how at the end of his illness his manner had suddenly changed on the very day when that final letter of my mothers had arrived yes it was certain that he had read them from the beginning but a blacker depth of treachery lay beyond if he had read them and if he had been insane enough to think that i was acting disloyally towards him why had he not said so at the time why had he contented himself with sidelong scowls and quarrelling over trivialities breaking too into forced smiles when i had asked him point blank what was the matter one obvious reason was that he could not tell his grievance without telling also how he had acquired his information but i knew enough of cullingworths resource to feel that he could easily have got over such a difficulty as that in fact in this last letter he had got over it by his tale about the grate and the maid he must have had some stronger reason for restraint as i thought over the course of our relations i was convinced that his scheme was to lure me on by promises until i had committed myself and then to abandon me so that i should myself have no resource but to compound with my creditors to be in fact that which my mother had called him but in that case he must have been planning it out almost from the beginning of my stay with him for my mothers letters stigmatising his conduct had begun very early for some time he had been uncertain how to proceed then he had invented the excuse which seemed to me at the time if you remember to be quite inadequate about the slight weekly decline in the practice in order to get me out of it his next move was to persuade me to start for myself and as this would be impossible without money he had encouraged me to it by the promise of a small weekly loan i remembered how he had told me not to be afraid about ordering furniture and other things because tradesmen gave long credit to beginners and i could always fall back upon him if necessary he knew too from his own experience that the landlord would require at least a years tenancy then he waited to spring his mine until i had written to say that i had finally committed myself on which by return of post came his letter breaking the connection it was so long and so elaborate a course of deceit that i for the first time felt something like fear as i thought of cullingworth it was as though in the guise and dress of a man i had caught a sudden glimpse of something sub human of something so outside my own range of thought that i was powerless against it well i wrote him a little note only a short one but with i hope a bit of a barb to it i said that his letter had been a source of gratification to me as it removed the only cause for disagreement between my mother and myself she had always thought him a blackguard and i had always defended him but i was forced now to confess that she had been right from the beginning i said enough to show him that i saw through his whole plot and i wound up by assuring him that if he thought he had done me any harm he had made a great mistake for i had every reason to believe that he had unintentionally forced me into the very opening which i had most desired myself after this bit of bravado i felt better and i thought over the situation i was alone in a strange town without connections without introductions with less than a pound in my pocket and with no possibility of freeing myself from my responsibilities i had no one at all to look to for help for all my recent letters from home had given a dreary account of the state of things there my poor fathers health and his income were dwindling together on the other hand i reflected that there were some points in my favour i was young i was energetic i had been brought up hard and was quite prepared to rough it i was well up in my work and believed i could get on with patients my house was an excellent one for my purpose and i had already put the essentials of furniture into it the game was not played out yet i jumped to my feet and clenched my hand and swore to the chandelier that it never should be played out until i had to beckon for help from the window for the next three days i had not a single ring at the bell of any sort whatever a man could not be more isolated from his kind it used to amuse me to sit upstairs and count how many of the passersby stopped to look at my plate once on a sunday morning there were over a hundred in an hour and often i could see from their glancing over their shoulders as they walked on that they were thinking or talking of the new doctor this used to cheer me up and make me feel that something was going on every night between nine and ten i slip out and do my modest shopping having already made my menu for the coming day i come back usually with a loaf of bread a paper of fried fish or a bundle of saveloys then when i think things are sufficiently quiet i go out and brush down the front with my broom leaning it against the wall and looking up meditatively at the stars whenever anyone passes then later still i bring out my polishing paste my rag and my chamois leather and i assure you that if practice went by the brilliancy of ones plate i should sweep the town who do you think was the first person who broke this spell of silence the ruffian whom i had fought under the lamppost he is a scissorsgrinder it seems and rang to know if i had a job for him i could not help grinning at him when i opened the door and saw who it was he showed no sign of recognising me however which is hardly to be wondered at the next comer was a real bona fide patient albeit a very modest one she was a little anaemic old maid a chronic hypochondriac i should judge who had probably worked her way round every doctor in the town and was anxious to sample this novelty i dont know whether i gave her satisfaction she said that she would come again on wednesday but her eyes shifted as she said it one and sixpence was as much as she could pay but it was very welcome i can live three days on one and sixpence i think that i have brought economy down to its finest point no doubt for a short spell i could manage to live on a couple of pence a day but what i am doing now is not to be a mere spurt but my regular mode of life for many a month to come my tea and sugar and milk swiss come collectively to one penny a day the loaf is at twopence threefarthings and i consume one a day my dinner consists in rotation of one third of a pound of bacon cooked over the gas twopence halfpenny or two saveloys twopence or two pieces of fried fish twopence or a quarter of an eightpenny tin of chicago beef twopence any one of these with a due allowance of bread and water makes a most substantial meal butter i have discarded for the present my actual board therefore comes well under sixpence a day but i am a patron of literature to the extent of a halfpenny a day which i expend upon an evening paper for with events hurrying on like this in alexandria i cannot bear to be without the news still i often reproach myself with that halfpenny for if i went out in the evening and looked at the placards i might save it and yet have a general idea of what is going on of course a halfpenny a night sounds nothing but think of a shilling a month perhaps you picture me as bloodless and pulled down on this diet i am thin it is true but i never felt more fit in my life so full of energy am i that i start off sometimes at ten at night and walk hard until two or three in the morning i dare not go out during the day you see for fear that i should miss a patient i have asked my mother not to send little paul down yet until i see my way more clearly old whitehall came in to see me the other day the object of his visit was to invite me to dinner and the object of the dinner to inaugurate my starting in practice if i were the kind old fellows son he could not take a deeper interest in me and my prospects by dr munro sir said he ive asked every man in birchespool thats got anything the matter with him youll have the lot as patients within a week theres fraser whos got a touch of martells three star hes coming and theres saunders who talks about nothing but his spleen im sick of his spleen but i asked him and theres turpeys wound this wet weather sets it tingling and his own surgeon can do nothing but dab it with vaseline hell be there and theres carr who is drinking himself to death he has not much for the doctors but what there is you may as well have all next day he kept popping in to ask me questions about the dinner should we have clear soup or oxtail didnt i think that burgundy was better than port and sherry the day after was the celebration itself and he was in with a bulletin immediately after breakfast the cooking was to be done at a neighbouring confectioners the landladys son was coming in to wait i was sorry to see that whitehall was already slurring his words together and had evidently been priming himself heavily he looked in again in the afternoon to tell me what a good time we should have soandso could talk well and the other man could sing a song he was so far gone by now that i ventured in the capacity of medical adviser to speak to him about it its not the liquor dr munro sir said he earnestly its the relaxing air of this town but ill go home and lie ill down and be as fresh as paint to welcome my guests but the excitement of the impending event must have been too much for him when i arrived at five minutes to seven turpey the wounded lieutenant met me in the hall with a face of ill omen its all up with whitehall said he whats the matter blind speechless and paralytic come and look the table in his room was nicely laid for dinner and several decanters with a large cold tart lay upon the sideboard on the sofa was stretched our unfortunate host his head back his forked beard pointing to the cornice and a half finished tumbler of whisky upon the chair beside him all our shakes and shouts could not break in upon that serene drunkenness what are we to do gasped turpey we must not let him make an exhibition of himself we had better get him away before any one else arrives so we bore him off all in coils and curves like a dead python and deposited him upon his bed when we returned three other guests had arrived youll be sorry to hear that whitehall is not very well said turpey dr munro thought it would be better that he should not come down in fact i have ordered him to bed said i then i move that mr turpey be called upon to act as host said one of the new comers and so it was at once agreed presently the other men arrived but there was no sign of the dinner we waited for a quarter of an hour but nothing appeared the landlady was summoned but could give no information captain whitehall ordered it from a confectioners sir said she in reply to the lieutenants cross examination he did not tell me which confectioners it might have been any one of four or five he only said that it would all come right and that i should bake an apple tart another quarter of an hour passed and we were all ravenous it was evident that whitehall had made some mistake we began to roll our eyes towards the apple pie as the boats crew does towards the boy in the stories of shipwreck a large hairy man with an anchor tattooed upon his hand rose and set the pie in front of turpey what dyou say gentlemen shall i serve it out we all drew up at the table with a decision which made words superfluous in five minutes the pie dish was as clean as when the cook first saw it and our illluck vanished with the pie a minute later the landladys son entered with the soup and cods head roast beef game and ice pudding followed in due succession it all came from some misunderstanding about time but we did them justice in spite of the curious hors doeuvre with which we had started and a pleasanter dinner or a more enjoyable evening i have seldom had sorry i was so bowled over dr munro sir said whitehall next morning i need hilly country and a bracing air not a croquet lawn like this well im glad to hear that you gentlemen enjoyed yourselves and i hope you found everything to your satisfaction i assured him that we did but i had not the heart to tell him about the apple pie i tell you these trivial matters my dear bertie just to show you that i am not down on my luck and that my life is not pitched in the minor key altogether in spite of my queer situation but to turn to graver things i was right glad to get your letter and to read all your denunciations about dogmatic science dont imagine that my withers are wrung by what you say for i agree with almost every word of it the man who claims that we can know nothing is to my mind as unreasonable as he who insists that everything has been divinely revealed to us i know nothing more unbearable than the complacent type of scientist who knows very exactly all that he does know but has not imagination enough to understand what a speck his little accumulation of doubtful erudition is when compared with the immensity of our ignorance he is the person who thinks that the universe can be explained by laws as if a law did not require construction as well as a world the motion of the engine can be explained by the laws of physics but that has not made the foregoing presence of an engineer less obvious in this world however part of the beautiful poise of things depends upon the fact that whenever you have an exaggerated fanatic of any sort his exact opposite at once springs up to neutralise him you have a mameluke up jumps a crusader you have a fenian up jumps an orangeman every force has its recoil and so these more hidebound scientists must be set against those gentlemen who still believe that the world was created in the year b c after all true science must be synonymous with religion since science is the acquirement of fact and facts are all that we have from which to deduce what we are and why we are here but surely the more we pry into the methods by which results are brougtsic about the more stupendous and wonderful becomes the great unseen power which lies behind the power which drifts the solar system in safety through space and yet adjusts the length of the insects proboscis to the depth of the honeybearing flower what is that central intelligence you may fit up your dogmatic scientist with a diameter microscope and with a telescope with a sixfoot speculum but neither near nor far can he get a trace of that great driving power what should we say of a man who has a great and beautiful picture submitted to him and who having satisfied himself that the account given of the painting of the picture is incorrect at once concludes that no one ever painted it or at least asserts that he has no possible means of knowing whether an artist has produced it or not that is as it seems to me a fair statement of the position of some of the more extreme agnostics is not the mere existence of the picture in itself a proof that a skilful artist has been busied upon it one might ask why no says the objector it is possible that the picture produced itself by the aid of certain rules besides when the picture was first submitted to me i was assured that it had all been produced within a week but by examining it i am able to say with certainty that it has taken a considerable time to put together i am therefore of opinion that it is questionable whether any one ever painted it at all leaving this exaggerated scientific caution on the one side and faith on the other as being equally indefensible there remains the clear line of reasoning that a universe implies the existence of a universe maker and that we may deduce from it some of his attributes his power his wisdom his forethought for small wants his providing of luxuries for his creatures on the other hand do not let us be disingenuous enough to shirk the mystery which lies in pain in cruelty in all which seems to be a slur upon his work the best that we can say for them is to hope that they are not as bad as they seem and possibly lead to some higher end the voices of the illused child and of the tortured animal are the hardest of all for the philosopher to answer goodbye old chap it is quite delightful to think that on one point at least we are in agreement xiv oakley villas birchespool th january you write reproachfully my dear bertie and you say that absence must have weakened our close friendship since i have not sent you a line during this long seven months the real truth of the matter is that i had not the heart to write to you until i could tell you something cheery and something cheery has been terribly long in coming at present i can only claim that the cloud has perhaps thinned a little at the edges you see by the address of this letter that i still hold my ground but between ourselves it has been a terrible fight and there have been times when that last plank of which old whitehall wrote seemed to be slipping out of my clutch i have ebbed and flowed sometimes with a little money sometimes without at my best i was living hard at my worst i was very close upon starvation i have lived for a whole day upon the crust of a loaf when i had ten pounds in silver in the drawer of my table but those ten pounds had been most painfully scraped together for my quarters rent and i would have tried twentyfour hours with a tight leather belt before i would have broken in upon it for two days i could not raise a stamp to send a letter i have smiled when i have read in my evening paper of the privations of our fellows in egypt their broken victuals would have been a banquet to me however what odds how you take your carbon and nitrogen and oxygen as long as you do get it the garrison of oakley villa has passed the worst and there is no talk of surrender it was not that i have had no patients they have come in as well as could be expected some like the little old maid who was the first never returned i fancy that a doctor who opened his own door forfeited their confidence others have become warm partisans but they have nearly all been very poor people and when you consider how many one and sixpences are necessary in order to make up the fifteen pounds which i must find every quarter for rent taxes gas and water you will understand that even with some success i have still found it a hard matter to keep anything in the portmanteau which serves me as larder however my boy two quarters are paid up and i enter upon a third one with my courage unabated i have lost about a stone but not my heart i have rather a vague recollection of when it was exactly that my last was written i fancy that it must have been a fortnight after my start immediately after my breach with cullingworth its rather hard to know where to begin when one has so many events to narrate disconnected from each other and trivial in themselves yet which have each loomed large as i came upon them though they look small enough now that they are so far astern as i have mentioned cullingworth i may as well say first the little that is to be said about him i answered his letter in the way which i have i think already described i hardly expected to hear from him again but my note had evidently stung him and i had a brusque message in which he said that if i wished him to believe in my bonafides whatever he may have meant by that i would return the money which i had had during the time that i was with him at bradfield to this i replied that the sum was about twelve pounds that i still retained the message in which he had guaranteed me three hundred pounds if i came to bradfield that the balance in my favour was two hundred and eightyeight pounds and that unless i had a cheque by return i should put the matter into the hands of my solicitor this put a final end to our correspondence there was one other incident however one day after i had been in practice about two months i observed a bearded commonplacelooking person lounging about on the other side of the road in the afternoon he was again visible from my consultingroom window when i saw him there once more next morning my suspicions were aroused and they became certainties when a day or so afterwards i came out of a patients house in a poor street and saw the same fellow looking into a greengrocers shop upon the other side i walked to the end of the street waited round the corner and met him as he came hurrying after you can go back to dr cullingworth and tell him that i have as much to do as i care for said i if you spy upon me after this it will be at your own risk he shuffled and coloured but i walked on and saw him no more there was no one on earth who could have had a motive for wanting to know exactly what i was doing except cullingworth and the mans silence was enough in itself to prove that i was right i have heard nothing of cullingworth since i had a letter from my uncle in the artillery sir alexander munro shortly after my start telling me that he had heard of my proceedings from my mother and that he hoped to learn of my success he is as i think you know an ardent wesleyan like all my fathers people and he told me that the chief wesleyan minister in the town was an old friend of his own that he had learned from him that there was no wesleyan doctor and that being of a wesleyan stock myself if i would present the enclosed letter of introduction to the minister i should certainly find it very much to my advantage i thought it over bertie and it seemed to me that it would be playing it rather low down to use a religious organisation to my own advantage when i condemned them in the abstract it was a sore temptation but i destroyed the letter i had one or two pieces of luck in the way of accidental cases one which was of immense importance to me was that of a grocer named haywood who fell down in a fit outside the floor of his shop i was passing on my way to see a poor labourer with typhoid you may believe that i saw my chance bustled in treated the man conciliated the wife tickled the child and gained over the whole household he had these attacks periodically and made an arrangement with me by which i was to deal with him and we were to balance bills against each other it was a ghoulish compact by which a fit to him meant butter and bacon to me while a spell of health for haywood sent me back to dry bread and saveloys however it enabled me to put by for the rent many a shilling which must otherwise have gone in food at last however the poor fellow died and there was our final settlement two small accidents occurred near my door it was a busy crossing and though i got little enough from either of them i ran down to the newspaper office on each occasion and had the gratification of seeing in the evening edition that the driver though much shaken is pronounced by dr stark munro of oakley villa to have suffered no serious injury as cullingworth used to say it is hard enough for the young doctor to push his name into any publicity and he must take what little chances he has perhaps the fathers of the profession would shake their heads over such a proceeding in a little provincial journal but i was never able to see that any of them were very averse from seeing their own names appended to the bulletin of some sick statesman in the times and then there came another and a more serious accident this would be about two months after the beginning though already i find it hard to put things in their due order a lawyer in the town named dickson was riding past my windows when the horse reared up and fell upon him i was eating saveloys in the back room at the time but i heard the noise and rushed to the door in time to meet the crowd who were carrying him in they flooded into my house thronged my hall dirtied my consulting room and even pushed their way into my back room which they found elegantly furnished with a portmanteau a lump of bread and a cold sausage however i had no thought for any one but my patient who was groaning most dreadfully i saw that his ribs were right tested his joints ran my hand down his limbs and concluded that there was no break or dislocation he had strained himself in such a way however that it was very painful to him to sit or to walk i sent for an open carriage therefore and conveyed him to his home i sitting with my most professional air and he standing straight up between my hands the carriage went at a walk and the crowd trailed behind with all the folk looking out of the windows so that a more glorious advertisement could not be conceived it looked like the advance guard of a circus once at his house however professional etiquette demanded that i should hand the case over to the family attendant which i did with as good a grace as possible not without some lingering hope that the old established practitioner might say you have taken such very good care of my patient dr munro that i should not dream of removing him from your hands on the contrary he snatched it away from me with avidity and i retired with some credit an excellent advertisement and a guinea these are one or two of the points of interest which show above the dead monotony of my life small enough as you see but even a sandhill looms large in holland in the main it is a dreary sordid record of shillings gained and shillings spent of scraping for this and scraping for that with ever some fresh slip of blue paper fluttering down upon me left so jauntily by the taxcollector and meaning such a deadweight pull to me the irony of my paying a poorrate used to amuse me i should have been collecting it thrice at a crisis i pawned my watch and thrice i rallied and rescued it but how am i to interest you in the details of such a career now if a fair countess had been so good as to slip on a piece of orange peel before my door or if the chief merchant in the town had been saved by some tourdeforce upon my part or if i had been summoned out at midnight to attend some nameless person in a lonely house with a princely fee for silence then i should have something worthy of your attention but the long months and months during which i listened to the throb of the charwomans heart and the rustle of the greengrocers lungs present little which is not dull and dreary no good angels came my way wait a bit though one did i was awakened at six in the morning one day by a ringing at my bell and creeping to the angle of the stair i saw through the glass a stout gentleman in a tophat outside much excited with a thousand guesses capping one another in my head i ran back pulled on some clothes rushed down opened the door and found myself in the grey morning light face to face with horton the good fellow had come down from merton in an excursion train and had been travelling all night he had an umbrella under his arm and two great straw baskets in each hand which contained when unpacked a cold leg of mutton halfa dozen of beer a bottle of port and all sorts of pasties and luxuries we had a great day together and when he rejoined his excursion in the evening he left a very much cheerier man than he had found talking of cheeriness you misunderstand me bertie if you think as you seem to imply that i take a dark view of things it is true that i discard some consolations which you possess because i cannot convince myself that they are genuine but in this world at least i see immense reason for hope and as to the next i am confident that all will be for the best from annihilation to beatification i am ready to adapt myself to whatever the great designers secret plan my be but there is much in the prospects of this world to set a mans heart singing good is rising and evil sinking like oil and water in a bottle the race is improving there are far fewer criminal convictions there is far more education people sin less and think more when i meet a brutal looking fellow i often think that he and his type may soon be as extinct as the great auk i am not sure that in the interest of the ologies we ought not to pickle a few specimens of bill sykes to show our childrens children what sort of a person he was and then the more we progress the more we tend to progress we advance not in arithmetical but in geometrical progression we draw compound interest on the whole capital of knowledge and virtue which has been accumulated since the dawning of time some eighty thousand years are supposed to have existed between paleolithic and neolithic man yet in all that time he only learned to grind his flint stones instead of chipping them but within our fathers lives what changes have there not been the railway and the telegraph chloroform and applied electricity ten years now go further than a thousand then not so much on account of our finer intellects as because the light we have shows us the way to more primeval man stumbled along with peering eyes and slow uncertain footsteps now we walk briskly towards our unknown goal and i wonder what that goal is to be i mean of course as far as this world is concerned ever since man first scratched hieroglyphics upon an ostracon or scribbled with sepia upon papyrus he must have wondered as we wonder today i suppose that we do know a little more than they we have an arc of about three thousand years given us from which to calculate out the course to be described by our descendants but that arc is so tiny when compared to the vast ages which providence uses in working out its designs that our deductions from it must i think be uncertain will civilisation be swamped by barbarism it happened once before because the civilised were tiny specks of light in the midst of darkness but what for example could break down the great country in which you dwell no our civilisation will endure and grow more complex man will live in the air and below the water preventive medicine will develop until old age shall become the sole cause of death education and a more socialistic scheme of society will do away with crime the englishspeaking races will unite with their centre in the united states gradually the european states will follow their example war will become rare but more terrible the forms of religion will be abandoned but the essence will be maintained so that one universal creed will embrace the whole civilised earth which will preach trust in that central power which will be as unknown then as now thats my horoscope and after that the solar system may be ripe for picking but bertie swanborough and stark munro will be blowing about on the west wind and dirtying the panes of careful housewives long before the half of it has come to pass and then man himself will change of course the teeth are going rapidly youve only to count the dentists brass plates in birchespool to be sure of that and the hair also and the sight instinctively when we think of the more advanced type of young man we picture him as bald and with double eyeglasses i am an absolute animal myself and my only sign of advance is that two of my back teeth are going on the other hand there is some evidence in favour of the development of a sixth sensethat of perception if i had it now i should know that you are heartily weary of all my generalisations and dogmatism and certainly there must be a spice of dogmatism in it when we begin laying down laws about the future for how do we know that there are not phases of nature coming upon us of which we have formed no conception after all a few seconds are a longer fraction of a day than an average life is of the period during which we know that the world has been in existence but if a man lived only for a few seconds of daylight his son the same and his son the same what would their united experiences after a hundred generations tell them of the phenomenon which we call night so all our history and knowledge is no guarantee that our earth is not destined for experiences of which we can form no conception but to drop down from the universe to my own gnats buzz of an existence i think i have told you everything that might interest you of the first six months of my venture towards the end of that time my little brother paul came down and the best of companions he is he shares the discomforts of my little menage in the cheeriest spirit takes me out of my blacker humours goes long walks with me is interested in all that interests me i always talk to him exactly as if he were of my own age and is quite ready to turn his hand to anything from bootblacking to medicinecarrying his one dissipation is cutting out of paper or buying in lead on the rare occasion when we find a surplus an army of little soldiers i have brought a patient into the consulting room and found a torrent of cavalry infantry and artillery pouring across the table i have been myself attacked as i sat silently writing and have looked up to find fringes of sharpshooters pushing up towards me columns of infantry in reserve a troop of cavalry on my flank while a battery of pea muzzle loaders on the ridge of my medical dictionary has raked my whole position with the round smiling face of the general behind it all i dont know how many regiments he has on a peace footing but if serious trouble were to break out i am convinced that every sheet of paper in the house would spring to arms one morning i had a great idea which has had the effect of revolutionising our domestic economy it was at the time when the worst pinch was over and when we had got back as far as butter and occasional tobacco with a milkman calling daily which gives you a great sense of swagger when you have not been used to it paul my boy said i i see my way to fitting up this house with a whole staff of servants for nothing he looked pleased but not surprised he had a wholly unwarranted confidence in my powers so that if i had suddenly declared that i saw my way to tilting queen victoria from her throne and seating myself upon it he would have come without a question to aid and abet i took a piece of paper and wrote to let a basement floor in exchange for services apply oakley villas there paul said i run down to the evening news office and pay a shilling for three insertions there was no need of three insertions one would have been ample within half an hour of the appearance of the first edition i had an applicant at the end of my bellwire and for the remainder of the evening paul was ushering them in and i interviewing them with hardly a break i should have been prepared at the outset to take anything in a petticoat but as we saw the demand increase our conditions went up and up white aprons proper dress for answering door doing beds and boots cooking we became more and more exacting so at last we made our selection a miss wotton who asked leave to bring her sister with her she was a hardfaced brusque mannered person whose appearance in a bachelors household was not likely to cause a scandal her nose was in itself a certificate of virtue she was to bring her furniture into the basement and i was to give her and her sister one of the two upper rooms for a bedroom they moved in a few days later i was out at the time and the first intimation i had was finding three little dogs in my hall when i returned i had her up and explained that this was a breach of contract and that i had no thoughts of running a menagerie she pleaded very hard for her little dogs which it seems are a mother and two daughters of some rare breed so i at last gave in on the point the other sister appeared to lead a subterranean troglodytic sort of existence for though i caught a glimpse of her whisking round the corner at times it was a good month before i could have sworn to her in a police court for a time the arrangement worked well and then there came complications one morning coming down earlier than usual i saw a small bearded man undoing the inside chain of my door i captured him before he could get it open well said i whats this if you please sir said he im miss wottons husband dreadful doubts of my housekeeper flashed across my mind but i thought of her nose and was reassured an examination revealed everything she was a married woman the lines were solemnly produced her husband was a seaman she had passed as a miss because she thought i was more likely to take a housekeeper without encumbrances her husband had come home unexpectedly from a long voyage and had returned last night and then plot within plot the other woman was not her sister but a friend whose name was miss williams she thought i was more likely to take two sisters than two friends so we all came to know who the other was and i having given jack permission to remain assigned the other top room to miss williams from absolute solitude i seemed to be rapidly developing into the keeper of a casual ward it was a neverfailing source of joy to us to see the procession pass on the way to their rooms at night first came a dog then miss williams with a candle then jack then another dog and finally mrs wotton with her candle in one hand and another dog under her arm jack was with us for three weeks and as i made him holystone the whole place down twice a week until the boards were like a quarter deck we got something out of him in return for his lodging about this time finding a few shillings over and no expense imminent i laid down a cellar in the shape of a four and a half gallon cask of beer with a firm resolution that it should never be touched save on high days and holidays or when guests had to be entertained shortly afterwards jack went away to sea again and after his departure there were several furious quarrels between the women down below which filled the whole house with treble reproaches and repartees at last one evening miss williams the quiet one came to me and announced with sobs that she must go mrs wotton made her life unbearable she said she was determined to be independent and had fitted up a small shop in a poor quarter of the town she was going now at once to take possession of it i was sorry because i liked miss williams and i said a few words to that effect she got as far as the hall door and then came rustling back again into the consulting room take a drink of your own beer she cried and vanished it sounded like some sort of slang imprecation if she had said oh pull up your socks i should have been less surprised and then suddenly the words took a dreadful meaning in my mind and i rushed to the cellar the cask was tilted forward on the trestles i struck it and it boomed like a drum i turned the tap and not one drop appeared let us draw a veil over the painful scene suffice it that mrs wotton got her marching orders then and there and that next day paul and i found ourselves alone in the empty house once more but we were demoralised by luxury we could no longer manage without a helper especially now in the winter time when fires had to be lit the most heart breaking task that a man can undertake i bethought me of the quiet miss williams and hunted her up in her shop she was quite willing to come and saw how she could get out of the rent but the difficulty lay with her stock this sounded formidable at first but when i came to learn that the whole thing had cost eleven shillings it did not appear insurmountable in half an hour my watch was pawned and the affair concluded i returned with an excellent housekeeper and with a larger basketful of inferior swedish matches bootlaces cakes of black lead and little figures made of sugar than i should have thought it possible to get for the money so now we have settled down and i hope that a period of comparative peace lies before us goodbye old chap and never think that i forget you your letters are read and reread with avidity i think i have every line you ever wrote me you simply knock paley out every time i am so glad that you got out of that brewery business all right for a time i was really afraid that you must either lose your money or else risk more upon the shares i can only thank you for your kind offer of blank cheques it is wonderful that you should have slipped back into your american life so easily after your english hiatus as you say however it is not a change but only a modification since the root idea is the same in each is it not strange how the two great brothers are led to misunderstand each other a man is punished for private libel over here at any rate although the consequences can only be slight but a man may perpetrate international libel which is a very heinous and farreaching offence and there is no law in the world which can punish him think of the contemptible crew of journalists and satirists who for ever picture the englishman as haughty and hdropping or the american as vulgar and expectorating if some millionaire would give them all a trip round the world we should have some rest and if the plug came out of the boat midway it would be more restful still and your votehunting politicians with their tailtwisting campaigns and our editors of the supercilious weeklies with their inane tone of superiority if they were all aboard how much clearer we should be once more adieu and good luck xv oakley villas birchespool rd august do you think that such a thing as chance exists rather an explosive sentence to start a letter with but pray cast your mind back over your own life and tell me if you think that we really are the sports of chance you know how often the turning down this street or that the accepting or rejecting of an invitation may deflect the whole current of our lives into some other channel are we mere leaves fluttered hither and thither by the wind or are we rather with every conviction that we are free agents carried steadily along to a definite and predetermined end i confess that as i advance through life i become more and more confirmed in that fatalism to which i have always had an inclination look at it in this way we know that many of the permanent facts of the universe are not chance it is not chance that the heavenly bodies swing clear of each other that the seed is furnished with the apparatus which will drift it to a congenial soil that the creature is adapted to its environment show me a whale with its greatcoat of fat and i want no further proof of design but logically as it seems to me all must be design or all must be chance i do not see how one can slash a line right across the universe and say that all to the right of that is chance and all to the left is preordained you would then have to contend that things which on the face of them are of the same class are really divided by an impassable gulf and that the lower are regulated while the higher are not you would for example be forced to contend that the number of articulations in a fleas hind leg has engaged the direct superintendence of the creator while the mischance which killed a thousand people in a theatre depended upon the dropping of a wax vesta upon the floor and was an unforeseen flaw in the chain of life this seems to me to be unthinkable it is a very superficial argument to say that if a man holds the views of a fatalist he will therefore cease to strive and will wait resignedly for what fate may send him the objector forgets that among the other things fated is that we of northern blood should strive and should not sit down with folded hands but when a man has striven when he has done all he knows and when in spite of it a thing comes to pass let him wait ten years before he says that it is a misfortune it is part of the main line of his destiny then and is working to an end a man loses his fortune he gains earnestness his eyesight goes it leads him to a spirituality the girl loses her beauty she becomes more sympathetic we think we are pushing our own way bravely but there is a great hand in ours all the time youll wonder what has taken me off on this line only that i seem to see it all in action in my own life but as usual i have started merrily off with an appendix so i shall go back and begin my report as nearly as possible where i ended the last first of all i may say generally that the clouds were thinning then and that they broke shortly afterwards during the last few months we have never once quite lost sight of the sun you remember that we paul and i had just engaged a certain miss williams to come and keep house for us i felt that on the basementlodger principle i had not control enough so we now entered upon a more business like arrangement by which a sum though alas an absurdly small one was to be paid her for her services i would it had been ten times as much for a better and a more loyal servant man never had our fortunes seemed to turn from the hour that she reentered the house slowly week by week and month by month the practice began to spread and to strengthen there were spells when never a ring came to the bell and it seemed as though all our labour had gone for nothing but then would come other days when eight and ten names would appear in my ledger where did it come from you will ask some from old whitehall and his circle of bohemians some from accident cases some from new comers to the town who drifted to me some from people whom i met first in other capacities an insurance superintendent gave me a few cases to examine and that was a very great help above all i learned a fact which i would whisper in the ear of every other man who starts as i have done a stranger among strangers do not think that practice will come to you you must go to it you may sit upon your consulting room chair until it breaks under you but without purchase or partnership you will make little or no progress the way to do it is to go out to mix everywhere with men to let them know you you will come back many a time and be told by a reproachful housekeeper that some one has been for you in your absence never mind go out again a noisy smoking concert where you will meet eighty men is better for you than the patient or two whom you might have seen at home it took me some time to realise but i speak now as one who knows but there is a great big but in the case you must ride yourself on the curb the whole time unless you are sure absolutely sure that you can do this you are far best at home you must never for one instant forget yourself you must remember what your object is in being there you must inspire respect be friendly genial convivial what you will but preserve the tone and bearing of a gentleman if you can make yourself respected and liked you will find every club and society that you join a fresh introduction to practice but beware of drink above everything beware of drink the company that you are in may condone it in each other but never in the man who wishes them to commit their lives to his safe keeping a slip is fatal a half slip perilous make your rule of life and go by it in spite of challenge or coaxers it will be remembered in your favour next morning and of course i do not mean merely festive societies literary debating political social athletic every one of them is a tool to your hands but you must show them what a good man you are you must throw yourself into each with energy and conviction you will soon find yourself on the committee possibly the secretary or even in the presidential chair do not grudge labour where the return may be remote and indirect those are the rungs up which one climbs that was how when i had gained some sort of opening i set to work to enlarge it i joined this i joined that i pushed in every direction i took up athletics again much to the advantage of my health and found that the practice benefited as well as i my cricket form for the season has been fair with an average of about with the bat and with the ball it must be allowed however that this system of sallying out for my patients and leaving my consulting room empty might be less successful if it were not for my treasure of a housekeeper she is a marvel of discretion and the way in which she perjures her soul for the sake of the practice is a constant weight upon my conscience she is a tall thin woman with a grave face and an impressive manner her standard fiction implied rather than said with an air as if it were so universally known that it would be absurd to put it into words is that i am so pressed by the needs of my enormous practice that any one wishing to consult me must make their appointment very exactly and a long time in advance dear me now she says to some applicant hes been hurried off again if youd been here halfan hour ago he might have given you a minute i never saw such a thing confidentially between you and me i dont think he can last at it long hes bound to break down but come in and ill do all i can for you then having carefully fastened the patient up in the consulting room she goes to little paul run round to the bowling green master paul says she youll find the doctor there i think just tell him that a patient is waiting for him she seems in these interviews to inspire them with a kind of hushed feeling of awe as if they had found their way into some holy of holies my own actual appearance is quite an anticlimax after the introduction by miss williams another of her devices is to make appointments with an extreme precision as to time i being at the moment worked to death at a cricket match let us see says she looking at the slate he will be clear at seven minutes past eight this evening yes he could just manage it then he has no one at all from seven past to the quarter past and so at the appointed hour i have my patient precipitating himself into my room with the demeanour of the man who charges in for his bowl of hot soup at a railway station if he knew that he is probably the only patient who has opened my door that evening he would not be in such a hurry or think so much of my advice one curious patient has come my way who has been of great service to me she is a stately looking widow turner by name the most depressingly respectable figure as of mrs grundys older and less frivolous sister she lives in a tiny house with one small servant to scale well every two months or so she quite suddenly goes on a mad drink which lasts for about a week it ends as abruptly as it begins but while it is on the neighbours know it she shrieks yells sings chivies the servant and skims plates out of the window at the passersby of course it is really not funny but pathetic and deplorable all the same it is hard to keep from laughing at the absurd contrast between her actions and her appearance i was called in by accident in the first instance but i speedily acquired some control over her so that now the neighbours send for me the moment the crockery begins to come through the window she has a fair competence so that her little vagaries are a help to me with my rent she has too a number of curious jugs statues and pictures a selection of which she presents to me in the course of each of her attacks insisting upon my carrying them away then and there so that i stagger out of the house like one of napoleons generals coming out of italy there is a good deal of method in the old lady however and on her recovery she invariably sends round a porter with a polite note to say that she would be very glad to have her pictures back again and now i have worked my way to the point where i can show you what i mean when i talk about fate the medical practitioner who lives next me porter is his name is a kindly sort of man and knowing that i have had a long uphill fight he has several times put things in my way one day about three weeks ago he came into my consulting room after breakfast could you come with me to a consultation he asked with pleasure i have my carriage outside he told me something of the case as we went it was a young fellow an only son who had been suffering from nervous symptoms for some time and lately from considerable pain in his head his people are living with a patient of mine general wainwright said porter he didnt like the symptoms and thought he would have a second opinion we came to the house a great big one in its own grounds and had a preliminary talk with the darkfaced whitehaired indian soldier who owns it he was explaining the responsibility that he felt the patient being his nephew when a lady entered the room this is my sister mrs la force said he the mother of the gentleman whom you are going to see i recognised her instantly i had met her before and under curious circumstances dr stark munro here proceeds to narrate again how he had met the la forces having evidently forgotten that he had already done so in letter vi when she was introduced i could see that she had not associated me with the young doctor in the train i dont wonder for i have started a beard in the hope of making myself look a little older she was naturally all anxiety about her son and we went up with her porter and i to have a look at him poor fellow he seemed peakier and more sallow than when i had seen him last we held our consultation came to an agreement about the chronic nature of his complaint and finally departed without my reminding mrs la force of our previous meeting well there the matter might have ended but about three days afterwards who should be shown into my consulting room but mrs la force and her daughter i thought the latter looked twice at me when her mother introduced her as if she had some recollection of my face but she evidently could not recall where she had seen it and i said nothing to help her they both seemed to be much distressed in mind indeed the tears were brimming over from the girls eyes and her lip was quivering we have come to you doctor munro in the greatest distress said mrs la force we should be very glad of your advice you place me in rather a difficult position mrs la force said i the fact is that i look upon you as dr porters patients and it is a breach of etiquette upon my part to hold any communication with you except through him it was he who sent us here said she oh that alters the matter entirely he said he could do nothing to help us and that perhaps you could pray let me know what you wish done she set out valorously to explain but the effort of putting her troubles into words seemed to bring them more home to her and she suddenly blurred over and became inarticulate her daughter bent towards her and kissed her with the prettiest little spasm of love and pity i will tell you about it doctor said she poor mother is almost worn out fred my brother that is to say is worse he has become noisy and will not be quiet and my brother the general continued mrs la force naturally did not expect this when he kindly offered us a home and being a nervous man it is very trying to him in fact it cannot go on he says so himself but what is mother to do cried the girl taking up the tale again no hotel or lodginghouse would take us in while poor fred is like that and we have not the heart to send him to an asylum uncle will not have us any longer and we have nowhere to go to her grey eyes tried to look brave but her mouth would go down at the corners i rose and walked up and down the room trying to think it all out what i wanted to ask you said mrs la force was whether perhaps you knew some doctor or some private establishment which took in such cases so that we could see fred every day or so the only thing is that he must be taken at once for really my brother has reached the end of his patience i rang the bell for my housekeeper miss williams said i do you think we can furnish a bedroom by tonight so as to take in a gentleman who is ill never have i so admired that wonderful womans self command why easily sir if the patients will only let me alone but with that bell going thirty times an hour its hard to say what you are going to do this with her funny manner set the ladies laughing and the whole business seemed lighter and easier i promised to have the room ready by eight oclock mrs la force arranged to bring her son round at that hour and both ladies thanked me a very great deal more than i deserved for after all it was a business matter and a resident patient was the very thing that i needed i was able to assure mrs la force that i had had a similar case under my charge before meaning of course poor jimmy the son of lord saltire miss williams escorted them to the door and took occasion to whisper to them that it was wonderful how i got through with it and that i was within sight of my carriage it was a short notice but we got everything ready by the hour carpet bed suite curtains all came together and were fixed in their places by the united efforts of miss williams paul and myself sharp at eight a cab arrived and fred was conducted by me into his bedroom the moment i looked at him i could see that he was much worse than when i saw him with dr porter the chronic brain trouble had taken a sudden acute turn his eyes were wild his cheeks flushed his lips drawn slightly away from his teeth his temperature was and he muttered to himself continually and paid no attention to my questions it was evident to me at a glance that the responsibility which i had taken upon myself was to be no light one however we could but do our best i undressed him and got him safely to bed while miss williams prepared some arrowroot for his supper he would eat nothing however but seemed more disposed to dose so having seen him settle down we left him his room was the one next to mine and as the wall was thin i could hear the least movement two or three times he muttered and groaned but finally he became quiet and i was able to drop to sleep at three in the morning i was awakened by a dreadful crash bounding out of bed i rushed into the other room poor fred was standing in his long gown a pathetic little figure in the grey light of the dawning day he had pulled over his washingstand with what object only his bemuddled mind could say and the whole place was a morass of water with islands of broken crockery i picked him up and put him back into his bed again his body glowing through his nightdress and his eyes staring wildly about him it was evidently impossible to leave him and so i spent the rest of the night nodding and shivering in the armchair no it was certainly not a sinecure that i had undertaken in the morning i went round to mrs la force and gave her a bulletin her brother had recovered his serenity now that the patient had left he had the victoria cross it seems and was one of the desperate little garrison who held lucknow in that hellwhirl of a mutiny and now the sudden opening of a door sets him shaking and a dropped tongs gives him palpitations are we not the strangest kind of beings fred was a little better during the day and even seemed in a dull sort of way to recognise his sister who brought him flowers in the afternoon towards evening his temperature sank to and he fell into a kind of stupor as it happened dr porter came in about suppertime and i asked him if he would step up and have a look at my patient he did so and we found him dozing peacefully you would hardly think that that small incident may have been one of the most momentous in my life it was the merest chance in the world that porter went up at all fred was taking medicine with a little chloral in it at this time i gave him his usual dose last thing at night and then as he seemed to be sleeping peacefully i went to my own room for the rest which i badly needed i did not wake until eight in the morning when i was roused by the jingling of a spoon in a saucer and the step of miss williams passing my door she was taking him the arrowroot which i had ordered overnight i heard her open the door and the next moment my heart sprang into my mouth as she gave a hoarse scream and her cup and saucer crashed upon the floor an instant later she had burst into my room with her face convulsed with terror my god she cried hes gone i caught up my dressinggown and rushed into the next room poor little fred was stretched sideways across his bed quite dead he looked as if he had been rising and had fallen backwards his face was so peaceful and smiling that i could hardly have recognised the worried feverworn features of yesterday there is great promise i think on the faces of the dead they say it is but the postmortem relaxation of the muscles but it is one of the points on which i should like to see science wrong miss williams and i stood for five minutes without a word hushed by the presence of that supreme fact then we laid him straight and drew the sheet over him she knelt down and prayed and sobbed while i sat on the bed with the cold hand in mine then my heart turned to lead as i remembered that it lay for me to break the news to the mother however she took it most admirably they were all three at breakfast when i came round the general mrs la force and the daughter somehow they seemed to know all that i had to say at the very sight of me and in their womanly unselfishness their sympathy was all for me for the shock i had suffered and the disturbance of my household i found myself turned from the consoler into the consoled for an hour or more we talked it over i explaining what i hope needed no explanation that as the poor boy could not tell me his symptoms it was hard for me to know how immediate was his danger there can be no doubt that the fall of temperature and the quietness which both porter and i had looked upon as a hopeful sign were really the beginning to the end mrs la force asked me to see to everything the formalities register and funeral it was on a wednesday and we thought it best that the burial should be on the friday back i hurried therefore not knowing what to do first and found old whitehall waiting for me in my consulting room looking very jaunty with a camelia in his buttonhole not an organ in its right place and a camelia in his buttonhole between ourselves i was sorry to see him for i was in no humour for his company but he had heard all about it from miss williams and had come to stop only then did i fully realise how much of the kindly delicate minded gentleman remained behind that veil of profanity and obscenity which he so often held before him ill trot along with you dr munro sir a mans none the worse for a companion at such times ill not open my mouth unless you wish it sir but i am an idle man and would take it as a kindness if you would let me come round with you round he came and very helpful he was he seemed to know all about the procedure buried two wives dr munro sir i signed the certificate myself conveyed it to the registrar got the order for burial took it round to the parish clerk arranged an hour then off to the undertakers and back to my practice it was a kind of nightmare morning to look back upon relieved only by the figure of my old bohemian with his pea jacket his black thorn his puffy crinkly face and his camelia to make a long story short then the funeral came off as arranged general wainwright whitehall and i being the sole mourners the captain had never seen poor fred in the flesh but he liked to be in at the finish sir and so he gave me his company it was at eight in the morning and it was ten before we found ourselves at oakley villa a burly man with bushy whiskers was waiting for us at the door are you dr munro sir he asked i am i am a detective from the local office i was ordered to inquire into the death of the young man in your house lately here was a thunderbolt if looking upset is a sign of guilt i must have stood confessed as a villain it was so absolutely unexpected i hope however that i had command of myself instantly pray step in said i any information i can give you is entirely at your service have you any objection to my friend captain whitehall being present not in the least so in we both went taking this bird of illomen he was however a man of tact and with a pleasant manner of course dr munro said he you are much too well known in the town for any one to take this matter seriously but the fact is that we had an anonymous letter this morning saying that the young man had died yesterday and was to be buried at an unusual hour today and that the circumstances were suspicious he died the day before yesterday he was buried at eight today i explained and then i told him the whole story from the beginning he listened attentively and took a note or two who signed the certificate he asked i did said i he raised his eyebrows slightly there is really no one to check your statement then said he oh yes dr porter saw him the night before he died he knew all about the case the detective shut his notebook with a snap that is final dr munro said he of course i must see dr porter as a matter of form but if his opinion agrees with yours i can only apologise to you for this intrusion and there is one more thing mr detective sir said whitehall explosively im not a rich man sir only the halfpay skipper of an armed transport but by sir id give you this hat full of dollars to know the name of the rascal who wrote that anonymous letter sir by sir youd have a real case to look after then and he waved his black thorn ferociously so the wretched business ended bertie but on what trifling chances do our fortunes depend if porter had not seen him that night it is more than likely that there would have been an exhumation and then well there would be chloral in the body some money interests did depend upon the death of the lad a sharp lawyer might have made much of the case anyway the first breath of suspicion would have blown my little rising practice to wind what awful things lurk at the corners of lifes highway ready to pounce upon us as we pass and so you really are going avoyaging well i wont write again until i hear that you are back from the islands and then i hope to have something a little more cheery to talk about xvi oakley villas birchespool th november i face my study window as i write bertie slate coloured clouds with ragged fringes are drifting slowly overhead between them one has a glimpse of higher clouds of a lighter gray i can hear the gentle swish of the rain striking a clearer note on the gravel path and a duller among the leaves sometimes it falls straight and heavy till the air is full of the delicate gray shading and for half a foot above the ground there is a haze from the rebound of a million tiny globules then without any change in the clouds it cases off again pools line my walk and lie thick upon the roadway their surface pocked by the falling drops as i sit i can smell the heavy perfume of the wet earth and the laurel bushes gleam where the light strikes sideways upon them the gate outside shines above as though it were new varnished and along the lower edge of the upper bar there hangs a fringe of great clear drops that is the best that november can do for us in our dripping little island you i suppose sitting among the dying glories of an american fall think that this must needs be depressing dont make any mistake about that my dear boy you may take the states from detroit to the gulf and you wont find a happier man than this one what do you suppose ive got att hissic at this moment in my consulting room a bureau a bookcase no i know youve guessed my secret already she is sitting in my big armchair and she is the best the kindest the sweetest little woman in england yes ive been married six months now the almanack says months though i should have thought weeks i should of course have sent cake and cards but had an idea that you were not home from the islands yet it is a good year since i wrote to you but when you give an amorphous address of that sort what can you expect ive thought of you and talked of you often enough well i daresay with the acumen of an old married man you have guessed who the lady is as well we surely know by some nameless instinct more about our futures than we think we know i can remember for example that years ago the name of bradfield used to strike with a causeless familiarity upon my ear and since then as you know the course of my life has flowed through it and so when i first saw winnie la force in the railway carriage before i had spoken to her or knew her name i felt an inexplicable sympathy for and interest in her have you had no experience of the sort in your life or was it merely that she was obviously gentle and retiring and so made a silent claim upon all that was helpful and manly in me at any rate i was conscious of it and again and again every time that i met her how good is that saying of some russian writer that he who loves one woman knows more of the whole sex than he who has had passing relations with a thousand i thought i knew something of women i suppose every medical student does but now i can see that i really knew nothing my knowledge was all external i did not know the woman soul that crowning gift of providence to man which if we do not ourselves degrade it will set an edge to all that is good in us i did not know how the love of a woman will tinge a mans whole life and every action with unselfishness i did not know how easy it is to be noble when some one else takes it for granted that one will be so or how wide and interesting life becomes when viewed by four eyes instead of two i had much to learn you see but i think i have learned it it was natural that the death of poor fred la force should make me intimate with the family it was really that cold hand which i grasped that morning as i sat by his bed which drew me towards my happiness i visited them frequently and we often went little excursions together then my dear mother came down to stay with me for a spell and turned miss williams gray by looking for dust in all sorts of improbable corners or advancing with a terrible silence a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other to the attack of a spiders web which she had marked down in the beer cellar her presence enabled me to return some of the hospitality which i had received from the la forces and brought us still nearer together i had never yet reminded them of our previous meeting one evening however the talk turned upon clairvoyance and mrs la force was expressing the utmost disbelief in it i borrowed her ring and holding it to my forehead i pretended to be peering into her past i see you in a railway carriage said i you are wearing a red feather in your bonnet miss la force is dressed in something dark there is a young man there he is rude enough to address your daughter as winnie before he has ever been oh mother she cried of course it is he the face haunted me and i could not think where we had met it well there are some things that we dont talk about to another man even when we know each other as well as i know you why should we when that which is most engrossing to us consists in those gradual shades of advance from friendship to intimacy and from intimacy to something more sacred still which can scarcely be written at all far less made interesting to another the time came at last when they were to leave birchespool and my mother and i went round the night before to say goodbye winnie and i were thrown together for an instant when will you come back to birchespool i asked mother does not know will you come soon and be my wife i had been turning over in my head all the evening how prettily i could lead up to it and how neatly i could say it and behold the melancholy result well perhaps the feeling of my heart managed to make itself clear even through those bald words there was but one to judge and she was of that opinion i was so lost in my own thoughts that i walked as far as oakley villa with my mother before i opened my mouth mam said i at last i have proposed to winnie la force and she has accepted me my boy said she you are a true packenham and so i knew that my mothers approval had reached the point of enthusiasm it was not for days not until i expressed a preference for dust under the bookcase with quiet against purity and ructions that the dear old lady perceived traces of the munros the time originally fixed for the wedding was six months after this but we gradually whittled it down to five and to four my income had risen to about two hundred and seventy pounds at the time and winnie had agreed with a somewhat enigmatical smile that we could manage very well on that the more so as marriage sends a doctors income up the reason of her smile became more apparent when a few weeks before that date i received a most portentous blue document in which we brown woodhouse the solicitors for the herein and hereafter mentioned winifred la force do hereby state a surprising number of things and use some remarkably bad english the meaning of it when all the whereass and aforesaids were picked out was that winnie had about a hundred a year of her own it could not make me love her a shade better than i did but at the same time i wont be so absurd as to say that i was not glad or to deny that it made our marriage much easier than it would otherwise have been poor whitehall came in on the morning of the ceremony he was staggering under the weight of a fine japanese cabinet which he had carried round from his lodgings i had asked him to come to the church and the old gentleman was resplendent in a white waistcoat and a silk tie between ourselves i had been just a little uneasy lest his excitement should upset him as in the case of the dinner but nothing could be more exemplary than his conduct and appearance i had introduced him to winnie some days before youll forgive me for saying dr munro sir that you are a lucky fellow said he youve put your hand in the bag sir and taken out the eel first time as any one with half an eye can see now ive had three dips and landed a snake every dip if id had a good woman at my side dr munro sir i might not be the broken halfpay skipper of an armed transport today i thought you had been twice married captain three times sir i buried two the other lives at brussels well ill be at the church dr munro sir and you may lay that there is no one there who wishes you better than i do and yet there were many there who wished me well my patients had all got wind of it and they assembled by the pewfull looking distressingly healthy my neighbour dr porter was there also to lend me his support and old general wainwright gave winnie away my mother mrs la force and miss williams were all in the front pew and away at the back of the church i caught a glimpse of the forked beard and crinkly face of whitehall and beside him the wounded lieutenant the man who ran away with the cook and quite a line of the strange bohemians who followed his fortunes then when the words were said and mans form had tried to sanctify that which was already divine we walked amid the pealings of the wedding march into the vestry where my dear mother relieved the tension of the situation by signing the register in the wrong place so that to all appearance it was she who had just married the clergyman and then amid congratulations and kindly faces we were together her hand on my forearm upon the steps of the church and saw the familiar road stretching before us but it was not that road which lay before my eyes but rather the path of our lives that broader path on which our feet were now planted so pleasant to tread and yet with its course so shrouded in the mist was it long or was it short was it uphill or was it down for her at least it should be smooth if a mans love could make it so we were away for several weeks in the isle of man and then came back to oakley villa where miss williams was awaiting us in a house in which even my mother could have found no dust and with a series of cheering legends as to the crowds of patients who had blocked the street in my absence there really was a marked increase in my practice and for the last six months or so without being actually busy i have always had enough to occupy me my people are poor and i have to work hard for a small fee but i still study and attend the local hospital and keep my knowledge uptodate so as to be ready for my opening when it comes there are times when i chafe that i may not play a part upon some larger stage than this but my happiness is complete and if fate has no further use for me i am content now from my heart to live and to die where i am you will wonder perhaps how we get on my wife and i in the matter of religion well we both go our own ways why should i proselytise i would not for the sake of abstract truth take away her childlike faith which serves to make life easier and brighter to her i have made myself illunderstood by you in these discursive letters if you have read in them any bitterness against the orthodox creeds far from saying that they are all false it would express my position better to say that they are all true providence would not have used them were they not the best available tools and in that sense divine that they are final i deny a simpler and more universal creed will take their place when the mind of man is ready for it and i believe it will be a creed founded upon those lines of absolute and provable truth which i have indicated but the old creeds are still the best suited to certain minds and to certain ages if they are good enough for providence to use they are good enough for us to endure we have but to wait upon the survival of the truest if i have seemed to say anything aggressive against them it was directed at those who wish to limit the almightys favour to their own little clique or who wish to build a chinese wall round religion with no assimilation of fresh truths and no hope of expansion in the future it is with these that the pioneers of progress can hold no truce as for my wife i would as soon think of breaking in upon her innocent prayers as she would of carrying off the works of philosophy from my study table she is not narrow in her views but if one could stand upon the very topmost pinnacle of broad mindedness one would doubtless see from it that even the narrow have their mission about a year ago i had news of cullingworth from smeaton who was in the same football team at college and who had called when he was passing through bradfield his report was not a very favourable one the practice had declined considerably people had no doubt accustomed themselves to his eccentricities and these had ceased to impress them again there had been one or two coroners inquests which had spread the impression that he had been rash in the use of powerful drugs if the coroner could have seen the hundreds of cures which cullingworth had effected by that same rashness he would have been less confident with his censures but as you can understand cs rival medical men were not disposed to cover him in any way he had never had much consideration for them besides this decline in his practice i was sorry to hear that cullingworth had shown renewed signs of that curious vein of suspicion which had always seemed to me to be the most insane of all his traits his whole frame of mind towards me had been an example of it but as far back as i can remember it had been a characteristic even in those early days when they lived in four little rooms above a grocers shop i recollect that he insisted upon gumming up every chink of one bedroom for fear of some imaginary infection he was haunted too with a perpetual dread of eavesdroppers which used to make him fly at the door and fling it open in the middle of his conversation pouncing out into the passage with the idea of catching somebody in the act once it was the maid with the tea tray that he caught i remember and i can see her astonished face now with an aureole of flying cups and lumps of sugar smeaton tells me that this has now taken the form of imagining that some one is conspiring to poison him with copper against which he takes the most extravagant precautions it is the strangest sight he says to see cullingworth at his meals for he sits with an elaborate chemical apparatus and numerous retorts and bottles at his elbow with which he tests samples of every course i could not help laughing at smeatons description and yet it was a laugh with a groan underlying it of all ruins that of a fine man is the saddest i never thought i should have seen cullingworth again but fate has brought us together i have always had a kindly feeling for him though i feel that he used me atrociously often i have wondered whether if i were placed before him i should take him by the throat or by the hand you will be interested to hear what actually occurred one day just a week or so back i was starting on my round when a boy arrived with a note it fairly took my breath away when i saw the familiar writing and realised that cullingworth was in birchespool i called winnie and we read it together dear munro it said james is in lodgings here for a few days we are on the point of leaving england he would be glad for the sake of old times to have a chat with you before he goes yours faithfully hetty cullingworth the writing was his and the style of address so that it was evidently one of those queer little bits of transparent cunning which were characteristic of him to make it come from his wife that he might not lay himself open to a direct rebuff the address curiously enough was that very cadogan terrace at which i had lodged but two doors higher up well i was averse from going myself but winnie was all for peace and forgiveness women who claim nothing invariably get everything and so my gentle little wife always carries her point half an hour later i was in cadogan terrace with very mixed feelings but the kindlier ones at the top i tried to think that cullingworths treatment of me had been pathological the result of a diseased brain if a delirious man had struck me i should not have been angry with him that must be my way of looking at it if cullingworth still bore any resentment he concealed it most admirably but then i knew by experience that that genial loudvoiced johnbull manner of his could conceal many things his wife was more open and i could read in her tightened lips and cold grey eyes that she at least stood fast to the old quarrel cullingworth was little changed and seemed to be as sanguine and as full of spirits as ever sound as a trout my boy he cried drumming on his chest with his hands played for the london scottish in their opening match last week and was on the ball from whistle to whistle not so quick on a sprint you find that yourself munro eh what but a good hard working bullocky forward last match i shall have for many a day for i am off to south america next week you have given up bradfield altogether then too provincial my boy whats the good of a village practice with a miserable three thousand or so a year for a man that wants room to spread my head was sticking out at one end of bradfield and my feet at the other why there wasnt room for hetty in the place let alone me ive taken to the eye my boy theres a fortune in the eye a man grudges a halfcrown to cure his chest or his throat but hed spend his last dollar over his eye theres money in ears but the eye is a gold mine what said i in south america just exactly in south america he cried pacing with his quick little steps up and down the dingy room look here laddie theres a great continent from the equator to the icebergs and not a man in it who could correct an astigmatism what do they know of modern eye surgery and refraction why dammy they dont know much about it in the provinces of england yet let alone brazil man if you could only see it theres a fringe of squinting millionaires sitting ten deep round the whole continent with their money in their hands waiting for an oculist eh munro what by crums ill come back and ill buy bradfield and ill give it away as a tip to a waiter you propose to settle in some large city then city what use would a city be to me im there to squeeze the continent i work a town at a time i send on an agent to the next to say that i am coming i heres the chance of a lifetime says he no need to go back to europe heres europe come to you squints cataracts iritis refractions what you like heres the great signor cullingworth right up to date and ready for anything in they come of course droves of them and then i arrive and take the money heres my luggage he pointed to two great hampers in the corner of the room those are glasses my boy concave and convex hundreds of them i test an eye fit him on the spot and send him away shouting then i load up a steamer and come home unless i elect to buy one of their little states and run it of course it sounded absurd as he put it but i could soon see that he had worked out his details and that there was a very practical side to his visions i work bahia said he my agent prepares pernambuco when bahia is squeezed dry i move on to pernambuco and the agent ships to monte video so we work our way round with a trail of spectacles behind us itll go like clockwork you will need to speak spanish said i tut it does not take any spanish to stick a knife into a mans eye all i shall want to know is money down no credit thats spanish enough for me we had a long and interesting talk about all that had happened to both of us without however any allusion to our past quarrel he would not admit that he had left bradfield on account of a fallingoff in his practice or for any reason except that he found the place too small his springscreen invention had he said been favourably reported upon by one of the first private shipbuilding firms on the clyde and there was every probability of their adopting it as to the magnet said he im very sorry for my country but there is no more command of the seas for her ill have to let the thing go to the germans its not my fault they must not blame me when the smash comes i put the thing before the admiralty and i could have made a board school understand it in half the time such letters munro colney hatch on blue paper when the war comes and i show those letters somebody will be hanged questions about this questions about that at last they asked me what i proposed to fasten my magnet to i answered to any solid impenetrable object such as the head of an admiralty official well that broke the whole thing up they wrote with their compliments and they were returning my apparatus i wrote with my compliments and they might go to the devil and so ends a great historical incident munro eh what we parted very good friends but with reservations i fancy on both sides his last advice to me was to clear out of birchespool you can do better you can do better laddie said he look round the whole world and when you see a little round hole jump in feet foremost theres a lot of em about if a man keeps himself ready so those were the last words of cullingworth and the last that i may ever see of him also for he starts almost immediately upon his strange venture he must succeed he is a man whom nothing could hold down i wish him luck and have a kindly feeling towards him and yet i distrust him from the bottom of my heart and shall be just as pleased to know that the atlantic rolls between us well my dear bertie a happy and tranquil if not very ambitious existence stretches before us we are both in our twentyfifth year and i suppose that without presumption we can reckon that thirtyfive more years lie in front of us i can foresee the gradually increasing routine of work the wider circle of friends the indentification with this or that local movement with perhaps a seat on the bench or at least in the municipal council in my later years its not a very startling programme is it but it lies to my hand and i see no other i should dearly love that the world should be ever so little better for my presence even on this small stage we have our two sides and something might be done by throwing all ones weight on the scale of breadth tolerance charity temperance peace and kindliness to man and beast we cant all strike very big blows and even the little ones count for something so goodbye my dear boy and remember that when you come to england our home would be the brighter for your presence in any case now that i have your address i shall write again in a very few weeks my kindest regards to mrs swanborough yours ever j stark munro this is the last letter which i was destined to receive from my poor friend he started to spend the christmas of that year with his people and on the journey was involved in the fatal railroad accident at sittingfleet where the express ran into a freight train which was standing in the depot dr and mrs munro were the only occupants of the car next the locomotive and were killed instantly as were the brakesman and one other passenger it was such an end as both he and his wife would have chosen and no one who knew them would regret that neither was left to mourn the other his insurance policy of eleven hundred pounds was sufficient to provide for the wants of his own family which as his father was sick was the one worldly matter which could have caused him concern h s
