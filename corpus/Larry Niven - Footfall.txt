 prologue where are they enrico fermi the fifth part of the year three within its broad array of nested rings the planet was a seething storm it had always been so patterns chased themselves across its brownonbrown face in bands and curlicues the space around it churned with activity billions of icy particles in a broad array of nested rings eights of moons streamers of dust whipped by powerful magnetic fields all whirling around at terrific velocities at several makasrupkithp per breath message bearer maneuvered within that storm the herdmasters advisor gazing raptly through the thick double window seemed to notice only the beauty of the scene the herdmaster found that irritating his own domain included collisions industrial operations internal quarrels and the peaceful integration of sleepers with spaceborn he had quite enough problems without that message bearers main telescope was the equal of any astronomical installation on the world they had left behind the alien probe was close now by astronomical standards and the screen showed it in fine detail a circular antenna a pod at the tip of a long boom radiated infrared warmth that would be the power supply two more booms thrust instruments outward clasp digits with me that i may know your herd one extension held what had to be cameras the other some kind of electronic sensing device sixtyfour sleepers the breakers team were working now to infer what they could about the creatures who had built that machine they hadnt told the herdmaster anything useful when the camera platform began to turn the herdmasters digits flexed restlessly you made your decision half a year ago advisor fathistehtulk said placidly you did not destroy it then how can you destroy it now here is where their fragile spy probe must pass through endless orbiting debris it must survive collisions radiation orbital fluctuations and any unreal danger the prey may imagine here is where some mischance is most likely to smash it we agreed that the probe will find no trace of us message bearer is tiny on this scale surely the probe is not seeking us it was launched long before we arrived but if there were something to see yonder camera might have seen it by now some evidence of our presence vivid in their receivers and now comes a flash of light then silence from the probe ever after would that tickle your suspicions if you were herdmaster would you continue to worry that was cruel at the beginning of things fathistehtulk had been herdmaster he had entered his deathsleep expecting to be herdmaster again in his present subservient position the concerns of a herdmaster seemed not to bother him at all sometimes herdmaster pastempehkeph wondered if he was being mocked were i herdmaster the advisor said placidly i would do as you have done rest quiet while the probe passes through make no attempt to move the ship send no message to our work force on the foot let the probe pass when the second probe comes we will be established on the foot let them try to distinguish us against an unknown background and he turned from the telescope screen perhaps pointedly to gaze on the great brownpatterned world and its vast rings the herdmaster said i worry for much of their history the prey must have studied this great gaudy ornament in their sky they would know what to expect better than we do after less than a year what have we missed outside the broad main ring system a narrower ring still roiled from the wake of message bearers drive november as she closed the gate and automatically picked up a scrap of paper that had blown into the yard linda gillespie realized that she was beginning to think of this house a typical california development splitlevel as home that would mike the second home since she was married there had been three other places they hadnt stayed in long enough to think about as homelike at all five moves in four years the air force was a mobile service especially for hot fighter pilots the best place had been in texas when edmund had been with the astronaut office and theyd lived in el lago but this couldnt really be home it was just a rented house a place to stay during edmunds tour at the space and missiles systems organization in los angeles now that hed been assigned as a shuttle pilot theyd move again back to houston that would be nice houston treated astronauts and their families very well indeed it was a gloomy los angeles november morning chilly even through her cashmere sweater with low clouds and fog the air smelled damp with a trace of the odor of smog there was no sunshine although by noon there would be it wasnt pleasant outside inside was better she poured coffee and sat at the kitchen table too early for ed to call he wouldnt anyway he never did when he was out of town its all very well to be married to an astronaut hero but it would be nice to have a husband at home once in a while the los angeles times lay on the table and she thumbed through it she didnt like to be alone at home but she didnt want to go anywhere either ed could assure her she was perfectly safe much safer than in washington where shed grown up and she could believe him but she knew washington and los angeles was a mystery one san francisco columnist kept teasing los angeles about being invisible there was also the hollywood strangler and a man alleged to be the freeway killer was on trial for the torture sex murders of a dozen young boys great place to raise children she folded the paper time to wax the kitchen floor she decided ed didnt care much but his colonel would come to dinner next week and colonel mcreadys wife was inclined to snoop besides it wasnt that hard to do floors ed wouldnt approve not now she grinned and looked down at her stomach didnt show a bit she wasnt sick either and if it hadnt been for the missed periods and medical reports thered be no reason to suspect she was pregnant even so ed treated her like she was made of dresden china he carried out the garbage did all the lifting and worried about hurting her during sex that thought made her frown ed went all gooey over her pregnancy but it turned him off maybe ill lose interest in a month or so i sure hope so the way he acts linda poured more coffee the telephone rang startling her so that she dropped the cup it was corningware and didnt break but it clattered loudly on the floor spilling coffee everywhere hello linda yes by golly it is you its roger oh how are you roger great glad you havent forgotten me no i havent forgotten you dont forget your first she thought first love first sex experience first a lot of firsts with roger back in high school and just after and what should i say that he hasnt called in a long time but thats all right because i didnt want him to roger how did you get our number we reporters have our ways hey id like to see you what about a really unusual experience she giggled roger im a married woman sure happily yes of course good good for you and edmund anyway what i have in mind is in edmunds line jpl the saturn encounter voyager is out there getting pictures nobody understands and we can see them firsthand he paused a moment its this way im here in los angeles covering the saturn story not exactly pulitzer prize material but i took the assignment to get away from washington for a while so im out at the jet propulsion laboratory where the pictures come in we get briefings from the scientists and theres sciencefiction writers and its a hell of a show let me pick you up on my way out youre almost on the way ill have you home by dinnertime and i wont try to seduce you and ed was gone for a week its tempting it really is but i cant sure you can roger my sister is staying here so what ill have you home before dinner linda thought about that jenny was off somewhere for the day saturn pictures reporters it might be fun you said science fiction writers is nat reynolds there yeah i think so just a second theres a list yeah hes there know him no but edmund likes his books i bought one for his birthday think i could get it autographed an astronauts wife hell those scifi types will turn flips to meet you nat reynolds was hung over and it was far too early to be up it was a miracle hed made it up the arroyo to the jet propulsion laboratory parking lot and got the porsche into the tiny slot the jpl guard had showed him there were cars parked for half a mile along the road leading to where jpl nestled in what had once been a lonely arroyo the sweet immediately outside the press center was nearly blocked by tv vans and a thick web of cables spanned the sidewalk to vanish through open loading doors the press corps had turned out in force bringing almost as many cameras and crews as theyd send to the site of a bank robbery in progress the von karman auditorium was a madhouse nearly every square foot of floor space was covered by someone scientist public relations press corps most holding coffee cups or carrying bulky objects the press corps was divided there were the working press and there were the sciencefiction writers and no doubt about who was who the press was there to work some had fun but all had deadlines the sf types were there to gawk and be part of the scene and absorb the atmosphere and maybe someday it would get into a story and maybe not their world was being created and they were here to see it happen this is saturn huge tv screens showed pictures as they came in from the voyager every few minutes a picture changed a close view of the planet blackandwhite streamlines and whorls rings hundreds of them like a closeup of a phonograph record saturn again in color with his rings in wide angle sections of the rings in closeup shots of moons all just as it came in so that the press saw it as soon as the scientists at the jupiter passings the pictures had come in faster in vivid swirls and endless storms god making merry with an airbrush and four moons that turned out to be worlds in their own right but to balance that theyd soon see titan which was known to have an atmosphere sagan and the other scientists werent saying they hoped to find life on titan but they were certainly interested in the giant moon which had so far been disappointingly featureless the screens shifted and the babble in the room fell off for a moment a moon like a giant eyeball one tremendous crater of the proportions of an iris with a central peak for the pupil anything bigger nat thought would have shattered the whole moon he heard a female voice say well weve located the death star and he grinned without turning around what do the newspeople think of us he could picture himself the idiot grin mouth slightly open drifting down the line of screens without looking where he was going tripping over cables nat couldnt make himself care a screen changed to show something like a dry riverbed or three twined plumes of smoke or fring the printout said nat said what the hell youd know if youd been here last night ive got to get some sleep nat didnt need to look around hed written two books with wade curtis he expected to recognize that voice in hell when they planned their escape wade curtis talked like he had an amplifier in his throat turned high partly that was his military training partly the deafness hed earned as an artillery officer he also had a tendency to lecture fring he said you know like a b c rings only theyre named in order of discovery not distance from the planet so the systems all screwed up the fring is the one just outside the big body of rings its thin nobody ever saw it until the space probes went out there and pioneer didnt get much of a picture even then nat held up his hand i know i know the gesture said curtis shrugged and was quiet but the fring didnt look normal at all it showed as three knotted streamers of gas or dust or god knows what all braided together braided nat said what does that none of the astronomers wanted to say okay i can see why catch me in a mistake i shrug it off a scientist hes betting his career yeah well i know of no law of physics that would permit that nat didnt either he said whats the matter havent you ever seen three earthworms in love and accepted wades appreciative chuckle as his due id be afraid to write about it someone would have it explained before i could get the story into print the press conference was ready to start the jpl camera crew unlimbered its gear to broadcast the press conference all over the laboratory grounds and one of the public relations ladies went around turning off the screens in the conference mom hmm interesting stuff still coming in curtis said and there arent any seats i had a couple but i gave them to the washington post frontrow seats too too bad nat said what the hell lets watch the conference from the reception area jillys out there already on the morning of november the pressroom at jet propulsion laboratories was a tangled maze of video equipment and moving elbows roger and linda had come early but not early enough to get seats a sciencefiction writer in a bush jacket gave up his two right in the front row sure its all right roger asked the scifi man shrugged you need em more than i do tell congress the space programs important thats all i ask roger thanked the man and sat down linda gillespie was trapped near the lifesize spacecraft model fending off still another reporter who was trying to interview her what had it been like marooned on earth while her husband was aboard skylab she looked great he hadnt seen her since since when only twice since shed married edmund and of course hed been at her wedding lindas mother had cried damn near cried myself roger thought how did i let her get out of circulation but i wasnt ready to marry her myself maybe i should have the trouble was he wasnt getting any story he could understand people were excited but they didnt say why the regular science press people werent telling they all knew each other and they resented outsiders at big events like this roger doodled looking up when anyone called a greeting hoping nobody would want his attention he hadnt asked for this assignment he heard havent you ever seen three earthworms in love and looked a clump of sciencefiction writers stood beneath a screen that showed yeah three earthworms in love or a bad photo of spaghetti left on a plate orjust noise he wrote f ring three earthworms in love and tapped lindas shoulder linda save my seat wherere you going maybe i can get something from the sciencefiction writers nobody else was trying that it might get him a new slant at least theyd talk english it looks like things are starting frank bristow the jpl newsroom manager had taken his place at the podium roger had met him briefly when signing in the regular press corps all seemed to know him as well as each other roger didnt know anyone bristow was about to make his opening statement the voyager project manager and four astrophysicists were taking their seats at a raised table brooks sat down again he wished he were somewhere elseroger brooks was approaching thirty and he didnt like it there were temptations in his job too much free food and booze he took care to maintain the muscle tone when his lifestyle didnt his straight blond hair was beginning to thin and that worried him a little but his jaw was still square with none of the softening he saw in his friends he had given up smoking three years ago flatly and suffered through horrid withdrawal symptoms his teeth were white again but the scars between the index and middle fingers of his right hand would never go away hed been taken drunk one night in vietnam and a cigarette had burned out there roger brooks had been just old enough to cover some of the frantic last days in vietnam but he had been too late to get anything juicy he had missed watergate his suspicions were right but he was too junior to follow them up other reporters got pulitzer prizes something had changed in him after that it was as if there were a secret somewhere calling to him little assignments couldnt hold his interest he missed one chance to be played by robert redford one of his ladies had been heard to say he isnt about to miss another this was a little assignment he wondered if he should have taken it even for the chance to get to california even though half the washington newsroom staff would have sold fingers and toes for the chance but nobody was keeping secrets here whatever voyager one told them they would shout it to the world to the moon if they could the trick was to understand them no big story maybe but the trip was worth it he glanced at linda and thought definitely worth it he twisted uncomfortably as old memories came back theyd been so inexperienced but theyd learned and no sex had ever been as good as his memory of linda that last time maybe hed edited that memory maybe not ive got to stop thinking about that itll show what in hell am i going to write about another group was clumped beneath the fullsize model of the voyager spacecraft they had to be scientists because most of them were men and they all wore suits a couple of the sciencefiction writers stood with them more like colleagues than press no reporters did that would that make an interesting angle the scifi people didnt pretend to be neutral they were enthusiasts and didnt care who knew it while the reporters tried to put on this smug air of impartiality the briefing began the program director talked about the spacecraft mission details spacecraft performing well some data lost because it was raining in spain where the highgain antennae were located was that a joke no nobody was laughing three billion miles away and theyre getting pictures somebody said on his right a pretty girl long legs slim ankles short bobbed hair badge said jeri wilson some geological magazine wedding ring but that didnt always mean anything maybe shed be here the rest of the week she seemed to be alone the mission planning people left the podium and the scientists brad smith and ed stone and carl sagan came up to tell what they thought they were learning roger listened and tried to think of an interesting question in a situation like this the important thing was get yourself noticed for future reference then try for an exclusive he jotted useful phrases new moons are going to get dull pretty soon not dozens of rings hundreds were still counting long pause some of them are eccentric what does that mean someone whispered the scifi man in the khaki bush jacket answered in what he probably thought was a whisper the rings are supposed to be perfect circles with saturn at the center all the theory says they have to be now theyve found some that arent circles theyre ellipses other scientists spoke may be the largest crater in the solar system in relation to the body its on there isnt any janus there are two moons where we thought janus was they share the same orbit and they change places every time they pass oh yes weve known for some time those orbits were possible its a textbook exam question in celestial mechanics its just that we never found anything like it in the real universe brooks jotted down details on that one it was definitely worth a mention janus was the moon named for the twofaced god of beginnings he whispered that to linda and got an appreciative nod the wilson girl wrote something too the radial spokes in the rings seem to be caused by very tiny particles around the size of a wavelength of light also the process seems to be going on above the ring not in it radial spokes in the rings they ought to disappear as the rings turned because the inner rings were moving faster than the outer rings they didnt disappear weird news from everywhere in saturn system some of brooks colleagues would understand the explanations when they came yet the press conference offered more than brooks had expected he had interviewed scientists before it was the lack of answers that was interesting here we dont know what that means we wouldnt like to say yet the more we learn from voyager the less we know about rings if we fiddle with the numbers a little we can pretty well explain why cassinis divide is so much bigger than it ought to be dramatic pause of course that doesnt explain why there are five faint rings inside it if id had to make a long list of things we wouldnt see eccentric rings would have been the first item brad what about braided rings that would have been off the top of the paper everyone up there looked happy brooks noted fun things were going on here if brooks didnt have the background to appreciate them who did a newsperson asked have you got any more on the radial spokes id have thought that violated the laws of physics david morrison from hawaii answered im sure the rings are doing everything right we just dont understand it yet brooks jotted it down where i want to be roger said is in a motel room with you they were walking the grounds of jpl lawn fountains vaguely oriental rock gardens a bridge all very nice that was years ago linda said and its all over sure yes roger im sure now be good you promised you would dont make me sorry i came with you no of course i wont roger said it really is good to see you again and im glad youre happy with edmund are you linda wondered and am i of course i am im very happy with edmund its when he goes off and leaves me to take care of everything and im alone all the time and i see these goddam romantic perfume ads and things like that that i get unhappy about major edmund gillespie i wonder if the feminists did us any favors letting us admit we get horny just like men she grinned broadly yeah roger demanded nothing nothing id tell you but its nice to see i could have some company if i wanted lunch was in the jpl cafeteria roger and linda were made welcome at the sciencefiction writers table but the writers didnt know any more than roger did they were having fun with not knowing someone passed a cartoon down the table it showed hanging off to one side either the star wars death star or saturns moon mimas saturn huge across the background in the foreground a spacecraft used mechanical arms to twist the fring into a braid the caption youve a wicked sense of humor darth vader another writer looked up and yawned oh its just another goddam spectacular picture of saturn that earned him appreciative laughter but no one knew which made it a frustrating lunch saturn had secrets maybe but he wasnt telling them and the writers didnt have any logical guesses about the strange pictures halfway through the lunch linda called to someone wes we didnt expect to see you here he was a trim athletic man in a faded baseball cap linda introduced him around the table wes married carlotta she told roger you remember carlotta she was my best friend in school sure roger said how are you one of the writers looked thoughtful wes dawson youre running for craig hosmers old seat right wes has always been for the space program linda said maybe you fellows will vote for him not our district wade curtis said we live north of there but maybe we can help were always interested in people wholl promote space it was late afternoon when they got back to the house roger pulled into the driveway you might as well come in and meet jenny linda said remember her sure i remember the brat i had to bribe her to leave us alone well shes grown a bit now linda led the way to the house and unlocked the door it was strangely silent inside she went to the kitchen and found a note held to the refrigerator by a tomatoshaped magnet roger was standing behind her scanning over her shoulder as she read it had to run down to san diego beach party charlenes with me back tomorrow jenny shes a freshman at long beach state anthropology but she took up scuba diving in a big way her curient boyfriend is at scripps linda shook her head in dismay mother will kill me if she finds out i let her go to an allnight party roger shook his head the brats in college jeez linda she cant be more than what fifteen seventeen roger sighed i guess its been longer than i thought yes it has been want some coffee sure she got out the filters and put water on roger hadnt said anything hadnt done anything but she could feel the vibes had jenny planned this but no she didnt know roger was in town and she wouldnt if she had shed always liked roger but she liked edmund more no jenny wouldnt have deliberately ananged to leave her alone with a lover from the past it had been a long time but she remembered every detail pampered georgetown university freshman dating the reporter from the washington post theyd planned it a weekend together in her parents appalachian cabin it had been summer and no one was using the place the weather in the mountains had been perfect thered been a delicious thrill of anticipation as they drove up the twisting highway she hadnt had that feeling since edmund was different edmund was older too and more glamorous fighter pilot astronaut everything a hero should be everything but a great lover thats not fair not fair at all thered been anticipation when she met edmund it lasted all during their courtship and died on their wedding night id forgotten all this but i feel it now just as i did then but the coffee machine was set up and there wasnt any reason to watch it any longer she turned roger was standing very close to her she didnt have to move very far to be in his arms part one the rogues discovery when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth sherlock holmes in the sign of the four countdown h minus six weeks the lush tropical growth of the kona coast ended abruptly suddenly the passionflower vines and palm trees were gone and jenny was driving through barren lava fields it looks like the back side of the moon she said her companion nodded and pointed toward the slopes off to their right mauna loa they say its terrible luck to take any of the lava home who says the old hawaiians of course but a surprising number of tourists too they take the stuff home and later they mail it back he shrugged bad luck or no so far as anyone knows she mauna loa is always she to the old ones shes never taken a life captain jeanette crichton expertly downshifted the borrowed tr as the road began another steep ascent the terrain was deceptive from the beach the mountains looked like gentle slopes until you tried climbing them then you realized just how big the twin volcanoes were mauna kea rose nearly feet above the sea and plunged feet downward to the sea bottom making it a bigger mountain than everest youll turn left at the next actual road richard owen said itll be a way mind if i doze off i had a late night all right by me she said she drove on not very flattering she thought picks me up in kona gets me to drive him up the side of a volcano and goes to sleep romantic she ran her fingers along her shoulderlength hair it was dark brown with a trace of red and at the moment it couldnt be very attractive since it was still damp from her morning swim she hadnt much of a tan either sometimes her freckles ran together to give the illusion of a tan but it was too early in the spring for that damp hair no tan not really the popular image of a california girl her figure was all right if a bit athletic the army encouraged officers to run four miles a day and she did that although she could get out of the requirement if she really wanted to the mediumlength skirt and tshirt showed her off pretty well still it couldnt be looks that attracted this astronomer to her any more than she was overwhelmed by his appearance all the same thered been some electricity earlier now it was nearly gone he was up all night she thought and will be again tonight let him sleep that should liven him up god knows what id be like if i had to live on a vampires schedule they drove through alternate strips of pasture and lava fields at irregular intervals someone had made crude stacks of lava rocks three or four rocks each smaller than the one below the bottom one perhaps two feet across piled in a stack shed been told they were religious offerings made by the old hawaiians if so they couldnt be very old mauna loa erupted pretty often and certainly this field had been overflowed several times during the twentieth century she turned left at the intersection and the way became even steeper the tr labored through the climb there were fewer fresh lava fields here now they were on the side of mauna kea she was supposed to be pretty thoroughly dormant they drove through endless miles of ranchlands given by king kamehameha to a british sailor whod become the kings friend richard owen woke just as they reached the temporary wooden astronomy base station we stop here he said have some lunch there wasnt much there long onestory wooden barracks in a sea of lava and mud with a few straggly trees trying to live in the lava field she pulled in alongside several gmc jimmy fourwheeldrive vehicles we could go on up she said i dont really need lunch regulations acclimatization its nearly fourteen thousand feet at the top pretty thin air thin enough here at ten thousand its not easy to do anything even walk until you get used to it by the time they reached the clapboard barracks buildings she was ready to agree there were half a dozen observatories on the lip of the volcano richard parked the jimmy in front of the nasa building it looked like an observatory in a bugs bunny cartoon a square concrete building under a shiny metal dome do i get to look through the telescope she asked he didnt laugh maybe he had answered that one too often no one looks through telescopes anymore we just take pictures he led the way inside through barewalled corridors and down an iron stairway to a lounge furnished with chromesteel office tables and chairs there was a woman in the lounge she was about jeanettes age and she would have been pretty if shed washed her face and put on some lipstick she was frowning heavily as she drank coffee mary alice owen said this is jeanette crichton captain crichton army intelligence not a spook she does photo reconnaissance and that sort of thing dr mary alice mouton shes an asteroid specialist hi mary alice said she went on frowning problem owen asked sort of she didnt seem to notice jeanette at all rick i wish youd come look at this sure dr mouton led the way and rick owen followed jeanette shook her head and tagged after them through another corridor and up some stairs past an untidy computer room all mad she thought but what did i expect she hadnt known what to expect at all this was her first trip to hawaii courtesy of an engineering association meeting that invited her to speak on satellite observation that conference was over and she was taking a couple of days leave swimming the big islands reefs and enjoying the sun she didnt know anyone in hawaii and it had been pretty dull jeanette began to make plans to visit linda and edmund before going back to fort bragg then richard owen had met her at the reef theyd had breakfast after their swim and hed invited her to come up to see the observatory shed brought a sleeping bag she didnt know whether owen expected to share it with her but from little things hed said at lunch and on the drive up after lunch she was pretty sure hed make the offer shed been trying to decide what to do when he did now it was as if she werent there at all she followed them into a small cluttered room there was a big viewscreen in one corner dr mouton did things to the controls and a field of stars showed on the screen she did something else and the star field blinked on and off as it did one star seemed to jump back and forth new asteroid owen asked thats what i thought dr mouton said except take a good look rick and think about what youre seeing he stared at the screen jeanette came closer she couldnt see anything strange you take the pictures on two different nights and do a blink comparison the regular stars wont have moved enough to notice but anything that moves against the background of the fixed stars like a planet or an asteroid will be in two different places on the two different photos blink back and forth between the two plates the moving body would seem to jump back and forth that was how clyde tombaugh discovered pluto it was also a standard photo reconnaissance technique to see what had changed in the interval between two satellite photos whats the problem owen asked thats moving too far for the interval its close not that close she said i got the plates from a few weeks ago rick i had to trace back damn near night by night its moving so fast its in a hyperbolic orbit come on it cant be it is dr mouton said excuse me jeanette said they both turned to look at her theyd obviously forgotten she was there whats a hyperbolic orbit fast owen said moving too fast for the suns gravity objects in a hyperbolic orbit can escape from the solar system altogether she frowned how could something be moving that fast big planets can make it happen richard said disturb somethings orbit its under power mary alice mouton said aw come on i know its silly but its the only explanation i can think of rick ive followed that thing backward for weeks and it has decelerated most of the way but jupiter cant do that nothing can no of course it mary alice the computer plot fits perfectly if you assume its a powered spacecraft dr moutons voice had taken on a flat dry note and nothing else does an hour later two more astronomers had come in looked at the plates and left shaking their heads one had insisted that whatever else they found the early plates were genuine hed taken them himself the other hadnt even admitted seeing anything owen used the telephone to call arizona laura rick owen weve got something funny here did any of your people happen to get pictures looking south of leo the past few weeks he read off a string of coordinates and waited for a few moments good looked at them could you please go look yes now i know its not convenient but believe me its important you dont really believe thats a powered ship do you jeanette asked mary alice looked at her with haunted eyes ive tried everything else and nothing fits the data and yes i remember the pulsars which meant nothing to jeanette they drank coffee while owen talketh finally he put down the phone he looked flightened kin peak has seen it he announced chap named tom duff a computer type spotted it they didnt believe it its just where we saw it mary alice you may have a problem about credit for discovery bother the credit what is it dr mouton demanded rick its big and its under power and its coming here in california it would be three in the morning linda heard the phone ring three times then the sleepy voice yes linda this is jenny jenny but well hello is something wrong kind of sis i need to talk to your husband fast what there was a pause all right and get him some coffee jenney said hes going to need it presently she heard the newly awakened voice of major general edmund gillespie jenny whats wrong general i have something strange to report general are you being official well formal yes sir ive already called my colonel and he agreed that it would be a good idea to call you just a second jenny linda wheres that coffee ah thanks okay shoot yes sir as she spoke she tried to imagine the scene general gillespie sitting on the edge of the bed growing more and more awake his hair probably looks like his head is exploding linda pacing back and forth wondering what in the world is going on maybe joel had been awakened well there wasnt any help for that a lot of people were going to be losing sleep jenny are you seriously suggesting that this is an alien ship men from mars and all that sir we both know there cant be any men from mars or anywhere else in the solar system but this is a large object its moving faster than anything that could stay inside the solar system it has been decelerating for weeks and it appears to be coming here those are facts confirmed by three different observatories suddenly she giggled ed youre an astronaut what do you think it is damned if i know gillespie said russian no jeanette said there was a long silence from the other end youd know wouldnt you but are you that sure yes sir im that sure it is not a soviet ship its my job to know things like that ive been monitoring the soviet space program for ten years and they cant build anything like that neither can we jenn captain if this is ajoke were all going to be in trouble for gods sake general why would i joke about this she demanded i told you i already got my colonel out of bed hes going through channels but you can imagine whats going to happen to a ufo report i can think of people to call gillespie said im just having trouble believing it yes sir jenny said dryly yeah i know so must you ed gillespie said but i see your point if its an alien ship weve got some preparing to do jenny who is your co colonel robert hartley g strategic army command fort bragg heres the phone number linda watched as her husband put the phone down he looked worried whats my kid sister done now maybe earned herself a medal edmund said he lifted the phone and began dialing who are you calling now linda asked this is crazy hello colonel hartley general ed gillespie here captain crichton said youd be expecting my call yeah yeah shes always had a level head yeah yeah i believe her too okay so what do we do about it this is crazy linda thought absolutely crazy my kid sister discovers flying saucers i dont believe it i will not believe it only only jenny never pulled a practical joke in her life she doesnt drink she doesnt take drugs and aliens an alien ship approaching earth she saw that edmund had put the phone down so now what she asked i dont know hard to think have to let people know have to let the president know im not sure how to do that wes dawson could do it linda said by god he looked at his watch after six in washington wes might be up ill wake him up you got his home number handy david coffey had always thought of himself as a night person but that wasnt possible now the president of the united states couldnt sleep late it just wasnt done he couldnt even insist on being left alone for breakfast although he tried as he sat down on the terrace to enjoy the lovely spring day in washington the chief of staff said wes dawson california i know who he is insists on joining you for breakfast insists he didnt put it that way but yes said he was calling in any favors he had coming vital he said david coffey sighed he felt the pressure of his belt there was a cabinet meeting at eleven and hed hoped to get in a half hour swim before then tighten up the gut a bit tell congressman dawson im flattered he said and ask the housekeeper please to set another place at the table flying saucers spaceships silly the president thought the sort of stuff the midwestern papers ran when there wasnt any other news fakery or insanity except that wes dawson wasnt crazy had never been crazy and even though he was acting manic he wasnt crazy now let me get this straight wes coffey said the astronomers have seen a spaceship approaching earth it will be here next month you want to go meet it yes mr president wes do you know scratch that of course you know how goofy this sounds all right assume its all true why you somebody has to dawson said and the fact that i used up all my favors to be the first to tell you about it ought to show im interested yeah i give you that im on both space and foreign relations you ought to have somebody from the congress when we go out to meet them why go out to meet them at all because its more fitting sir dawson said think about it mr president they came from a long way off from another star sure about that the chief of staff asked why not from another planet because weve seen all the likely planets close up and theres no place for a civilization dawson said patiently anyway mr president they came from a long way off even so theyll recognize that the first step is the hard one we want to meet them in orbit not wait for them to come here let me try to put it in perspective he said would the history of the pacific islands have been different if the first time the europeans encountered hawaiians the polynesians had been well out at sea in oceangoing boats mightnt they have been treated with more respect i see the president said you know wes you just may be right thats assuming theres anything to this if there is do i get to go dawson asked david coffey laughed well see about that he said he turned to the chief of staff jim get hold of general gillespie get him on a plane for washington and the army captain who discovered this thing he sighed and get it on the agenda for the cabinet meeting today lets see what the secretary of state has to say about welcoming the men from mars wes dawson walked back from the white house to his offices in the rayburn building he didnt really have time to do that but it was a fine morning and the walk would do him good and he was too excited to work anyway the president hadnt said no wes strolled quickly through the federal triangle and along independence avenue hed done that often but he still tended to gawk at the great public buildings along the way it was all there government granite magnificent buildings in the old classic style built to last back when america had craftsmen able to compete with the great builders of old greece and rome and more than that the archives with the original constitution and declaration of independence to make you mistyeyed and silent and remind you that wed done things even the romans couldnt wed invented a stable government of free citizens beyond that was the smithsonian old castle and new extension the president hadnt said no im going to space only only would president coffey remember it wasnt an ironclad promise no one had heard it but jim frantz if the president forgot the chief of staff would forget too because coffey might have had a reason to forget or its too fine a morning to think that way coffey didnt say no i really could go to space ahead was the space museum with its endless traffic the only building in washington that drew crowds during weekend blizzards wes wanted to look in just for a moment there was work to do and carlotta would be waiting in the office to hear what happened in his meeting with the president and he ought to hurry but dammit across from the museum was nasa itself wes grinned from ear to ear startling passersby who werent used to people looking happy a couple of runners came past and returned the grin although they couldnt know what made him so cheerful i know a secret he said aloud as he looked up toward the eighthfloor corner office of the administrator have they told him by now maybe theyll even have him at the cabinet meeting but im the one who told the president and ive got my claim staked and im the right man ive been waiting for this day all my life im in good shape well reasonably good ill be in better ill run every day he ran a couple of steps realized that wasnt practical for a man in a dark pinstripe threepiece suit and grinned again starting this afternoon he thought and ill get to houston for training real training ive been there before good thing being on the space committee aliens the full force of it hit him just as he reached the capitol reflecting pool theyre really here aliens this is where human history breaks into two pieces the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is over the aliens are coming take that bill proxmire he climbed the hill to the rayburn building and walked between the two monstrous statues that faced each other across the granite steps they were the ugliest statues in washington crude attempts to portray the majesty and compassion of the law in greek classical style but done by a very bad sculptor who hadnt understood what the greeks were trying to do and who hadnt known much about human anatomy either wes grinned as he passed them it was obvious what had happened someone had insisted on statues and some forgotten congressman had said al my cousin cindy lou married a guy who makes statues his aides hurried to intercept him as he entered his suite of offices wes knew he was late but dammit now here came larry with a fistful of messages wes waved him aside and went past the receptionist and into his office bursting to tell carlotta she was seated in his chair a dozen boy scouts from his district were draped on the other chairs and couches oh damn wes thought and put on his best smile carlotta saw the fixed political grin on her husbands face but she could see beyond it to the glow of enthusiasm in wess eyes he didnt need to say anything after all theyd lived together nearly twentyfive years and had been married for twentytwo she could tell wes has a chance a chance to be the ambassador of the human race no make that consul or whatever the hell they call the second in charge of an embassy the russians are likely to provide the ambassador thank god i made wes learn some russian her bed would be empty now and that wouldnt be so good but he sure looked happy couldnt wait to tell her about it but the scouts were here bad timing but the appointment was made weeks ago how could anyone know congressman dawson would eat his breakfast at the white house the boys swarmed around wes he seemed friendly enough not too friendly he wasnt making many political points with this visit why couldnt the damn kids go away that wasnt really fair shed encouraged them to come herself carlotta liked boys all congressmen welcomed visiting bdy scouts but wes and carlotta were happier than most when they came to washington not just scouts all boys if simon had lived carlotta thought but he hadnt simon dawson age three months dead of whatever it was that killed babies in their first year silent killer crib death the doctors had told her she couldnt have more children shed gambled anyway and very nearly died in childbirth it was a month before she could hold her daughter in her arms and another before she recovered and it was obvious that sharon would be the only child of the dawson family the only heir to two long and respectable lines that was almost twenty years ago sharon was enrolled at radcliffe now and didnt think much of her fathers career carlotta had never been able quite to understand why doesnt matter all colleges teach nonsense shell outgrow it carlotta got up and went to wes he was bursting to tell her but he had control of his face now hi she said this is troop johnny brasicku is the senior patrol leader johnny this is my husband congressman dawson they were nice boys and they came from the district wes shook hands with each one of them when hed finished he gave carlotta a rueful grin she winked at him the most important news weve ever heard she thought possibly the most important thing anyone ever heard and here were chatting with boy scouts while the staff decides what we ought to think and how wes ought to vote and theres nothing we can do about it if congressmen spent any time being congressmen and thinking about the job they wouldnt have the job its a strange way to run a country announcements suspicion is the companion of mean souls and the bane of all good society thomas paine common sense countdown h minus six weeks i really dont think you should do that jeanette crichton said richard owen paused with his hand on the telephone then snorted nothing you can do about it the army doesnt have any jurisdiction over me i never said we did jeanette said and why be paranoid but you ought to think it over i already did owen said the soviets have to know they may already in which case its better if they know that we know about it and youre nice and friendly but somehow ive got the feeling that if i wait very long a real spook might show up he lifted the receiver and dialed and now what jeanette thought hes right the army doesnt have any jurisdiction and the russians probably know all about it anyway if they dont now theyll learn soon enough they have a lot more in space than we do with their big manned station academician pavel bondarev owen said da bondarev his fingers drummed against the desk pavel richard owen in hawaii uh yes of course ill wait he put his hand over the transmitter they have a policy he told jeanette theyre not allowed to talk to americans unless there are three of them together even somebody as high as bondarev talk about paranoid these guys own the copyright ah academician bondarev your colleagues are there excellent this is professor richard owen university of hawaii weve turned up something interesting i think you better know about pavel aleksandrovich bondarev put down the telephone and stared thoughtfully at the ceiling is it real boris ogarkovs flat peasant lace was twisted into an inquiring frown which made him look very unpleasant yes bondarev said absently boris was the institute party secretary he was not well educated boris was from the working class uninspired but tireless party activities had brought him to lie attention of his superiors he was one of those raised to a position of power who knew that loyalty to the system was the only way be would ever be more than a menial he had cunning enough to know that the institute was important to the soviet union and so not to interfere with its work instead be busied himself with seeing that there was a portrait of lenin in every office and that everyone scientist secretary clerk or janitor voted in every election i know this american well bondarev continued we have published two papers together and worked together when i was in the united states he would not call me for a hoax not as a hoax andrei pyatigorskiy said but could he be mistaken we have seen no evidence of this perhaps we have bondarev said and perhaps not as a favor anditi will you please call dr nosov at the observatory and ask his staff to examine all the photographs that might be relevant certainly thank you i need not say that nosov must not speak of this to anyone no matter what he finds i can call the party secretary at the observatory boris ogartov said he will help to keep this secret bondarev nodded agreement but pavel aleksandrovich do you believe this story alien spacecraft coming to earth pyatigorskiy gestured helplessly how can you believe it bondarev shrugged if you agree that they did not lie we have no choice but to believe it the americans have excellent equipment and enough so that every observatory has comparators and computers as you well know if we had half so much pyatigorskiy said half the time he had to build his own equipment because the institute could not get the foreign exchange credits to obtain electronics and optics from the west and unless it had been built for the military russian laboratory equipment did not work well bondarev shrugged again certainly but there are many reasons why the americans would see it first perhaps it has been seen from kosmograd boris ogarkov said pyatiggrskiy nodded agreement their telescopes are much better than those we have here i will ask bondaiev said and perhaps get an answer perhaps not reports from the soviet space station were closely guarded often bondarev did not get them for months we should see their photographs pyatigotskiy said instantly when they come in and you should be able to call rogachev and tell him where to point his instruments perhaps bondarev said he looked significantly at his subordinate andrel pyatigorskiy was an excellent development scientist but his career would not be aided by criticizing policy in front of boris ogarkov boris probably would not report this but he would remember it is vital andrei continued he sounded stubborn if aliens are coming we must make preparations is it not likely that they know in moscow ogarkov asked perhaps they have heard from kosmograd and already know i think not bondarev said quietly it is of course possible they know much in moscow but i think we here would have heard if not what they know that they have learned something of importance in the meantime it is vital that we look at our own photographs if this object shows then we know it is no hoax he looked thoughtful no ordinary hoax at all events so thats that richard owen said they hadnt seen it he walked over to the window overlooking the road up mauna kea or said they hadnt jeanette said yeah thats right he glanced at his watch next thing is a press conference he looked at her defiantly she shook her head richard theres nothing i can do to stop you i think youre wrong though dont the people have a right to know i suppose so she said do you think the russians believe you why shouldnt they owen demanded they dont often believe anything we say they see plots everywhere jeanette said not bondarev owen protested ive known him a long time hell believe me yes but will his superiors believe him anyway its not my problem sure about that what theres a mess of cars coming up the road owen said state police and an army staff car i never saw anything like that up here before lieutenant hal brassfield was nervous he couldnt have been more than twenty years old and he wasnt sure who jeanette was small wonder she thought captain he said i dont really know any more than that the orders said to get you to washington by first available transportation highest priority and we arranged that a chopper will meet us down at the fivethousandfoot level hell get you to pearl theres a navy jet standing by there jeanette frowned isnt that a bit unusual you bet your sweet yes maam thats unusual leastwise i never did anything like this before she looked at the sheet of orders theyd been hastily typed from telephone dictation and looked nothing like standard military orders shed never seen anything like them come to that she thought not very many officers had at the bottom it said by order of the president of the united states and below that was for the president james f frantz chief of staff those came in about an hour ago the lieutenant said and its all i know were a training command captain all right lieutenant but someone will have to go to my hotel i have things there and the bill has to be paid yes maam major johnston said id have to take care of that ill send your bags on to you only i dont know where to send them he chuckled i wouldnt think the white house would be the right address for a captain but thats the only place listed on those orders jeanette nodded more to herself than to the lieutenant whenever she was in washington she stayed at flintridge with her aunt and uncle so that was no problem only it was probably a hurry up and wait situation there wasnt any need for her at the white house not that urgently and probably not at all the president would want to confirm the sighting but before she could get to washington hed have a dozen others to tell him about the mysterious what she giggled penny for your thoughts richard owen said what do we call it she asked ufo but it isnt flying lieutenant brassfield looked puzzled ufo all this is over a flying saucer yes jeanette said hey now wait a minute its all true richard owen said weve spotted an alien spaceship its on its way to earth captain crichton called the army maybe i better not know any more about this brassfield said jeanette thought of richard owens upcoming press conference and laughed it wont hurt lieutenant do you have anyone in kona or somebody who can get there fast yes maam good have him go to the kamehameha hotel and collect my bags hes to be careful with my uniform but get it packed all my stuff then drive like hell to meet us where that helicopter is picking us up if im going to the white house i am damned if ill go barelegged kgb headquarters was across the city square from the institute it was a drab brick building in contrast to the institutes pillars and marble facade pavel bondarev walked briskly across the square it was a pleasant day warm enough that he did not need an overcoat a new man sat at the reception desk in kgb headquarters he looked very young pavel bondarev grimaced then shrugged what cannot be cured must be endured he had learned patience and he forced himself to be still although he was bursting with the news a long line of citizens waited in front of the reception desk men in illfitting suits women in stained skirts and scarves farmers workers minor factory officials they all held forms to be signed permission slips of one kind or another today there were not so many farmers in fall there would be hundreds wanting to sell the produce from their tiny private plots bondarev shook his head absurd he thought they should be working not standing in lines here but it is typically russian and if they didnt stand in lines they wouldnt work anyway theyd just get drunk if there were not residency controls everyone would live in moscow once while visiting washington hed heard a song at an americans party how you going to keep them down on the farm it was evidently a problem for the americans as well as the russians he walked past the line a man at the head of the line roundfaced like boris ogarkov glared at him sullenly but didnt say anything bondarev stood at the desk two men were at another desk nearby he thought he recognized the one who was typing a report on a battered machine of german make bondarev wondered idly if the typewriter had been brought to russia by the wehrmacht it was certainly old enough provincial establishments even kgb did not often get new equipment the reception officer ignored him as long as possible then looked up insolently yes you will be that way will you bondarev thought very well bondarev spoke quietly but loud enough so he was certain that the men at the next desk could overhear him i am bondarev i wish to see the duty officer the desk officer frowned the man at the next desk ceased typing what is the nature of your business if i had meant for you to know i would have told you bondarev said now you will please inform the senior officer present that academician bondarev director of the lenin research institute of astrophysics and cosmography wishes to see him and that the matter is urgent the receptionists frown deepened but his face lost the insolent look a full academician would have powerful friends and the institute was important in their provincial city the officer who had been typing got up from the desk and came over certainly comrade academician he said i will go and tell comrade orlov at once he looked down sideways at the receptionist then left i am required to ask the receptionist said his voice was sullen he has not long held his commission as an officer of the kgb bondarev thought and he has rather enjoyed having everyone act respectful even fearful he did not expect to find someone to fear this way comrade academician the other agent indicated a doorway as bondarev passed through the receptionist was saying how should i know he was an academician he did not say so bondarev smiled the office was not large the desk was cluttered bondarev did not recognize the officer at the desk but he was certain he had seen him before yes comrade academician i must use your scrambler telephone to call moscow comrade orlov party third secretary narovchatov in the kremlin it is urgent no one must listen it is a matter of state security if it is a matter of state security we must record yes but not to listen bondarev said comrade believe me you do not want to listen to this call it took nearly an hour to complete the call then general narovchatovs voice came on the line pavel aleksandrovich it is good to hear from you the hearty gravel voice changed all is well da comrade general marina is well your grandchildren are well ah another year pavel another year and you may return to moscow but hard as it is you must stay there now your work is needed i know bondarev said marina will be grateful that it is only one more year that however is not why i have called then i have called from the kgb station in order to use the scrambler telephone the officer on duty is watching to see that no one listens it is a matter of great importance nikolai nikolayevich the greatest importance general nikolai nikolayevich narovchatov put down the telephone and carefully finished writing his notes in the leatherbound book on his desk once in paris a wealthy lady had given him a score of the leather books full of blank pages of excellent paper that had been long ago long enough that his baggage had been searched when he returned and the border guards had wondered what sinister messages were written on the blank paper until the superiors he travelpd with had become impatient and the guards wordlessly passed him through each book lasted nearly a year and now only two were left he stared at his notes aliens an alien spaceship was coming to earth nonsense but it is not nonsense he thought pavel bondarev would not have been my ideal of a soninlaw i would have preferred that marina marry a diplomat still there is no questioning that the academician is intelligent intelligent and cautious he would not call if he were not certain the americans have seen this object the americans say they have seen this object an american scientist calls a soviet scientist a friendly gesture one scientist to another could this be narovchatov stared at his notebook as if the notes he had taken could tell him something he didnt know pavel bondarev was intelligent he knew this american and he believed that this was real but of course he would the cia was clever almost as clever as the kgb and more to the point the kgb would not believe the americans he thought of the problems a provincial kgb officer would have in trying to notify moscow of a development like this and nodded in satisfaction it would be hours before the senior officials of the kgb would know the americans have seen something or say they have more important now that they knew where to look russian astronomers at the urals observatory have seen it as well not nonsense it is real something is there could the americans have done something like this it didnt seem likely but the americans had surprised them before i must do something i do not know what narovchatovs ornately carved desk stood at one end of a long highceilinged room the inevitable portrait of lenin dominated rugs covered the floor the room was comfortable full of quiet elegance tasteful and restful a room where he could work but it was also a room where he could relax as was necessary more and more often now he had first seen this room as a very young soldier at the beginning of the great patriotic war his special regiment had been assigned to guard duty in the kremlin just before the germans were driven away it was not a long tour of duty the omsbon were sent to chase germans soon after it had been long enough and he had seen enough nikolai nikolayevich narovchatov would never return to kirov where his father worked in the hammer mill communism had been kind enough to nikolai narovchatov it had taken him from the villages to kirov from the stolid peasant misery of a russian winter to the comparative warmth of the city and industrial life it had made his children literate nikolai never wanted more but his son did if that office came from communism then communism was worth studying it took him thirty years but he never doubted that he would arrive party work in the army then moscow university where he studied engineering and always took excellent marks in the political courses he could have had better grades in his academic subjects but he did not want to show up his friends for he always sought out the relatives of high party officials if you wish power it is best to have friends in high places and if you know no one in high places meet their children great stalin died and khrushchev began his slow rise to power those were not easy years for it was difficult to tell who would win in the inevitable struggle beria had fallen and with him fell the nkvd to be divided into the civil militia and the kgb nikolai narovchatov chose his friends carefully and kept his ties with the party eventually he married the daughter of the party secretary of the russian soviet federated socialist republic largest of the fifteen republics that together made up the ussr shortly after khrushchev fell and the party men became even more dominant from then on his rise was rapid he became a political general mostly he despised that group but the title was useful it paid well and gave him ties within the army and the rocket forces and unlike many political generals he had fought in the great patriotic war and elsewhere he had earned his medals as i have earned my place he thought party work arse kissing yes enough of that but i have also built factories that actually produce goods i have helped keep the germans helpless cannot the americans understand why we must i have dismissed corrupt officials where i could and minimized the damage of those i could not do without i have been a good manager and i have earned my place a good place with my son safely established in the ministry of trade and my daughters well married one grandchild in moscows institute of international relations and now this at least i shall be the first to inform the chairman marina marina i did not approve your choice of a husband but i see i was wrong it was a good day when you met pavel aleksandrovich bondarev a very good day he pushed back his chair and stood and feeling very weary went down the ornate hall to the office of the chairman the biggest story in history and david coffey was president when it happened aliens coming here he sat at the center of the big table in the cabinet room the others had stood when he entered and didnt take their seats until he was settled it upset david but hed become used to it they didnt stand for david coffey but for the president of the united states coffey was aware that at least half the people in the room thought they could do the job better than he could and one or two might be right theyd never get the chance not even henry morton the political writers all like to talk about henry being a heartbeat away from the presidency but i never felt better in my life the party wanted morton as vice president but hell never have a clear shot at this chair david was a little in awe of the secretary of state dr arthur hart had written a bestseller on diplomacy made a fortune trading in overseas commodities and was a favorite guest on the tv talk shows harts face was probably better known to the average citizen than the presidents but hell never sit here either hasnt enough fire in his belly hed like to be president but he hasnt the killer instinct it takes to get high elective office david looked around the table at the others certainly hart was the most distinguished man in the room it wasnt an overwhelmingly distinguished cabinet i dont think i have it in me to be a great president david had told his wife the night he was elected when jeanne protested david shook his head but then i dont think the country wants a great president just now the nations about worn out with great this and great that i cant be a great president so ill just have to settle for being a damned good one and that i can manage and so far i have its not a great cabinet but its a damned good one gentlemen and ladies he added for the benefit of the secretary of commerce and the secretary of the interior in place of our regular agenda there is a somewhat pressing item which the chief of staff will explain to you jim if you will its just plain damned crazy peter mccleve said mr president i will not believe it he turned toward the president in his place at the center of the big conference table i simply do not believe it you can believe it ted griffin said the secretary of defense spoke directly to the attorney general but he talked mostly for the presidents benefit peter i heard it just before i came over sure from the same people who told dawson mccleve said they do seem to have checked it thoroughly ted griffin was a big man tall and beefy and built like the football player hed been he looked as if he might shout a lot but in fact he almost never did you accept the story then the secretary of state asked yes i see arthur hart put the tips of his fingers together in a gesture hed made famous on meet the press constitutionally the secretary of state was the senior cabinet officer in fact he was the fourth most important man in the room counting the president as top numbers two and three were hap aylesworth special assistant to the president for political affairs and admiral thorwald carrell assume its true hart continued i do so the important thing is what do we do now i suppose you want to tell the russians alan rosenthal said arthur hart looked at the secretary of the treasury with amusement rosenthal couldnt always contain his dislike of russians i think someone must hart said someone did ted griffin announced when everyone was looking at him he nodded for emphasis i got that news just before i came over here that astronomer guy in hawaii called someone he glanced at a note on the table in front of him a pavel bondarev at the astrophysics institute near sverdlovsk yeah well who could stop him he dialed direct how long do you suppose it takes a story like that to get from sverdlovsk to the kremlin the attorney general asked it could be quite a while arthur hart said i was thinking that the president might call the chairman moscow already knows admiral carrell said his gravelly voice stopped all the extraneous chatter in the mom payel bondarev is the soninlaw of general narovchatov narovchatovs been with chairman petrovskiy for twenty years everyone turned to look at the chief of staff jim frantz almost never said anything in cabinet meetings what prompted that jim arthur hart asked i often wonder if any country in the world could operate if communications went only through channels ted griffin said so the russians know and by the time we leave this meeting the country will know he smiled at the startled looks that caused yes captain crichton said this astronomer chap was calling a press conference so we have to decide what to tell the public hap aylesworth was short and beefy perpetually fighting a weight problem his necktie was always loosened and his collar unbuttoned he seldom appeared in photographs when cameras came out aylesworth would usually urge someone else forward as special assistant he was the presidents political advisor but for the past nine years hed given david coffey political advice the washington post called him the kingmaker there may be a more pressing problem admiral carrell said aylesworth raised a bushy eyebrow the russians i dont know it would be such a good idea for the president to call chairman petrovskiy but i think id better get on the horn to general narovchatov why ted griffin asked obvious isnt it carrell said he pushed back a gray pinstripe sleeve to glance at his watch one of the first things theyll do once theyre sure of this is start mobilizing military civil defense you name it ted id hate for your military people to get all upset are you certain of this david coffey asked yes sir admiral carrell said sure as anything mr president why would they assume this attorney general mccleve had trouble getting the words out this alien spacecraft is hostile because they think everything is hostile carrell said afraid hes right pete arthur hart said the secretary of state shook his head sadly i could wish otherwise but thats the way it will be and theyll very shortly be demanding an official explanation of why one of our scientists called one of theirs instead of passing this important news through channels as it ought to be done thats crazy peter mccleve said just plain crazy possibly secretary hart said but its what will happen to sum up then david coffey said the soviets will shortly ask us for our official position and they will begin mobilizing without regard to what that position is admiral carrell nodded agreement precisely mr president then what should we do hap aylesworth asked we cant let the russians mobilize while we do nothing the country wont stand for it i can think of senators who would be delighted coffey said on both sides of the aisle aylesworth said doves wholl say theres never been anything to be afraid of and will move resolutions congratulating you on your steady nerves and hawks wholl want to impeach you for selling out the country admiral david coffey asked admiral canell was another advisor the president was in awe of theyd known each other for more than a dozen years since the day vice admiral carrell had walked into a freshman congressmans office and explained patiently and with brutal honesty how the navy was wasting money in a shipyard that happened to be one of the major employers in davids district since that time carrell had become deputy director of the national security agency then director of the cia david coffeys first officially announced appointment was dr arthur hart to be secretary of state but hed decided on thorwald carrell as national security advisor before his own nomination and the announcement came the day after harts appointment i think a partial mobilization admiral carrell said well need a declaration of national emergency this is senseless commerce secretary connie fuller had a surprisingly low voice for such a small lady if we believe this is really an alien ship and i think we must then this is the greatest day in human history were sitting here talking about war and mobilization when when everything is going to be different i agree arthur hart said but the soviets will begin mobilization let them fuller said her brown eyes flashed let them mobilize and be damned at least one of the superpowers will behave like like responsible and intelligent beings do we want these aliens mr president think of the power they have to have come from another star we want to welcome them not appear hostile thats what wes dawson thinks president coffey said matter of fact he wants to meet them in orbit he thought that might impress them a little an excellent suggestion secretary hart said couldnt hurt ted griffin agreed except that we dont have a space station admiral carrell said the soviets do connie fuller said maybe if we asked them thats what i planned to do david coffey said meanwhile we have a decision to make what do we do now put the military forces on standby alert admiral canell insisted get the a teams on duty that works aylesworth said we can call in the congressional leadership before we do anything else spread the blame admiral carrell muttered something like that david coffey agreed ill call in the standby alert from the oval office he stood and the others after a moment stood as well mr griffin i think it would do no harm to examine our civil defense plans yes sir but thats not in the department of defense coffey frowned the federal emergency management agency is an independent agency mr president well for gods sake coffey said he turned to jim frantz statutory no sir created by executive order then get out an executive order putting the damned thing under the national security council ted i want you to stay on top of this the news will be out in an hour god knows what people will do im sure some will panic youll all want to call your offices coffey said theres no point in denying anything i think the official policy is that we do in fact believe an alien spaceship is coming here and were trying to figure out what to do mr president hap aylesworth was shocked david smiled hap i know youd like the public to think im infallible but it doesnt work that way the pentagon gives out infallibility with the third star and the vaticans got a way of handing it to the pope but it doesnt come with the job of president i think the people know that but if they dont its time they found out well tell the simple truth yes sir meanwhile lets figure on getting back together in two hours coffey turned to the chief of staff jim i think youd better get the crisis center activated it looks to be a long day flintridge along a parabola mans fate like a rocket flies mainly in darkness now and then on a rainbow andrei voznesevisky parabolic ballad countdownh minus six weeks the moving belt came to life luggage spewed out of the bowels of dulles international airport jenny reached for her suitcase but before she could get it a fat lady in a yellowflowered dress shouldered her aside to grab her own excuse me the fat woman said why should i jenny thought im supposed to defend a tub of lard like you why she tried to move past the woman but that wasnt going to be possible it had been a long flight jennys hair was in strings and she felt sticky she drew in a breath to speak but thought better of it no point she told herself she was resigned to letting her bag go around the carousel when she recognized ed gillespie he reached past the fat woman and caught the suitcase before it could escape it was big and heavy but he lifted it effortlessly good morning he said any other luggage no sir jenny said he was wearing a dark blue blazer and gray flannel trousers and didnt look military at all she giggled i dont often get a general for a porter and an astronaut at that gillespie didnt say anything but the look on the fat womans face when she said astronaut was worth a lot i hadnt expected you jenny said i got in from california about an hour ago called rhonda and found out which flight you were on seemed reasonable to wait for you jenny opened her big purse and fished out the clear plastic strap for the suitcase gillespie snapped it on and led the way out of the baggage area up the ramp to the taxi stands the suitcase followed like a dog on a leash which was the way jenny always thought of it as far as jenny was concerned wheels on luggage had done more for womens liberation than most organizations she didnt mind letting a strong alpha male take care of her suitcase she did have some misgivings about letting general edmund gillespie haul her luggage still there was no point in telling her brotherinlaw that she could take care of her own suitcase when they were both in civvies if theyd been in uniform shed have pulled her own no matter what he said they reached street level gillespie waved to a waiting taxi his luggage was already in its trunk the taxi was new or nearly so the driver was middle eastern probably pakistani and hardly spoke english they got into the backseat and she sank back into the cushions then she took a deep breath and let it out tired gillespie asked sure yesterday afternoon i was in hawaii she looked at her watch seventhirty am a navy jet took me to el tom they stuffed me in a helicopter and got me to los angeles just in time to catch the redeye get any sleep not really try now gillespie said im too keyed up whats the schedule early appointments gillespie said at the white house he saw her look of dismay and grinned youll have time to change id better im a wreck the taxi pulled out of the airport lot and onto the freeway putting the soaring structure of the terminal building in their view my favorite airport jenny said gillespie nodded its not too bad i didnt used to like it but it grows on you except its so damned far out i like the building so do i but it ruined the architects reputation ed gillespie said jenny frowned his name was eero saarmnen and he didnt build a glass box gillespie said so they kicked him out of the architects lodge as a heretic the taxi accelerated a fine mist hung in the air outside and the freeway was slick jenny glanced over the drivers shoulder at the speedometer the needle hovered around seventyfive im glad theres not much traffic she said i didnt know you were interested in architecture umm tom wolfe wrote a book about it oh he didnt need to explain further after the right stuff wolfe had become required reading for the astronauts hows it feel to create a sensation jenny im too tired to feel anything at all was it a sensation gillespie laughed thats right youve been on airplanes he reached down into his briefcase and took out a washington post the headline screamed at her alien spaceship discovered most of the front page was devoted to the story they didnt have many facts but there was a lot of speculation including a background article by roger brooks jenny frowned at that remembering the last time shed seen roger she glanced at ed he couldnt know about roger and linda my sisters a damn fool she thought there were interviews with famous scientists and pictures of a nobel cosmologist smiling approval there were also pictures of rick owen and mary alice mouton owens smile was broader than the cosmologists looks like dr owen has made himself famous jenny said youre pretty famous too edmund said your hawaiian boyfriend took most of the credit but he did mention your name every reporter in the country would like to interview you oh god yeah thats one reason i waited for you its a wonder the stews didnt recognize you maybe they did jenny said i thought one of them was extra attentive she didnt say anything though the taxi wove through the sparse traffic the freeway to dulles had few onramps originally it wasnt supposed to have any so it would bear no traffic except airport traffic but the politicians had managed to add a couple probably near where they owned property wherever there were ramps a cluster of houses and a small industrial park had sprung up what do you think theyll be like jenny asked gillespie shook his head i dont read much science fiction anymore i used to when i was a kid he stared out the window for a moment then laughed one things sure it ought to give a boost to the space program congress is already talking about buying more shuttles expanding the moon base to listen to those bastards youd think theyd been big space boosters all along what about hollingsworth jenny asked he doesnt seem to be giving interviews maybe he does have some shame she leaned back in the seat senator barton hollingsworth democrat of south dakota had long been an enemy of the space program and for that matter of every investment in high technology and almost anything else except dairy subsidies like his predecessor william proxmire the one thing hollingsworth really hated was seti the search for extraterrestrial intelligence which he claimed was a golden fleece of the taxpayers proxmire had once spent two days trimming one hundred and twelve thousand dollars for seti research from the nasa budget at a time when the welfare department was spending a million dollars a minute toward washington the traffic began to thicken they came off the dulles access freeway into a solid wall of red taillights the driver muttered curses in pakistani and began to weave through traffic ignoring angry horns they drove past a turnoff a long time before the sign at that turnoff had said bureau of public roads research but now it admitted that the cia building was invisible in the trees at the end of that road jenny paid it no attention shed been there before the aliens are coming and im famous jenny thought who are we seeing at the white house gillespie shrugged probably the president oh dear i dont know anything jenny said nothing i didnt tell you on the telephone yesterday he shrugged again well just have to play it as it lies yes but ed i dont even have any guesses neither do i but were the experts gillespie said after all we knew about it first they crossed the potomac and drove along the old chesapeake and ohio canal the morning drizzle had stopped and the sun was trying to break through overhead a dozen or more joggers were out despite the chilly morning jenny closed her eyes gillespie and the driver were in a heated argument the driver didnt understand anything ed was saying he was also getting nervous while gillespie got angrier whats the matter jenny asked damn fool wont follow directions let me where are we damned if i know thats the problem we crossed a bridge a minute ago one i never saw before had buffaloes on it buffaloes oh were near the cathedral jenny said she looked around they were in a typical washington residential neighborhood older houses each with a screened porch which way is north gillespie pointed okay she leaned forward in new york they had plexiglas partitions to seal the driver away from his passengers but there werent any here go ahead then left the pakistani driver looked relieved they drove for a couple of blocks and jenny nodded satisfaction its not far now were on the wrong side of connecticut avenue thats all gillespie was still angry why the hell cant they get drivers who speak english he demanded all the people out of work in this country or say theyre out of work and none of the damn airport taxi drivers at our nations capital can speak english the goddam politicians wouldnt know that though would they they have drivers to pick them up at the airport now that shed dozed off she wanted to sleep again but she stayed awake to direct the driver finding flintridge manor on its hill in rock creek park could be plenty tricky even if youd been there before they wont let washington cabs pick people up at dulles she said which was strange if you thought about it since it was a federal airport operated by the federal aviation administration and reachable only by a federally constructed throughway why shouldnt cabs licensed in washington be able to pick up passengers at dulles but they couldnt and nothing was going to be done about it just as nothing would be done about a hundred thousand other bureaucratic nightmares and why worry about it the government had more immediate problems coming at them out of the sky then again maybe the aliens would solve it all those advanced creatures could be carrying a millionyearold quantified science of government and a powerful missionary urge and the governments problems would be over forever flintridge nestled in colonial splendor atop a large hill there werent a dozen places like it in washington from its big columned porch you couldnt see another house most of the woods surrounding flintridge were part of rock creek national park which was perfect because no one could build there while the westons didnt have to pay taxes on the park property jenny directed the taxi up the gravel drive phoebe the haitian maid came to the door saw them and dashed back inside a few moments later her uncle came out colonel henry weston had inherited most of the money jennys mothers share had been useful but hardly what anyone would call wealth there were advantages to having a rich uncle especially if you had to stay in washington flintridge was much nicer than a hotel jennys room was on the third floor up the back stairs flintridge had a grand stairway to the second floor but there werent enough bedrooms there the top floor had once been a series of garrets theyd been redesigned to be comfortable turned into small suites with attached bathrooms but the only stairway was the narrow twisting enclosed back stairs designed to keep servants from interfering with family servants not slaves flintridge wasnt that old eighteen seventies jenny set her suitcases down and collapsed on the bed thank heaven aunt rhonda wasnt up yet shed have gushed admired jennys nonexistent tan asked about young men now that allan weston was safely married and established in a new york bank jenny was the only possible target for rhonda westons tireless matchmaking aunt rhonda was lovable but very tiring especially at eight in the morning when you had an appointment at the white house at eleven she glanced out the window toward the large arbor and gazebo and almost blushed it had been a long time ago in that gazebo after a school dance she shook het head and lay down sinking into the thick eiderdown comforters and pillows the bed was far too soft and luxurious she could easily have grown up in this house thered been several times when colonel weston us air force reserve and owner of weston international construction had relocated semipermanently leaving flintridge vacant each time hed offered the place to jennys father linda and jenny always hoped to move into flintridge but joel mackenzie crichton had too much of the dour scot in him living in flintridge would be living conspicuously above his station even though colonel weston would have paid the taxes and most of the upkeep it was a great place to visit and they could keep an eye on it for the westons but they wouldnt live there much to the girls disappointment what would it look like for a gs to live in that house jennys father demanded id be investigated every month and after he left government service and became first moderately then quite wealthy joel crichton wouldnt consider flintridge he hadnt much cared for the parties rhonda weston had thrown for his daughters either all nonsense this comingout stuff hed said but he had enough sense not to try to stop them first linda then jeanette had been presented to the eligible young men of washington in grand balls held at flintridge a former president of the united states had come to lindas party jenny had to settle for two senators and the secretary of state the morning after jeanettes ball their comfortable house seemed shabby it must have seemed that way to their father too because he quit his government job a couple of months later to become the washington representative of a california aerospace company thered even been some talk of an investigation but it never came to anything the crichtons had far too many friends in washington no one who knew them was at all surprised when jenny went into army intelligence ed gillespie turned the buick riviera into the irongated drive at pennsylvania avenue a uniformed policeman looked at gillespies identity cards then at a list on his clipboard and waved them through when they reached the garishly ornate building once known as old state then the executive office and now called the old eop a driver materialized ill park it for you sir a marine opened the car door for jenny then stepped back and saluted general captain if youll follow me please he led them across to the white house itself from somewhere in the distance they heard the chatter of grade school children on a tour the marine led them through another corridor in all her years in washington jenny had never been to the white house her parents and colonel weston had been to white house parties and even a state dinner it seemed ridiculous for the crichton girls to take a public guided tour one day theyd be invited and this is the day jenny thought they came to another corridor a young man in a gray suit waited there eleven oclock the marine said right hi im jack clybourne im supposed to check your identification he smiled as he said it but he seemed very serious he looked very young and cleancut and very athletic he inspected general gillespie then jenny they took out identification cards clybourne glanced at them but jenny thought he looked at them superficially he was much more interested in the visitors than in their papers doesnt miss a detail joe gland thinks hes irresistible finally he seemed satisfied and led them along a corridor to the oval office the interior looked very much the way it did on television with the president seated behind the big desk they were both in unifonn so they saluted as they approached the desk david coffey seemed embarrassed he acknowledged their salutes with a wave glad to see you he sounded as if he meant it captain jeanette crichton he said carefully his brows lifted slightly in thought and jenny was sure that hed remember her name from now on and general gillespie good to see you again thank you mr president edmund said eds as nervous as i am jenny thought i didnt think he would be she glanced around the office behind the president on a credenza was a red telephone the phone jenny thought at sac headquarters the general in command had two telephones one red to communicate with his forces and one gold this would be the other end of the gold phone captain this is hap aylesworth the president said he indicated a seated man aylesworths face seemed flushed and his necktie was loosened he stood to shake hands with her please be seated the president said now captain tell me everything you know about this she took the offered chair sitting on its edge both feet on the floor feet together her skin pulled down over her knees as shed been taught in officers training classes i dont know much mr president she said i was at the mauna loa observatory how did you happen to be there aylesworth asked i was invited to hawaii to address an engineering conference i took a couple of extra days leave while i was swimming i met richard owen who turned out to be an astronomer and he invited me up to see the observatory owen aylesworth said pensively come on hap we have confirmation from every place we logically could get confirmation the president said he smiled thinly mr aylesworth cant quite get over the notion that this is a putup job could it have been jenny frowned in thought yes sir but i dont believe it what would be the motivation there must be forty sciencefiction novels with that plot aylesworth said scientists get together convince the stupid political and military people that the aliens are coming unite earth end wars the air force observatory reports the same thing ed gillespie said now that they know what to look for the president nodded as do a number of other sources hap if its a plot there are an awful lot of plotters involved youd think one would have spilled the beans by now yes sir aylesworth said and i suppose were sure this isnt something the russians cooked up to get us off guard both jenny and general gillespie shook their heads not a chance gillespie said no i suppose not aylesworth said my apologies captain im having trouble getting used to the notion of little green men from outer space or big black ones ed gillespie said the president eyed gillespie in curiosity what makes you say that surely you dont have any knowledge no sir but theyre as likely to be big and black as they are to be little and green if we had any idea of where they came from we might be able to figure something out saturn jenny said dr mouton had a computer program alice mouton had wanted to lecture and jenny had listened carefully we dont know how fast they came and saturn must have moved since they left but if you give them almost any decent velocity they started in a patch of sky that had saturn in it saturn aylesworth said saturnians i doubt it ed gillespie said saturn just doesnt get enough sunlight energy for a complex organism to evolve there much less a civilization sure about that the president asked no sir neither is the national academy of sciences the president said at least those i could get hold of but the consensus is that the ship must have gone to saturn from somewhere else now all we have to do is find the somewhere else maybe we can ask them jenny said oddly enough we thought of that aylesworth said with what result gillespie asked none aylesworth shrugged so far they havent answered anyway mr president im satisfied its real good the president said in that case if youd ask mr dawson and admiral carrell to come in gillespie and jenny stood wes dawson came in first hello ed jenny he said ah you both know congressman dawson then the president said yes sir ed gillespie said of course you would david coffey said you told mr dawson about the alien ship have you met admiral carrell yes sir ed said but i think jenny hasnt admiral carrell was approaching retirement age and he looked it with silver hair and wrinkles at the corners of his eyes he shook hands with her masculine fashion his hand was firm and so was his voice his manner made it clear that he knew precisely who jenny was he waited until the president invited them to sit then again until jenny was seated before he took his own seat nice work captain he said not every officer would have realized the significance of what you saw interesting she thought does he take this much trouble with everyone he meets thank you admiral congressman dawson had taken the chair closest to the president how will congress treat this wes the president asked i dont know them all mr president dawson said will i get support for a declaration of emergency i dont know sir dawson said there will certainly be opposition damn fools admiral carrell said what makes you think the aliens wont be friendly wes dawson demanded the aliens may be friendly but a russian mobilization without reaction from us would be a disaster it might even tempt them to something they normally wouldnt think of carrell spoke evenly really dawson said his tone made it less a question than a statement will they mobilize the president asked well let captain crichton answer the admiral said perhaps mr dawson will be more likely to believe someone he knows captain ive just been set up jenny thought so thats how its done but ive no choice yes sir they will she hesitated and if we dont react there could be trouble why is that the president prompted sir its part of their doctrine if they could liberate the world from capitalism without risk to the homeland and didnt do it theyd be traitors to their own doctrine admiral carrell said theyre jamming all our broadcasts and they havent told their people anything about an alien coming its too big to keep secret dawson said isnt it once again admiral carrell turned to jenny this time he merely nodded to her is this a test she wondered whatever it is sir the east germans and poles are bound to find out unless the soviets want to completely disrupt their economy they cant cut off all communication from the eastern european satellites so the news is bound to get to russia to the cities anyway the admiral nodded behind halfclosed eyes meanwhile whatever the russians are doing theres an alien ship coming the president said it may be that in a few weeks all our little squabbles will look very silly yes sir wes dawson said very silly there are other possibilities admiral carrell spoke in low tones but everyone listened even the president such as dawson demanded i want to assemble a staff of experts at colorado springs one task will be to look at as many possibilities as we can very reasonable the president said why colorado springs the hole admiral carrell said norad jenny thought the north american air defense command base buried deep under the granite of cheyenne mountain it was supposed to be the safest place in the united states although there were some arguments about just how hardened it really was will you be going out there the president asked not permanently but youll be busy meanwhile i need someone to keep me informed the president looked thoughtful we have two problems aliens and the soviets captain youre a soviet expert and you discovered the alien ship i didnt discover it sir near enough the president said you recognized its importance and you already have all the clearances you need or you wouldnt be in military intelligence he touched a button on the desk the chief of staff came in immediately jim the president said im commander in chief does that mean i can promote people yes sir good promote this young lady to major and have her assigned to the staff shell work with you and the admiral to keep me briefed on what the aliens and the soviets are doing he chuckled major crichton and general gillespie are military i can give them orders without going through civil service hearings at least i assume i can sure frantz said major crichton just like that good the president was saying general gillespie congressman dawson wants to go meet the aliens in space ed gillespie nodded yes sir you approve yes sir jenny smiled thinly ed would approve more if it was going to be him meeting the aliens for that matter id like to go help him do it the president said i want you to work with him go to houston and personally see to his training its possible youll go along too although thats up to the russians he grimaced slightly then glanced at his watch theyre expecting both of you over at nasa headquarters i wanted to see you before i made up my mind if you hurry you wont be too late yes sir ed glanced at jenny but didnt say anything the president stood and everyone else stood with him the soviet ambassador has demanded an official explanation of why news of this importance was transmitted via private telephone call rather than through official channels he said one of your first tasks major will be to think of ways to convince them that this isnt a trick that may not be easy to do admiral carrell said i realize that the president said others will be working on the problem he indicated dismissal major theyll find you a place to work lord knows where and dont be shy about asking for equipment mr frantz will see that you get what you want ill expect daily reports sent through admiral carrell if hes not available youll brief me yourself jennys thoughts raced giddily here ive been promoted and am in the middle of one of the most unique events in history and ive been assigned to the national security council and personal presidential briefings in the oval office all because i went for a swim and let an astronomer pick me up in hawaii my friend barb believes nothing is ever a coincidence synchronicity maybe theres something to it now all i have to do is figure out where to put you the chief of staff was saying the president will want you in this building i guess ill have to exile someone else to old eop he was striding briskly down the hail jenny followed they reached a desk at the end of the hall the man whod led her to the oval office was seated there jack the chief of staff said meet another member of our family major jeanette crichton the president has assigned her to his staff nsc shell have regular personal access right he studied her again this is jack clybourne jim frantz said secret service i worry about keeping the chief healthy clyboume said get word to all the security people jack frantz turned to jenny major id like you to check in this evening about four i should have some room for you by then meanwhile oh you came with general gillespie youve lost your ride no problem sir right thanks he started down the hall stopped and turned his head but not his body welcome aboard he said over his shoulder he scurried off jenny giggled and clybourne gave her an answering smile hes a worrier that one i gathered whats next fingerprints have to be suit youre you oh who does that i can if you like clybourne lifted a phone and spoke for a few moments presently another cleancut young man entered and sat at the desk tom bucks clyboume said captain jeanette crichton next time you see her shell be wearing oak leaves the president just promoted her shes the newest addition to nsc personal access hi bucks said he studied her and jenny felt he was memorizing every pore on her face they both act that way of course not joe gland just a secret service agent doing his job clybourne led the way downstairs and through a small staff lounge i keep gear back here he said he took out a large black case and put fingerprinting apparatus on the counter of the coffee machine you really have to do this my prints are on file sure what i have to be sure of is that the pretty girl im talking to now is the same jeanette crichton the army commissioned i suppose she said he took her hand just relax and let me do the work shed been through the routine before clybourne was good at it eventually he handed her a jar of waterless cleanser and some paper towels how did you know the president had promoted me she asked the appointment list said captain and the chief of staff called you major jim frantz doesnt make that kind of mistake and you dont miss much either she cleaned the black goo from her hands while clybourne poured two cups of coffee from the pot on the table he handed her one somebody said you live in washington grew up here she said which reminds me can you call me a cab blind mice only one ship is seeking us a black sailed unfamiliar towing at her back a huge and birdless silence in her wake no waters breed or break philip lanjard next please countdown h minus six weeks sure where are you going flintridge its out connecticut rock creek park area i know where it is he glanced at his watch if you can wait ten minutes i can run you out i wouldnt want to put you to any trouble no trouble i go off duty and im going that way all right then thank you you can wait for me at the main entrance clybourne said he took a memo pad bearing the white house seal from his pocket and scribbled on it then took a small triangular pin from another pocket put that in your lapel and keep this pass he said ill see you in ten minutes he smiled again and she found herself answering general narovchatov paused at the door and waited to be invited inside even though nadya had told him that comrade chairman petrovskiy was expecting him petrovskiy did not like surprises the chairman was writing in a small notebook narovchatov waited patiently the office was spartan in comparison to his own petrovskiy seemed not to notice things like rugs and tapestries and paintings he enjoyed rare books with rich leather bindings and was fond of very old cognac otherwise he did not often indulge himself there had been a time when nikolai nikolayevich narovchatov was concerned that it would be dangerous to enjoy the trappings of wealth and power while the chairman so obviously did not he still believed that in the early days that concern had not been misplaced but as narovchatov rose in status the gifts sent him by petrovskiy had become more numerous and more valuable until it was obvious that petrovskiy was encouraging his old associate to indulge himself to enjoy what he did not himself care for narovchatov had never discussed this with chairman petrovskiy it was enough that it was so chairman petrovskiy looked up his welcoming smile was broad come in come in then he grimaced i suppose it was not a joke they continue to come then he lifted his glass of tea and peered at narovchatov over its rim da anatoliy vladimirovich general namvchatov shrugged according to the astronomers at this point it would be difficult for them not to come the rocket forces will be brought to full strength and we are anticipating their arrival they move toward us very fast and they arrive when a few weeks i am told it is difficult to be more precise because it is a powered ship that makes it unpredictable and you continue to believe that this is an alien ship and not more cia tricks i do anatoliy vladimirovich so i think do i but the army does not narovchatov nodded he had expected nothing else and that could be a great problem for a man who had no need of more problems the chairman looked old and tired too old narovchatov thought and what might happen when perhaps the chairman had read his thoughts it is long past time that you were promoted nikolai nikolayevich my friend i wish you to have the post of first secretary we will elevate comrade mayarovin to the politburo where he can rust in honor it is not necessary it is especially now nikolai nikolayevich i have long hoped to be the first leader of the soviet union to retire with honor one day perhaps i will but not until i can give the post to someone worthy you are the most loyal man i know thank you no thanks are needed it is truth but my friend i may not be with you so long the doctors tell me this nonsense that it is not but before i am gone i hope to see us accomplish something never before done to give this land stability to allow its best to serve without fear of their lives the czars had never done that not the czars and not lenin this was russia that requires law anatoliy vladimirovich bourgeois lands have law we have he shrugged expressively we have had terror it is not enough you will remember little of stalins time but i recall khrushchev destroyed himself in trying to destroy stalins memory and we shall never make that mistake but khrushchev was correct that man was a monster even lenin warned against him he did what was necessary narovchatov said as do we as will we enough of this what shall we do about this alien spacecraft narovchatov shrugged the army has begun mobilization constructing new space weapons he frowned i do not yet know what the americans will do nor i the chairman said i suppose they will do the same i hope so narovchatov thought if they do not there were always young officers who would begin the war if they thought they could win it on both sides also we have warned the commander of kosmograd i scarcely know what else to do we must do more the chairman said what will these aliens want what could bring them here across billions of miles if they are aliens at all and not a cia trick this again such a trick would make our space program look like childrens games it is alien and powered i would believe a spacegoing beast with a rocket up its arse before i thought it a cia trick but i think it must be a ship anatoliy vladintirovich i do agree the chairman said only i cannot believe what i believe it is too hard for me what do they want no one would travel that far merely to explore they have reasons for coming they must but i do not know why they have come no nor will we until they are ready to tell us we know too little of this petrovskiy speared narovchatov with a peasants crafty look your daughter has married a space scientist an intelligent man your soninlaw intelligent enough to be loyal intelligent enough to understand what your promotion to first secretary will mean to him someone must command the space preparations who he means something narovchatov thought always he means things he does not say he is clever always clever but sometimes he is too clever for i do not understand him who should command the news of the alien ship had brought something like panic to the kremlin everyone was upset and the delicate balance within the politburo was endangered who could command narovchatov shrugged i had assumed marshal ugatov certainly the army will have suggestions we will listen to them as we do to kgb the chairman continued to look thoughtful what is his plan narovchatov thought the meeting of the defense council is in an hour the heads of the army and the kgb the chief party theoretician chairman petrovskiy and me because petrovskiy has named me his associate at that meeting everything will be settled then comes the meeting of the entire politburo and after that the central committee to endorse what we have already decided but what will we decide he looked at petrovskiy but the chairman was studying a paper on his desk what did anatoliy vladimirovich want the soviet union was ruled by a troika the army the kgb and the party with the party the weakest of the three yet the most powerful because it controlled promotions within the other two organizations other schemes had been tried and nearly brought disaster when stalin died party and army had feared beria for his nkvd was so powerful that it had once eliminated nearly the entire central committee in a matter of weeks party and army together acted to eliminate the threat beria was dragged from a meeting of the politburo and shot by four colonels the top leadership of the nkvd was liquidated suddenly the party found itself facing the uncontrolled army it had not liked what it saw the army was popular the military could command the affections of the people if the partys rule ever ended it would not be the armys leaders who would be shot as traitors the army could even eliminate the party if it had full control of its strength that could not be allowed the nkvd was reconstructed it was shorn of many of its powers divided into the civil militia and the kgb never allowed to gain the strength it once had still it had grown powerful again as always it did its agents could compromise anyone recruit anyone it reached high into the kremlin into the politburo and party and army alliances shifted once again here in this room origins did not matter here and in the politburo itself the truth was known no one of the three power bases could be allowed to triumph party army kgb must all be strong to maintain the balance of power ruling russia consisted of that secret and nothing more petrovskiy was a master at that art and now he was waiting the hint he had given was plain i believe academician bondarev might be very suitable to advise us and to direct our space forces during this emergency narovchatov said if you approve anatoliy vladimirovich now that you make the recommendation i see much to commend it petrovskiy said i believe you should propose academician bondarev at the central committee meeting of course the kgb will insist on placing their man in the operation the kgb would have its man but the party must approve him another decision to be made here before the meeting of the full politburo grushin narovchatov said dmitri parfenovich grushin petrovskiy raised a thick eyebrow in inquiry i have watched him he is trusted by the kgb but a good diplomat well regarded by the party people he knows and he has studied the sciences very well petrovskiy nodded in satisfaction the kgb is divided narovchatov said some believe this a cia trick others know better we have seen it for ourselves rogachev has seen it with his own eyes in the telescopes aboard kosmograd the americans could never have built that ship anatoliy vladimirovich petrovskiys peasant eyes hardened perhaps not but the army does not believe that marshal ugatov is convinced that this is an american plot to cause him to aim his rockets at this thing in space while the americans mobilize against us but they would not narovchatov said it is all very well for us to say these things for the public but we must not delude ourselves petrovskiy frowned and nikolai narovchatov was afraid for a moment then the chairman smiled thinly we may however have no choices he said at all events it is settled your daughters husband will take charge of our space preparations it is better that be done by a civilian come let us have a cognac to celebrate the promotion of marinas husband with much pleasure narovchatov went to the cabinet and took out the bottle crystal decanter and glasses what will the americans really do he asked petrovskiy shrugged they will cooperate what else can they do it is never wise to underestimate the americans i know this i taught it to you nikolai nikolayevich grinned i remember but do you yes but they will cooperate narovchatov frowned a moment then saw the sly grin the chairman wore ah he said their president called no i called him nikolai narovchatov thought of the implications of a deal petrovskiy was the only man in the soviet union who could have spoken to the american president without narovchatov knowing it within moments does thisov know this he asked i did not tell him petrovskiy said he shrugged narovchatov nodded agreement the kgb had many resources who could know what its commander might find out you will discuss this in the defense council then nikolai narovchatov poured two glasses of rare cognac and passed one across the large desk the chairman grinned and lifted the drink in salute to the cooperation of the americans he said he laughed naruvchatov lifted his glass in reply but inwardly he was confounded this alien ship could be nothing but trouble at a time when had come so close to the top but nothing was certain now the kgb would have its own devious games so twisted that even bonderev would not understand and the army was reacting as armies always reacted missiles were made ready many fingers hover over many buttons nikolai naruvchatov felt much like the legendary tatar who had saddled a whirlwind the shows were over and martin carnell was driving home with his awards one best bitch three best of breed and a best working one more than he expected from behind him from the crates in the back of the heavy station wagon came restless sounds martin flipped off the radio to listen none of the dogs sounded sick barth was just a puppy and he wasnt used to traveling in the station wagon his mood was affecting the others martin was taking it easy he stayed at fifty or below with half a minute to change lanes you couldnt drive a station wagon like a race car not with starquality dogs in the back otherwise theyd be ready to take a judges hand off by the day of the show martin saw a lot of country this way this had been a typical dogshow circuit two shows on saturday and sunday sixty miles apart five weekdays to be killed somehow and three hundred miles to be covered two more shows much closer together the following weekend two thousand miles to be covered on the trip take it easy guys martin said because they liked the sound of his voice he turned on the radio the music had stopped martin heard i have spoken with the soviet chairman it sounded like the president himself that unmistakable trade union accent martin turned up the sound we are also consulting on a joint response to this alien ship my fellow americans our scientists tell us that this could be the greatest event in the history of mankind you now know all that we know a large object well over a mile in length is approaching the earth along a path that convinces our best sc entific minds that it is under power and intelligently guided so far there has been no communication with it we have no reason to believe this is a threat martin grinned and shook his head wishing hed heard the beginning of the broadcast whoever was playing the part he sure had the presidents voice down pat martin laughed at a different thought george tateevans tuned in at the same moment he had he wouldnt know whether to bellow with the joy of vindication or hide under the bandstand the enclave was still going martin knew that much he couldnt understand now how hed got sucked into the survivalist mind set spent some real money too before he came to his senses the only thing that little fling had ever done for him was to turn him from miniature poodles to dobermans hed bought marten burg sunhawk because a doberman might be better equipped to defend his house and found that he flat out preferred the larger dogs but the rest of the enclave families must still be meeting on thursday nights all ready for the end of civilization on earth george and vicki what would they do warn the rest of the the enclave and head for the hills of course their natural reaction to any stimulus and they say dog people are scary a newscasters rich radio voice continued the theme speaking of war and politics it introduced a professor of physics who also wrote science fiction and who predicted wonderful things from the coming confrontation martin easing down old us with a load of prima donna dogs began to wonder if he really was listening to a remake of war of the worlds he hadnt found a plot line yet there was heavy traffic in the san fernando valley isadore leiber cursed lightly half listening to the news station half worrying about how late he would be isadore had simply forgotten it wasnt a thursday his brain hadnt ticked over until fourthirty and then hey wasnt something happening tonight sure jack mccauley called an emergency meeting of the enclave probably has to do with that light in the sky id better call clara remind her clara had remembered and wondered where he was he fought abnormally dense rushhour traffic straight to the tateevans place one house among many in the san fernando valley clara met him at the curb laughing insisting that shed followed him right in in her own car he grabbed her and kissed her to shut her up they held each other breathlessly for a moment then by mutual consent let go and walked up on the porch clara rang the bell and they waited in those few seconds clara stopped laughing even stopped smiling do you think theyll be angry yeah my fault and i guess i dont care that much relax they did tell us or jack did the door opened george tateevans ushered them inside he wasnt angry but he wasnt happy either clara isadore come on in what kept you my boss isadore lied whats happening george ran his hand over bare scalp to long thin blond hair he wasnt yet forty but hed been half bald when isadore first met him sign of virility hed said now he answered jack and harriet taped some newscasts were playing them now clara the girls are in the kitchen cooking something girls kitchen cooking something what this was serious then or else george was sure this was serious could it be that serious survivalism specialization wartime rules isadore made his way into a darkened living room he knew where the steps and the furniture were hed been there often enough the light of the fivefoot screen showed him an empty spot on the couch there were only men in the room the house belonged to george and vicki tateevans but vicki wasnt present and clara had gone to the kitchen clara ye gods she thought it was real george waved him to a seat then went to the betamax recorder here it is again he said the set lit up to show the presidential seal then the oval office the camera panned in on president david coffey the president looked calm and relaxed almost too much so isadore thought but he does look very presidential my fellow americans coffey said last night scientists at the university of hawaii made an amazing discovery their findings have since been confirmed by astronomers at kitt peak and other observatories according to the best scientific information i have been able to obtain a very large spacecraft is approaching earth from the general direction of the planet saturn the president looked up at the camera ignoring his notes for a moment he had a way of doing that of looking into the camera so that everyone watching felt he was speaking directly to them coffeys ability to do that had played no small part in his election i have been told that it is not possible that the ship came from saturn and that it must have come from somewhere much farther away wherever it came from it is rapidly approaching the earth and will arrive here within a few weeks probably at the end of june he paused to look at the yellow sheets of paper that lay on his desk then back at the camera again so far we have received no communication from this ship we therefore have no reason whatever to believe the ship poses any threat to us however the soviet union became aware of this ship at the same time we did predictably their reaction was to mobilize their armed forces our observation satellites show that they have begun a partial strategic alert we cannot permit the soviets to mobilize without some answer i have therefore ordered a partial mobilization of the united states strategic forces i wish to emphasize that this is a defensive mobilization only the united states has never wanted war we particularly do not desire war at a time when an alien spacecraft is approaching this planet no american president could ignore the soviet mobilization i have not done so however i have spoken with the soviet chairman and we have reached an agreement on limiting our strategic mobilization we are also consulting on a joint response to the alien ship my fellow americans our scientists tell us that this could be the greatest event in the history of mankind you now know all that we know a large object perhaps a mile in length is approaching the earth along a path that convinces our best scientific minds that it is under power and intelligently guided so far there has been no communication with it we have no reason to believe this is a threat and we have many reasons to believe this is an opportunity with the help of god almighty we will meet this opportunity as americans have always met opportunities good night the oval office faded and news analysts came on george switched off the set we can skip the analysis those birds dont know any more than we do but you see why i called an alert they had called themselves the enclave before there was anything more than four men meeting at george and vickis house that was at the tail end of the seventies when the end of civilization was a serious matter there were doubledigit inflation and a rising crime rate iran was holding fiftyodd kidnapped ambassadors and getting away with it opecs banditry regarding oil prices seemed equally safe what nation would be next to see the obvious the united states couldnt defend itself the value of her money was falling to its limit a penny and a half in money the cost of printing a dollar bill us military forces were in shreds and the soviets kept building missiles long after they caught up then passed the united states strategic forces if the economy didnt collapse nuclear war would kill you either way there were long odds against survival of the unprepared the enclave was born of equal parts desperation and playacting which was more important depended on the morning headlines things looked better after reagan was elected the hostages were returned minutes after the old cowboy took office but the enclave continued to meet the dollar ceased to fall then grew strong the economy was turning around the stock market was showing signs of health but there was no money for the military and the soviet union kept building rockets the enclave made lists of what a survivalist ought to own and checked each others stocks a years supply of food just like the mormons guns gold coins and they dreamed of a place to run just in case the late eighties welfare had not increased to match inflation and unemployment was down there might have been a connection inflation had slowed too general motors had won its lawsuit against the unions for damages done by a strike and collected from the union funds strikes ought to be less common in the future the weapons of war had moved into a sciencefictional realm difficult for the avenge citizen to assess but the soviet space program had been moving steadily outward until they virtually owned the sky from near earth orbit to beyond the moon the enclave continued to meet they had grown older and generally wealthier four years ago they had bought a piece of land outside bellingham a decaying city north of seattle that had been a port and shipyard before the silt moved in and the trade moved south it was as far from any likely targets of war as anyplace that seemed able to support itself there had once been a navy shipyard but that was long ago they all made money but they werent rich their jobs kept them in los angeles over the years one or another had found wealth or peace or even both in small towns the dropouts were replaced and the enclave endured an aging group of middleclass survivalists unwilling to break away from los angeles and their not inconsiderable incomes all this time they had been meeting every thursday night after the dinner hour like clockwork tonight was monday they had left work early and isadore was getting hungry the dinner hour should have been just beginning but the terrible strangeness of this night did not derive from that isadore leiber sought for what it was that was bothering him and it came not in strangeness but in familiarity as he reached for a cigarette four years ago hed given up smoking for the last time hed given it up but he borrowed from his friends at every opportunity giving up smoking became his lifestyle it got to where his friends couldnt stand him the sight of a familiar face triggered his urge to smoke he would roll pipe tobacco in toilet paper if he had to but he was giving up smoking yes indeed and he was getting ready for the end of civilization yes indeed but hed been doing it for well over a decade and that had become his lifestyle tonight was weird no laughter no complaining about fools in congress tonight they meant it i hate the timing george said corliss is about to graduate and the rest of the kids wont like missing the tail end of the school year and if they do i dont there were echoes of agreement i cant go isadore said the noise stopped jack mccauley said what do you mean cant i cant quit my job i cant take leave either george said it its timing travel agencies get hectic with summer coming on jack made a sound of disgust george asked sick leave mmm a couple of weeks wait till oh the tenth of june jack this makes sense george jumped the gun on an automatic protest were bound to forget something well keep ia posted ia you take your two weeks sick leave just before the etis reach earth you come up then two weeks later youll damn well know whether you want to go back to the city its still costing us a pair of strong arms jack groused isadore decided he liked the idea ill ask clara if she wants to take the kids up early maybe well want to keep them in school as long as we can all right it cant be helped jack said but the rest of us are going right he snowballed on before there could be an answer bill and gwen are already up at the enclave weve got the second cistern system running and hes got the top deck poured on the shelter bill says the well has to be cleaned out but we can do that with muscle when we get there he pursed his lips in a familiar gesture one thing ia you come up a full week before the etis get here cut it any finer and you may not make it at all when people really believe in that ship god knows what theyll do if the soviets give us that long george said jack frowned for that matter if theres any alien ship at all maybe this is something the russians cooked up they all shrugged no data isadore said but youd think the president would know and hed sure tell us right jack said ia are you sure you want to wait yeah i have to christ hes right isadore thought who the flick knows whats happening aliens russians a nuclear war could ruin your whole day i think clara will go up early he said ill have to ask her the others nodded understanding when theyd first started the enclave they made a decision one vote per adult but all the votes of a family would be cast by one person the theory was simple if a family couldnt even agree on who represented it what could they agree on thered been a problem at first because isadore thought clara ought to vote rather than him but she didnt get along with jack or maybe jack didnt get along with her thered been too many arguments after the first year things had settled in and only the men voted but isadore often went off to ask claras opinion before making a decision who else goes jack demanded the inevitable question struck each of them differently jack was already belligerent george looked disconcerted then guilty well us of course he said our wives and children of course who else who do we need who do we want john fox isadore laughed hell yes we want fox hes a better survivor than any of us thats why hes not coming i talked to him hell be camping somewhere in death valley and thats fine for him but he didnt invite me along what if martie shows aw hell jack martin carnell had been with the enclave for a time hed lasted long enough to help buy the house and land in bellingham then maybe hed run into financial trouble hed quit later hed moved further north into the antelope valley you read me wrong george i just want to point out that hes got some legal rights were betting that wont matter much but suppose he shows up at the gate before or after the etis get here weve turned that place into a fortress since he quit expensive isadore grinned at them what he owns is something like half his fair share awkward yah well i see him sometimes and hes still single theres just him and those damn dobennans george said is that bad we can use some guard dogs well make him build his own kennels these are show dogs theyre gentle and dignified and everybodys friend anything else would cost martie some prizes theyre not guard dogs would looters know that a silence fell jack said shall we let him in if he shows at the gate assuming hes got equipment and supplies but i see no reason to phone him up and invite him there were nods and some relief showed george said harry reddington wants to come two heads shook slowly jack mccauley asked have you seen hairy red lately george hesitated then nodded we used to be friends i guess we still are hell we took motorcycles up along the pacific coast highway one time three hundred miles wed stop in a bar and harry would sing and play that guitar and get us our drinks that way and maybe our dinners hairy red the minstrel i lately yeah ive seen him lately he looks like hes about to have twins and he has to use that cane it isnt because he had those accidents jack shook his head in bewildered pity rearended twice in two weeks in two different cars and neither of them had head rests typical of harry but thats not the point the insurance companys been fastshuffling him for two years and his lawyer tells him he wont win if hes too healthy when he gets on the stand now jacks speech slowed and his enunciation improved as if he were making a point for someone who didnt quite understand english harry red has been letting his insurance company tell him to stay sick so he doesnt exercise and he lets his belly grow like a parasite all right all right ken dutton he had his chance interesting mind he collects some odd stuff and it all seems to make sense maybe were too much alike the four of us george you offered to let him in he waffled now theres something coming and suddenly its not fun and games anymore he could have got in when it was fun and games why didnt he was it the money oh partly not just the dues for the enclave but the gear we make each other buy he has to pay alimony only hes got gear its just not like ours and partly its because he never really gets all the way into anything hardly a recommendation what has he got for weapons george smiled reluctantly that crossbow itd kill a bear that thing and its advertised as suitable for swat teams and his liquor he calls it trade goods and he really does keep an interesting bar a crossbow and a rocket pistol ive seen his little s gyrojet how many shells has he got for it its for damn sure theyll never make any more he could have been in and he didnt pay his dues george isadore said you could say the same about jeri wilson we want her dont we youre married ia and im very married martie isnt john fox isnt and wed take him there are men we want besides us arent there do we want the men seriously outnumbering the women i dont think we do we cant invite the whole city jack said we dont have the room izzie who else are you going to try to drag in you knew we wouldnt have harry and you wouldnt want him anyway its just that a month from now i can see us all being terribly apologetic the hell you say said jack this could be our invitation to join the galactic union it could be a flock of funny looking alien grad students here to give us cheap jewelry for answering their questions george made a rude noise jack at least looked more thoughtful than amused isadore steamed on through the interruption and who knows what they might consider cheap jewelry okay so were going off to hide somebody has to just in case but i can hear the remarks from some people i like because we left them outside jacks look was stony remember a sciencefiction story called to serve man sure they even made a twilight zone out of it about an alien handbook on how to deal with the human race george smiled some sciencefiction fans actually published the cookbook and sobered yeah somebody has to hide till we know what they want and just in case we do not take liabilities see how they run do unto the other feller the way hed like to do unto you an do it fust edward notes westcott david ilarum countdown h minus six weeks the areo plaza mall was deep underground with fourstory shafts reaching high to street level around the corner from the government bookstore was a b daltons and near that was a radio station with its control room in showcase windows a few people with nothing better to do sat on benches watching the radio interviewer his guest was a sciencefiction author whod come to plug his latest book but couldnt resist talking about the alien ship the government bookstore had been crowded all day ken dutton noticed harry shuffling in but was too busy to hail him harry reddington was still using a cane ken remembered him as a biker he still had the massive frame but it had turned soft years ago hed trimmed his beard and cut his hair short even before the two successive whiplash accidents he might have lost some weight lately hed claimed to when ken saw him last but the belly was still his most prominent feature he stopped just past the doorway and looked around at shelves upon shelves of books and pamphlets before he sought out ken dutton behind the counter hi ken hello harry whats up harry ran his hand back through graying scarlet hair i was listening to the news not much on the intruder its still coming and i got to thinking how most of these books will be obsolete an hour after that thing sets down some will dutton waved toward a shelf of military books others maybe not history still means something some will go obsolete but which books maybe medicine maybe theyve got something thatll cure any disease and theyre just dying to give it away yeah harry didnt smile i remember theres one on how to take care of a car more than one cars and bikes and and bicycles for that matter okay maybe theyve got matter transmitters talked to george today no i guess i should have dutton said hells bells i should have joined that survivalist outfit when i had a chance now ill call after we close good luck parry said you talked to them yeah theyre not recruiting but theyre running scared scared of the aliens a little and of the russians a lot harry looked thoughtful george mentioned a book on cannibal cookery supposed to be funny but it was wellresearched he said we dont carry it and harry im not sure i want to think youve got a copy well you never know harry couldnt keep it up and laughed all right but maybe what well need is survival manuals i thought id come in and look around the shelves had been seriously depleted harry chose a few and came to the counter there was a new book from the public health service on stretching exercises got it in yet sure but were out others had the same thought you did ken youre actually one of the enclave group arent you ken hesitated they invited me in i havent moved yet and maybe its too late maybe not jesus are you hooked for dinner i dont know need to make a phone call he went to the back room and dialed georges number vicki answered hi ken said uhthis is ken dutton i know who you are yesuhvicki is there a meeting tonight not tonight call tomorrow vicki i know damned well theres a meeting call tomorrow anything else bye then the phone went dead ken dutton went back out to the customer area and found harry no i dont have anything on tonight lets eat here in the plaza saves us worrying about rush hour jeri wilson kissed her daughter and was surprised at how easy it was to hold her smile until melissa went up to her room shes a goodlooking tenyearold jeri thought going to be pretty when she grows up melissa had jeris long bones and slender frame her hair was a bit darker than jeris and not quite so fine but her face was well shaped pretty rather than beautiful jeri waited until she heard the toilet flush then waited again until the light under melissas door vanished shed sleep now shed be exhausted so am i jeris smile faded it had been such a wonderful day the nicest for weeks until she came home to find the mail she went to the living room an expensive breakfront stood there and she took out a red crystal decanter and a matching crystal glass we bought this in venice we couldnt really afford the trip and the glassware was much too expensive god that was a beautiful summer the sherry came from fedco but no one ever noticed the sherry they were too enchanted with the decanter she poured herself a glass and sat on the couch it was impossible to stop the tears now damn you david wilson she took the letter from her apron pocket it was handwritten postmarked cheyenne wells colorado and it wasnt signed she thought the handwriting looked masculine hut she couldnt be sure dear mrs wilson it said if youre really serious about keeping your husband youd better get out here and do something right away cause hes got himself a new cookie of course he has a new cookie jeri thought hes been gone almost two years and he filed for divorce six months ago it was inevitable inevitable or not she didnt like to think about it pictures came to mind david nude stepping out of the shower lying with david on the beach at malibu late at night long after the beach had closed both of them buzzed with champagne theyd been celebrating davids phd and they made love three times and even if the third time had been more effort than consummation it was a wonderful night after the first time shed turned to him and said i havent been taking my pills i know he said she liked to think melissa was conceived that night certainly it happened during that wonderful week five months later jeri quit her job as general science editor for uclas alumni magazine davids education was finished hed found a great job with litton industries and they could enjoy themselves she sipped her sherry then convulsively drained the glass it was an effort to keep from throwing it on the floor who am i so damned mad at at myself im a damned fool she crumpled the letter then smoothed it out again then poured more sherry no matter how often she wiped her eyes they filled again shed had three glasses when the phone rang at first she thought shed ignore it but it might be about melissa or it might even be david he still called sometimes what if its him and he says he needs me hello jen this is vicki oh youve heard the news vicki asked how the devil would you know about david what news the alien spaceship what jeri where have you been all day hibernating no melissa and i drove up to the angeles crest we had a picnic then you havent seen the news jen the astronomers have discovered an alien spaceship in the solar system its coming to earth aliens coming to earth she heard the words but they didnt make any sense youre not putting me on jeri go turn on channel four ill call back in half an hour we have to talk saturn they were coming from saturn and no one knew how long theyd been there jeri remembered a tv monitor at jpl three lines twisted into a braid and davids grip on her arm was hard enough to hurt that was a lot mote than ten years ago i was about twenty i had david and everything was wonderful the phone rang just as the news program was ending jen lifted the receiver hello vicki hi okay you watched the news yes jeri giggled what aliens from saturn thats what vicki ill bet they were there when the voyager probe went past i remember all the bull sessions after that probe john deming and gregory and david and i trying to think how an orbiting band of particles could be twisted like that david even said aliens once but he wasnt serious yes well thats what we need to talk about vicki said weve decidedthe enclave is going north to bellingham you and melissa are invited oh why well for one thing you and david were part of the group for a long time thats one reason jeri said what are some others vicki tajeevans sighed because you know scienceand all right because youre pretty and unattached and we may need to attract a single guy an interesting compliment im glad they think im pretty at my age i see so i can be a playmate for ken dutton jeri he wasnt invited good i thought you liked ken in fact i thought you can keep that thought to yourself vicki tateevans of course it was true ken dutton had invited himself to dinner with jeri and david after his wife left him and when david moved to colorado ken continued to come over she wasnt interested in an affair although it was pretty difficult sleeping alone she missed david a lot and in every way and ken wasnt unattractive and he was very attentive the night she learned that david had filed for divorce ken had been there and held her and listened to her and in a blind rage she seduced him for a few days hed shared her bed then she found out what he was thinking he thought id be convenient jeri said he wouldnt have to drive far somehow that didnt seem a good foundation for a relationship oh vicki laughed awkwardly anyway hes not invited in fact i was supposed to tell you not to invite him well thats good jeri well be going up to bellingham this week isadore and clara will stay down here until a few days before the aliens come wed like you to come up with us but you could wait and go up with isadore if you want i see thanks vicki uhill get back to you shall i youll have to we need to go over your gear find out what david left you and what you have to take ill help with that thanks theres a lot of it here ill get it out thanks for inviting me sure bye jeri put the phone down and thoughtfully pulled at her lower lip aliens coming here soon and they hid at saturn no sign of them nothing that made sense anyway they stayed hidden for more than a dozen years is that a sign of friendship dont be paranoid she told herself but it might be a good idea not to be in a big city when they came just in case she and david and melissa had visited george and vicki at the enclave house in bellingham that had been nice a good vacation it had been their last vacation together a month later david was transferred to colorado its a big raise hed told her he sounded excited but what about my job what about it jeri you dont have to work david i dont have to but i want to when melissa started school jeri needed something to do and became an editorial assistant with the west coast branch of a big publishing house shed been good at the job her experience with the alumni paper had helped within a year shed become an associate editor and then thered been a lucky break shed discovered a woman who needed a lot of help handholding and reassurances and lots of editing but whose first book became an instant bestseller after that jeri became a senior editor im important at harris wickes youre important to me and to melissa david jeri its a big promotion i was a damn fool so was he why didnt he tell me theyd fire him if he didnt transfer that a lot of eager young petroleum geologists were graduating from the schools and the big firms would rather hire a recent graduate than a man so long out of school he didnt tell me because he was ashamed they didnt really want him anymore but he couldnt tell me that and he wouldnt beg me damn it i begged him but its not really the same and david david why cant i just call you and say im coming to you why cant i it was a beautiful spring day in washington the city was surprisingly calm despite the headlines it took a lot to shake up washington people roger brooks walked from nasa headquarters back toward the white house thered been nothing for him at the nasa press conference it was great for congressman wes dawson that he was going to go up to the soviet kosmograd space station to watch the aliens arrive it might even make a story but mavis would take care of the news part and there was plenty of time to collect background for a minute hed thought he had something jeanette crichton discovers the satellite and wes dawson goes to the president not too many would know about the connection between linda crichton gillespie and carlotta dawson he was still thinking about that when the nasa press people explained it all in loving detail captain crichton calls her brotherinlaw who calls congressman dawson who goes to see the president all out in the open for everyone to see nothing hidden at all damn it was a good twentyminute walk to the mayflower even so roger got there before his lunch appointment the grill at the mayflower was convenient even if the food wasnt distinguished roger would have preferred one of the french cuisine places off k street but today he was meeting john fox fox wasnt someone you ate an expensive lunch with no matter who was paying brooks ordered a glass of white wine and leaned back to relax until fox showed up you cant get anywhere in washington dc without a coat and tie sure enough fox was in disguise in a gray business suit and a tie that didnt glare it wouldnt have fooled anybody his shirt cuffs gave him away they were much larger than his wrists lean as a ferret with bony shoulders and fatfree muscle showing even in the hands and face john fox looked like hed just walked out of a desert roger worked his way out of the booth to shake his hand how are you john have you heard the news yeah they slid into the booth im surprised youre here for a fact this wasnt the day a militant defender of deserts could get the publics attention roger had toyed with the idea of chasing after news of the alien spacecraft but those who knew anything would be telling anyone who would listen and hed be fighting for scraps for a while roger had wondered aliens coming from saturn it didnt make sense and roger was sure it was some kind of trick probably cia when he tried to check that out though he ran into a barrage of genuine bewilderment if there were any secrets hidden inside the presidents announcement it was going to take a lot more than a few hours to find them and john fox had given roger stories in the past so he said the day i skip an appointment with a known news source you call the police because ive been kidnapped now tell me what youre doing in washington i know you dont like cities fox nodded have you heard what theyre doing to china lake when brooks looked blank he amplified the highbeam for a moment nothing clicked then of course he meant the microwave receiving station an orbiting solar power plant had to have a receiver its just a test facility its only going to cover about an acre oh sure and the orbiting power plant only covers about a square mile of sky and wont send down more than a thousand megawatts even if everything works roger dont you understand about test cases if it works theyll do it bigger theyll cover the whole damn sky with silver rectangles i like the sky i like desert too this thing has to be stopped now i wonder if the soviets wont stop us before you do they havent yet fox looked thoughtful all the science types say this thing isnt a weapon i wonder if the russians believe that roger shrugged anyway i thought id better be here flew in on the redeye last night but nobodys keeping appointments nobody but you he glanced up to see the waitress hovering bacon burger tomato slices no fries hot tea chefs salad heineken brooks made notes but mostly out of habit of course no one was keeping appointments aliens were coming to earth they tell me itll be clean power roger said help eliminate acid rain fox shook his head never works they get more power they use more power look they tell you an electric razor doesnt use much power right and it doesnt but what about the power it took to make the damn thing you use it a few years maybe not that long and out it goes the more electric power we get the more theyre tempted to keep up the throw away society no real conservation nothing lasts doesnt have to last roger no matter how clean they make it it pollutes some theyll never learn to do without until they have to do without okay brooks jotted more notes so theyll clutter up the deserts and block the stars and give us bad habits what else is wrong with them roger brooks listened halfheartedly as fox marshaled his arguments there werent any new ones they werent what roger had come for anyway fox could argue but the real stories would come from learning what tactics fox intended to use he had loyal troops loyal enough to chain themselves to the gates of nuclear power plants or clog the streets of washington fox had led the fight against the sun desert nuclear power plant and won and his tips had put roger in the right place at the right time for good stories not today though no one was listening to fox today not even his friends not even me roger thought this wasnt going to make any kind of news brooks was tempted to put away his notebook instead he said this could be just a puff of smoke tomorrow or later today for that matter have you thought about what an interstellar spacecraft might use for power by the time the aliens stop talking these orbiting solar plants could look like the first fire stick even to us fox shook his head hell we may not even understand what these etis are using or maybe its worse than what weve got anyway nothing changes that fast whatever that light in the sky does for us the highbeam is going ahead unless i stop it and i intend to i had an appointment with senator bryant he canceled for today so ill just wait him out brooks jotted john fox is the only man in the nations capital who doesnt care beans about an approaching interstellar spacecraft hell i wish i had something more for you fox said thought i did its all right no its not fox said youre like me brooks a nut monomaniac he held up his hand when roger started to protest its true i love my deserts and you love snooping well heft id help you get a pulitzer if i could youve always played fair with me he chuckled but not today nobodys paying attention to a damn thing but that eti comin do you really believe in that thing i think so you know that army officer who was in hawaii when they saw it coming i know her i just dont think shes part of anything funny no its real all right could be there are a lot of scientists in the sierra club roger said any of them have an opinion on highbeam damn right i meant on the etis john fox grinned i havent heard i will though and ill be sure to let you know jenny surveyed her office with satisfaction the furniture was battered fortunately there wasnt much of it because if thered been more the office couldnt have held it all she had a desk with nothing on it but a telephone there were also a small typing table three chairs and a thickwalled filing cabinet with a heavy security lock they said theyd get her a bookcase but that hadnt come yet neither had the computer terminal the room was tiny and windowless in a basement but it was the white house basement and that made up for everything the phone rang major crichton she said jack clybourne oh hi hed come in for coffee after he drove her home theyd sat outside under flintridges arbor and when they noticed the time two hours had passed that hadnt happened to her in years hi yourself ive only got a moment interested in dinner aunt rhonda would expect her to eat at flintridge what did you have in mind afghan place stuffed grape leaves and broiled lamb it sounds great but let me call you after you get home no big deal if you cant make it ill go to mcdonalds youre threatening suicide if i dont have dinner with you i have to run ill call you i havent given you the number she said how will you call we have our ways bye she put the phone carefully on its cradle holy catfish im actually lightheaded stupid i just need lunch but i was thinking about him just before he called the private phone on wes dawsons desk was hidden inside a leather box it rang softly yes carlotta said me hows houston hot and wet and windy im in the hilton edgewater room she made a note of the room number i miss you already he said sure you probably have a texas girl already two actually just be careful ive seen the speaker well arrange for you to be paired whenever we can so itll go in the congressional quarterly it was standard practice a congressman who couldnt be present for a vote found another who intended to vote the opposite way and formed a pair neither attended and both were recorded as paired so that the outcome of the vote wasnt affected but neither congressman was blamed for missing a rollcall vote good can you ask andy to look after my committee work already did what kind of administrative assistant do you think i am anyway fair to middling humph keep that up and ill ask for a raise i suppose houstons full of talk about the aliens lord yes wes said and the tv showsdid you watch the tonight show nothing but alien jokes some pretty clever i think the countrys taking it all right so do i but ive got wilbur checking things out in the district carlotta said so far nothing though not even phone calls except mrs mcnulty yeah i expect shes in heaven mrs mcnulty called her congressman every week usually to insist on protection against flying saucers look theyve got me on a pretty rigorous schedule up before the devils got his shoes on physical training yet ugh youll be all right youre in good shape carlotta said ill be in better in a month youll love it good call me tomorrow i will thanks carlotta she smiled as she put the phone down thanks hed said thanks for looking after things for letting me go to space as long as shed known wes hed been a space nut hed even signed up to be a lunar colonist and was shocked when she told him she wasnt really interested in living on the moon his look had frightened her he would have gone without her if hed had the chance that chance never came the us lunar base was a tiny affair never more than six astronauts and currently down to four the russians had fifteen people on the moonand they made it clear that a larger us effort wouldnt be welcome what would they do to the americans sent more people to the moon president coffey hadnt wanted to find out maybe it wouldnt matter now carlotta went back to the papers on wes dawsons desk aliens might or might not be coming but if wes dawson wanted to remain in congress there was a lot of work to finish here in washington preparations there are periods when the principles of experience need to be modified when hope and trust and instinct claim a share with prudence in the guidance of affairs when in truth to dare is the highest wisdom willlam ellery channing the union countdown h minus five weeks academician pavel bondarev sat at his massive walnut desk and flicked imaginary dust specks from its gleaming surface the office was large as befitted a full member of the soviet academy who was also director of an institute for astrophysics the walls were decorated with photographs taken by the new telescope aboard the soviet kosmograd space station there were spectacular views of jupiter as good as those obtained by the american spacecraft and there were color photographs of nebulae and galaxies and the endless wonders of the sky there was also a portrait of lenin pavel aleksandrovich bondarev needed no visit from the local party officials to remind him of that visiting party officials might know nothing of what the institute did but they would certainly notice if there was no picture of lenin it might be the only thing a visiting party official was qualified to notice he waited impatiently because he was waiting he was startled when the interphone buzzed da he has arrived at the airport his secretary said there are papers to sign bring them bondarev said brusquely the door opened seconds later his secretary came in she carried a sheaf of papers but she made no move to show them to him lorena was a small woman with dark flashing eyes her ankles were thin one wrist was encircled by a golden chain which pavel bondarev had given her the third time they had slept together she had been his mistress for ten years and he could not imagine life without her to the best of his knowledge she had no life beyond him she was the perfect secretary in public and the perfect mistress in private it had occurred to him that she genuinely loved him but that thought was sufficiently frightening that he did not want to deal with it better to think of her as mistress and secretary emotional involvement was dangerous she came in and closed the door who is this man she demanded why is moscow sending an important man who does not give his name what have you been doing pavel aleksandrovich he frowned slightly lately she had begun speaking to him that way even at the office never when anyone was around of course but it was bad for discipline to allow her to address him in that way inside the institute a rebuke came to his tongue but he swallowed it she would accept it yes but he would be made to pay tonight tomorrow night some evening in her apartment it is not a difficulty bondarev said he was expected then you know him no i meant that someone from moscow was expected he smiled and she moved closer to him until she was standing beside his chair her hand lay on his arm he covered it with his own there is no difficulty my lovely one calm yourself if you say so i do you recall the telephone call from the americans in hawaii it concerns that but you will not tell me he laughed i have not told my wife and children she snorted well yes even so this is a state secret it is a matter of state security why should i deceive you what have we to do with state security how can the state be affected by distant galaxies she demanded what have you been doing pave i you must not do this but what you wish to go to moscow she said it is your wife she has never been happy here her voice changed became more shrill accented with the bored sophistication of a muscovite great lady daughter of a member of the politburo yes the party found it necessary to send pavel here for a few years the provincial people are so inefficient i suppose we simply must make the sacrifice i wish you would not mock marina he said and you are wrong this has nothing to do with a return to moscow resides when we do go back i will take you with me all russians want to live in moscow i do not want to go i want to stay here with you your wife is not so careful here in moscow she would be concerned lest her friends learn her husband has a mistress that was true enough but it hardly mattered none of this is important he said not now things will change soon sooner than you know great changes for all of us she frowned you are serious i have never been more serious changes for the better i do not know he stood and took both her hands in his but i promise you there will be changes beyond our power to predict as profound as the revolution pavel bondarev studied the papers he had been given but from time to time he looked past them at the man who had brought them dmitii parfenovich grushin a lieutenant colonel in the kgb despite his seeming youth grushin wore a suit of soft wool that fit perfectly obviously made in paris or london he was of average height and slender but his grip had been very strong and he walked with an athletic spring to his step the papers told him what general narovchatov had already said i see bondarev said i am to go to baikonur yes comrade academician grushin spoke respectfully it was difficult to know what the man was thinking he seemed perfectly in control of his face and his voice he brought a letter from general narovchatov inviting marina and the children to moscow and enclosing the necessary travel permits marina would be pleased there is much unsaid here bondarev said yes i can explain grushin said please general narovchatov has become first secretary of the party grushin said carefully he paused long enough to allow the full weight of that to wash across bondarev this will be announced within the week the politburo finds this alien ship a matter of some concern many of the marshals of the soviet union do not believe in aliens then they think that this is a cia trick grushin said it cannot be i believe that so does chairman petrovslciy and comrade trusov grushin shrugged you will understand that i do not often see the chairman of the kgb however i am informed that the vote of the defense council was unanimous that a civilian scientist should command the preparations for receiving the aliens you comrade so i was told i confess i am not especially qualified who is i am trained as a diplomat yet what training is there to meet with aliens from another star but we must do what we must do then you have been assigned as my deputy that would be common enough practice to have a kgb officer as chief of staff to a project of this importance certainly the kgb would insist on having its agents high within the control organization no another will do that grushin said my orders are to proceed to kosmograd ah you are a qualified astronaut no but i have been a pilot grushins smile was thin comrade academician i have been ordered by your fatherinlaw to trust you to tell you everything i can this is unusual stranger yet comrade trusov himself instructed me to do the same strange indeed so the politburo did take this alien craft seriously very seriously and general nikolai narovchatov had said you will trust the man sent by kgb as much as you trust any man from kgb what that could mean was not obvious so bondarev said what is there that i must know the military grushin said not all will cooperate and not all will be under your command you will need great skills at baikonur to learn which marshals trust you and which do not i need not tell you that this will not be easy no it was safe enough to say that much not more it is also vital that the americans do not learn the extent of our mobilization i see i see a great deal some of the marshals are out of control they mobilize their forces regardless of the wishes of the kremlin the americans can never be allowed to know this what else must i know the crew aboard kosmograd grushin said who is there now and whom we shall invite invite americans they have already requested that we allow their people aboard kosmograd when the alien ship arrives the politburo wishes your advice within three days he paused i think though that they will invite the americans no matter what you say ah and if the americans wish this other nations will also he shrugged i do not know how many kosmograd can accommodate nor i but i will tell you when i arrive there as i will advise you of the personnel aboard of course you will also receive reports from commander rogachev a good man rogachev bondarev said grushins smile was crafty like a peasants although there was little of the peasant about the kgb man certainly he has a legend about him but he is not everywhere regarded as you regard him why he is a troublemaker when he feels his mission is in danger a fanatic about carrying out orders make no mistake technically he is the best commander we have for kosmograd but you doubtdoubt what surely not his loyalty not his loyalty to the soviet union ah there had been an edge to grushins voice rogachev had not always shown proper deference to the party in what way is he a troublemaker grushin shrugged minor ways an example he has aboard kosmograd his old sergeant the maintenance crew chief of his helicopter during the ethiopian conflict this man lost both legs in the war when it came time for this sergeant to be rotated back to earth rogachev found excuses to keep him he said that no better man was available that it was vital to kosmograd that this man remain was he right grushin shrugged again that is something i will know when i arrive there understand comrade academician i am to be only a deputy commander of kosmograd when i board thtsikova will be first deputy but i will report directly to you if there is need you may remove rogachev from command bondarev nodded comprehendingly inside he was frightened i command this space station but there are many technical matters i will not know which are important and which are not i require advicebut whose advice can i trust he smiled thinly that would be the dilemma faced by chairman petrovskiy and first secretary narovchatov it is why i have been given this task it will be a great opportunity though at last pavel bondarev thought at last i can tell them where to aim the space telescope and be able to see the pictures instantly it was a bright clear spring day with brilliant sunshine the kind of day that made it worthwhile living through bellinghams rainy seasons the snowcrowned peaks of mount baker and the twin sisters stood magnificently above the foothills to the east the view was impressive even to aсative it was enough to have angelenos gawking they stood near the old bellingham city hail a red brick castle complete with towers and chuckanut granite and alternately looked out across the bay to the san juan islands then back to the mountains when kevin shakes saw a uniform coming toward them he wondered if something was wrong his eyes flicked toward the truckhad he parked in the wrong place a city kids reaction in a small town like bellingham you could park nearly anywhere you liked the uniform was brown shortsleeved decorated with badges and a gun belt the man wearing it was three or four years older than kevins eighteen he was grinning and taking off his hat showing fine blond hair in a ragged cut hello miranda he called is this the whole clan all but dad and mom miranda was smiling too leigh meet kevin and carl and owen we were just doing some shopping carl and owenthirteen and eleven respectively with identical straight brown hair but a foots difference in height between themwere looking mistrustfully at the uniformed man who seemed mainly interested in miranda he said looks like you bought out the store kevin said well maybe miranda told you we dont own the ranch all by ourselves there are three other families and they each own a fifth and theyre all coming up for a vacation wont that be crowded kevin shrugged miranda lost a little of the smile yeah weve never done this before the idea was to take turns one week out of five a vacation spot you know but it never seems to work out that way weve lucked out a lot this time well maybe itll work out the other families arent as big as we are but i dont know them very well miranda and the cop drifted away and kevin let them have their privacy later when they were in the truck he asked who is he how did you meet him leigh young he was at the club and we played some tennis hes not very good but he could be you like him some i think dad would approve of your dating a policeman useful miranda smiled it doesnt hurt that hes got good legs either kevin looked back to be sure his younger brothers were settled inside the truck with the mounds of groceries before he started the truck sure going to be crowded yeah rafidy what do you think about all this is dad right she shrugged i didnt used to think so all our friends laugh at george old supersurvivor i think dad used to laugh at him too you never know with dad kevin said miranda was only a year older than kevin and theyd become good friends as well as brother and sister they both knew about their fathers half smiles he also kept their home computers busy analyzing the cost of everything they did william adolphus shakes hadnt wasted a nickel in years gee kevin there really is an alien spaceship yeah and mrs wilson says its been hiding for a long time claims she was out at some lab whenwhen something happened but nobody knew it was the aliens then why would they hide out that long i dont know she opened the glove compartment at least its pretty here miranda pushed a tape into the player and the stereo crashed out with the sounds of a new group glad we have the tapes she shouted yeah there sure wasnt anything on radio up here william shakes and max rohrs walked back toward the house across the concrete apron rohrs had poured last week it felt dry and solid beneath their feet rohrs was a tall broadshouldered muscular man william shakes felt like a dwarf beside him though there wasnt that much difference rohrs said looks like were finished if it gives you any trouble you know my number yeah thanks i guess ill be seeing you i hope so youre good for business rohrs said the way youve been planting pipe i wonder if youre planning to open up a hotel when shakes didnt react he said just kidding well im not laughing its going to feel like a hotel weve got three more families coming up i expect weve finally got enough septic tanks to keep everyone happy and i know weve got enough beds thats still a lot of elbows to be taking up your elbow room shakes nodded a secretive smile lived just underneath his blank expression rohrs had built the septic tank last april hed been told that the second septic tank on the other side of the house was too old too small it was neither rohrs had just finished pouring this concrete apron but he had no way of knowing that there was a second concrete apron under it covered with rock and dirt and under that a roomy bomb shelter that nobody knew about william shakes smile showed in max rohrs rearview mirror as rohrs drove away jack and harriet mccauley had invited them into the enclave six years ago the shakes had known pretty well what they were getting into jack and harriet and several others were survivalists perpetually prepared for the end of civilization they collected news clippings on soviet encroachments and economic failures and the national collapse of law and church and patriotism they were bores on the subject why had they picked on bill and gwen shakes was it only because they lived in the neighborhood or because they could afford the expense or because they were good listeners and never called the mccauleys fools in fact neither bill nor gwen thought that any man was a fool to prepare for disaster but disasters couldnt be predicted the enclave was preparing for something far too specific reality would fool them when it came so the shakes had not jumped at the chance they had talked around the subject until bill realized what the enclave group had in mind they joined they paid their dues a moderately hefty fee they bought and maintained equipment as they were told to guns and spare food were good to have around anyway they stored the pamphlets and books and even read some of them and taught the kids firearms safety at the thursday meetings they argued strongly for buying a place of refuge in some nearwilderness area preferably near some small agricultural village ultimately they found such a place and when the rest of the enclave agreed the shakes had paid percent of the costs bill enjoyed such games it wasnt as if he were cheating anyone the enclave was getting exactly what it had paid for but bill and gwen shakes now owned a vacation site for a fifth of what it would normally have cost them in dollars and centsand bill shakes always thought in dollars and centsit was more like percent the place wasnt just being repaired it was being turned into a refuge and that cost in time and effort and money but bill and gwen both liked working with their hands and so did the boys when they had the leisure they would drive the truck up to bellinghammiranda and kevin were old enough to spell bill at the wheeland make order out of chaos and play at turning the huge roomy old house into a fortress it backed onto a woods with enough grounds for a garden there was work to do but also plenty of time out for goofing off and sailing their twentyfive footer in the san juan islands some of the greatest sailing water in the world by all odds the end of civilization would never come or would come in some form the enclave could never predict meanwhile the shakes used the place more often than the rest of the enclave families put together but this vacation hadnt been planned when bill got home two evenings ago gwen and the kids could talk about nothing but the approaching alien spacecraft the eleven oclock news featured fanciful sketches of what an interstellar craft might look like reminding bill of equally fanciful cartoons of the late forties varying designs for a nuclearpowered airplane that one had certainly come to nothing but this when the telephone woke him at one in the morning he had felt no surprise whatever gwen had said nothing only turned on her side to listen while george tateevans ordered the shakes family to bellingham i dont take orders worth a damn bill thought but he didnt say it he was already thinking muzzily of how his boss would react to bills taking a sudden week or two off because george was right and this was what the enclave was for it was still a game but they were playing for points now bill wasnt sure how the kids were taking it miranda and kevin were into the social scene carl and owen were having trouble adjusting to a new school they should never have been shifted this close to the end of the school year but they all did their stints working in the vegetable garden and shopping for masses of groceries bill tried not to resent the expense the disruption he couldnt take this star wars stuff as seriously as the kids or george and vicki for that matter neither did gwen although she wasnt so sure vicki is really worried gwen had said think of it as a fire drill hed answered get the bugs out of the system if something real ever happens well know how to do it right at that level it made sense what max rohrs told his wife that night was i think i make shakes nervous they were in bed and evelyn was reading it wasnt a book that took concentration she said you said he was little yeah max rohrs was a tall broadshouldered muscular man blond and hairy he liked the occasional fight and some men could see that bill doesnt quite reach my shoulder his wifes just his height and a little wider and his sons tower over him even so hes hiding something bodies she wasnt all that interested she was just being polite max recognizing this laughed no not bodiesbut theres too many pipes too much plumbing they keep adding to the septic tanks and it doesnt look like theyd have to i think theyre survivalists that house he rolled over onto his elbowits twice as big as it looks any angle you see it it looks lshaped but its an x count on it theyve got guns and food stores and a bomb shelter too i bet its under that tennis court i poured them in some of the big cities there are bookstores just for survivalists he frowned theyve sure been frantic the past week or so i heard from linda today evelyn said linda and why are you changing the subject gillespie shes back in washington the president sent ed and wes dawson to houston theyll train together wes dawson finally gets to space max felt a twinge of envy thatll be nice lindas at flintridge her kid sister you remember jenny had something to do with discovering the alien ship oh hey thats what set shakes off sure those guys are survivalists he knew his wife was smarter than he was and by a lot it didnt bother him what was amazing was that she was so obviously in love with him and had been since the night they met in washington hed been a sailor on liberty with no place to go and somebody suggested a social club in a church up near the national cathedral thered been girls there lots of them and all pretty snooty all except evelyn and her friends linda and carlotta they were college girls but they werent ashamed to be seen with a petty officer maybe it would have been better if she had been snooty max thought but not for me three weeks after they met evelyn was pregnant thered never been any discussion of an abortion they were married in the church theyd met in with a wedding reception at flintridge it was a nice wedding with a lot of evelyns family and lindas and carlottas families too important people who talked about maxs future and jobs he could get it looked like hed lucked into a great future and when he got out of the navy he had to come back to bellingham to look after his mother evelyns father helped a little enough so that max could open his own boiler shop but there was never enough business that was almost twenty years ago he glanced over at his wife she was reading again her fancy nightgown looked a little ratty jeer i gave her that four years ago where does the time go the kids were raising some moderate hell on the other side of the wall not enough to bother them evelyn adjusted her position the bed sagged on his side sometimes that would roll her toward him in the night before she had quite made up her mind and that was nice but it made reading difficult she set the book aside and turned off her bed lamp a lot of people say this is survivalist country she said but nobody we know talks about it yeah hey im telling you but thats as far as it goes they wouldnt give me any more business if they knew i was shooting my mouth off all right dear the shipyards been phased out for years and theres not much work there for steamfitters the shakes pay on time but evelyn was asleep great expectations tis expectation makes a blessing dear heaven were not heaven if we knew what it were sir john suckling against friction countdown h minus two weeks the bedroom was more than neat it was spotless jack clybournes entire apartment was that wayexcept for the second bedroom which he used as a den that one wasnt precisely messy but he did permit books to remain unshelved for days at a time the first time jenny had visited jack in his apartment shed remarked on its nearness hed laughed yeah we get that way in the service we have to travel a lot and stay in hotels and we never know when the presidents schedule will change so we stay packed i remember once the maid saw all my stuff packed and the suitcases in the middle of the room and the manager checked us out and rented the room to someone else despite the neatness his bedroom wasnt sterile there were photographs of his mother and sister and of the president pictures of the kremlin and the great wall of china and other places hed been book club selections filled a tidy shelf along one wall the shelves were full now so when new selections came in old ones went to the used book stores the residue gave some clues to clybournes reading habits voracious partial to history but interested in spy thrillers jenny got up carefully she didnt think shed awakened jack although it was hard to tell he slept lightly and when he woke he didnt even open his eyes she teased him about it once and he laughed and it wasnt until later that she realized that kind of sleeping habit might be an advantage in his job the secret service did other things besides protect the president she retrieved her uniform from the closet the first time shed come there her clothes ended on the floor but jacks apartment invited neatness she took her class as into the bathroom the bed was empty when she came out she could hear the shower in the other bathroom hes certainly the most considerate lover ive ever had she didnt much care for the word lover but nothing else fit he wasnt a fiancй thered been no talk at all about marriage no lieutenants should marry but male captains could and by the time they became majors most male officers were married but marriage would be the end to a woman officers career he was certainly something more than a boyfriend they didnt live together partly because both the army and the secret service tended to be a little prudish even if they pretended not to be and even more because jenny wasnt ready for all the explanations aunt rhonda would demand if she moved out of flintridge even so she spent a lot of time at jacks apartment they both traveled a lot and worked odd hours but it was definitely understood that when they were both in washington and had free time theyd spend it together while on trips shed twice dated other men but it wasnt the same something was missing magic she thought and didnt care to put another name to it that it existed was enough and it was wonderful ready for dinner his tie was perfectly knotted but hed left his jacket off sure want me to cook you dont have to jack i like to cook i dont get a chance very often all right well have to shop though theres nothing here sure ill get started and you can go get she stopped because he was shaking his head lets go together we can figure out what we want on the way sure she waited while he put on his jacket as he always did before going out he took his revolver out of the holster concealed inside his trousers and looked into the barrel then checked the loads shed never seen jack angry or threaten anyone but jenny never worried when she went out with him the post might be full of stories about washington street crime but no one ever bothered jack clybourne jenny wondered if it could be telepathy he lived in the newly rebuilt area off new jersey avenue where there were lots of apartments it was on the other side of the white house from flintridge she giggled drive me home he said its on my way he said it worked didnt it she took his hand yes and im glad me too they went toward constitution avenue and the federal triangle until they reached the wide park like mall between independence and constitution avenues when they were in the middle of the mall he stopped jenny what in hell is going on with what this alien shiplook being around the president i hear a lot of things i never talk about them not even with you except its your job toothe presidents scared jenny if you dont know that youd better scared jackoh hell darling lets walk she led him along the path toward the great granite shape of the national museum he wouldnt talk about this in his apartment out here we ought to be safe if we keep our voices down and talk directly to each other thats silly no ones listening to us still i shouldnt talk to him about this but he knows already jack what do you mean scared ive briefed him a dozen times and he doesnt act scared with me not with you not with the admiral jack said but with mrs coffey hes worried because they dont answer well we all wonder its no wonder hes scared and i think he thinks the russians are too yeah jenny said of course we can only guess what they really think its true though isnt it every nut with a transmitter has tried to send them messages and they dont answer not just every nut jenny said the national security agency with our biggest transmitters the jet propulsion laboratorys deep space net with the big goldstone antenna the russians are doing the same thing and nothing jack shivered slightly despite the warm june night heck maybe im scared too she hesitated then laughed what just thinking if theres anybody with a higher clearance than a man wholl put his butt between the president and a bullet i dont know what it is there was no one around but she lowered her voice anyway the admirals getting worried too i guess the soviets decided to mobilize jenny chuckled no thats like an australians first reaction to anything is to go on strike whaat or like the watergate trials the lawyers asked one of them who ordered the coverup and he said actually nobody ever suggested there would not be a coverup unless somebody actually says stop the soviets will mobilize get enough of those weapons and somebodys likely to use them yes but things look reasonably stable over there their theoreticians are saying that any race advanced enough to have star travel would have to be economically evolved meaning the aliens will all be good communists i wouldnt think that follows neither do i we know for a fact it hasnt helped the russians communicate with the aliens that ship isnt talking to anyone maybe its a robot ship she shrugged we dont even have any good theories and the admiral wants some who has he asked who havent we asked jenny laughed again anybody we didnt ask has tried to tell us anyway out at the air force academy weve got the damnedest collection of anthropologists historians political scientists and other denizens of academia you ever saw theres even a psychic but next week we go even further the admirals rounded up a collection of sciencefiction writers jack didnt laugh actually that might not be such a bad idea thats what i thought anyway hes done it most of them are at the air academy but hes taking a smaller group into cheyenne mountain guess what im supposed to go out next week and help get them settled in i dont know how long ill be oh okay but ill miss you she squeezed his hand then glanced around it was dark and nobody was going to see her behaving in an undignified manner while in uniform and if they did the hell with them she stood on tiptoe and kissed him he was startled at first then he held her close and they kissed again we still havent got dinner she said finally no what do you want something we can cook fast he laughed yeah there are better things to do than eat the church has always considered the possibility of intelligence other than human cardinal manelli said angels are one obvious example ah and of course c s lewis played with aliens the episcopalian bishop added certainly the christian churches are interested in this alien ship but i cant agree that the existence of the aliens refutes christian revelation jeri wilson looked thoughtful shed turned on the tv something she almost never did on sunday afternoons and this program had been on the roman catholic cardinal the episcopal bishop of california two protestant ministers whose faces she recognized and a history professor from the university of california professor boyd seemed to be acting as moderator and also as a gadfly intent on irritating the others lewis points out that the existence of intelligent aliens impacts christianity only if we assume they are in need of redemption that redemption must come in the same manner as it was delivered to humanity and that it has been denied them the episcopal bishop continued i doubt we know any of that just yet what if theyve never heard of christianity professor boyd asked if they have no legends of gods no notion of sin no thought of redemption it wouldnt change the facts of our revelation cardinal manelli said the resurrection took place in our history and no alien ship will change that well know soon enough why speculate if you want to ask what if then what if they have both the old and new testaments or documents recognizably related to them that would be interesting jeri thought i predict that what well find will be ambiguous one of the ministers said god doesnt seem to speak unequivocally not to you cardinal manelli said the others laughed but jeri thought some of the laughter was strained the doorbell rang she went to answer it a little unhappy at missing the program which was interesting melissa raced down the hall and got to the door first the man at the door had red hair and beard fading to white his gut spilled out over the top of his blue jeans hed never be able to button his denim jacket melissa stepped back involuntarily for a moment then she smiled hi harry jeri didnt encourage melissa to call adults by their first names but harry was an exception how could you call him mr reddington hello jeri said what brings you here she stepped back to let him in and led him toward the kitchen beer thanks yes harry said he took the can eagerly actually i was just over to see ken dutton and thought id stop by melissa had gone back to her room horse crap harry jeri said he shrugged okay i have ulterior motives look theyre throwing me out of my apartment great god harry you dont expect me to put you up he looked slightly hurt you dont have to be so vigorous about the way you say that then he grinned naw i just thought well maybe you could put in a word with the enclave people i could go up to washington state any time harry they dont want you that hurt him she could see it even so it had to be said harry had done odd jobs for the tateevanses as well as for the wilsons and although hed never been invited to join the enclave he knew about it because david had talked about it with him harry shrugged they dont want dutton either but they do want you possibly im not so sure i want them harry looked puzzled ive been thinking of going east to join david not yet he said but it wasnt no melissa came in to get a coke from the refrigerator is that your motorcycle out there she asked sure harry said will you take me for a ride melissa you shouldnt bother sure harry said jeri frowned she wasnt worried about melissas going with harry but is it safe harry grinned safe as houses he patted his ample gut if we fall off ill see she lands on me he just might do that jeri thought look harry not too fast speed limit and no freeway harry said melissa was dancing around ill get my jacket she said she dashed out of the kitchen oh all right jeri said harry do be careful an hour later melissa came in the front door have a good time jeri asked yeah until his motorcycle blew up blew up well thats what he said it just died we were a long way off how did you get home harry asked if you let me take the bus by myself and when i said sure he waited at the bus stop with me melissa giggled he had to borrow bus fare from me so he could get home too linda gillespie drained her margarita and set the empty glass down too hard when she spoke her voice was too loud for the dimly lit mayflower cocktail lounge dammit it just isnt fair carlotta dawson shrugged lots of things arent at least you had fair warning you knew you were marrying an astronaut i thought id married a nice lawyer they could let us go to houston with them speak for yourself carlotta said ive got work to do someone has to think about his career and its for sure wes wont now that hes got a chance to go to space if youre looking for something to do come help me with the constituent mail yeah sure i mean it carlotta said sure it gives you something to distract you but seriously i need the help its hard to find intelligent people who know california and live in washington i dont blame them so why dont you go home we were going to have the house painted anyway and when the president ordered ed to washington we decided to have an extra room put on the attic the house is a madhouse crawling with contractors you could go see joel no i cant that expensive boarding school doesnt like having mommy drop in interferes with their routine of course if ed wants to come carlotta smiled astronauts are always welcome you knew that when you married him yes and i still love him too but it gets damned lonesome sometimes linda signaled the waitress another round please not me carlotta said twos more than enough linda be reasonable ed and wes dont have any time at all thats straight enough theyre living on the base i could stay in a hotel be pretty expensive and he still wouldnt have any time for you linda nodded i know but its still not fair carlotta chuckled the aliens are coming our husbands are intimately involved in making contact with themand were sitting here grousing because were not seeing them in washington instead of being ignored by them in houston you dont like it either no i dont congress recesses about the time wes actually goes into orbit and ill like that even lessbut theres nothing i can do about it she stood and fumbled in her purse until she found a fivedollar bill she put the money on the table i mean it linda i could use some help call me at the office all right i like your enthusiasm well if you do i guarantee ill put you to work bye linda watched carlotta leave and turned back to her drink i probably should go help carlotta its something to do five dollars for your thoughts uh she looked up at the man standing where carlotta had been roger yep were you thinking about me he sat down without waiting to be asked no he still looks pretty good he must bewhat fifty thats about right goodlooking man for fifty goodlooking for forty for that matter after five years why should i he chuckled because youre alone in my town you ought to have been thinking about me for weeks thats silly i did think about you damn you how do you know im not waiting for my husband because hes in houston sheep dogging the honorable wesley dawson you were with carlotta dawson until a minute ago he flashed a grin i passed up a chance to interview her waiting for you to be alone and if id left with her id have got my interview of course or at least had a chance to talk with the wife of the us ambassador to outer space now i have to settle for the chauffeurs wife hows ed taking it not well ye never seen him so twitchy he projects that right stuff image cool and collected like all the astronauts clints on tv linda said and usually he really is like that now he doesnt know how to feel well look at it that alien ship is the biggest thing since the invention of the lung eds sisterinlaw discovers it even and a congressman steals his mission you ought to be glad its wes if it wasnt him it still wouldnt be ed roger said the sovs dont want edmund gillespie an american military officer a generalhe outranks rogachev for gods sake yeah he knows that really linda said but it doesnt help that he knows it roger what are you doing here trying to seduce you roger he shrugged its true enough i had a lead on a story brought her here for a drink spotted you and got rid of ms henrietta crisp of the business and professional womens alliance surprised hell out of her it did well you might as well go find her again all right he didnt move damn you roger brooks i should get

finds me and i feel like a schoolgirl on her first heavy date how does he do this to me i guess ive missed you too remember that movie same time next year its like that with us except we dont see each

exaggerated gesture dunno there must be some reason youre too busy chasing stories thats all you see in me a news source come on now will you promise you wont try to get information from me of course not see good i dont like it when you lie to me so what do we do now he glanced at his watch a bit early for dinner what say we take a drive through the virginia countryside i know a nice restaurant in fairfax and then up to you roger stood and came around to hold her chair ive got to be going linda said she started to push back her chair from rogers kitchen table but roger stood behind her and blocked her way he put his hands under the bathrobe she felt her nipples erect in the warmth of his palms whats the hurry stop thatno dont stop that roger what will i tell aunt rhonda party at the thai embassy got late some senator from the appropriations committee insisted on quizzing you about the space program but there really is a big party there so big that you could have been there and been lost in the crowd he bent around her took her nipple in his mouth she thought she was thoroughly satiated but his tongue reawakened sensations all through her body roger had always been a tigertheyd made love three times that afternoon after jpl all those years ago are you serious he straightened possibly not linda giggled suddenly certainly not then roger said what is it i never did get nat reynoldss autograph natoh yeah damn damn damn that ship was there all the time we were looking at saturn the twisted fring havent you ever seen three earthworms in love youve a wicked sense of humor darth vader remember the drive flame from that thing must have roiled the whole ring system it settled down before voyager two got there linda stroked his hand then put it back on her breast he stood very close to her and even if youd known if youd said anything theyd have put you away for a nice rest heh yes i might have gone digging found some astronomical photographs something i didnt know enough science then ive done some studying since she grinned and looked up at him without raising her head i hadnt noticed actually its not funny nothing you could learn nothing will ever bring back that afternoon i know that why do i go on looking it was a wonderful day roger all of it all those scientists and the writersyouve been studying science are you going to write science fiction hadnt intended to maybe i should most of the sf writers have disappeared he wet one finger and traced a complex pattern on her breast what well not all of them the ones who make up their own science are being interviewed all over the place the ones who stick to real science are getting hard to find know anything about it not really he straightened and stepped away from her my god you do know something what roger i said bat shit i can tell you know something linda what is it well its not important jenny said something about going to meet the scifi people in colorado springs it wasnt a secret colorado springs norad or the air academy launch what we anticipate seldom occurs what we least expected generally happens benjamin disraeli henrietta temple countdown h minus one week i dont know aunt rhonda would knowshed have jenny leave her phone number in colorado springs speaking of aunt rhonda roger i really do have to leave now let me get up well all right if you insist ill call you tomorrow say no tell him no fine the house perched on stilts above a crag in the los angeles hills for years the engineers had worried that it would slide down in a heavy rainstorm but it never did wes dawson poked about the storage area built by enclosing the stilts in a normal house it would have been called a basement its getting late carlotta called down the stairs i know he opened an old trunk junk clutter memories leapt up at him wait a minute i used to use this a lot the valentine card shed handed him one january morning after a fight so thats where that went the huge mug that would hold two full bottles of beer but the chipped rim kept gashing his lip a tshirt faded almost to gray but he recognized the print on the chest an american flag with a whirlpool galaxy in the upper left corner a hundred billion stars no time he closed the lid on memories and went up the stairs the house looked half empty with anything valuable or breakable packed away arent you packed she asked i mean what could you take he grinned remember my old baseball cap good god whatever did you luck it won my first campaign i wore it to jpl for the saturn encounter remember she turned away and he followed her im sorry you cant come with me me too she still didnt face him youve got to be used to it im not home a lot of the time sure but youre in washington maybe you dont get home until im in bed but i know youll be there or i have to come here and youre still there but were jesus wes i dont know but it feels wrong she opened the thermos pitcher and poured coffee i talked to linda and she feels it too when eds not on the earth she can tell is that silly telepathy that could be interesting and if i say that shell blow up wes tried to hide his eagerness to be gone he couldnt before the aliens came carlotta really was the most important thing in his life more important than congress or anything else but not now not with the galactic congress coming in just a few days and hed be there to meet them she had him dead to rights youll be nowhere on the face of the earth and you wont be thinking about me the doorbell rang before he had to speak thank god wes thought whoever that is i love you it was harry reddington la harry he said there was no point in asking why harry was there hed find out whether he asked or not come in but i warn you forefinger prodding the zipper on the linemans vest you had to make things clear to harry ye got to go right now and carlotta has to drive me sure congressman harry used his cane to help him up the steps hi carlotta hello carlottas greeting wasnt enthusiastic it had happened several years before wes dawson twoterm congressman stuck on the transportation safety subcommittee interviewing bikers hed been young enough and new enough then to go out looking for information rather than summoning the interested parties to washington to testify to a committee and in a san bernardino bar wes dawson had let a hells angel get his goat and took a swing at the bloated barbarian and was about to get his head stomped in which would have been bad and in the newspapers which would have been worse when hairy red the minstrel made a joke of the whole affair and hustled wes out of the bar and only after they were outside did harry admit that he was so scared hed pissed in his pants or said he had which made wes laugh too so i owe harry one and hes never really collected just uses that to keep us polite to him and hell i enjoy his company sometimes what brings you here now harry carlotta asked she hadnt been in that bar shed only been told if shed felt the vibes in that bar shed be more polite to harry heard youre going up to meet the etis harry said yeah everyone knows that carlotta said i wondered if you needed anybody to keep an eye on things harry said im sort of loose just now no carlotta said firmly thanks but no harry must be heavily stuck for a place to sleep not only that he was here but that he was so clean so massively sober wes looked around the house all the valuable stuff was packed and stored especially all the breakables but there were electronics and keepsakes and things he hadnt had time to store away and hed really hate to lose them there hadnt been time to plan anything and the breakable stuff was stored and wes was just feeling so damned good he asked harry where are you living just now carlotta eyed him suspiciously here and there want to stay here wes asked just for a few weeks carlottas going to washington and then visiting her family in kansas so the place is empty except for the gardener once a week wouldnt hurt at all if somebody kept an eye on it carlotta looked disgusted harry harry grinned he raised his right hand the way he would in a courtroom no visitors no friends no parties i swear the kind of people i know i wouldnt even tell them where im staying thats straight then wes said your word of honor on record sure harry said good congressman dawson said you know harry that works pretty good i was a little worried going offjesus except for the apollo crews about as far as anybody ever went from his family i was a little worried about leaving carlotta it feels better with you to look after things that cant hurt wes thought with harry you had to be careful what you said because he took things too seriously sometimes but he was pretty smart when he was sober and dammit he didnt lie hed jump off a cliff before hed steal from friends keys harry said and the alarm right it was getting complicated wes looked at harry and the eager expression and knew it was already too late might as well do it right keys alarm system ill write you a letter and theres a drawer in here where we keep a thousand bucks in small bills for emergencies only well leave it for you kind of tricky to find carlotta looked at him again and wes grinned she didnt know harry that well hed never touch that money if they told him about it if he found it rooting around as he probably would he might think of some reason why he ought to do something with it to help the dawsons harry had a real knack for rationalization but he didnt violate direct orders youll need a letter wes said and maybe a phone number for your friend to call you i wont give anybody yours harry said thats all right carlotta said we change this top number here every month or two she indicated one of the three telephones just dont give anyone the other number wes typed up a letter to the police while carlotta explained the alarm system she wasnt happy about it maybe im not happy wes thought but what the hell else could i do throw harry out fat chance and damn he can be useful and anyway anyway it was time to go wes looked at the tv with its continuous stream of garble about etis and speculation about what was coming and grinned ill know before they do damn straight he got his suitcases and headed for the downstairs garage and hed forgotten about hairy red before he got to his car five the unemotional voice spoke in his headset my god ive made it four wes dawson tried to relax but that was impossible the count went on three two one ignition first motion liftofe we have liftoff we do indeed goddam elephant sitting on my chest he was vaguely aware that his companions in the shuttle were cheering he tried to remember every moment of the experience but it was no use things happened too fast separations the shuttle roar changed dramatically as the two solid boosters fell free to splash into the atlantic ocean for recovery they were just worth recovering according to figures dawson had seen although hed also seen analyses demonstrating that it would be cheaper to make new ones each timethat recovery of the boosters was mostly for public relations value to demonstrate that nasa was thrifty his feeling of great weight continued as the shuttle main engines continued to burn hed been told they developed over a hundred horsepower per pound wes dawson tried to imagine that but the image that came to mind was silly he noticed the roar fading and then the weight easing from his body silence and falling black sky and the bluewhite arc of planet earth and wes dawson had reached space at last ed gillespie went out first wes waited impatiently while gillespie helped the soviet crewmen rig tether lines between the shuttle and the soviet kosmograd space station the shuttle was far too large to dock with the soviet station at least that was the official reason theyd been given finally the work was done and it was dawsons turn in the airlock captain john greeley wess escort and aide waited behind him to go last ed gillespie would be waiting outside ed must hate this a lot greeley and go aboard kosmograd ed takes the shuttle home enough of that wes ran through the pressuresuit checklist once more the small computerdriven display at his chest showed all green and wes touched the airlock cycle button he heard a faint whine he moved very cautiously there was nothing out there but vacuum high school physics classes and the science fiction hed read in his teens spoke their lessons in his memory space is unforgiving even to a powerful and influential congressman he listened to the dwindling hiss as the airlock emptied none of it was coming from his million dollars worth of pressure suit hed done it right the hiss and whine faded to nothing then the airlock display blinked green over red in the back of his throat was nausea waiting to pounce his semicircular canals danced to strange rhythms high school physics be damned his body knew he was falling skydiving wasnt like this skydiving you had the wind if you waited a few seconds the wind stopped your acceleration and it was as if you were being buoyed up here there was only the oxygen breeze in your face the outer door opened and the universe hit him in the face the soviet station was a winged hammer that tumbled as it flew at one end of the long long corridor that formed the handle three cylinders born as fuel tanks nestled side by side the living quarters must have been expanded since the structure was built there were few windows and all were tiny not much of a view from in there best do my sightseeing while im outside solarelectric panels splayed out around the other end of the corridor dawson guessed there was a nuclear plant too well isolated from the crew quarters why else would the joining corridor be so long though it would help the sovs maintain spin gravity at the center of rotation opposite a fourth tank that served as a freefall laboratory was the main airlock a line ran from the airlock to the hovering shuttlecraft and behind it all a great blue ball was slowly traversing a deep black sky orbit freefall hed done it but what a strange path hed traveled there was a boy who had wanted to be an astronaut a young man had watched that hope dwindle as he matured men had landed on the moon in july of after eight years of effort in a nasa official had stated that the united states could not reach the moon again ten years from now no mailer what the effort the space program had been nearly dismantled the united states had reached the moon and come back and stopped the soviets beaten in the moon race dropped out but when the united states rested the soviet space program began anew this time systematically developing capabilities each new exploit a bit more difficult than the last none of the spectaculars of the early days but plenty of solid achievement an angry man had grown into politics partly through wes dawsons efforts the us space program began again led by the shuttle and continuing toward industries in space but too slowly the cold war began again with all its implications editorials in us papers and on television why challenge the soviets in space nothing was there or alternatively the soviets are so strong that they cannot be challenged or why begin a race no one can win a drumfire of editorials threatening to drown the american space effort then had come a speck in the night sky and a powerful determined politician in the best of health now looked across thirty meters of line at a soviet space station to which he had come as visiting dignitary it was a way into space but hed have had to be crazy to plan it that way do you feel all right congressman the soviet crewman waited outside clinging to a handhold on the airlock door he floated easily his whole posture a statement for soviets this is easy we have the experience to make it easy he couldnt see the expression behind the darkened glass of ed gillespies helmet gillespie waited im fine fine wes stayed uncertainly in the airlock space was wonderful but there was so much of it he felt bouncy happy he sounded that way too good the cosmonaut pushed into dawsons glove a device vaguely resembling pliers the business end was already closed around the line if you will move out of the airlock wes grasped the line grip and moved out of the airlock door ed gillespie came up beside him gillespie said nothing but wes was grateful someone familiar in this strange and wonderful place the airlock cycled again and greeley emerged the cosmonaut handed him a line gripper remember there is no way to get lost you need only jump when you near the airlock squeeze the handle and friction will slow you the russians accent was noticeable even through the electronics of the suit radios fine theyd showed him most of it in briefings but it wasnt the same youre on your own then ed gillespie said see you in houston he clapped wes on the shoulder and climbed into the airlock right my regards to linda he spoke automatically he was watching the soviet cosmonaut dawson took a deep breath the russian jumped dawson waited until the soviet was across before he moved it took nerve for a man who was already falling a good jump maybe a bit too hard airlock coming up fast he wasnt slowing at all dawson braked too soon left himself short of the airlock greeley thumped into him from behind greeley was massive an air force captain who had earned his letter in football as a halfback his cheerful voicewas a bit tinny in wess earphones no sweat sir if youll just ease up on the clamps wes relaxed his grip releasing the line and let greeley guide him into the airlock several people waited beyond the airlock one was a woman in her forties a legless man floated toward wes and deftly helped him to remove his helmet no one spoke hi wes said hello the woman spoke grudgingly the airlock opened and the soviet cosmonaut entered the legless man assisted him in opening his helmet the cosmonaut grinned welcome to kosmograd i am rogachev ah thank you wes said i hadnt expected the commander himself to assist me i enjoy going outside rogachev said i have all too few opportunities the others seemed friendlier now allow me to introduce you but quickly rogachev said when we have removed these suits you can be more properly welcomed this is first deputy commander aliana aleksandmvna thtsikova deputy commander drnitri parfenovich gru shin station engineer ustinov these three were lined up tutsikova closest to wes they all looked typically russian to dawsons untrained eye there were three more in the crowded corridor including the legless man but rogachev made no move to introduce them it would be difficult to shake hands in zero gravity and wes didnt try the airlock door opened again to admit captain greeley the legless cosmonaut went to help remove his helmet rogachev was already leading the way down the corridor and wes had no choice but to follow in here rogachev said mitya will aid you with your suit he will then show you where we will await you his tone changed nikolai i come the legless man said and launched himself after rogachev the compartment vies was led into was small but larger than he had expected it had some gravity hardly enough to notice but sufficient that objects settled to one deck and wes could lie on that deck to allow his suit to be removed mitya did not look like the others he was small almost tiny and his face was very oriental almost pure tatar he talked constantly as he assisted dawson in getting out of the pressure suit vies couldnt understand a word although mitya seemed to understand english when they had the pressure suit off mitya produced a pair of dark blue coveralls on the left breast was the name dawsn in both roman and cyrillic letters there was also a patch with the stylized hammershaped symbol of kosmograd the stations image was marked with a red star and the soviet cccp thats why they said i neednt bring my own clothes they want me in their uniform vies grinned and reached inside his suit there was a small pouch there vies took out a bright us flag pin and pinned that above the kosmograd patch then he looked directly at mitya the soviet was grinning he said something incomprehensible then waited for wes to put on the coveralls sergeant ben mailey was accustomed to shepherding vips but hed never seen a group quite like this one idly he listened to the chatter behind him theyd put five passengers in a helicopter built for many more the trip from the colorado springs airfield to cheyenne mountain wasnt very long civilians were talkative anyway but they rarely tried to compete with the roar of a helicopter motor these were winning though half of what they said didnt make sense he had his share of tall this trip sergeant mailey tended to notice that five feet five wide and round he dreaded what he would look like without the army exercises they made him take youd want to roll him down a bowling alley but three of his passengers were six feet or taller and two of those were women he glanced at the passenger list that tall man playing tour guide was curtis of hollywood california it was easy enough to hear him even over the helicopter motors thats the broadmoor hotel one of the worlds top hotels and not built because of the air force academy or norad or anything else remember the old penrose machine one of the younger sons got too rough even for that crowd and they sent him out here about the turn of the century as a remittance man had nothing to do so he built the worlds best hotel in the shadow of pikes peak which was interesting mailey had never heard that story before unfortunately the guy knew more and now he was revealing too many of the secrets of cheyenne mountain for maileys comfort how the hell did he ever get inside because hed sure been there not that it mattered they were all going inside and maybe it wouldnt be so easy to get out again four of them had come in pairs but the darkhaired woman had come alone if youd put her in playboyshe was that pretty youd have had to use the centerfold she was that tall when curtis shut up she said what i meant is we ought to be the ones to greet the aliens maybe we will but sherry wes dawsons up there and hes a sciencefiction fan i mean serious he was at the first saturn flyby you were there dont you remember him congressional candidate in a baseball cap no well he was watching the screens instead of making speeches that any help i in the meantime if you were a government who would you get to tell you about aliens us id like to know who thought of it the silverhaired womans laugh was a pleasant silvery tinkle her husband wasnt in uniform but from the id hed shown mailey he could have bean although it would make him the oldest lieutenant in the navy he had a head like a bullet and a mustache like a razors edge the sheet on maileys clipboard named them robert and virginia anson santa cnn they looked too old to be part ofwhatever was going on here all mailey was sure of was that there was a direct order from the president concerning this new advisory group and mailey had never seen anything like that before they were to report directly to the national security council not even to general deighton who commanded norad and had taken up residence inside anson leaned forward in his chair and mailey noticed that the others stopped talking and turned toward him well see enough he said sure one of the others said bob we trust hell out of you but cant you tell us what were doing here ten minutes anson looked up at mailey thats about how long it will take to get inside mailey nodded yes sir another one whod been in the hole they had that distinctive way of pronouncing the word inside if youd been there you knew anyway anson said well learn as much and as quickly as anyone in the united states admiral carrell assured me of that the grins on the others were unmistakable although some of the wives didnt seem so happy about it sounds good someone said and an audience that wants to be told what to do and can do it who could ask for more virginia anson laughed in silver robert anson leaned forward again and again everyone else fell silent ive seen generals get less respect than that mailey thought what have you done with nat reynolds anson asked curtis i thought you two went everywhere together we have since his divorce curtis said but hes got a convention in kansas yeah i thought of that too but where is he safe hed be safe inside mailey thought if theres one safe place in the world this is it the motors changed pitch and the helicopter descended jenny watched the group climb out of the helicopter and hid her misgivings she got the passengers loaded into the station wagon for the short drive from the helipad to the entrance shed only been inside a few times and it was still an awesome experience the station wagon drove through doors the size of a house then on into the mountain and on and on eventually it stopped and they entered an elevator that had no difficulty holding all of them with room for the station wagon if theyd wanted it no one was talking much people didnt the first time the buildings sat on coil springs as tall as people except for the springs and the granite walls overhead and everywhere the buildings might have been standard military barracks and offices jenny gave them an hour to get settled most of them were in the briefing room in half that time she waited the full hour the inside of the conference room was set up like a movie theater with folding chairs in rows army men ushered them to seats a little warily as if they didnt quite know what to make of their guests the army troopers stood when she came in so did robert anson although jenny had the impression that it wasnt the gold leaves he stood for they waited while she went to the blackboard then one of them said i suppose youre all wondering why ive asked you here and everyone laughed which made it a lot easier i suppose you are wondering jenny said admiral carrell has assembled an intelligence group to advise the national security council you are part of it makes sense who else knows about aliens she looked at her seating chart curtis she nodded the first thing is to explain why you are here rather than at the academy with your colleagues and the anthropology professors you are the threat team the others will assume the aliens are friendly our group will examine the possibility that they will be hostile everyone looked thoughtful then a hand was raised jenny consulted her chart again yes ms atkinson do we have a choice in the assignment not now jenny said too bad i thought it valuable to have you with us sherry anson said the rest of us are paranoid you are not it seemed reasonable to have one intelligent but trusting person on this team sherry atkinson melted back into her seat im afraid things will be a bit hectic jenny said you will have a series of intensive briefings there that much to know about the aliens actually dr curtis there is very little to know about the aliens however you are to be briefed on us and ussr strategic weapons systems one of the possibilities admiral carrell intends to examine is that the aliens make alliance with the soviets against us academician pavel bondarev sat at his desk his large leather chair was swiveled toward the window with its view of the black sea the weather outside was pleasant it was pleasant inside the office as well his secretary sat on his lap slowly she unbuttoned her blouse this was far better than he had expected he had more power and prestige than he had ever imagined possible to add to his joy marina and his grandson had vacationed on the shores of the black sea and were now on an airplane to moscow it couldnt last of course soon the aliens would come and things would change he could only guess at how they would change he may have been the proper man for this task i know few who could have done it and of those two are not reliable on his desk lay thick reports from the soviet military leaders the largest was the report of the strategic rocket command bondarev had always known that the soviet union possessed thousands of intercontinental nucleartipped missiles now he knew the location and targeting of every one of them he also knew their reliability which was not high despite the full alert nearly a quarter of the missile force was not in readiness and the generals did not expect more than two thirds of those remaining to launch on the first attempt the reports contained information on which missiles could be retargeted and which could not of those some could be aimed at objects in space and some could be targeted only toward other points on the earth because their warheads could not be detonated until after reentry he had turned so that he wouldnt have to look at those reports could he not keep his mind on lorena for these few precious moments but his mind ran on he had a large force that could be used to engage the united states and a small force that could fight an enemy in outer space if that became necessary it was not possible to estimate what that force could do because they knew nothing of the onrushing alien spacecraft what defenses did it have how thick was its hull and how close would it come to earth all probably unnecessary they will not attack but if they do i have forces to engage them with some forces i should determine more precisely what i have available that would not be easy because it was no simple task to combine the targeting information with the figures on readiness and reliability the result would only be a probability it is well that i am doing this few military officers would know how to do the mathematics nor would i be able to in time except for he glanced at the table next to his desk an american ibm home computer stood there it was an excellent machine simple to use and it had come with a number of probability and statistics programs that he had adapted to this purpose you have no need of that machine at this moment lorena said firmly she took his hand and guided it to her breast he had been expecting the telephone but it startled him anyway pavel bondarev disengaged his hand from within his secretarys blouse the ringing phone was on a secure line permanently attached to a scrambler he had been told that not even the kgb could listen to calls on that line pavel didnt believe that but it was well to act as if he did he lifted the receiver academician bondarev narovchatov the voice of america announces that the americans are aboard i heard there was no jamming narovchatov chuckled so long as they do our work why should we interfere but it is a good sign they are not upset by our mobilizations i trust not bondarev said i have done much to keep such matters under control you are now satisfied with the preparations i believe so grushin reports that all is well aboard the spacecraft the strategic rocket forces are alerted the fleet is at sea but the air force remains grounded and visible to the american satellites this was not achieved without cost colonel general akhmanov proved uncooperative and has been replaced by genera tretyak the transfer of power was accomplished without incident and akhmanov has been promoted to the general inspectorate of the ministry of defense um you are becoming accustomed to military authority perhaps i should have you appointed a general that could do no harm bondarev said generals have enormous perquisites meanwhile i receive reports from both grushin and rogachev and there are no contradictions nikolai nikolayevich i believe we have done everything possible all we know to do why then do i worry bondarev grinned mirthlessly we have nothing to guide us here no history and no theory da there was a pause as if narovchatov were thinking then the general said from tomorrow on this line will be connected directly to the chairman you will use it to keep us informed certainly it would be an excuse to ask where you and the chairman will be perhaps marina and the children could visit you that has been arranged then no more remains to be said bondarev put the telephone down and stared out the window you are frightened lorena said yes anticipations space will be colonizedalthough possibly not by us if we lose our nerve there are plenty of other people on this planet the construction crews may speak chinese or russianswahili or portuguese it does not take good old american knowhow to build a city in space the laws of physics work just as well for others as they do for us robert a heinlein countdown h minus two days the meeting was called for but they were still straggling in at a quarter past some had hangovers all had stayed up too late too bad jenny thought theyll have to get used to military hours she had a strong urge to giggle suppose they didnt maybe theyd make cheyenne mountain adapt to the hours science fiction writers kept they took their places in the lecture room but they tended to sit for a moment then get up and gather in clumps most of them talked at once working with the sciencefiction people was an educational experience they had no reverence for anything or anyone except possibly for mr anson and they argued with him they just didnt call him names theyd spent the past days learning about us and soviet weapons now it was time to examine what was known about the aliens not that theres anything to know our best photos dont show details just that its damned big one of the men the one with the heavy mustache began before she could major crichton i assume that the government has been no more successful in communicating with the aliens than all the private attempts were correct weve tried every means of communication we can think of and a few no one would have thought of sherry atkinson added they all laughed remembering that the mayor of san diego had persuaded the citizens of his city to blink their lights on and off while they were in the alien ships view with no result jenny said our best prediction is that the alien ship will arrive day after tomorrow sometime day after tomorrow we cant predict it closer than that because the ship has begun random acceleration and deceleration as if it didnt want us to know the precise eta curtis said eta atkinson asked estimated time of arrival jenny said and yes weve thought of that it might be their engines arent working properly atkinson looked thoughtful or that the concepts of time and regularity dont mean much to them bat puckey curtis said if theyre space travelers they have to have clocks doesnt mean they use them someone said jenny spoke through rising voices lieutenant sherrad will review what we know the chatter stopped sherrad was a regular navy man hoping for his bad foot to heat so that he could go back to sea jenny wasnt quite sure how hed been assigned to colorado springs but she did know the admiral thought well of him his father had been a classmate the navy seemed to have even more of that sort of thing than the army he ran new blowups of films taken by the mauna kea telescopes as far back as the late ls a few showed a flickering star that must have been the alien ship although at the time no one had realized it sherrad showed each film in sequence then again he brought the lights up and waited as if teasing the audience son of a bitch what joe it dropped something sherrad nodded it does look that way it took me four hours to see that jenny thought maybe there is a good reason to have these birds here our best guess is that it came from the southern region of the centaur dropped something heavy rounded the sun and went to saturn lieutenant sherrad said decelerating all the way they knew where they were going then well dr curtis it does seem so jenny nodded approval sherrad had memorized the doctorates voices arose from one of the clumps okay they refueled at saturn why not jupiter it takes less deltav to slow down for saturn jesus but they must have been going on the last teacup of fuel for that to matter jupiter could have been around on the other side could we see it again anson asked sherrad waited until they were quiet certainly we also have the computer simulation the room darkened again black dots speckled a white field a negative of the night sky astronomers generally preferred to use negatives it was easier to see the spots that were stars the scene jumped minutely every few seconds the stars stayed where they werethe photographs had been superimposedbut one dot jumped too and grew larger these were taken from mauna kea observatory notice the point that jumps when we realized what we had we made same graphs the first showed a curve across the star background not very informative and this is what it would look like from above the suns north pole three faintly curved lines radiated from a central point near that point the sun they were dotted linesof course no camera would have seen anything thenand they almost brushed the solar rim the navy mans lightpointer traced the incoming line it came in at several hundred miles per second he said decelerating all the way of course the invader wasnt seen near the sun and nobody was even looking for it then this the lightpointer traced a line outward we have only three photos of it and of course they could be artifacts garbage if theyre real then this one wasnt under power when it left the sun it was dropped the third line ran nearly parallel to the second then curved away this section was under power and decelerating at around two gravities with fluctuations weve got five photos and then its lost but it might well have been on its way to saturn not good said a voice in the dark the lights came on the navy man said who said that joe ransom he had a gaudy mustache and the air of selfassurance the sf writers all seemed to share look they dropped something to save fuel could have been a fuel tank id think it was a bussard ramjet someone interrupted ransom waved it away it almost doesnt matter they dropped something they needed to get here they probably planned to odds are they didnt take enough fuel to stop inside the solar system without droppingwell something massive something they didnt need any more something that served its purpose once it got them from alpha centauri or wherever if burnham jumped on it a bussard ramjet wouldnt be any use inside the solar system you need a thousand kilometers per second to intercept enough fuelor there are some alternate versions but you still ransom rode him down we cant figure out what it was yet and we dont care they used it to cross and then they dropped it either they figure to make someone build them another one or theyre not going home you see the problem something icy congealed in jennys guts they dont expect to go home maybe a threat team isnt such a bad idea ill have to call the admiral meanwhile the meeting was degenerating into isolated clumps of conversation jenny spoke up to resume control enough the noise dropped by half mr ransom you said alpha centauri why just a shot in the dark its the three closest stars in the sky and two of them are yellow dwarfs stars very like ours stars yes what we call alpha centauri meaning the brightest star in the centaur constellation is really three stars two yellow ones pretty close together and one wretched red dwarf our own suns a yellow dwarf curtis said interesting lieutenant sherrad said our astronomers say the object came from the centaur region is alpha centauri really a good prospect the meeting came apart again this time jenny let it ride for a bit her patience was rewarded when curtis bellowed may i have a consensus who likes alpha centauri two hands went up who hates it three hands and three undecided sherry why dont you like alpha centauri wade you know how many other choices there are there are almost a dozen yellow dwarf stars near us and we dont know they came from that kind of star anyway bob you like it the wide whitehaired man with the gaudy vest laughed and said i didnt at first its trite but you know its trite because it got used so much and it got used so much because its the best choice why wouldnt they go looking for the closest star thats like their own and sherry there arent many yellow stars in that direction that clump centers around procyon and tau ceti and thats what i was getting at dr curtis said its trite as i see it the way to bet is that they came from alpha centauri or else they came a hell of a long distance and if they dropped half their shipyou see burnham said itd be their first trip they wont be very good at talking to us chances are theyll want to watch us from high orbit maybe its good the soviets cant go after them they might run it still isnt good we should have met them around saturn just to get a little more respect could have had a hotel on titan by now proxmire they were at it again out of the babble she heard curtis say one things suit they came from a long way off so the next question is what do they want rogachevs office was roomy enough by station standards much of its furniture looked like afterthoughts the hot plate the curved sofa that had replaced a standard air mattress even the window shuttled from earth and welded into a hole sawn in the hull a thickwalled box two panes of glass sandwiching a goop that would foam and harden in near vacuum but it let light through so that station commander arvid pavlovlch rogachev could see the stars they flowed past left to right while arvid mixed powdered tea with boiling water in a plastic bag the station was equipped for freefall in case of emergencies he served the tea into two cups and passed one to his second in command the station will house twelve arvid said twelve are aboard four are foreign observers no more important event has occurred aboard any spacecraft and it will happen while kosmograd is both crowded and shorthanded not quite so bad as all that said aliana aleksandrovna thtsikova recall that there is nothing to be done about the alien ship we dont have to go to meet them we dont even have a motor neither drive nor weapons we could not flee either exactly it will come we are privileged to watch i suggest that we are doing fairly well perhaps we are arvid smiled it helps that our guests cannot talk to each other well their dossiers said that arvid didnt entirely trust any dossiers but aliana knew that he said ive watched them exercising their language deficiencies do you see a security problem from them no it is my habit to make threat estimates shall we as a game my mother would call it gossip let us gossip then which of our guests do you find interesting the nigerian hes the blackest man ive ever seen i actually have trouble looking him in the face really what will you do when aliens are aboard perhaps ill hide in your office she lost her smile comrade commander i have an irrational fear of spiders and insects then we must hope that the approaching guests will be neither but they will not be shaped like men arvid thought and aliana could not even see all men as men she would be of little help to him if aliens came aboard he had not suspected this weakness in her it was well hed learned it now she said the nigerian speaks english and three native languages which must make him effectively retarded there are fortythree languages active within the borders of nigeria educated in england then patrice lumumba university in moscow but he learned little russian he favors economic independence for nigeria we wont cure that here he spends all his time with dmitri parfenovich and wes dawson that would be good except that dmitri has been trying to convert dawson to his own views whereas dawson sometimes takes the time to try to tell george whats going on dawson is good at explaining complex matters could you have a word with dmitri arvid laughed do you want me to tell our political commissar how to convert the heathen aliana i do not seek converts she laughed officially dmitri grushin was deputy commander and information officer for the station but he was so little qualified for either job that his kgb origins showed clearly we may find ourselves seeking converts among people with nightmare shapes aliana said if so dawson is the one to watch nigeria and france would be no threat to us his nation made a good choice there i think the honorable wes dawson is frantic to meet aliens wasnt it politics that rogachev shrugged certainly his dossier suggests that he forced himself aboard even so although i know little of american politics i would not think a mere congressman could force the american president too far in a direction he did not wish to go aliana grinned dawson is more qualified than dmitri surely they have similar positions rogachev shrugged i do not think so but it hardly matters dawsons dossier calls him politically liberal a lazy agent wrote that politically liberalhe copied that out of some newspaper dawson has invariably favored the american space program rogachevs face twisted into a look he didnt show to many people a distinctly guilty grin i have closely watched the honorable wes dawson he has been sick with envy since he came aboard he does not even care much for the design indeed he knows precisely how he would rebuild the station if it were his but as it is not it is killing him aliana smiled back if we had the funding wouldnt we make improvements too very well dr beaumont has been a french communist for two decades we can count her an ally she has a kind of beauty wouldnt you say classic and severe but yes have you made advances arvid laughed she would not be interested a male can tell before he commits himself perhaps i have grown too fat she speaks little english i have taken opportunities to put her together with dawson to see what would happen and oh he shows some interest but captain greeley and giselle beaumont have spent much more time together aliana i find that odd she nodded comprehension captain john greeley usaf a goodlooking man three years younger than the french doctor but fourteen years younger than for example me greeley probably considers dawson a step in his career which might end in public relations or political campaign management yet he seems to be trying to share a bed with the frenchwoman dawson might find her attractive as well greeley is competing with a man who could help or hurt him he shrugged some men have little control over their gonads what would you do i hardly have to ask do i arvid you would help your superior seduce the woman and thereby advance your career i no longer must resort to such tactics yet i would have said that greeley does greeley knows dawson better than we do dawson may be homosexual it would be in his dossier even if the americans do not know the kgb would then again some married people are more thoroughly married than others that was a dig but meant in friendly fashion arvid found alianas position perfectly reasonable with a husband and a child on earth and a career to manage as well her life was easily complex enough without adding a lover arvid poured more tea for them from the plastic bag i enjoy gossiping with you aliana we are also discussing security are we not perhaps security isnt my department either decisions have already been made and not by me my own inclination would be to bar any tourists from the station during this crucial time but the chairman favors world opinion these days i generally find that reassuring too often it precedes an invasion not this time perhaps mother russia is about to greet the first visitors from interstellar space they will come here first intelligent creatures would not leave potential enemies above them when they land and that coup will make the us landings on the moon look like a child reciting for his elders must we have visitors to watch our triumph it could be filmed we can guess at a second purpose when the aliens arrive we will seem to represent the world it doesnt matter security is out of my hands i can forbid our foreign visitors to enter parts of the station i can forbid the crew to discuss technical matters information may leak through anyway it usually does but the blame will not fall on arvid rogachev the little truck groaned up coldwater canyon harry clutched his twelvestring guitar and shivered in the windwake behind the cab it was cold for may in los angeles lately all the nights had been cold cold or not it beat walking it was nice of arline to duck her old man and come pick him up too damn bad she had five other people with her so he had to ride in the back it had been a good evening in the sunset bar where he played for free drinks and customer change once harry had thought hed be a real performer but the auto wrecks had finished that twice within two weeks in his own car and then his bosss borrowed car and neither had headrests it went beyond bad luck his head hurt and his back hurt and he cursed the two separate sets of sons of bitches whod separately rearended him and left him part crippled and the insurance companies and their goddam lawyers and ruby moved over to sit against him a hundred and eighty pounds of fleshy cushion her warmth felt good want to come to my place she asked love to harry said and i dont like to sleep alone but you know i have this place i have to watch take me with you then cant do that either harry said he didnt want to ruby had been a nice soft affectionate partner and not just in bed ten years ago naive but nice maybe hed been expecting her to grow up god how shed changed shed grown out forty pounds maybe more shed been soft then but she hadnt sagged you noticed the lack of brains more now arline now shed be nice but jesus she lives with her old man and hed get sticky as hell for a moment harry thought it over arline would come with him shed love the dawson house and and word of honor on record heckfire the truck was passing laurel canyon on mulholland he tapped on the glass the pickup pulled over harry climbed out he waved to arline thanks he called sure this is all right she asked fine harry said he waited until shed driven on up the hill and around a corner then started climbing toward the dawson house its good for me harry thought its got to be and by damn my legs are tightening up he slapped his thighit did feel more solid than it had in a long timeand shifted the guitar from his left hand to his right the littlecaliber beretta was too heavy in his shirt pocket he knew he ought to leave it at home it wasnt much of a gun and even so the cops would get soggy and hard to light if they caught him with it but it was all the gun he had and there were some bad people out there not the only gun he thought hed rooted around in the dawson househell wes knew hed do that thats why he told him about the money in the drawer behind the big drawer in the kitchenand hed found the army the one wes bought for carlotta on harrys advice and damn all she hadnt taken it with her but it wasnt his gun and harry couldnt carry it it would really hit the fan if he was caught carrying a piece registered to a congressman hell hed never carry that weight up this hill it was always steeper every fucking night it got steeper its good for me its really good for me oh my god i have got to get that motorcycle fixed ive got enough for a deposit theyll fix the engine maybe if i sing at three places the hell with the free drinks get to places where the tips are good i can scrape up enough to get it out because i cant go on climbing this hill and theres groceries jesus im down to chili and cornmeal and nutrisystems for the first week it had been easy there had been food in the refrigerator he ate vegetable omelets then frozen stuff then cans but now he was down to the nutrisystem stuff carlotta had bought years ago diet stuff lord god it tastes better than it ought to and i could lose some belly here but opening the cans feels like opening cat food looks like opening catfood cans and carlotta went off the diet two years ago fry it with eggs and it looks like cat food and snot and im out of eggs he shifted the guitar to his other hand nothing left but breakfast cereal im going to get that engine fixed tomorrow harry thought he shifted the guitar again i can take the kawasaki apart but the engine has to be rebuilt ill have to carry it in borrow arlines pickup again if you pulled a drawer in the dawson kitchen all the way out there was another drawer behind it and a thousand dollars in fifties behind that a good burglar would find it and go away harry thought and that was probably its major purpose burglar bait for gods sake and thank god he didnt need it he had enough for the deposit jenny stood quickly as admiral carrell came into her tiny office in the white house basement sit down he commanded im just old enough to feel uncomfortable when ladies stand up for me got any coffee yes sir she took cups from her desk drawer and poured from a thermos pitcher pretty good not up to navy standards of course navy coffee will peel paint did we get anything out of that zoo yes sir jenny said you sound surprised admiral i was surprised i thought the exercise was a waste of time but once those scifi types got going it was pretty good she opened a folder that lay atop her desk this for instance when the alien ship came into the solar system almost fifteen years ago a few telescopes including mauna kea happened to be pointed that way no one noticed anything then but when we really looked she showed the photographs it look like blobs to me yes sir they looked like blobs to all of us maybe they are blobs but the scfi people suggested that the alien ship dropped a bussard ramjet a bussard ramjet admiral she looked down at her notes and read vacuum isnt empty theres hydrogen between the stars the ramjet is a device for using the interstellar hydrogen as a means for propulsion in theory it will take shipslarge shipsbetween the stars it uses large magnetic fields for scoops and you may spare me the technical details yes sir the important point is that they dropped something massive something they may need if they contemplate leaving our solar system which means they intend to stay admiral carrell said mildly yes sir rather presumes on our hospitality almost as if they didnt intend us any free choice he stood well we will know soon enough yes sir my congratulations on your work with the advisors perhaps i can glean more speculations from them youre going to work with them sir i may as well the president has decided that someone responsible must be inside cheyenne mountain when the aliens arrive that someone apparently is to be me good choice jenny said carrell smiled thinly i suppose so any special preparations i should make sir nothing that isnt in the briefing book ive discussed this with the strategic air command and the chief of naval operations theyre ordering a yellow alert starting tomorrow afternoon yellow alert the a teams on duty in the missile silos all the missile subs at sea bombers on ready alert fueled bombs aboard with crews in quarters by the runways i do hope this is a waste of time admiral carrell nodded agreement so do i major needed or not i leave this afternoon before i do we must discuss this with the president i give you one hour to reduce all we know to a tenminute briefing jeri wilson piled the last of the gear into the station wagon and slammed the tailgate then she leaned against it to catch her breath it was warm out with bright sun overhead but the morning low haze hid the mountains ringing the san fernando valley she glanced at her watch eleven and im ready to go she announced isadore leiber eyed the aged buicks sagging springs youll never make it he announced clara nodded agreement good roads all the way jeri said ive left enough time so i wont have to drive too fast youre the ones who are cutting it close you have farther to go yeah isadore said jeri change your mind come with us no i am going to find my husband clara looked uncomfortable jeri hes not really he damned well is that divorce isnt final anyway its not your problem its mine thanks for worrying about me but i can take care of myself i doubt it isadore said with embarrassed brutality melissa came out with a large bear named mr pruett thank god there werent any animals jeri thought except the goldfish shed taken care of that problem by flushing the fish down the toilet while melissa was asleep isadore showed her an entry in his notebook thats the right address and phone number she nodded caddoa colorado isadore said i never heard of the place jeri shrugged me either david thinks theyre crazy but somebody thinks he can find oil there sounds small i guess it is harry marked out a route for me harry clara said contemptuously harrys all right jeri said anyway i went to the auto club too they say the roads are good all the way isadore clara its sweet of you to worry but youve done enough now get out of here before george and vicki get mad at you yeah isadore said i sure would hate it if george got mad at me you would though jeri said give the enclave my best melissa get in the car were on our way clan from your look youd think you werent ever going to see me again sorry clara tried to laugh but she wasnt doing a very good job of it do you know something jeri demanded a little isadore said he sounded reluctant to talk but finally added george caught something on short wave all the strategic forces are on alert also theres some kind of problem in russia he thinks im not sure what george is always hearing about problems in russia jeri said yeah but hes been right too remember how he predicts that shakeup jeri shrugged too late to worry about it she got into the station wagon and started the engine thanks again she called as she pulled away from the curb the buick was sluggish and she wondered if she really had loaded it too heavily it was an old car and for the past year it had been pretty badly neglected i ought to have new springs put in and have the brakes looked at and a tuneup andand no if i wait i may never go at all he didnt say no he couldnt quite get himself to say yes but he didnt say no and thats enough for me melissa buckle up weve got a long ride ahead part two arrival the arrival why meet we on the bridge of time to exchange one greeting and to part the kasidah of haji abdu elyazdi countdown h hour the army had been at work in the oval office technicians had installed tv monitors in all the corners as well as in front of the presidents desk they showed the command center of the soviet kosmograd satellite at the moment nothing was happening despite its large size the oval office was jammed there was the president and mrs coffey most of the cabinet the white house staff diplomats tv crew jenny sat well back behind the tv cameras nearly in the corner in theory she was there as admiral carrells representative ready to advise the president but there was no way she could have spoken to him if hed wanted her to not in this zoo everyone wandered about everyone but the secret service men it was easy to spot them once you knew how they were the ones who never looked at the president they watched the people who were watching him jenny caught jack clybournes eye and winked he didnt respond he never did when he was on duty he didnt look happy jenny had overheard an argument between jacks boss and the president mr dimming i appreciate your concern but i have told the country i would watch from the oval office and by god thats where ill be so theres an end to it president coffey had said selected newspeople were invited which meant the secret service people as well they knew them all reporters and camera crew and jack looked as relaxed as he ever did when on duty but jenny could see that he was worried they had wanted the president in a bomb shelter but were here jenny thought here and waiting in the most famous office in the world but were only spectators its the soviets show all the computer projections showed the alien craft arriving at kosmograd only the time was uncertain she glanced at her watch it was very late well past midnight the aliens were due and past due coffee service was available in the hall outside but someone would probably take her chair if she went out better to wait the television monitors blanked momentarily then showed the dark of space in the far distance something flickered and flashed heretofore the telescopes on earth and in earth orbit had seen only a long pure bluewhite light and the murky shadow at its tip now as the tremendous halfseen mass approached kosmograd something changed twinkling lights flashed in a ring around the central flame round and round chasing their tails like light bulbs in a bar sign the communications lounge was crowded eight present four crew busy elsewhere wes watched the picture being beamed from the telescope to a screen half the size of the wall the ship was minutes away wes tried not to think what would happen if it came a bit too fast it was decelerating hard those extra engines hadnt been needed until now sixty or seventy tiny engines symmetrical sixteen to a quadrant wes dawson grinned in delight sixtyfour engines the aliens used baseeight arithmetic or base four or binary digits engines much smaller than the main engine and probably less efficient fission or fusion pulse engines judging by the radiation they were putting out why hadnt the alien slowed earlier it still hadnt replied to any message it had grown gigantic in the telescope field a blaze of light washed out the aft end wes saw only the long flame and the ring of twinkling jets he made out bulges around the cylindrical midsection he saw tiny fins and guessed at landing craft spaced out around the hull a knob on the end of a long jointed arm what was that a cluster of sensing devices it was aimed at the station we have some shielding arvid said without being asked we can handle this much radiation but not for too much longer i hope they have some way of maneuvering with chemical rockets wes nodded he thought you knew the job was dangerous when you took it fred but nobody aboard would have understood the reference he said this may be a violation of the geneva convention it sparked laughter arvid said use tact when you tell them nikolai thats enough of the telescope show us a camera view from and interrupted to strain forward wess hands closed hard on the arms of his chair for the alien ship was sparkling like a fireworks display four of the twinkling jets expanded outward away from the drive flame then four more those pulsejets were the main drives for smaller spacecraft showers of sparks flowed from the hidden bow end missiles missiles in tremendous number then and this was starting to look ominously like a japanese movie not first contact but space war the picture flickered white and disappeared arvid was out of his seat and trying to reach god knows what and wes was checking his seat belt when the whole station rang and shuddered wes yelled and clapped hands over his ears the others were floating out of their seats freefall he swept an arm out to push giselle back into her seat and she clutched the arms he couldnt reach anyone else freefall how could that be the connecting tunnel must have come apart nikolai was screaming into a microphone he stopped suddenly he turned and looked around stunned ashen behind wes the wall smashed inward then outward the buckle on wess seat harness popped open wes grabbed instinctively a death grip on the arm of his chair even before the shock wave reached him the nigerian snatched at wess belt and clung tight he was screaming good so was wes hold your breath and youd rupture your lungs for the stars were glaring in at them through the ripped metal and the air was roaring away carrying anything loose giselle beaumont flapped her arms as if trying to fly her eyes met wess in pure astonishment and fly she did out into the black sky and gone shit vacuum dawsons eyes and ears felt ready to pop giorges grip was growing feeble but so was the wind the air was almost gone so what have i got a minute before the blood boils out through my lungs ill never reach my milliondollar pressure suit so where are the beach balls i located them first thing every compartment the emergency pressure balloons where the hell were they if americans had built this place theyd be popping out of the walls because ralph nader would raise hell if they didnt nothing was popping out of the walls dawsons intestinal tract was spewing air at both ends his eyes sought rogachev there clawing at a wall dawson patted the shoulder at his waist and kicked himself toward rogachev giorge hung on in good sense or simple panic his throat tried to cough but it couldnt get a grip wes bounced against a wall couldnt find a handhold bounced away losing control dying the black man caught something but kept one arm around wess waist rogachev looked like a pufferfish he was fighting to tear open a plastic wall panel it jerked open and he bounced away bulky disks four feet across turned out to be flattened plastic bags wes skimmed one at rogachev he pulled another open crawled inside and pulled the black man in too zipper he zipped them inside tight fit some kind of lock at the end of the zipper with his chin on the black mans shoulder wes reached around the mans neck and flipped the lock shut he hoped air jetted immediately reverse pressure in his ears he pulled in air in in no need to exhale at all they were going to live they were floating loose and nothing to be done about it because the pressure packages were nothing but balloons with an air supply attached rogachevs too was bouncing about like a toy but at least hed gotten inside wess passenger was beginning to struggle it was uncomfortable wes wanted to say something comforting or just tell him not to rip the goddam beach ball rut now his throat had air to cough with and he couldnt stop coughing he sounded like he was dying so did giorge nothing happened for a long time giorge discovered the blood pooling in his ears he wailed he fought his way around until he could look into wess face and then he wailed again his eyes showed bloody veins as if hed been on a weeklong drunk wess own eyes must look just that bad his nose was filled with blood a globule swelled at the tip he had no idea how much air there was in these things something showed through the ripped wall just for an instant reflecting glass that might hide eyes and a glimpse of what might be a tentacle a real honesttogod tentacle giorge made a mewling sound and ceased struggling wes froze too he hadnt believed hed fought like a demon to be at this event but somewhere inside him hed been ready for disappointment there had been the pulsars precisely timed signals coming from somewhere in interstellar space beacons for little green men hed been in college when the pulsars were shown to be rapidly spinning neutron stars weird but natural much younger when the canals of mars became mere illusion the dangerously populated swamps of venus were red hot dry and lifeless the starship too would be something else some natural phenomenon the alien approached cautiously a quick look dodge back maybe report to a companion look again reflecting faceplate swinging side to side along with the snout of what must be a weapon it crawled through being careful not to snag its pressure suit it was compact and bulky and three or four times the size of a man a dull black pressure suit hid most of it but it wasnt even vaguely manshaped it was fourfooted the boots were armed with claws pincers there was a tail like the blade of a paddle the transparency at the front might indicate its face reflection hid the detail behind it but a single rubberylooking tentacle reached out from just below the transparent plate and then branched and branched again there was no doubting that the branched tentacle held a large bore gun the handle was short and grotesquely broad but the rest was easy to recognize magazine barrel trigger halfway up the barrel packs at the aliens sides puffed gas from foreandaft snouts the aliens approach slowed and it floated toward wes with the gun barrel and the reflecting faceplate looking right at him wes lifted his hand in greeting for lack of a better idea waved then opened and closed his thumb across the palm he said inaudibly with vacuum between them im a tool user too brother the alien didnt react hed been prepared for disappointment but not for war idiot yet he could hope he wasnt dead yet and a border skirmish did not constitute a war the tentacle swept backward slid the gun into a holster on the creatures back the tentacle pulled a line from a backpouch fixed something to the end something sticky yes the alien was mooring the beach ball to a line using adhesive tape wes began to believe that he would not be killed just yet ambassador to the galactic empire he could still make it maybe they were only paranoid only very cautious he would have to be cautious himself a diplomat was wes dawson good at finding the interfaces between disparate viewpoints let him come to understand them he could find the advantage in friendship between earth and aliens unless they really had come to conquer earth the specter of herbert george wells was very much with him everyone in the oval office was shouting jenny stared at the screen not quite comprehending what shed seen major crichton the president sir please call admiral carrell you people make room for her please jack help her get over here yes sir jack clybourne shouldered through the crowd then helped her get to the presidents desk coffey was still seated his face was ashen jeanne coffey sat beside him her eyes staring at the blank tv screen i dont think we need the newspeople here just at the moment the president said or the staff or the cabinet except for dr hart and mr griffin state and defense yes well need them hap aylesworth stayed also jenny almost giggled the political advisor political implications of war with the aliens how would this affect the next election there were three telephones on the stand behind the presidents desk jenny lifted the black one and punched in numbers before she realized there was no dial tone dead she said the president looked at her uncomprehendingly should i use this one she asked the indicated the red telephone yes there was no dial tone on that one either but the air force officer on duty in the white house basement came on yes sir priority jenny said hq norad right wait one theres something coming in theyre calling you here you are mr president a familiar voice said major crichton admiral the president is here she held out the telephone his calm is going mrs coffey looks horrible and what happened admiral the secret service had managed to clear nearly everyone out of the room jack clybourne stood uncertainly at the door the president touched a button admiral carrells voice filled the mom little left we have no operational satellites just before we lost the last observation satellite it reported a number of rocket plumes in the soviet union the president looked up and caught the eye of the secretary of state arthur get down to the hot line and find out right dr hart ran to the door secretary of defense ted griffin went pale if the crazy bastards have launched at us weve got to get our birds up before theirs hit we cant just shoot the president shouted we dont know theyve attacked us we have to talk to them i doubt that you can get through admiral carrell said i took the liberty of trying mr president it appears that a large nuclear device has been detonated in the very high stratosphere far too high to do any harm to ground installations except for the pulse effect which has severely damaged our communications capabilities especially on the east coast we must get through admiral do you believe the soviets are attacking us sir i dont know certainly the aliens have attacked our space installations admiral carrells voice broke off suddenly admiral there was a long silence mr president i have reports of ground damage hoover dam has been destroyed by a large explosion a nuclear weapon sir i dont know what else it could be a moment there was another silence god damn ted griffin shouted they did it the crazy russian bastards did it the admirals voice came on faintly one of my advisors says it could have been what he calls a kinetic energy weapon not nuclear it could not have been a soviet rocket they couldnt have reached here in time another pause im getting more reports alaska colorado mississippi mr president we are being bombarded some of the attacks are coming from space may i have permission to fight back david coffey looked at his wife she shuddered fight who the president demanded the aliens admiral carrell said not the soviets not yet ted david coffey asked sir the secretary of defense looked ten years older is there any way i can authorize carrell to fight a space battle without giving him the capability to launch against the soviet union no i see jeanne what do you think i think youre the president david jenny held her breath you dont have any choice hap aylesworth said what youll let them attack our country without fighting back thank you coffey said quietly admiral is colonel feinstein there yes sir colonel another voice came on yes mr president colonel i authorize you to open the code container and deliver the contents to admiral thorwald carrell the authentication phrase is pigeons on the grass alas you will receive confirmation from the secretary of defense and the national security council duty officer ted yes sir ted griffin took the phone almost dropped it and read from a card hed taken from his wallet then he turned to jenny major major crichton here jenny said i confirm that i personally have heard the president order the codes released to admiral carrell my authentication code is tango xray alfa four seven niner four and thats done lord i never admiral the president said you will not launch against the soviet union until we have absolute confirmation that they have attacked us i dont believe theyre involved in this and earth has troubles enough without a nuclear war is this understood yes sir mr president i suggest you come here as quickly as you can major crichton assist the president and stay with him as long as youre needed ill put colonel hartley on now something rang in his head harry reddington woke and thrashed and slapped the top of his alarm clock the pause to give him another ten minutes sleep the ringing went on the room was pitch dark and it wasnt the clock ringing it was the telephone harry picked up the receiver his voice was musical sarcastically so hellooo a breathy voice said harry go outside and look ruby its late ruby ive got to get up early tomorrow there was party music in the background and a womans voice raised in laughing protest rubys voice was bathetically mournful she must be ripped at a late party she was bound to be harry i went outside for a hit you know julia and gwen they dont like anyone smoking anything in there they dont like tobacco any better than pot ruby i went out and its its it looks so real harry go out and look at the sky its the end of the world harry hung up he rolled off the dawsons water bed and searched for his clothes hed stayed up too late anyway it would have been a good night to get drunk with friends but word of honor on record hed come home and had a few drinks as consolation for being alone while interstellar ambassadors made first contact with humanity the clock said and hed been up past midnight watching the news there hadnt been any whatever the soviets were learning they hadnt been telling eventually he went to bed now his eyes felt gritty the cane was leaning against the bedstead he gave up on finding a jacket he wouldnt be out long he unlocked the back door and stumbled out onto the dawsons lawn ruby had been using marijuana and spreading the word of it like any missionary since the midsixties she worked as a clerk in the head shop next to the honda salesroom what had harry outside in a coolish california may night was this reflection a doper might see things that arent there but she might see things that are the sky glowed harry was an angeleno he judged the mistiness of the night by that glow the glow of the los angeles lights reflected from the undersides of clouds the glow wasnt bright tonight and stars showed through something brighter than a star showed through a dazzling pinpoint that developed a tail and vanished all in a moment a long bluewhite flame formed and held for several seconds while narrow lines of light speared down from one end other lights pulsed slowly like beating hearts the sky was alive with strange lights harry got back inside fished the tiny minolta binoculars out of a drawer found his windbreaker on a chair and stumbled out all without turning on a light he wanted his night vision the sky seemed brighter now he could see streaks of light rising from the west flaring disappearing narrow threads of green lanced west down there were phosphorescent puffs of cloud lazily expanding on another night harry might have taken it for a meteor shower tonight hed read a hundred versions of the aliens conquering earth and they all sounded more spectacular than this flaring and dying of stars and smudges of lights any movie would have had sound effects too but it looked so real still without turning on the lights he fumbled his way back into the house to find a transistor radio he carried it outside with him and tuned to the allnews station have fired on the soviet kosmograd space station the newsmans voice said the president has alerted all military forces people are asked to stay in their homes we cannot confirm that the united states air force has fired on the alien spacecraft pentagon spokesmen arent talking here is lieutenant general arlen gregory a retired air force officer general do you think the united states will fight back look at the sky you silly buzzard a gravelly voice said what the hell do you think all the lights are harry watched and thought as a flame curved around the western horizon flared and died then two more no question what that was and now what do i do stay and watch the house only jesus congressman wes was in kosmograd and carlotta dawson would be in western kansas by now present situation unknown if shed taken the gun if shed been the type to take the but she wasnt the radio began the peculiar beep beep of an incoming news bulletin we have an unconfirmed report that san diego harbor has suffered a large explosion the announcer said he sounded like a man whod like to be hysterical but whod used up all his emotions maybe i should go help carlotta wes would want me to jesus how the kawasaki was in pieces there hadnt been nearly enough money for everything that should have been done to it and harry hadnt wanted to push hed done most of the work himself as much as he could but only the honda shop could rebuild the engine hed finished taking the bike apart and carried the engine in and as far as he knew it was ready it had better be there must be others watching tonight theyd sure as hell know by morning harry watched and thought and made his plans then he went inside and washed his face carlotta didnt like him and so what harry opened dawsons liquor cabinet and opened a bottle of carlos primera brandy sixty bucks a bottle but it was all that was left he poured a good splash looked at it thought of pouring some back and drank half carlotta doesnt like me the countrys at war with aliens wes asked me to look after things nothing i can do here and if i stay here long ill be here and for good he went to the telephone and dialed the kansas number carlotta had left it rang a long time then a voice not sleepy male mrs carlotta dawson please harry said he could sound official when he wanted to it took a moment yes harry reddington mrs dawson is there anything you want me to do harry harry they dont know what happened up there yes maam can i help you i dont know carlotta dawsons voice dissolved in hisses another voice came on the line is this an official telephone call it asked through the static then the line went dead harry emptied his glass now what she didnt say and if i stay in los angeles tomorrow ill be in los angeles forever he drank half an inch more brandy and closed the bottle firmly when he left he was in clean shirt and a sports jacket that was years old but had almost never been worn he carried id and a sleeping bag and congressman dawsons letter at am he was on the front steps of the security pacific national bank spreading his sleeping bag pavel bondarev stared at the blank screen all around him officers and aides at the command and communications consoles began to speak at once and the babble brought him to life colonel i wish this chatter to cease da comrade director colonel suvorov was efficient if unimaginative he shouted and the cacophony of voices died away the aliens had fired on kosmograd he had seen that much before all communications were lost the aliens had fired without warning without provocation an amber light blinked insistently pavel lifted the scrambler telephone da comrade chairman there was only a soft hiss then a sudden rush of static the officers at the command consoles burst into chatter again what has happened bondarev demanded a highaltitude nuclear explosion perhaps more than one the pulse effect has crippled our telephones suvorov reported i see and without communications bondarev felt rising panic the scrambler phone was dead get me marshal shavyrin there is no answer suvorov said it is vital use another means use any means bondarev ordered he fought to keep his voice calm the scrambler telephone remains silent is the chairman in communication with anyone else perhaps not perhaps we are safe i have shavyrin colonel suvorov said thank you pavel put on the headset comrade marshal da comrade director have you launched any missiles no comrade director i have received no instructions from the defense council bondarev discovered that he had been partially holding his breath now he let it out slowly you understand that the aliens have fired on kosmograd comrade director i know someone has two of my generals believe this a western trick nonsense comrade marshal you have seen that ship neither we nor the united states nor both nations working together could have built that ship there was a long pause pavel heard someone speaking to the marshal but he could not make out the words marshal bondarev insisted that ship was not built on this earth and we know the united states cannot have sufficient space facilities if they did they would long ago have defeated us there was another long pause then shavyrin said perhaps you are correct certainly that is true what must we do now i wish i knew immediately before the aliens destroyed kosmograd they launched many smaller ships i say smaller although they were each larger than kosmograd have you had success in tracking any of those only partially even with our largest radars it is difficult to see through the electronic storms in the upper atmosphere the aliens have set off many weapons there i know also they have fired laser beams at three of our large radars marshal shavyrin said laser beams da the most powerful we have ever seen damage the abalakovo radar is destroyed the sary shagan and lyaki radars are damaged but survive we have not activated the large radar near moscow for fear that it will draw their fire i see intelligent of him we will need information but not at that cost now tell me what you know of their smaller ships my information is not complete we have lost communications with many of our radars da but tell me what you have learned the ships have scattered most are in polar orbits track them if they come within range of the ion beam weapons fire at them be prepared to fire ss missiles under ground detonation control meanwhile attack the main alien ship with the entire force of ss missiles based in kamensk comrade director i require authorization from the chairman before i can do any of this comrade marshal the chairman has directed me to conduct this battle we have no communication with moscow you must launch your forces against the aliens particularly their large mother ship we must cripple it before it destroys us on the ground comrade director that is not possible comrade marshal it must be made possible if we attack the alien ship we will destroy kosmograd as well and all survivors a strange sentiment for the commander of strategic rocket forces kosmograd is already destroyed the survivors cannot be important now comrade director colonel suvorov shouted i have the chairman marshal the chairman is calling me please stand by bondarev took the other phone there was no mistaking the thick voice bondarev what must we do destroy the alien ship i would prefer not to but there is no choice have the aliens attacked the united states comrade chairman i do not know they have attacked us chairman petrovskiy said can we defeat the aliens can we destroy their ship i do not know we certainly cannot capture it we can try to destroy it da try then meanwhile we will do what we can there are reports of severe damage in the harbors the rail center west of moscow is in ruins so is brest litovsk but bondarev spoke in horror the germans da the germans may rise in revolt the poles as well the chairmans voice rose all the warsaw pact nations may rise against us our harbors are destroyed harbors and rail centers we face a new civil war if the united states remains undamaged comrade chairman i do not know that they are undamaged i do know that we must destroy that ship you must order marshal shavyrin to accept my orders to launch missiles at the alien there was a long pause we must retain enough missiles to prevent the united states from attacking us now that we are weakened petrovskiy said da i will do that bondarev said but if we do not act quickly we cannot act at all i have never spoken this way to the great ones not even to my fatherinlaw but i must comrade chairman there is no time to lose there was another long pause then da i will give the orders but have a care pavel aleksandrovich have a care lights in the sky be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves matthew countdown h plus one hour the air was foul and growing fouler it was like being trapped inside a whales lungs giorge gasping and coughing and fighting the soft walls had finally fainted the beach balls oxygen supply wasnt designed for two occupants it was a hell of a situation in which to try to relax but wes tried he held his breathing slow and steady he let his eyelids droop half curled toward fetal position he consciously relaxed his muscles in pairs as if he were fighting a night of insomnia all this while traveling like a tethered balloon behind their massive inhuman captors naked in the glare of the stars helpless as a babe wes fell toward an alien artifact bigger than the world trade center he saw detail as he neared the thing a pod on a jointed arm rectangles of blackness a jet of blue flame from a cluster of cones but the air was like soup his nose was clogged with drying blood hold the breathing down stay awake there are things you have to see no use his chest heaved a coughing fit wracked his body and everything went out of focus arvid rogachev was finding a great deal to awe him and not much to surprise him a ship the size of a city of course if they hoped to conquer a planet the aliens very alien the attack why not whatever they expected from contact with humankind it was their safest approach which was not to say that he wasnt angry how would they treat prisoners human precedent showed a wide spectrum but wouldnt they want to inspect the natives more closely these attackers hadnt had time to build up a hatred for the enemy not yet what they found alive they would keep alive unless they were xenophobic beyond sanity or found the human shape intrinsically disgusting still a corpse dead of explosive decompression was not the ideal subject for dissection might they prefer a healthy soviet executive arvid shrugged off that line of thought who still lived dawson of course and giorge nikolai too had reached a survival bubble aliana the other american greeley a dozen of the beasts had followed the first the scout through the ripped wall paused briefly to inspect the humans then gone off into other parts of the wrecked station the four who remained had enlarged the rip with a series of explosive gun blasts now the survival bubbles were being towed toward what seemed an infinite metal wall he wished for a better look at the aft end the drive but they were approaching from the side dark holes showed along the flank with doors snugged against the hull airlocks or missile ports those oval windows for passengers or lasers a sudden narrow string of twinkling points against the black sky random dust motes reflecting a laser beam sure enough a new star blazed far away then winked off far below lights flashed against earths night sky something blossomed impossibly bright and arvid turned his head away a nuclear weapon whose and how close was it he fought real panic how long do i have to live almost he laughed it had been a long way away near the earths surface ten thousand kilometers and more i have looked upon the cocatrice and survived other lights flared far down toward earth light beams stabbed downward through space flecked with dust and debris bondarev is attacking the alien ship perhaps the united states as well he had never felt more helpless they were close enough to the ship for him to see details grooves ran along the spacecrafts flank like railroad tracks but much farther apart smaller craft could have been anchored there smaller but still big perhaps as big as a pocket battleship the entire hull might function like an aircraft carriers deck or arvid felt hampered here this kind of guesswork was no task for an executive nor a soldier either he needed a combination of mechanic and strategist a mechanic with imagination had nikolai survived or mitya the ship had become a cubistic landscape rectangular pock too small to be an airlock no it was larger than hed thought aliensized he saw as one of his captors moved up against it a cavity the size of an alien in a pressure suit alien disappeared within the door closed the door opened alien pushed arvids survival bubble into the airlock it brushed the sides but it fit the outer door closed the survival bubble sagged arvids abused ears popped an inner door opened alien pulled the survival bubble out into a corridor a wide rectangular corridor curved painted in three tones of green camouflage style with carpet along two walls arvid was disoriented would they spin the ship for gravity certainly he was still in freefall the doors he saw were all closed then an open door and it was thick massive as one would expect aboard a warship the alien paused arvid saw that he was boxed between the two aliens they acted in concert a longhandled bayonet sliced through the side of the survival bubble a forked tentacle reached in and closed around him arvid couldnt help himself he screamed and slammed a fist against the aliens faceplate only his fist was hurt the tentacle birthed him from the collapsed bubble and hurled him into the room did they breathe poison he was breathing it already he hit the far wall without the jolt hed expected it was padded the room was big and padded over walls and floor and ceiling the air the air was damp with a smell both earthy and strange it didnt smell like it would kill him a large conspicuous glassfaced tube poked through the padding in one corner of the room a camera the aliens followed him in arvid tried to relax as they came toward him one still clutched the bayonet in its tentacle dissection he wouldnt scream again but it was difficult not to fight one alien held him it felt like pythons were squeezing him to death while the other used the bayonet to slice through his clothing down the back and along his arms and legs they stripped him naked and collected the ruined clothing and backed out carefully as if he might still be dangerous he was alone his fear edged over into black rage dangerous when you can see me as dangerous then i am harmless this hour or this day this year or next year you will lower your guard by then i will know more wes had missed it all his oxygenstarved mind had been fading in and out catching fragmentary glimpses of alien wonders while his lungs strained at the dirty air as if he were trapped in a burning theater that was showing star wars halffelt forces pulled him through some kind of strangling barrier into air he could breathe his lungs clawed at air that was damp and cool sweet lifegiving air while something sharp ran down his torso and arms and legs and decidedly queer hands peeled him like an orange he was naked falling spots danced before his eyes where are the others is this all of us there were other bodies all naked rogachev white skin covered with black hair and bright eyes watching him giorge black skin almost hairless dull eyes that saw nothing another fell past him and bounced against the rubbery wall pale skin joltingly inhuman shape stumps for legs nikolai there were scars on nikolais belly oh boy that had been some accident arvid rogachev and nikolai talked in russian they sounded indecently calm four where were the others giorge was curled loosely in a ball his mouth was slightly open wes took his shoulder and turned him to bring them face to face giorges eyes were open but they werent looking at anything giorge its all right now all right for the moment were not in any danger just now can you hear me giorge giorge said a word in his own language wes couldnt get him to say any more hes nearly catatonic wes could understand the temptation it would be easy to curl into a fetal position and close his eyes easy but not sensible they attacked without warning without talking oh god carlotta saw it all she must think im dead or have they told earth they have prisoners the door opened again dmitri grushin flew among them cursing vigorously in a high hysterical voice rogachev snapped orders they had to be orders grushin blinked and quieted and rogachevs voice went from authoritative to fatherly dmitri nodded now there were five seven missing including both women arvid rogachev turned and spoke in english you are well congressman wes tested his throat id want a doctors opinion im alive but i hurt all over bends probably how are you the same wes we have seen men exposed to vacuum before we will live youll see ruptured veins on your face and body shit there goes my career arvid laughed president reagan used makeup so did nixon youre such a comfort arvid whats going on i would have i did bet my life that conquering another planet across interstellar space just isnt costeffective war of the worlds does it look like that to you i like the phrase your computer programmers use insufficient data is this all of us i do not know dmitri tells me that captain greeley is dead he saw it after the aliens had him in tow an alien moved into captain greeleys chambers in vacuum mind you the door was a bit small for the alien and while it was in the doorway captain greeley fired a handgun into the alien then continued firing through the wall he must have been firing through his survival bubble the aliens raked the chamber with explosive bullets wes couldnt decide how he felt about that too many shocks sounds like john there was a sound almost subsonic as if a tremendous gong had been struck wes saw a wall come at him he was falling he struck they were all piled against the damp padding and then the thrust eased off and left them floating so we still have some defenses arvid said zapsats groundbased beam weapons i would think the aliens will know all about it before we do at least it tells us we can still fight i wish we had a window wes said i wish we had a suitcase fission bomb arvid thought do i it would end my life too that will come soon enough patience the bb flew just above the treetops at near sonic speed for a while jenny looked out the tiny crew windows but there was little to see just shapes flashing past an occasional light most of the united states was dark there was a bright flash off to starboard jenny shuddered what jack asked he touched her hand then moved his away she reached for him and brought his hand back and held it in both of hers another dam she said she listened as the artificially calm voice from colorado springs spoke into her earphones spring lake dam near peoria illinois it said theyve hit most of the dams from there north and west floodwaters are rising all along the mississippi and missouri rivers were ordering evacuation but it wont be in time isnt there anything else the presidents voice interrupted the air force talker get the national guard out with helicopters sir were trying but we have almost no communications most of the reports im giving you come from direct observation by air national guard pilots flying wherever they see a flash we could lose a lot of pilots that way is there anything more on the russians jack asked no just a lot of damage reports jenny answered then we dont even know if were at war jenny gave a short laugh were at war all right we just dont know who with could the aliens be allied with the russians dont know i dont think so jenny said im sure wed have heard if they were in communication wed have heard something i think yeah he leaned back in the bombardiers seat and closed his eyes in seconds he was asleep jenny shook her head in admiration nothing for jack clybourne to do so he rests up for the next assignment i wish the president would do that theres not enough information for him to make any decisions not here i wish i could do it the reports continued missiles launched against the smaller alien ships the large alien ship remained invisible behind a screen of noise charged particles and chaff no confirmation of any soviet missile landing in the united states and no confirmation of any cities destroyed jenny leaned back in the electronic warfare officers seat and tried to close her eyes but the temptation to look out the window was too much the thick leaded glass would shield her eyes from anything that wouldnt kill her the bomber flew on toward colorado springs the steps of the bank were cold and damp harry settled as near the door as he could reach and turned on the transistor radio power failures throughout southern california the announcer was saying he sounded nearly hysterical we have reports thai something hit hoover dam laser beams for gods sake the long blue flame sank into the east harry settled against the bank door he thought of what else he could do steal a car steal a motorcycle break into the shop and steal his own motorcycle any of that might work but it might not im not as quick as i used to be he tried to think of someone whod help him but anyone whod believe him either wouldnt be any use or would already be doing something after a while he closed his eyes and slept a little he woke again when someone moved in beside him a small pudgy man who puffed from his climb up the steps he settled on the step below harry mind no harry said did you see the sky or the news both the tvs gone off though one of the radio people keeps saying its all a big mistake but i cant get through to new york sure cant or to dighton kansas harry nodded the pudgy man was shivering harry thought he should have worn more i keep remembering the war of the worlds what are they what do they want they could be anything not my department harry said and he closed his eyes as he drifted off he felt grateful for his brief military stint he had learned to sleep anytime and if everything went just right it was going to be one miserable day he kept waking to watch the sky there the pudgy man said he pointed south like what did they call it the highaltitude atom bomb test back in the fifties wouldnt remember harry said he frowned something came back to him theyd blown off a nuclear weapon in the stratosphere and mucked up the ionosphere and communications all over the world and it had taken months for things to get right again and that was one bomb there was nothing but static on the radio harry tuned across the band sometimes he heard stations but he couldnt really make out words he shrugged and kept tuning there were a lot of faintly phosphorescent smudges north south and west east was getting pink and he couldnt tell if explosions were there too war of the worlds in that movie the aliens had landed his random sweep picked up a news station he listened but there wasnt much news official announcements everyone to remain calm and stay home hysterical announcers with unconfirmed reports of anything you liked orphanage burned in los gatos dams broken trains derailed europe laid waste but no one had been hurt in los angeles and as far as harry could tell the announcer didnt know about anybody whod been hurt just lots of rumors when the sky turned light a dozen were in line only two had thought to bring sleeping bags one weatheredlooking man brought an entire backpack with sleeping bag selfinflating mat a blowup pillow a tiny stove he got himself settled then made coffee and sent it up and down the line in a sierra cup he seemed to be having a wonderful time so were the two boy scouts with him they talked in low voices a thin womans voice kept rising into hysteria then chopping off harry dozed the voices changed harry rolled over and was looking up at two blue police uniforms he exposed his hands then carefully reached into his sports jacket and opened his wallet harry reddington im here to make a withdrawal he didnt bother to smile sir why are you here harry suppressed an urge to point to the sky and giggle i told you im here to make a withdrawal the federal emergency management agency has issued orders for all citizens to stay home the older policeman said sure harry said we always do everything washington says dont we this time he couldnt help the grin howd they learn to deal with this situation experience sir the younger officer interrupted his companion they whispered for a moment harry used the opportunity to take out his baggiewrapped letter he held it out if youll shine your light here harry said the older policeman moved closer his light showed the capitol stationery clearly mr harry reddington whom i have authorized to stay in my house and guard my possessions and interests if they had read further theyd have come to the weasel words but they didnt and harry swallowed his sigh of relief yes sir the officer said this time the sir sounded a great deal more sincere some of the crowd behind them was muttering fucking pigs someone said not too loud the voice sounded cultured and not at all what youd expect someone saying that to sound like harry was tempted to take advantage of that instead he spoke in a low voice ill be glad to hold a place for you he said or one of your family the younger policeman thought that through then nodded her name is rosabell shell he here in an hour interstate had been completely dark for an hour one moment she had been trying to read an illuminated sign the next moment there was no light except her headlights the radio had gone dead at the same instant and now she could only get static high mountains loomed to either side as the car steadily climbed into the chuska mountains of western new mexico the gas gauge read less than a quarter full mom im hungry melissa said from the back seat theres bread and cheese jeri said not any more good god that was supposed to last a while you mean theres none left at all aw there wasnt very what was that overhead the sky blazed in green and blue then a long red streak that went all across the sky and downward to earth i dont know jeri said she shuddered aliens they were out there all the time waiting fifteen years and now theyve attacked us were gonna need gas i know albuquerque is ahead we can get gasoline there i dont know mom melissa said huh space war aliens you sure we want to go into a city lots of people running away i bet traffic jams you could be right her headlights picked up a reflective sign gas food ahead melissa said we could use some eat and run the car on the gas very funny jeri watched for the offramp there it was everything was dark over there but she took the ramp anyway if a town was nearby it was invisible theres the station melissa said somebodys in it youre right jeri pulled into the station yes maam a voice said from nowhere the station attendant switched on his flashlight he was a young man certainly not more than twenty and dark jeri thought he looked indian this is the right part of the country for it uh i need some gasoline badly the powers off the attendant said cant get the pumps to work oh but i have a long way to go and i really need some gasoline isnt there anything you can do he looked thoughtful i have a hand pump i suppose i could pump some out into a can itd be a lot of work oh please jeri said id be glad to pay you not sure moneys worth much now did you hear the news yes if you dont want money what do you want guess itll he all right though he went inside the station the flashlight flickered through the windows he seems nice enough so why am scared is civilization that fragile part of her kept saying yes the eastern windows blazed the television hissed and sprayed random light the radio spoke of an explosion on interstate between everett and marysville close isadore rolled to his feet and turned the tv off the radio announcer sounded hysterical thats got to be the long causeway isadore thought we got over it just in time all of the kids were asleep vicki tateevans had staggered away an hour ago her husband george was snoring on the couch with claras feet in his lap they got along fine as long as they were both asleep isadore felt punchy twitchy as if he should be doing something war in the sky just in time clara was right push on dont stop something might happen if wed waited any longer for jeri it would have been too late and where is she on the road somewhere and nothing i can do about it we were near enough dead getting in last night he remembered the bright flashes on the highway behind them maybe that was the causeway we hadnt got to sedro wooley so if wed been an hour later thats cutting things close theyd come in ready to collapse to find the television set running and a dead silence in the crowd that faced the set when the tv went blank theyd all trooped outside to watch the war in the sky he said as hed said before son of a bitch yeah shakes said he came in from the kitchen carrying a cup of coffee you were right he looked like he would never sleep again we were right isadore laughed and didnt like the high pitch of it seventeen years we were right before it looked even sensible we should be putting the shutters over the windows we should have bricked up the windows is anybody feeling ambitious nobody stood up and went out to fix the metal screens in place shakes said i never thought it was real so what are you doing here my whole damn family gets to use this place for only about thirty percent of what it would cost us thats a damn good deal for a vacation spot i dont even mind admitting it now we havent slacked off this place is built to keep all of us alive and me and my family did most of it you havent even seen the shelter izzie clara suddenly sat upright food how are the food supplies the food supplies are fine shakes said in some irritation good i could eat your arm off im going to make breakfast clara said and she stood staggering a little and made her way into the kitchen veering around jack and harriet mccauley who were asleep on the rug by eightthirty the line ran around the corner the original police had gone but two other pairs had come and one team of two had stayed rosabell hruska had come at eight she was a slender frightened woman in her twenties she carried a baby girl and she didnt talk to anyone except one of the visiting police at ten harry watched an old man in a guards uniform open the doors the line behind him rustled impatiently but he waited when the doors opened harry held it for rosabell two more elbowed past him before he could let go and get to a cashier the cashier looked nervous at least there is a cashier harry thought hed been worried would they all stay home there were twelve windows but only four had cashiers i want to make a withdrawal said harry were restricting withdrawals to five hundred dollars the cashier was an older woman probably long since graduated from sitting in a cage and talking to customers now filling in she looked defiant and afraid at the same time the eastern banks had been open for three hours harry wondered not whether there was a rush on the banks but how bad it was two windows down rosabell was shouting at the younger cashier shed chosen its our money she screamed too bad harry thought but it was no skin off harrys nose he had only fiftyeight dollars in his account he asked for it all in coins got two twentydollar rolls of quarters and eighteen ones then he moved to the deposit boxes his contained one mexican gold peso and thirty silver dimes hed been able to keep them because of the symbolic number if hed spent one hed have spent them all once there had been a lot more he took his money and left the bank tap city he thought tap city on my total resources the radio spoke of the need for calm message bearer and the lord said behold the people one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one anothers speech genesis countdown h plus six hours the herdmasters family occupied two chambers near the center of message bearer space was at a premium the sleeproom was not large though it housed two adults and three children it was roomier now the herdmasters eldest male child was aboard one of the digit ships that would presently assault the target world the mudroom smaller yet gave privacy some discussions the children might be permitted to hear but not this one herdmaster pastempehkeph lay on his side in the mud he was far too relaxed for his mates aplomb its a thoroughly interesting situation he said kturfookeph blared a trumpet blast of rage a moment later her voice was quietly intense if your guards heard that theyll think weve lost our reason as your advisor has keph you must dissociate yourself from him i cant that is one of the interesting aspects the sleepers expected to wake as masters of the ship they are as docile as one could hope and no more fathistehtulk was their herdmaster they will not permit me to remove him completely from power not even if they know him to be insane they would lose too much status kturfookeph sprayed warm water along her mates back he stirred in pleasure and high waves marched toward the high rim of the tub gravity was inconveniently low so near the ships center but any force from outside would destroy the ship before it penetrated so far she asked then what can be done little i must listen to him i am not required to obey his suggestions the herdmaster pondered the war for winterhome was finally under way and his relaxation time was all too rare he resented his mates encroachment on that time turn your mind around mother of my immortality dont play word games with me its half a year until mating season and we dont need soothing phrases between us not at our age he sprayed her scalp to tail making a thorough job of it before he spoke again your digits grasp the handle of our problem the mating cycles for sleeper and spaceborn are out of phase it makes all controversy worse the seasons on winterhome will be out of phase for both never mind turn your mind far enough to see the humor the sleepers never considered any path but to conquer a new world we spaceborn have spent seventy years in space we feel in our natalmemories that we can survive without a planet we know nothing of worlds the dissidents want to abandon winterhome entirely they should be suppressed that cant be done keph he said using the part of their name they shared in common as no other would it would split the spaceborn the dissidents may be one in four of us by now and fathistehtulk is a dissident chowpeentulk should control him better shes pregnant it ought to mean something to him some females have not the skill sufficient to control their mates irony had she offended him she sprayed him he seemed pleased rather than mollified a male as powerful as the herdmaster didnt need to assert himself over his mate she said the situation cannot continue no i fear for fathistehtulk and i dont like his clear successor can you speak to chowpeentulk will she control him she shifted uncomfortably and muddy water surged i have no idea a sleeper was not in her class they didnt associate tones sounded the herdmaster stretched and went to dry himself it was time to return to duty the target world already bore a name in the predecessor language the species had been nomads once the traveler herd had become nomads again but when mating season came even a nomad herd must settle in one place until the children had been born winterhome winterhome was fighting back its rulers were no longer an unknown despite damage and loss of lives pastempehkeph was relieved during the long years of flight from the ringed planet the prey had not acted the herdmaster and his advisor debated it had they been seen electromagnetic signals of the domestic variety leaked through winterhomes atmosphere and were monitored most of it was gibberish some was confusing with pictures of enormous spacecraft of unrealistic design what remained held no word of a real starship drawing near then suddenly beams were falling directly on thuktun flishithy messages demands for answers words promising peace before there had been war first a few then more then an incessant babble what was there to talk of how could they expect to negotiate before their capabilities had been tested but the prey had sent no missiles no ships of war only messages the breakers wondered if the prey might not know how to make war this violated all the herdmaster knew of evolution yet even when the attack began the prey did little the orbiting satellites didnt defend themselves half of them were gone in the first hour warriors braced to fight and die veered between relief and disappointment but the natives did have weapons not many used late but a long scar melted and refrozen lay along message bearers flank crossing one wing of a big troopcarrying lander digit ship fortyone might still operate in space but it would never see atmosphere four more digit ships had been destroyed in space missiles still rose from the planets surface and missiles and beam weapons still fired from space a few satellites remained in orbit message bearer surged under the impact of a plasma jet and trembled as a missile launched away toward the jets origin oh yes the great ship had suffered minor damage but this was good in its way the warriors would know at least that there was an enemy and now they knew something about the alien weapons and something about their own fighting ability and the herdmaster had learned that he could count on the sleepers hed wondered would they fight these ancient ones but in fact they were doing well ancient they might be considered from their birthdates but frozen sleep was hard on the aged the survivors had been eight to sixteen years past sexual maturity they had run the ship for four years before their bodies had been frozen they knew its rooms and corridors and storage holds as well as those who had been born aboard permission to report said attackmaster koothfektilrusp go ahead i think weve cleared everything from orbit herdmaster there could be something around the other side of winterhome moving in our own orbit well have to watch for that we find four missiles rising from land mass three shall i send them some bombs no wasteful weve done enough here defensemaster take us out of here out of their range most of the native weapons would barely reach orbit as if they were designed to attack other parts of the planet knowing the launch site was enough it could be destroyed just before the troops went down to test the preys abilities the digit ships could trample lesser centers before they descended destroy dams roads anything that looked like communication or power sources he hoped it would go well his son fookertehs eightcubed of warriors would be in the first assault kturfookeph was much concerned about him though pride would never allow her to admit it follow the plan defensemaster take us behind that great gaudy satellite on a freely falling curve hide us attackmaster i want every preys eyes on that moon stomped blind before we begin the second phase of our acceleration the herdmaster waited for acknowledgments then ordered get me breakertwo breakertwo had been a profession without an object until now takpusseh had been chosen young he was only entering middle age if one excluded the decades he had spent in frozen sleep and the years worth of damage that had done he had been trained to deal with aliens since before the starship ever left home yet his training was almost entirely theoretical almost there had been another intelligent race on takpussehs homeworld the predecessors had died out before takpussehs race developed gripping appendages and large brains they were the domain of fistartehthuktun the historianpriest not of takpusseh fistartehthuktun was a sleeper since the awakening he had become more stiff and formal more withdrawn than ever his spaceborn apprentices spoke only to him his knowledge of the thuktunthp would be valuable here perhaps breakerone raztupispminz with the authority of a spaceborn and a tact that was all his own could draw him out the sleepers knew in their hindbrains and spines and in their very cells how to live on planets what planets were like the spaceborn could only guess and yet more was at stake than this artificial division of the traveler herd the sleepers would die one by one eventually and the traveler herd would be one fithp again the fithp needed what fistartehthuktun knew the stored knowledge of that older now alien species before they received the first pictures broadcast by the prey the question had been debated endlessly would winterhomes natives resemble the predecessors or the fithp they did not breakertwo watched the surviving locals through a oneway transparency while his assistant and a pair of soldiers worked with the alien artifacts they look so fragile he said the ship shuddered theyve hit us again one of the soldiers said fragile they may be but theyre fighting back they do fight some were dead and some surrendered their plight was hopeless said the octuple leader yet one fired a weapon through its life support system it killed itself to kill two of my warriors your explanation do you forget your place your pardon shall i request that your superiors ask you shall i call the herdmaster and request that he tell you to answer my questions wish you to continue this i dont know it killed itself to kill two warriors surrender would have been easy i i have no explanation breaker this is your own task have you a theory octuple leader mad with battle lust or sick dying it happens his digits knotted and relaxed knotted relaxed i should be fighting it happens fumf the spaceborn know only what they have read and studied yet they these thoughts were useless if youre needed youll be summoned breakertwo takpusseh told him i need you now you were aboard the ruined space habitat i will have questions ask breaker takpusseh hadnt yet learned enough to ask intelligent questions what did we take octuple leader pretheeteh pretheetehdamb sir we took out quite a lot of stuff there wasnt room for it all in here alien voices from the restraint room formed a muted background takpusseh half listened while he meandered through the loot pretheetehdambs troops had moored to walls for fifteen years he had studied the alien speech that crossed on radio waves between winterhome and the ringed giant sometimes there had been pictures strange pictures of a herd that could not exist boxes that danced with legs bipeds that changed shape and form streams of very similar paintings arriving within tiny fractions of a second contrasts cities with tall buildings and machines cities of mud huts and straw roofs reception was terrible and some of what could be resolved was madness such information was suspect contaminated contained falsehoods better to trust what one learned directly one fact stood out most of the broadcasts had been in one language takpusseh was hearing that language now but he was hearing another too the prisoners were of two or more herds for the moment that hardly mattered but it would it would add interest to a task that was already about as interesting as a fi could stand there were big metal bins filled with smaller packages each bearing a scrawled label found frozen piles of cloth too thin to be armor protection from cold alienlooking machines with labels scrawled on them from food preparation area computer part of waste recycling system projectile weapon corpses bloated by vacuum had been stuffed into one great pressure package half frozen during the crossing and stuck together breakertwo takpusseh pulled the package open and ignoring a queasy tremor in his digestive system let his eyes rest on an alien head this body had been ripped half apart by projectiles takpusseh noted sense organs clustered around a mouth filled with evillooking teeth and a protruding flap of muscle two bulging vulnerablelooking eyes the nose was a useless knob the paired nostrils might as well have been flat to the face but the array was familiar they werent that peculiar bilateral symmetry he reached to pick up a partially thawed foreleg and found five digits reinforced with bone the aliens used those modified forefeet for making and using tools they certainly didnt use that bumpwithholes for anything but smelling all known from pictures but this was different the weapon it was a tiny thing with a small curved handle could this modified foot really hold it aimed and steady this is the weapon it used yes breakertwo that weapon killed two warriors thank you takpusseh moved the digits of an alien forefoot thoughtfully noting how one could cross over the flat surface behind the other four and they all curved inward he was wasting time first priority is to get their food separated out theyre bound to need water theyre certainly wet inside then autopsies lets get some idea whats inside them pretheetehdamb did you put these things in pressure containers after they had been subjected to vacuum breaker they were bound to suffer some damage during an assault i suppose you could have come along to guard them takpusseh was stung you suppose wrongly the herdmaster refused me permission because he was too valuable or because a sleeper was untrustworthy who could know again he looked through oneway glass at the prisoners weve watched their ships take off chemicals hydrogen and oxygen energetic and difficult to handle but still chemical fuels the expense must be formidable we must assume that these prisoners are the best they breed else they would not be worth the cost of lifting them his assistant twitched her ears in assent language first we must make them teachers for future prisoners you say that easily tashayamp it will be difficult it may be impossible with most of our team lost to the military mission breakertwo turned to the stacked cloth from the space station then to cloth that had been cut from the prisoners it was oddly curved it had fastenings in odd places designed to fit an odd shape these stiffened cups for the hind feet were thicker padded takpusseh found nothing that might protect the fragilelooking foreleg digits pretheetehdamb did you search this detritus for weapons yes there were none not even a bludgeon the prisoners were all covered with cloth werent they they were so were the corpses it isnt a rank symbol and it doesnt hold personal weapons they were in a space habitat theyd regulate the temperature could they be so fragile i think we had better give them cloth to protect their skins he looked back into the padded room could the cloth be used for humidity regulation if they didnt exude enough moisture to be comfortable well that would be tested hunch prodded him to add and get the cloth off the corpses tashayamp start with this one the herdmaster for you breakertwo takpusseh took the call the herdmaster looked tired in the fashion of those whom exhaustion turns nasty show them to me breakertwo takpusseh turned the camera toward the oneway glass wall the herdmaster was silent for two or three breaths then and these you must integrate into the traveler herd i dont envy you breakertwo what do you know so far their skins are fragile they need cloth for protection will they survive one seems near death and it isnt the legless one that one seems active enough as for the rest ill have to be careful we have their stored food thanks to the troops though we will have to identify it how soon can i expect when i tell you so you have heard the sounds they make they will never speak well another matter we do not have a representative sampling here that may be to the good they may be more easily taught than their dirtyfoot kin takpusseh glanced at the smallest of the halffrozen corpses now denuded of cloth eyes protruding mouth wide open distress frozen in its face the protected area between the legs his guess had been right the genitalia were oddly placed he tried to imagine how they might mate but this was a female the breasts confirmed it our survivors are all adult males before we can understand anything about the natives we will need to study females children the crippled the insane the merely adequate do what you can breaker we wont be able to furnish you with other prisoners for some days yet unless you would prefer to stay behind with the digit ships takpussehs ears flattened against his head had he just been named a coward at your orders herdmaster i wasnt serious and neither are you youre needed here sixtyfour of us are needed here herdmaster youve taken all but three of us for the digit ships and you expect they must be near the battle to advise our warriors regarding the preys mentality and to learn do what you must the herdmasters face faded the prisoners were not very active now the one who spoke a known language was prowling exploring the restraint room the rest were talking in their own gibberish they must belong to land mass one the largest land block and not to the herd that was so free with their radio noise all but the prowler and possibly the darkskinned one who might almost have been dead might that be a disease a lethal skin condition could the rest catch it leaving the breakers without a profession again one more thing to worry about he assumed and would continue to assume that breakerone raztupispminz was listening via intercom they would talk later meanwhile pretheetehdamb your attention takpusseh pointed through the oneway transparency of the wall that one hes talking now do you see his mouth moving i see take your octuple and fetch him to me breakertwo i would have no trouble fetching it myself save for fear of crushing it by accident take your octuple takpusseh felt no need to justify himself they were an unknown best to be wary at worst the show of strength might impress the aliens they did look fragile fragile enough to make him queasy he couldnt afford to think that way he was breakertwo and these alien beings constituted the only career open to him we must come to know each other well without you im nothing the door was square ten feet by ten feet or thereabouts and padded when wes pounded on it with his fist he got a peculiar echo not quite like metal foamed metal thick like the door on a bank vault what do they think we are the hulk could they have picked up some saturdaymorning tv it opened inward he remembered but no hinges were in sight and no handle maybe the invaders had prepared this cell before they knew what humans would be like maybe it was built for invader felons or mental cases whatever we wont get out of here with just muscle clack the door jumped under his hand wes kicked himself away as it swung open what showed first were pale brown tentacles gripping a bayoneted rifle the invader entered behind the blade slowly its wary eyes on the cloud of drifting humans it looked wes found himself grinning he let it spread it wouldnt know what a grin meant the invader looked like a baby elephant the tentacle was an extended nose a trunk it branched halfway down with a nostril in the branch and branched again near the tip and again eight digits base eight straps of brown leather wove a cage around it with a flap of cloth between the legs and a pouch behind the head wes struck the wall opposite the door and managed to absorb most of the recoil another baby elephant with two trunks entered similarly dressed similarly armed they took positions against the bulkhead to each side of the door their claws sank easily into the thick dampened padding their weapons were aimed into the room not at anyone but ready a third unarmed stayed in the doorway the cell was getting crowded giorge was finally showing signs of life staring walleyed making feeble pushing gestures at the air arvid pulled the black man behind him the recoil drifted him into the first invader it skillfully turned the rifle before rogachev could impale himself then gently thrust him away with the butt the invader in the doorway held dawsons attention this one wore straps dyed scarlet and a backpouch patterned in green and gold its feet were clawed not really elephantlike except for the size the tail was paddleshaped the head was big the face impressive grooves of muscle along the main trunk focused attention on the eyes black irises surrounded by gray looking straight at wes dawson it pushed itself into the cell it was coming for him wes waited he saw no point in trying to escape the jump was skillfully done the invader landed feetfirst against the wall just next to wes wrapped its trunk around wess torso jumped on the recoil thrust him through the doorway ahead of itself and barely brushed the doorway as it came through behind it would have crushed wes against the corridor wall if its claws hadnt closed on the doorjamb wes was near strangling he pulled at the branches around his neck then slapped thrice at the joint with the flat of his hand would it understand yes the constriction eased five more invaders waited in the corridor three moved off to the left wess captor followed and the others followed him they must think were hot stuff he thought maybe we really are hurting them or maybe just how many are they that they can spare eight behemoths to collect one fragile man where are they taking me dissection but with so many around him there was surely no point in struggling they were floating down the curved corridor a sound like a ramshorn blared through the ship dawsons guards moved quickly to one of the corridor walls their claws sank into the thick damp matting that lined the passageway what a warning there was nothing to hold on to it hardly mattered the tentacles held him tightly the air vibrated with a supersonic hum what had been a wall became a floor after a few moments the baby elephants seemed to have adjusted and released their grip they moved off down the corridor surrounding him but letting him walk they were staring how must it look to them a continual toppling controlled fall they pushed him through a large door at the end of the corridor one followed the others waited outside a single invader waited behind a table tilted like a draftsmans table it stared at him dawson stared back how long does this go on i am congressman wesley dawson representing the united states of america i am takpusseh my god they speak english why have i been treated this way i do not comprehend the creatures voice was flat full of sibilants without emotions a leaking balloon might have spoken that way you attacked us without warning you killed our women here was a chance to protest finally a target for his pain and it was just too much wes leaned across the tilted table his voice became a scream there was no need we welcomed you we came up to meet you there was no need i do not always understand what you say speak slowly and carefully it felt like a blow to the face wes stopped then started over fully in control shaping each word separately we wanted to welcome you we wanted to greet visitors from another star we wanted to be friends the alien stared at wes you will learn to speak with us yes certainly it will be all right now it is a misunderstanding it must be when i learn to talk with them our families will be concerned about us have you told earth that we are alive i do not comprehend do you talk to earth to our planet ah our word for earth is a peculiar sound short and hissing we do not know how to tell your people that you live why do you lock us up he didnt get that maybe why is too abstract the door to our room leave it open the alien stared at wes then looked toward a lens on the wall then it stared at wes again finally it said we have cloth for you can you want that cloth wes became aware that he was naked yes we need clothing covering you will have that you will have water food dawson said yes eat the alien gestured one of the others brought in boxes from another compartment clothes canned goods oxygen bottles a spray can of deodorant whose soap twelve cans of spam with a london label a canned smithfield ham the russians must have brought that wes pointed to what he thought was edible then he took a spam can and pantomimed opening it with his forefinger tying to indicate that he needed a can opener one of the aliens drew a bayonet and opened the smithfield ham by cutting the top off four digits for the can four for the bayonet he passed the can to wes stronger than hell advanced metals too but you wouldnt make a starship out of cast iron okay now what do you eat that the alien behind the draftsmans table asked the interrogative was obvious yes it was hard to interpret the aliens response it lifted the ears the other the one that brought the packages responded the same way vegetarians are they disgusted the alien spoke gibberish and another alien came in with a large sheet of what might have been waxed paper it took the ham from the can wrapped it and gave it to wes it left carrying the can you attack you fight us there is no need there is need your people is strong the alien said a flat screen on one wall lighted to show another alien a voice came into the room it babbled in the liquid sibilants wes had heard them use before you must go back now we turn now it didnt make sense if we were weak would you fight us go but what do you want where do you come from why are you here why is it important that we are strung the alien stared again go i have to know why are you here the alien spoke in sibilants tentacles wrapped around his waist and encircled his throat he was dragged from the room as they went down the corridor the ramshorn sound came again and the aliens held him against the wall you dont have to hold me wes said there was no response the alien soldier carried a warm smell something like being in a zoo it wouldnt have been unpleasant but there was too much of it this close how many of them speak english he it said i should learn their language theyll try to teach me he looked down at himself naked wrapped in tentacles think like them theyre not crazy assume theyre not crazy just different differences in shape and evolution and senses what do i smell like to this soldier pulled right up against its nostrils like this it held him like a nest of snakes and its blackandgray eyes were unreadable you knew the job was dangerous the morning after now a is done that men can do and a is done in vain robert burns it was a for our rightfu king countdown h plus seven hours son of a bitch sergeant ben mailey shepherded his charges off the helicopter and watched them climb into the staff car the president son of a bitch he grinned widely then sobered it took a war to get the president inside and im not going in with him jenny ushered the president into the command center she had enjoyed her previous trip inside maps and screens showed what was going on across the nation you could see everything at a glance a dozen army and air force officers sat at consoles large screens flashed with maps of the united states aircraft in flight major trains and larger ships showed up as blobs of light on the maps but there werent many lights and many of the harbors showed dark splotches rail centers like omaha had pinpoint dark spots as well jack clybourne followed them into the cavernous room he looked puzzled and jenny felt sorry for him there was no real need for a presidential bodyguard not here in the national command center his job was done the moment they got the president into the hole but nobody had thought to tell him that and i sure wont admiral carrell stood to attention as the president entered so did the mustached civilian whod been seated with him admiral carrell wore a dark civilian suit but he looked very much an officer glad to see you sir thank you he sounds a million years old and i feel older i look like a witch she felt giddy and suppressed an insane desire to giggle suppose admiral carrell inspects my uniform with wrinkles and unbuttoned buttons and and im drunk on fatigue poisons we all are i wonder when the admiral slept last the cabinet will be coming later coffey said that is state and interior will be were dispersing some of the others so that i dont really know the aliens capabilities admiral carrell nodded they may know the location of this place he said could they do anything if they did know yes sir they hit boulder dam with something large and fast no radioactive fallout as my threat team keeps telling me theyre throwing rocks at us meteorites they have lasers that chew through ships mr president i dont know what they could do to cheyenne mountain they they they jenny thought our enemy has no name lets hope we dont find out then what is the situation what about the russians theyve been hit badly but theyre still fighting i dont know what forces they have left admiral carrell shook his head were having the devil of a time getting reports we used up half our icbms last night firing them straight up and detonating in orbit the aliens got half of what was left they seem to have targeted dams rail centers harbors and anyplace that launched a missile i presume they did the same to the soviets but we cant know we cant talk to them im able to communicate with dr bondarev intermittently but he doesnt know the status of his forces their internal communications are worse than ours and ours are nearly gone carrell paused a moment and leaned against a computer console hes an old man i never really saw it before and thats scary what about casualties the president demanded military casualties are very light except for f pilots who launched satellite interceptors those were one hundred percent weve lost a number of missile crews too civilian casualties are a little like that very heavy for those living below dams or in harbor areas and almost none outside such areas total carrell shrugged hard to find out id guess about a hundred thousand but it could be twice that a hundred thousand vietnam killed only fifty thousand in ten years nobodys taken losses like that since world war ii why dont you know the president demanded we depend heavily on satellite relays for communications carrell said command control communications intelligence all depended on space but we have no space assets left so we dont know anything know admiral carrell shook his head again no sir we dont know anything i do have some guesses something seems to have driven their large ship away at least it withdrew the soviets attacked it heavily according to bondarev they probably damaged it but if he has any evidence for that he hasnt told me about it jenny cleared her throat yes carrell asked nothing sir we all know about claims if i were a soviet official and id just expended a lot of very expensive missiles im sure id claim it was worthwhile too the president nodded grimly assume it wasnt damaged yes sir carrell said its very hard to track anything through the goop in the upper atmosphere and above for that matter the aliens have dumped many tons of metallic chaff this gives some very strange radar reflections as far as we can tell theyve left behind a number of warships but the big ship withdrew we think they headed for the moon admiral carrells calm broke for a moment god damn them thats our moon have we heard from moon base not ours and the soviets have lost contact with theirs i think theyre gone fifty billion dollars most of our space program damn the president looked older by the minute what do we know about their small ships carrel shrugged they have several dozen of them we say small but the smallest is the size of the enterprise i mean the aircraft carrier we shot some of them out of space i know we got two with a minuteman out of minot air force base then they clobbered minot we think the russians got a couple too none of which explains why they ran away the civilian said mr president this is mr ransom one of my threat team admiral carrell said he and his colleagues are the only experts we have experts yes sir theyre sciencefiction writers who else and the president isnt laughing why did they run away then mr ransom we dont know and we dont like it ransom said back in the red room you can get a dozen opinions curtis and anson are back there trying to get a consensus but i dont think theyll do it the aliens could have their mates and children aboard that main ship they came a long way i see david coffey said he looked around the big control room is there somewhere i can sit down youd do better to get some rest admiral carrell said so should you after you sir someone has to be on duty we might get through to the russians again this time jenny couldnt help laughing when the president and admiral carrell stared at her she giggled then sobered quickly i never thought wed be so eager to hear from the russians carrells smile was forced yes it is ironic however he broke off as red lights flashed and a siren wailed through the enormous room the admiral took a headset from one of the sergeants after a moment he said they havent all left they just hit a major highway junction highway junctions railroad yards dams the president muttered yes admiral carrell agreed but not cities or population centers san diego but not new york harbor cities along major riven are flooded some severely some parts of the country are undamaged but have no electricity others are without power and effectively isolated some places have electric power and are utterly untouched its an odd way to fight a war message bearer hummed the vibration from the main fusion drive was far higher than any normal range of hearing but it shook the bones and it was always there sleepers and spaceborn alike had learned to ignore it during the long days of deceleration into winterhome system it could not be sensed until it was gone it was gone thrust period was over the floor eased from under the herdmaster and he floated six eights of digit ships had been left behind to implement the invasion while message bearer fell outward toward the foot the acceleration the pulses of fusion light and gamma rays had been blocked by the mass of winterhomes moon let winterhomes masters try to detect her an inert speck against the universe the herdmaster blew a fluttering sigh several hours of maneuvers had left him exhausted it was good to be back in freefall even for a few minutes thats over he said now well trample the natives a little and see what they do its their terrain we will lose some warriors fathistehtulks lids drooped in sleepy relaxation and the herdmaster spared him a glare the herdmasters advisor had himself been herdmaster he could have saved the herdmaster this chore spared him for other work except that spaceborn warriors might not take his orders he was a sleeper his accent marked him so he was being unjust but fathistehtulk enjoyed the situation the herdmaster sighed again and turned to the intercom get me breakertwo takpusseh too spoke with the archaic sleeper accent he stood at a desk littered with alien artifacts you have spoken with the prey the herdmaster asked i have spoken with one of them herdmaster this one is of the land mass two herd that babbled to us as we approached some of the others speak that language but they are not part of that herd what have you learned herdmaster i do not know what we learned from that interview certainly that herdless one did not submit the herdmaster was silent for a moment it was helpless herdmaster i sent an armed octuple to fetch it i left it naked and required it to stand before my table it demanded explanations it was abusive yet it lives you show remarkable restraint takpusseh vented a fluttering snort i did not understand all it said at the time it was only after it was sent back to the restraining pen that we listened carefully to the recordings herdmaster these are alien beasts they do not obey properly it will take time to make them a part of the traveler herd perhaps being herdless it is insane were there others of its herd in the satellite yes it said that its mate had been killed in the attack it is insane then kill it herdmaster there is no need for haste it speaks this language the prey call english far better than do the others have the others submitted herdmaster i believe they have the herdless one comes from the continent with the most roads and harbors and dams surely the most advanced herd will not all be insane surely not herdmaster do you have advice herdmaster i believe we should continue the plan trample the prey before we speak with them if they are arrogant in defeat they must be impossible before they are harmed very well will you continue to speak with this one not without new reason i found the interview painful i will speak with it again when we have obtained more of its herd perhaps it will regain its sanity until then breakerone raztupispminz will study the herdless one he chooses not to speak with it the herdmaster twitched his digits against his forelegs takpusseh was being tactful raztupispminz was not fluent in the language of the prey the other prisoners are in my domain but we house them together breakertwo takpusseh finished do any of them submit i have had no opportunity to examine the others while message bearer maneuvers violently instead we have experimented with their living conditions we gave them cloth from the great stores they kept in the orbiting habitat they draped themselves with it we gave them water and watched how much they used and analyzed their excreta we change their environment how do they treat their food which of our foods can they tolerate do they like more oxygen or less warm air or cold to what extent can they tolerate their own exhalations i expect they breathe the air mixture of winterhome of course but where on winterhome equator or poles high altitude or low wet or dry we are learning they like pressure anywhere between sea level and half that they can tolerate our air mix but prefer it dryer they cover their skins with cloth even when far too hot that deceived us for a time they drink and wash with clean water and ignore mud their food is treated they have to wet it and heat it they would not eat ours and in the process of experiment we gave them strong incentive to learn to speak to us the herdmaster laughed a fluttering snort of course they would like to tell you to stop can they speak we have begun to teach them it is easier with those who speak the language called english i see no need to learn the others language the herdless one called dawson can translate until they gain skill at our speech their mouths are not properly formed one day i think there will he a compromise language but they will never be taken for ordinary workers of the traveler herd even in pitch dark the smell is distinctive are they in good condition the darkskinned one is unresponsive and doesnt eat i think he must be dying he too is herdless the other four seem ready for training the other herdless one will die as well perhaps he seems in health we must watch him herdmaster from what region do you intend to take prisoners you have no need to know herdmaster i must know if dawson will have companions of his own herd i must know if he is insane or if all those of his herd act so strangely he is insane the herdmaster said lead me herdmaster perform your task i gave no order thank you herdmaster it is likely that he is insane surely he has never been as far from his herd as he is now but we must know the herdmaster considered very well we will attempt to seize and keep a foothold in land mass two north the source of most of the electromagnetic babble we will take prisoners as many as possible herdmaster i require females and children it would also be well to have immature and aged cripples insane i have other priorities but the warriers will be told how shall we identify the insane never mind some will go insane after capture anything else i would like to show the prisoners some records good where the communal mudroom my officers and their mates are clamoring to see the natives im not sure theyre ready for lead me we will display them but not in the mudroom use the classroom theyll have to get used to us sooner or later and my fithp must get used to them well be starting spin immediately you can put your show on afterward will you show them the podo thuktun no theyre not ready they wouldnt know what it means fistartehthuktun would stomp me flat the herdmaster disconnected fathistehtulk who had not spoken during the exchange said takpusseh was a good choice many sleepers have lapsed into lethargy since the awakening takpusseh has kept his enthusiasm his sense of wonder yes why has he no mate he is of the age and his status is adequate though as a sleeper he lost rank of course his mate did not survive the deathsleep ah the herdmaster pondered advise me shall i expect these prisoners to develop into cooperating workers can they persuade their race to surrender without undue bloodshed you know my opinion the herdmasters advisor said we dont need this world or its masters we are not dirtyfeet we should be colonizing space not inhabited worlds dirtyfeet only sleepers used that term for those who had remained comfortably behind on the homeworld the spaceborn felt no need to insult ancestors who were forever removed in space and time never mind fathistehtulk had raised another problem odd that a spaceborn should hear this from a sleeper you know my opinion too we came to conquer winterhome regulations require that i consult you as to methods do you intend that our prisoners shall not learn of the foot the herdmaster frowned it is standard procedure a fluttering snort answered him of course a soldier should never know more than he must for he might be captured and accepted into the enemys herd but how could the forces of winterhome rescue our prisoners without taking message bearer herself in which case all is already lost i suppose so very well wait please herdmaster my advice well your judgment was right tell them what they must know tell them that they must submit and show them that we can force them to obey then let them speak to their people but we must not depend upon their aid breaking them into the traveler herd is the task of the breakers takpusseh and raztupispminz are conscientious even so dont let them know all they are alien the kawasaki was an ltd twin with a belt drive an model which harry had bought at the yearend sale in he had saddlebags for it and a carry rack for his guitar two weeks ago he had borrowed arline motts pickup truck and taken the engine in he was driving the same pickup truck now and he felt guilty about it hed telephoned arline at am before shed been up or able to listen to the radio ill have it back by noon hed said since arline didnt get up before noon that wouldnt be a problem shed put the key outside her door and gone back to bed she ought to be getting the hell out of los angeles if id told her harry thought but if i didnt call her who would and shed be in bed until noon anyway so all i have to do is get the damn truck back to her he pulled into a station there were three cars ahead of him he filled the truck then filled two gas cans arline kept in the back least i can do for her gas was still being sold at the pump prices that couldnt last he drove north along van nuys boulevard the tools and all of the kawasaki except the engine were in the back it was still in pieces a glance at road and track specialties which specialized in racing motorcycles sent him off on a daydream he really ought to steal one of those it would get him there faster and more dependably if he didnt get himself arrested and certainly the emergency justified it he drove past without slowing and on to van nuys hondakawasaki his walk slowed as he passed through the salesroom his money hadnt stretched far enough he needed a new fender spare brake and clutch levers a fairing jesus that vetter windjammer fairing was nice i could use the emergency thousand that wes keeps only that wouldnt work that thousand belonged to carlotta and harry intended to take it to her not all but as much as possible no vetter fairing then just tiedown straps and paper bags to put his hands in he stepped up to the counter next to a bulky younger man hairy red the man said harry almost recognized him the name wouldnt surface how they hanging this is the day nobody knows that harry said did you see the light show damn right im getting out im headed east i could use a partner north looks safer the half stranger said harry nodded he agreed when a clerk appeared he paid the rest of what he owed out of wes dawsons thousand he paid for the engine repairs and restrained the urge to buy anything he might need money more he brought truck and engine to the parking lot across the alley from the motorcycle shop the transistor radio was telling the world that there had been a horrible mistake the aliens had attacked certain parts of the united states and the rest of the world but now they were going away the delegation that had been aboard the soviet kosmograd had been taken aboard by the aliens negotiations were proceeding citizens should remain calm anyone who could go to work should do that conserve electricity and water dont waste anything there would be inconveniences expect rationing soon that was one station on another the announcer was hysterical the martians had landed in new jersey the one thing that every station announced was that all military and police personnel were to report for duty immediately harry began to work an hour later he had some appreciation of what hed lost harry felt the urgency and the certain knowledge that hurrying was a mistake his vertebrae dreaming that they had become solid bone woke to grating agony as he lifted and twisted and crouched and crawled he worked muscles that had forgotten their function they protested and were ignored he worked as he had to letting details fill his mind from edge to edge it was like the calm from being ripped on marijuana or from transcendental meditation he had read zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance long ago it was killing labor and harry was drenched with sweat he was old old but the kawasaki was a motorcycle again this would be a hellish shakedown tour for a newly mounted engine harry smoked while the crankcase drained onto the weeds he refilled it with a very light oil he started the engine and let it run for the life span of a cigarette he drained the engine again and refilled it with a heavier oil puffing he began to pack the kawasaki the sleeping bag went on the rack it would normally carry his guitar but not this trip hed already turned that over to lucy mott for safekeeping he ran his spare cables alongside the working cables ready to be attached in an instant he reached into the fuel tanks widemouthed fill was there anyone to see to attach the gold peso and the dimes carlotta dawsons auto went under the seat with two clips the beretta was in his jacket pocket a onequart botta bag was more convenient than a canteen for drinking while riding hed want to fill it before he left what had he forgotten he had spare belts highspeed belts built for industry which fit the cycle and cost a quarter as much as storebought he checked everything spare oil ratchet set screwdriver set four wrenches electrical tape spare fuses a can of hydraulic oil for the brakes tubing cut to fit spare clothing in a plastic garbage bag the binoculars finally he buckled on the wide kidney belt it reduced his stomach by inches and made him feel ten years younger he went to the head shop next door for cigarettes there was only one clerk and harry was surprised to see her ruby yeah man hows it harry i thought youd be in the mountains by now harry said she looked puzzled aliens space war lights in the sky she laughed what you need harry two cartons of pall mall no filter ruby you told me about it she got out the cigarettes harry handed her money and she gave him back change no premium price told you about what what i said space war she laughed again i thought i remembered calling somebody was that you she laughed some more wow that colombian stuff is strong harry i really thought it was real he was still shaking his head when he got outside it was tough loading the kawasaki into the truck but he got help from the guys in the shop got to return the truck he told himself got to fifteen hundred miles near enough wish i didnt have to take the truck back ought to get started hell its only five miles to arlines place damn near on the way lets get it done if hed been in a car hed never have made it all the highways out of los angeles were jammed cars all over the road cars stalled on the wrong side of the road people driving on the left side anything to get out and then the first wrecks and the endless fields of cars behind them many were piled high with clutter baby cribs footlockers a typewriter blankets toys any damned thing you could think of lashed on top of the cars one kingsize mattress on top of a car full of kids there werent many police and where there were any they were turning people back harry had to take out dawsons letter a dozen times until he was good with the spiel im congressman wes dawsons assistant harry would say hes aboard the alien ship i have to look after his wife one of the national guardsmen even said sir to harry after hed seen the letter heard much sergeant no sir they hit hoover dam we know that much seem to have hit a lot of dams and power plants and railroad yards nobody knows why now theyve gone harry nodded sagely thanks then he couldnt resist carry on sergeant he said and roared off by midafternoon he was through the cajon pass headed east across the mojave desert his back had begun to hurt the dam better ones own duty though imperfect than anothers duty well performed the bhagavad gita countdown h plus hours jeri wilson woke with a start the sun was in the west sinking toward one of the snowcapped peaks that surrounded the twisting mountain road melissa sat quietly in the backseat its after noon jeri said accusingly why did you let me sleep so long you looked like you needed it jeri yawned i guess i did punkin she glanced at the seat beside her then looked down at the floor wheres the map i have it melissa said i was trying to figure out where we are but i cant she handed over the auto club map jeri traced a yellow line along the map im not exactly sure myself she admitted i thought about what you said and decided we didnt want to go through albuquerque hairy red marked a route up into colorado hed have loved it lots of twists and turns good thing you slept through it youd have got carsick so how far is it now about three hundred miles in a straight line but i dont know how far on the road is does daddy really know were coming well sort of does he want us to come i think so jeri said he didnt say no pour me some coffee from the thermos weve got to cross the continental divide this afternoon best we get started jeri coasted down the twisting rocky mountain roads in low gear with the motor turned off scared as stiff as the unpowered power steering the highway was nearly deserted twice she pulled off for huge trucks then used the motor to get back on the road once a corvette shot into her rearview mirror fishtailed as the driver saw her and was still wobbling as it went past melissa stretched out on the backseat didnt wake up the highway began to straighten out as it reached the bottom the great plains stretched infinitely ahead jeri took the car out of gear started the motor to get her brakes and steering back and reached the great plains doing sixty in neutral she waited until shed lost some speed before going into gear it was midafternoon of a cloudless day behind her the rockies receding seemed to grow even larger as the scale came into focus a wall across the west of the world she held her speed at fiftyfive she jumped when she realized melissa was peering over her shoulder melissa said when the gas needle says empty how much gas is left i dont know could be anywhere from none to five theyd be out of gas soon all she could think of was to get as far as she could maybe there would be gasoline at the next station wherever that might be jeris rearview mirror flared like a spotlight in her eyes she slapped the mirror aside and screamed dont look melissa get down on the floor hoping melissa would obey wishing she could do the same braking carefully edging toward the right lane melissa said what wham ears popped the car lurched the rear window crazed and went opaque shed expected it to shatter to lace her head and neck with broken glass the news had spoken of bombs falling on hydroelectric dams railroads major highways george and vicki tateevans had told her how to recognize a thermonuclear bomb flash and how to survive she pulled off the road and waited when you see the whole world turn bright dont look drop to the ground grip your legs put your head between your knees now kiss your ass goodbye behind her a peterbilt tenwheeler that had been charging up on her tail wobbled and tipped over and kept coming on its side leaving a trail of fire as it slid past and finally came to a stop ahead of her atomic bomb melissa said awed stay down i am a man crawled out of the truck shaking his head that really wasnt much of a fire just a streak leading to the truck a few flames under it maybe the truck was out of gas too she waited for the softer wham the second shock wave as air rushed back to fill the vacuum beneath the rising fireball when the station wagon stopped shuddering she pulled around the burning truck and kept going a flaming toadstool lit her way she kept glancing back watching it die she made another six miles before the motor died she hoped they were far enough from the radioactive cloud she hoped it wouldnt rain the old onelung harley had begun sputtering ten miles back now it died gynge let it coast and thought of his alternatives he could probably make it run another couple of hundred miles but the damned thing had been nearly dead last year it wasnt getting younger he could walk there had to be something better up ahead was a rest area gynge let the harleys last momentum take it off the edge of the highway and into the picnic area the highways were deserted at first the cops and national guards were stopping everything gynge had detoured three times around them damn good thing he knew the country after he got into the mountains he left the main roads there werent any cops at all a semi roared past there was a little traffic food trucks come to that in normal times one out of every three trucks carried food people had to eat but there wasnt a hell of a lot except trucks the rest area was empty almost empty not quite he heard sounds at the far end and went to investigate what gynge saw was a tired old man on a picnic table with his pants off and a girdle stretched out beside him bikers called it a kidney belt but it did the same thing any girdle did it held in a sagging gut the old mans gut was a goodsized beer belly he was trying to hug one knee against his chest but his gut blocked the way the man sat up blowing his frame was large gynge saw that he must have been formidable in his time he didnt look formidable now his red beard had gone mostly gray and the hair of his head was following he sat up consulted the book beside him then he stretched his right leg out in front of him bent forward as far as he could manage threw a hand towel around the arch of his foot and pulled on both ends if the man had brought friends they had had plenty of time to appear gynge watched a little longer the redandgrayhaired man switched legs groaning one full day on a motorcycle had done him in harry lay on the picnic table and groaned two whiplash accidents within two weeks would leave their mark for the rest of his life his spine felt like a crystal snake dropped on flagstones he knew well enough that he was overweight that was what the kidney belt was for but it hadnt been enough and his guts were about to fall out all over the picnic table hed bought a book of stretching exercises some of those were supposed to help a bad back it was worth a try but it felt like he was breaking his back rather than mending it he had switched legs before the stranger stepped into view a biker probably he strolled up to harrys bike in no apparent hurry ran his eyes over it then stepped up to harry looming he was all muscles and hair and dirt no prettier than harry felt though younger and in better condition he asked why a towel harry flopped on his back panting he said a towel is the most massively useful thing a traveler can have and that was a stretching exercise because my back is giving me hell see skip it give me the key to the kawasaki help me up the bandit did by the slack of harrys jacket he looked down at the feel of something hard over his heart harrys jacket trailed from his hand and the beretta was in the jacket pocket i hold the key to a door you dont want to open harry said anyone with a grain of sense would have at least stopped to think it over the bandit reacted instantly he batted at the threatening hand and swung a fist at harrys jaw harry fired at once the fist exploded against his jaw and knocked him dizzy his gun hand was knocked aside too harry brought it back and fired twice more walking the pistol up the mans torso he shook his head and looked around fast the gun wasnt very loud it wasnt big either and harry didnt entirely trust a bullet any sign of a companion no the bandit was still on his feet looking startled harry fired twice more reserving one bullet for mistakes now the bandit toppled harry had spent some time finding the campground but it wouldnt be possible to stay he rolled off the table pulled his pants on then his kidney belt he paused to catch his breath and to listen the bandit was still breathing almost snoring harry looked down at him ill do you the best favor i can he said i wont check to make sure youre dead the wounded man said nothing ah well harry walked his bike to the bandits motorcycle there was nearly a gallon of gasoline in it whistling harry disconnected the fuel line and drained the gas into a pickle jar he fished out of the trash when hed put the last drop into the kawasaki he went through the bandits possessions there wasnt much then he mounted the kawasaki and rode away groaning harry was a firm believer in natural selection jeri woke at dawn melissa was awake but huddled in her sleeping bag i never knew deserts could be cold she said i told you jeri said now watch the sleeping bags were head to head with the sierra stove between jeri made two cups of cocoa without poking more than her head and shoulders out of her bag in the halfhour they spent drinking cocoa and eating oatmeal the world warmed jeri put her hat on and made melissa don hers they left their sleeping bags and rolled them with one eye each on the highway below they had moved uphill away from the car into a clump of bushes at the crest with heads above the bushes using binoculars they could see clearly for miles the highway ran straight as a bullets flight broken by a dishshaped crater nine miles to the west the precision of that crater grew scarier the more jeri thought about it it sat precisely on the intersection of two highways they watched for traffic jeris hand kept brushing the hard lump in her purse the walther automatic if she saw a safelooking ride she and melissa could get down to the highway in time to stick out their thumbs she hadnt seen much yet traffic was nearly nonexistent a clump of four motorcycles had passed slowed to examine the stalled car argue then move on west she stayed hidden what will we do melissa asked well think of something jeri told her i may have to pay for a lift hopefully with money she prayed for a policeman but there werent any someone ought to come look at the crater is it radioactive and why here what could aliens possibly care about this far from anywhere from the west came a motorcycle it slowed as it approached the crater jeri wondered if it would turn back it moved out into the desert and circled the lip of the crater big cycle big rider he had some trouble lifting it back onto the road he rested afterward smoking then started up again they watched him come ten minutes later melissa lowered the binoculars and said its harry jeri snorted its hairy red mom lets go down unlikely jeri said wearily but she took the glasses the lone bikers head was a windwhipped froth of red hair and beard that was true enough he kept the bike slow he couldnt be a young man not with the trouble hed had lifting the bike the bike it sure looked like harrys bike hells bells that was harry reddington go jeri said run she sprinted downhill melissa surged past her laughing they reached the bottom well ahead of the biker jeri puffed and got her wind back and screamed harry harreee it didnt look like he would stop harry saw the four bikers coming from a long way off they were on the wrong side his side of the dirt divider he was seeing trouble as he neared them but they veered across the divider and laughing doffed their helmets to him as he passed harry would have liked to return the gesture but he had one hand on the handlebars and one on the gun carlotta hadnt taken because hairy red sure wasnt in shape to defend himself with his fists his belly band was tightened to the last notch and harry felt like he was leaking out from under it beyond the bikers was a station wagon presumed doa beyond the wagon two figures running downhill harry made out a woman and a little girl he didnt have time for emergencies or room for passengers they reached the road they were yelling at him the adult was a goodlooking woman and it was with some regret that he twisted the accelerator harreee oh shit harrys hands clamped the brakes jeri and melissa wilson standing in the road just what he needed your word of honor on record he thought dead or captured by god knows what wes dawson had left his life on earths surface in harry reddingtons care carlotta dawson wasnt the type to survive without help stuck out here with a dead station wagon what were the chances that jeri wilson and her daughter would ever tell anyone that hairy red had driven past them he twisted harder and stopped precisely alongside melissa and smiled at the little girl shit harry reddington climbed from the bike as if afraid hed break and straightened up slowly jeri melissa why arent you at the enclave i have to find my husband oh harry thank god where are you going harry answered slowly he seemed to be doing everything slowly i was staying at congressman dawsons house now his wife is in dighton kansas and he sure cant do anything to take care of her so its up to me well want some cocoa sure but youve got a sierra stove up the hill whats wrong with the car out of gas lets get that cocoa harry accepted jeris hospitality knowing full well what it implied knowing that it was too late three passengers on a motorcycle was going to kill his shock absorbers those bushes at the top id better ride the bike up id hate to lose it harry let the bike coast to a stop it was hot as soon as they stopped moving harry poured a little water onto his bandana and mopped his face getting sunburn to go with the windburn bloody hell were almost there jeri said why are you stopping got to harry said everybody off melissa leaped off from her perch on the gas tank in front of harry jeri climbed off the back every muscle complaining harry slowly got off and set the stand then be tried to bend over backrub time jeri asked cant hurt harry said he pointed to a stream that ran beside the road melissa how about you go fill the canteens doesnt look very clean clean enough harry said pour all the water we have into one canteen and just fill the other from the stream jeri said harry you look like a letter s here bend over the bike and ill work on that harry waited until melissa was gone i dont quite know how to say this hate to be the one to do it but somebodys got to were almost there another ten twelve miles yes thank you i know it was out of your way and it cant be comfortable riding three on a bike its not but that isnt the problem harry said you got across the colorado river the day before the aliens came didnt you yes and all youve seen since is a few towns and that crater harry what are you trying to say i looked on the map that town youre headed for theres a dam just above it he didnt say anything for a moment to let that sink in jeri i goddam near didnt get across the colorado river theres nothing left of the town of needles or bullhead city or anything along the colorado they hit hoover dam with something big when lake mead let go it scoured out everything for two hundred miles i mean everything dams bridges houses boats all gone i had to get a national guard helicopter to take me and the motorcycle across oh yeah so i dont know what were going to find up ahead you got any idea of where dave lived in that town no jeri said he never told me anything about it harry harry its got to be all right sure harry said he couldnt even try to sound sincere one more rise over the top of that little ridge jeri sat uncomfortably among the gear tied to the bike she couldnt stop crying windwhipped the tears ran tickling across her temples and into her hair damn it i dont know anything yet why am i crying at least melissa cant see what should i tell her warn her but the bike lumbered over the top of the ridge a sea of mud lay below the reservoir had been ten miles long and over a mile wide now there was only a thick sluggish ripple at its center a tiny stream with obscenely swollen banks a thick stench rose from the mud they rode slowly feeling that hot wind in their faces smelling ancient lake bed mud there was no need to tell melissa anything she could see the dead lake and must be able to guess what was ahead it used to be we could protect children spare them from horrible sights they always do that in the old novels they rode along the mud banks toward the ruins of the dam at the far end long before they reached the dam there were new smells mingled with the smell of decayed mud and the hot summer everywhere lay the smell of death the town below the dam was gone in the center the destruction was complete as if a bulldozer had come through and removed all the buildings then another came along to spread mud over the foundations farther away from the stream bed was a thin line of partially destroyed houses and debris one house had been torn neatly in half leaving threewalled rooms to stare out over the wreckage below above the debris line nothing was touched people moved among the debris but few ventured down into the muddy bottom area theyve given up looking for survivors she could feel harrys chest and back tighten as they got closer to the ruined town a sheriffs car stood beside a national guard jeep to block the road harry let the bike coast to a stop he had his letter ready to show but it wasnt needed i am mrs david wilson jeri said my husband lives here at spring valley lane the young man in sheriffs uniform looked away so did the guard officer she knew before the sergeant spoke you can see where spring valley lane was just down there about a mile the sergeant said he pointed at the center of the mud flat maybe he wasnt home melissa said maybe it happened about two in the morning the sergeant said maybe five minutes after they blasted the russian space station warning didnt help anyway the deputy sheriff said they did something that knocked out the phone system at the same time the only way we could warn anybody downstream was to try to drive faster than the water that wasnt good enough how bad was it harry asked bad the guard officer said the whole great plains reservoir system everything along the arkansas river is gone theres flooding all the way to little rock and beyond he drew harry aside but jeri could make out what he was saying theres a temporary morgue in the schoolhouse three miles east of here the officer was telling harry some bodies still there the bestlooking ones weve had to bury a couple of hundred maybe more theyve got a list of all they could identify thanks i guess we better go there anyplace i can get some gas the officer laughed the wallet held two pictures of jeri and one of melissa jeri stared at her own face distorted by the tears that kept welling in her eyes my pictures i think he would have been glad to see me the drivers license was soaked but the name was readable thats his jeri said the thinly bearded young man in dirty whites made notes on a clipboard david j wilson of reseda california he said next of kin mrs geraldine wilson he went on interminably he took davids wallet and went through that noting down everything inside it finally he handed her a shoe box it contained the wallet a wristwatch and a wedding ring sign here please she carried the box out into the bright colorado sunshine my god what am i going to do now there was no sign of harry or melissa she sat down on a bench by the school what do they want why are they doing this why mom jeri didnt want to look at her daughter harry told me mom melissa sat beside her on the bench after a moment jeri opened her arms and they held each other we have to go melissa said go with harry are we where are we going with harry dighton kansas harry said from behind her and we got to be starting right now miz w were on the wrong side of the river and there arent any bridges downstream at least as far as dodge city we have to go upstream and cross above where the reservoir was its maybe two hundred miles the way weve got to go we need to get started jeri shook her head what i dont know anyone in kansas no maam and i dont either except mrs dawson harry snorted it was easy to tell what he was thinking harry red had no woman of his own just other peoples widows harry you dont want us on your bike i sure dont he said whats that got to do with anything melissa stood and pulled her by the hand come on mom we dont want to stay here i might meet davids friends find out how he spent his last months thats morbid and youll more likely meet his new cookie or was she with him did the earth move for you sweetheart all right lets go then harry i thought you were out of gas he used his letter melissa said talked the highway patrolman into a full tank for the motorcycle should get us there harry said he led the way around the corner the bike stood there it didnt look in very good shape it looked overloaded even with no one on it even loaded down with three should harry climbed aboard groaning slightly he looked a little better the monstrous belly was tighter and his back wasnt quite so thoroughly bent anyplace you want to go first he asked jeri shook her head they she took melissas hand they buried over a hundred in a common grave i dont want to see that me neither mom melissa hopped onto the bike in front of harry the young are so damned resilient i guess they have to be especially now jeri crammed the shoe box into the saddlebag and climbed on behind harry all right im ready she didnt look back as they drove out of the town the wheat fields when even lovers find their peace at last and earth is but a star that once had shone james elroy flecker prologue to the golden journey to samarkand countdown h plus hours they were through the last of the foothills and into the rolling prairies of kansas a land of straight roads and small towns wheat and cornfields made the landscape monotonous whenever they stopped the hot winds and bright sunshine drove them back into motion again conversation was impossible over the noise of the motorcycle the radio had nothing to say harry drove mindlessly trying not to think of his back and the cramps in his legs fantasies came easily jeris a right pretty woman and shes all alone dont know what shell do in kansas maybe there wouldnt be enough rooms theyd have to share a room and a bed and the first night he could just hold her and part of his mind knew better but the thoughts were more pleasant than his back pains dighton kansas was forty miles ahead the engine sputtered and harry switched to the reserve tank theyd just make it with a dozen miles to spare good enough thought harry good enough there was a smaller city four miles away logan kansas nothing to stop there for there was a bright flash ahead and to the left holy shit harry shouted he clamped the brakes skidding the bike to a halt off off and down hed heard george and vickis lectures too jeri and melissa threw themselves into the ditch alongside the road harry laid the motorcycle down he found hed been counting it was nearly a minute before thunder rolled over them there wasnt any shock wave ten twelve miles harry said we were closer to the other one melissa said she was trying to look brave and calm but she was having trouble forgetting that she was a tenyearold girl whod been protected all her life there were more rumblings a series of sonic booms and the sky was full of sound what in hell is worth bombing here harry asked jeri sat up she shook her head i dont harry she pointed up something dartshaped crossed the sky high up glowing orange at the nose and leaving a wavery vapor trail what is that harry shook his head the fading vapor trail curled and twisted winds did that in the high stratosphere russian not like any american plane i ever saw they looked at each other in wonder naw harry said it couldnt be the craft was already too small to see until it began blinking pulsing in harsh blue pinpoints of light like the lights harry had seen that first night dust motes were drifting out of the vapor trail another ship crossed the bright sky and another on skewed paths dust sifted from the vapor trails the motes left by the first ship were growing larger becoming distinct dots harry watched with his knees in ditch water a fourth ship and the first two were pulsing now pulling away they must be much larger than they seemed thirty miles up or more they had to be that high given what they were doing they were streaking through the high atmosphere at nearorbital speed dropping clouds of dots then accelerating free of earth so dots the fourth ship wasnt pulsing it was turning banking in a wide arc the dots had become falling soap bubbles and the lowest of them were breaking open hatching hatching winged things paratroopers melissa said her voice held wonder mom theyre invading at nearly sixtyfour makasrupkithp of altitude the troposphere tore at the hull blasting the digit ship with flame its mass seemed no more protection than the transparent bag around octuple leader chintithpitmang the planet was all of his environment vast beyond imagination and dreadfully close he was one in eight rows of sixtyfour bubbles each and each flaccid bubble held a fi his face hidden by an oxygen mask he was first in his line with the transparent door just a srupk from his face they were holding up well why not the lowest ranks were all sleepers a planet was nothing new to a sleeper this must be like homecoming to them as for the spaceborn the octuple leaders and higher ranks how could they let the sleepers see their fear and yet aft is raw chaos a roiling white fog of vapor trail but look down where greens and blues and browns sweep beneath here the patterns are equally random for worlds happen by accident and there is no sign of mind imposing order layers of curdled water vapor almost make patterns they seem more real more solid than the land the snaky curve of yonder river holds more water than is stored in all of message bearer any one in that line of mountains theyd crossed a few breaths ago would outmass the foot itself octuples you disembark now octuple leader chintithpitmangs breathing became shallow fast he had been born in the year that thuktun flishithy rounded this worlds primary star the year zero herd had all been born within a couple of eightdays of each other naturally and that age group was closer than most one and all males and females they were dissidents they had no use for worlds chintithpitmang fiercely resented the herdmasters splitting of the year zero herd he did not want to be here the aft door cracked air hissed away the bubbles grew taut the door folded outward while the chamber filled with a thin singing troposphere ripping at the digit ship a line of bubbles streamed out sixtyfour fithp falling above the fluffy cloudscape another stream of bubbles followed them then the octuple leader was first in line of course falling meant nothing to chintithpitmang it was the buffeting that held him in terror the survival bubbles dropped through the troposphere slowing the digit ship shrank to a dot and presently began pulsing accelerating pushing itself back to orbit the buffeting increased thicker air the shape of the land was taking on detail there the crater that was both landmark and first strike beyond the village that was their target chintithpitmang watched the numbers dropping on his altimeter now he opened the zipper air puffed away he crawled out of the fabric and let it fall away into the wind the land was yellow and brown crossed by a white line of road and now was a good time to learn if his flexwing would open it popped out by itself and dragged at the air unfolding as pressurized gas filled the struts his senses spun as blood tried to settle into his feet the landing shoe on a hind foot had been jerked almost loose he bent his head and stretched to adjust it his digits would just reach that far the shoes prisoned his toes big clumsy platforms of foamed material that would flatten on impact so that the bones of his feet would not likewise flatten he looked for other flexwings the colors of his octuple were rose and black and green he found six others and steered toward them one missing where the land drifted he steered above the road that the crater had broken then along the road toward the city six flexwings moved into line behind him still one missing and no way to avoid the ground now the planet was all there was details expanded three dots scrambled from a tiny vehicle to lie by the side of the road he steered toward them they grew larger larger chintithpitmang bellowed and pulled back in his harness to catch more air in his flexwing increasing lift striving desperately to avoid contact with the planet the planet slammed against his feet they stung his landing shoes were smashed flat he stripped them off dropped his flexwing and looked about him big planets were big a line of insectsized flyers converged toward the town ahead those werent parachutes delta wings harry red murmured hang gliders the shapes hanging under the delta wings were not human harry ran to the bike and lifted the seat the government model felt comfortable in his hand and the slide worked with a satisfying click but the secure feeling the big pistol usually gave him was entirely lacking a group of hang gliders broke away from the formation and came toward them they split into two groups one on either side of them melissa peered through the binoculars elephants she said baby elephants jeri grabbed the glasses then she began to laugh she handed the glasses to harry he said that funny eh and looked baby elephants with two trunks drifted out of the sky beneath paper airplanes harry chortled they were wearing tall conspicuous elevator shoes he laughed outright rifles with bayonets were slung over their backs harry stopped laughing two lines of deltawing gliders swept along a hundred yards to either side of them they were sinking fast into the wheat fields a much larger group had drifted over logan lets get the hell out of here harry shouted he raised the bike it wouldnt start laying it on its side in the dirt hadnt been a good idea the smell of gas was strong the electric starter whirred again the engine caught harry turned the bike a deltawing craft glided onto the road half a mile behind them the invader came down hard it freed its weapon then stepped out of the elevator shoes other gliders settled to each side a much larger vehicle swept overhead a flat oval with upwardpointing fins it glided along the road settling slowly until it landed more than a mile away were surrounded jeri sounded tired already defeated lets go harry ordered out in the fields get out there and lay low go on now jeri took melissas hand and dragged her off into the wheat fields they left an obvious trail behind them the wheat stalks were thickly planted and you couldnt move through without knocking some of them down we cant hide maybe they dont want us harry took a fresh grip on the pistol and followed eightcubed leader harpanet kept only the vaguest memories of his fall bubbles had streamed from digit ship number twentysix into a dark blue sky and were instantly lost in immensity far far below a vast rippling white landscape waited for him voices chattered through a background of static voices called his name he didnt answer he might have spoken anytime during the years of preparation hed heard lectures on planetary weather the variations in temperature wind chill factor and the coriolis forces that cause air to whirl with force sufficient to tear dwellings apart a vast worldwide storm accidentally formed beyond the control of fithp the predecessors messages tried to tell us random death in the life support system harpanet had been in the breaker group trying to learn of the prey theyd watched broadcasts that leaked through the target worlds atmosphere i cant make sense of these pictures they dont mean anything the more he knew the more alien they seemed breaker takpusseh could live with his ignorance and wait to learn more to harpanet these are not fithp at all they build tools and they kill and we will never know more others of the spaceborn had had private interviews with fistartehthuktun and later been taken from the lists of winterhomebound soldiers what they told the priest must have resembled his own thoughts i cant stand it the things who will try to kill me are the least of it i fear the air and i fear the land and i cant tolerate the thought of an ocean they were shunned thereafter their mothers never mentioned them again harpanet could have joined the dissidents he had kept his silence he kept it now he couldnt move he couldnt make a sound save for a thin keening like the keening of the air through which he fell the thin skin of the bubble rippled under the atmospheres buffeting the sky grew more inaccessible every second he was late to open his bubble the flexwing popped and the struts began to expand before it was clear harpanet shrieked he was falling toward a rippling white landscape vast in extent and his collapsed bubble was still tangled around his flexwing he clawed his way up the suspension harness and forced his digits under the fabric against the resistance of the inflated struts and pulled the planets white face came up to smash him it was nothing he fell through it without resistance he was still clawing at the bubble fabric and suddenly it was floating loose above him he had to nerve himself to let go of the flexwing and only then did it begin to drag at the air until he was flying it was some time before he recovered enough to look for other flexwings he found a swarm of midges far away away from the sun it is late in the day the planet turns away from the star my warriors are spinward the octuples under his command had steered toward their place on the rim of the great circle on the herdmasters map the circle would converge defenses would be erected digit ships would presently pick them up and return them to the darkness the immensity the security of space a rise of land blocked his view of the other wings undulations of yellow fur streamed beneath him terribly fast and harpanet had seconds in which to learn to fly through his terror came a single memory that lifting the fore edge of the flexwing would cause him to slow and rise he slid back in the harness the wing rose and slowed and hovered and dropped and picked up speed and hurled him against the dirt he rolled the harness rolled with him the flexwing wrapped around him one of the struts hissed in his face as his bayonet punctured it when he finally managed to disentangle himself his radio was dead one knee was twisted so that he could walk on three legs only gravity pulled at him it was an experience he would never want to remember but he was sixtyfours of makasrupkithp to antispinward from his assigned landing point jenny woke with a start a duty sergeant was standing over her he chattered excitedly right now major the admiral wants you in the war room now its an emergency theres an invasion invasion she sat up all right sergeant im coming now major i heard you thank you yes maam she dressed quickly putting on combat fatigues he hadnt said anything about sidearms were at war but surely they werent invading colorado springs when she reached the war room she wasnt so sure admiral carrell still in civilian clothes was in one of the balcony offices overlooking the control room jenny stood outside the door wondering what to do come in major carrell pointed to the big screens below they showed kansas and southern nebraska dotted with red flashes and handdrawn gray squares jenny stared for a moment trying to understand we dont have symbols for a parachute invasion of kansas admiral carrell said so we had to draw them in not that it means much since we dont know all the places theyre landing are all those red marks nuclear strikes jenny asked probably none of them carrell said so far they havent used nukes they havent had to no sir kinetic energy weapons throw big rocks an army lieutenant general bustled in he wore combat fatigues and hed buckled on his pistol youve met general toland carrell said no general major crichton is my assistant whats the score harvey damned if i know thor this doesnt make sense they cant possibly be invading kansas i dont care how goddam big that ship is it cant hold that many troops then what are they doing general toland shook his head carrel said jenny i want you to get those scifi gentry together and get them working you can use the big briefing room get tv monitors set up get maps get coffee get whiskey hell get them prostitutes if thats what they want but get me some explanations harry lay in the wheat field and sweated there was a hot wind and bright sun but hed have sweated in a blizzard he couldnt see the road but he heard a vehicle on it the motor didnt sound like anything harry had ever heard before now there were sounds in the wheat someone something was coming the wheat was too thick to see through his world had shrunk to five yards or less he could just see melissas bright head scarf should have told her to take it off too late now not that we can hide anyway the sounds came closer they were all around him what the fuck do i do the pistol held no comfort for him he wasnt a good shot he remembered a merc whod served in africa telling him about elephants they were hard to stop harder to kill you had to hit them just right a probably wouldnt even bother one not unless he hit a vital spot they arent elephants maybe theyre not as tough and maybe i dont know where the vital spots are he heard jeri scream and then two shots from her walther melissas scarf bounced up then something happened and she disappeared into the wheat there was nothing to shoot at harry leaped to his feet and ran toward the sound as he did he heard something behind him he turned an elephant was charging him another closed in from the side they were wearing hooded coats harry held out the pistol and fired the elephant kept coming a flurry of whips lashed his arm and side spinning him around tearing the pistol from his hand the other elephant came toward him the trunk was built like a catoninetails it held a bayoneted rifle the bayonet was pointed at his throat melissa run jeri screamed harry turned to go to her something lashed around his ankles and whipped them away from him he fell heavily into the wheat field the elephant stood over him bayonet pointed at him the other came and stood with it pshthishftpph harry glared up the elephants repeated their phrase only louder okay goddamm it you got me he stayed where he was rolled half onto his knees give him half a chance and hed once more the aliens shouted then suddenly the trunk swept down and rolled harry onto his back one invader pulled harrys hands out over his head the other reared above him my god theyre going to trample me harry writhed to get away the foot came down on his chest it settled almost gently harry struggled he yanked one hand free and scraped at the foot with his nails tried to push it upward tried to roll the pressure increased there were claws under his jaw and a mass that was crushing his chest the air sighed out of him in a despairing hiss he blacked out fog in his mind memory of a nightmare he was breathing like a bellows harry rolled over in wheat inhuman screaming and bellowing reached his ears sounds like a fire in a zoo oh god jeri harry tried to stand up and made it to one knee the baby elephants were converging on the road harry glimpsed melissa on an invaders back held firmly by a branching trunk jeri was walking stumbling with invaders around her a vehicle waited on the road the size of a large truck but it had no wheels it looked like a huge sled the motor wasnt running they loaded melissa into the vehicle then pushed jeri in behind her others jumped onto the broad platform the vehicle lifted on a cloud of dust an air cushion it sped away they seemed to have forgotten harry entirely he crawled away slowly disturbing the wheat as little as possible what else could he do theyd taken the big gun but they might have left the motorcycle and carlotta still waited unless theyd landed there too by vehicle and on foot the prey fled the village humans on foot were allowed to surrender they had to be taught in many cases they must he knocked down and rolled into position then if they could stand they were allowed to pass but vehicles were considered to be weapons and were treated as such the village had suffered more damage than was needed it grieved chintithpitmang locals dead or torn and still screaming buildings smashed the smell of explosives and of burning the flattened crater where the rock came down were dealing with unknowns better to err on the side of excessive strength by asking those he passed chintithpitmang found the leader of his eightcubed in a large red building with pillars in front siplisteph was surrounded by squarish bundles of printed sheets bound at one edge and gaudily decorated he was leafing through a bundle of print with drawings in it the youthful sleeper seemed relaxed very much at home he looked up dreamily and said its so good to see a sky again his eyes focused on chintithpitmang you come late chintithpitmang said one never reported otherwise we have no casualties siplisteph lifted his digits in response we have lost warriors you are promoted in addition to your octuple you will be deputy leader to your eightsquared were there heavy losses eightcubed leader many within the leadership we have lost an eightcubed leader the leadership they are all spaceborn it would be well not to finish that thought chintithpitmang sleeper winterhome is home to you but how can we find ourselves within this infinite horizon beneath this tremendous sky he could say none of that lead me continue your report i obey eightcubed leader i took two females one was mated to a big male the other their child i took the males surrender and left him siplistephs ears snapped alert the male surrendered he had to be shown but the episode had left a bad taste and chintithpitmang went on talking eightcubed leader i knocked him down and put my foot on him lightly he struggled he fought i pushed harder until he stopped struggling but when i took my foot away he did not move i wonder if i simply killed him this is the breakers problem not ours siplistephs eyes returned to the pictures lead me said chintithpitmang and he went to rejoin his octuple but it bothered him by now the taking of winterhome in falling rocks and disrupted supply chains must have killed close to eight to the sixth of the poor misshapen rogues well that was what war was about but a fi did not kill needlessly did not kill when he could take surrender if the beast was so fragile why did it continue to fight chintithpitmang remembered its rib cage sagging under his foot it thrashed and clawed and finally stopped moving it didnt know how to surrender they didnt know how to surrender bad submission a human being in a prison camp in the hands of his enemies is flesh and shudderingly vulnerable the disciplines that hold men together in the face of fear hunger and danger are not natural stresses equal to and beyond the stress of fear and panic must be laid on men some of these stresses are caied civilization and even the highest of civilizations demands leadership t r fehrenbach this kind of war countdown h plus hours the huilside wall was down and level the door was in the ceiling wes judged that things were likely to remain so for some time there had been an hour or so of acceleration then half an hour of freefall then the ship had begun to spin some days had passed without further change odds were it would take an hour or more to remove the spin spin would hamper the mother ship in a battle earth must he far aft and out of reach nikolai and dmitri talked qialetly nikolai sullen dmitri doing most of the talking wes understood a few words and sympathized nikolai was once again a cripple the aliens had wasted no time they were already teaching their language to the humans wes found this reassuring however the soviets were educated separately and they had expressed disinterest in sharing their lessons with wes he went over them alone whispering alien sounds as he remembered them srupk wes had memorized the term as swank standard trunklength it was just about six feet a makasrupk was five hundred and twelve strunks just about a kilometer wes had sought a word for the trunk there wasnt one a sharp snort snnfp named the nostrils or the upper trunk pa was one branch one finger of a trunk pathp the plural could mean the entire cluster chaytrif meant foot sfaftiss was takpussehs title it meant teacher the other sfaftiss didnt speak and his name was harder raztupispminz the two sfafissthp looked aged but as if they had weathered in different patterns were there two races of invader but they called themselves by the same words chsapt meant move chtaptisk moving chtaptiskfithp meant themselves everyone who had left their home planet the traveler people fi was the word for an alien a syllable chopped short by a kind of hiccup it sounded like a piece of a word and fithp was the entire species as if an individual was not a whole complete thing just as a pa was only one branch of the pathp the trunk herdbeasts takpusseh said tribe not herd but men didnt say herd to mean thinking beings tashayamp was takpussehs assistant dawson thought of her as female the leather or plastic patch on her harness covered a different area further back on her torso he knew he might have the sexes reversed he was not prepared to ask the door opened upward a trapdoor the prisoners looked up waiting takpusseh wes had learned to recognize their teacher or trainer by the loose look of his thick skin and by his eyes which behaved as if the lights were always too bright takpusseh watched while alien soldiers attached a platform at the level of the trapdoor the platform descended smoothly along grooves in the padding of the starboard wall the platform might have held one alien it held wes and arvid with room to spare wes had expected a ladder but a ladder would be useless to these aliens takpusseh and tashayamp and eight armed soldiers waited in the corridor the platform descended again for dmitri and nikolai they had left giorge behind arvid had been hoping for a window there were none the soldiers moved four ahead four behind takpusseh and tashayamp moved forward to join the prisoners they had found a wheeled cart for nikolai arvid took charge of pushing it wes was trying to tell tashayamp that they needed heat to prepare their food arvid ignored that he was trying to get some idea of the mother ships layout the rug was spongy and squishywet the prisoners had not been given shoes doors in the floor opened upward against the corridor wall i believe arvid said in russian that any aperture big enough for one of the aliens would pass two or three of us at once perhaps they will not think to guard small openings that will pass a man dmitri nodded they are surely not built for climbing a wall that could be scaled by a man would be impossible for one of them dmitri nodded again have you seen anything i might have missed dmitri spoke you waited until we were in a corridor and moving before you said any of this i approve but are you certain that our trainers do not speak russian they speak english and do not hide the fact why would they hide a knowledge of russian in any case we must speak sometime perhaps do you think we could use their rifles grooves for the branched trunk were far forward on the barrel and so was the trigger the bore was huge the butt was short and very broad it would not fit against a mans shoulder and it would probably kick him senseless unless youd have to brace it against something a floor a wall a piece of furniture difficult to aim dont do anything at all without word from me what of dawson will he try something foolish i arvid cut it off they had reached their destination the wide doorway would be used when the mother ship was under acceleration the permanently fixed platform elevator next to it would be for use under spin gravity the room below was big and more than a dozen aliens were already present the prisoners descended the soldiers remained above the aliens stared up most of them had their trunks folded up against the top of the heads evidently a resting position the eyelids drooped mournfully the eyes had black pupils fading to smokygray whites they were set wide but not too wide to prohibit binocular vision the thick muscle structure at the base of the trunk formed grooves with the trunk up the eyes focused along the grooves like gunsights their stare was unnerving nikolai was wiretense staring his captors down arvid murmured docile nikolai we docile servants of the new regime await instructions nikolai nodded his eyes dropped he sounded calm enough i saw no air vents the air may be filtered through the carpeting and the rug was wet they like wet feet the room would have held three or four times as many takpusseh spoke rapidly to the assembled aliens then more slowly to the humaqs arvid tried to file the introductions pastempehkeph kturfookeph fathistehtulk chowpeentulk fistartehthuktun koolpooleh paykurtank two smaller aliens were not introduced they stared at the humans and huddled close against larger aliens children then hed have trouble remembering the names it was the array that was important the aliens came in clusters hed be a long time learning their body language but that much was obvious pastempehkeph and kturfookeph with their child were the top of the ladder the chairman or president or admiral the similarity in the last syllable meant they were mated hed learned that much already one would hold title arvid would not lightly assume that it was the male similarly fathistehtalk and chowpeentulk were mated and they stood with the admiml advisors the male was doing all the talking so fistartehthuktun koolpooleh and paykurtank also formed a cluster the extra syllables would mean that fistartehthuktun had a mate he was an old one with wrinkled skin and painedlooking eyes like the teacher takpusseh he wore elaborate harness like tapestry made with silver wire he studied the humans like a judge the pair with him were younger clear eyes smoother skin quick movements nikolai said i thought the top ranks would wear uniforms they all wear those harnesses with the backpacks the colors and patterns could those yes insignia of rank dawson believes that we will not see clothing on any alien with those bulky bodies they will have trouble shedding heat i would not have thought of that the room darkened one wall seemed to disappear and arvid realized that he was in a motion picture theater rogachev recognized the huge invader spacecraft a cylinder about as wide as it was tall the aft rim was spiky with smaller craft and some had not been moored in place yet an arc of worldscape blue and white might have been the earth though arvid could not pick out any detail of landscape a polished sphere nearby a moon no it was drifting slowly takpusseh was talking arvid caught a word here and there and translated freely to watch dont move you see trip to build thuktun flishithy arvid smiled he had thought that was their name for the mother ship and sure enough that was what they were putting together onscreen he watched and didnt move the aliens around him were silent motionless the last of the smaller craft were moved into place in seconds this was timelapse photography a length of stovepipe a little wider than thuktun flishithy drifted in from the edge of the screen and was moored in place behind the ring of smaller craft the shiny sphere was moved into place at the fore end of the mother ship it was bigger than all of the rest of the ship combined a pod perhaps a cluster of sensing instruments reached out on a snakelike arm to peer around it something fell inward from the edge of the picture bright flames of chemical rockets around something rectangular it dwindled to a dot headed straight for the ship put podo thuktun in thuktun flishithy takpusseh said that word thuktun he had thought it meant skill or knowledge butfistartehthuktun a mate for that one had not been named was that particular fi married to the ship all in good time arvid glanced at dawson dawsons eyes were riveted to the screen that left arvid free to covertly observe the aliens five of the fithp showed signs of a lingering illness an illness that left loose skin and woundedlooking eyes it didnt seem to be a matter of age pastempehkeph and kturfookeph were not youths but they hadnt had the sickness either the sick ones tended to cluster they looked to be about the same age the rest varied enormously the admirals advisor and his mate were among the sick ones another sick one was trying to talk to them while a female rather unsubtly tried to prevent it a division among the aliens might be useful wes dawson was watching a planet recede a world colored like earth blue with clotted white frosting he spent no more than a few seconds trying to make out the shapes of continents none were familiar of course not the invader ship had been on camera for only a minute or so the camera that filmed that would have remained behind but thukiun fllsljithy was more than the cylindrical warship that had reached earth a sphere rode the nose a tremendous fragile looking bubble in contrast to the warships spiky armored look fuel supply of course and the ring he was looking aft along thuktun flishithys flank past a massive ring like a broad wedding band watching a sun grow smaller a second sun moved in from offscreen both shrank to bright stars white stars the light not too different from earths own sun hed anticipated that from the color of the lights in his cell the cameras showed a steady white light behind the ring wes sawand wasnt sure he sawthe drive flame go dim and a faint violet tinge emerge from the black background wes dawson wouldnt have noticed a bomb going off in the theater with a fraction of his attention he tried to track what the instructor was saying thuktun flishithy must move very fast before we use the saves something halfway to earthstarearths sunwe begin to slow down this is difficult but the pictures made more sense than the words time onscreen speeded up the drive flame brightened then diedand the background violet glow he thought hed seen wasnt there tiny machines and motesized aliens emerged to dislodge the bubble at the nose the stars wheeled one hundred and eighty degrees around the drive flamed again and dimmed and the stars forward were embedded in violetblackso he hadnt imagined itand thuktun flishithy surged past the abandoned fuel tank and onward the way the film jumped a good deal of it must have been missing perhaps it would have shown too much interior detail wes took it for granted that prisoners would not learn much of the interior detail of thuktun flishithy the next scene was a timelapse view of an ordinary star becoming a bright star and brighter until it virtually exploded in dawsons face he cursed and covered his eyes and immediately opened them again they must have dived within the orbit of mercury somewhere in there the white glow of the drive had brightened and the ships wedding band had vanished dawson hadnt noticed just when it disappeared now he grunted as if hed been kicked in the stomach takpusseh stopped talking and his eyes flicked dawson with the impact of a glare nobody else noticed the camera looked along the mother ships nose while earths sun shrank there were longdistance telescopic photos of mars and jupiter then saturn growing huge the great ship moved among the moons neared the rings still decelerating wes picked out the three classic bands of the ring separating into hundreds of bands as the ship neared the fring roiled and twisted as the ships fusion exhaust washed across it ships departed thuktun flishithy launched aft along rails the cameras didnt follow a telescope picked out something butterfly fragile but not as pretty freezeframe takpusseh pointed and made noises of interrogation voyager dawson said he tried a few words of the invader language we made it my fithp united states of america did it come to garble the instructor tried again to look on us did you know of us the word must be spy no then why to see saturn an anger was building in wes dawson and he didnt understand it they had come in war and killed without warning but hed known that for days what new grievance they had used saturn deep in his heart dawson felt that saturn belonged to earthto mankindto the united states that had explored saturn system to the science establishment and science fiction fandom goddaminit saturn is ours he kept his silence the film started again and jumped theyd skipped something theyd skipped most of what they were doing in saturn system two crescents earth and moon were growing near wedgeshaped markers pointed out the united states and soviet moon bases artifacts in orbit weather satellites soviet devices of unknown purpose the space station question time you know we come takpusseh said then louder time you know we come one sixth part of a year arvid said in english a year is his hands moved a forefinger circling a fist while he spoke alien words circle earth around earthstar you slow to fight you know we come why slow why had earths defenders responded so slowly wes said earth fithp chtaptisk fithp maybe not fight you fight you not fight two is one earth fithp is chtaptisk fithp sooner if earth fithp not fight the last time wes dawson had felt like this he had put his fist into a hells angels mouth just as far as it would go you came to make war only to make war make war yes takpusseh said as if relieved to be understood wes barely felt a large hand closing on his arm above the elbow what can you take move to fithp world what could they possibly hope to steal theyd dropped too much of their craft theyd be lucky to return home themselves earth is world for chtaptisk fithp takpusseh said warriors had come at takpussehs bellow the humans were gone now fathistehtulk helped takpusseh to his feet are you injured my pride hurts worse than my eyeand snnfp dawson surprised me entirely they look so fragile they dont know when to fight and they dont know how to surrender the herdmasters advisor said one would think that would be good news for the invasion but i wonder dawson is mad breakerone raztupispminz said his behavior tells us nothing must we keep him he is a puzzle that needs cracking he speaks english as his native language and we will need that too until the others know the speech of the fithp a srupk or two better they must surrender at once formally raztupispminz stated we should have taught them how and much earlier so that they can teach future prisoners the memory flashed in takpussehs mind it hurt worse than his eye takpusseh realized why he had delayed this crucial step of course youre right breakerone i want to visit the medical section ill meet you afterward above the restraining cell it hurt to breathe but he had to breathe hands were on him probing a stabbing agony in his ribs wes gasped and fought to open his eyes red mist gradually clearing the shapes around him resolved into human faces what happened you attacked the teacher takpusseh i tried to stop you dmitri said do you remember seeing red but his mind must have been working well on some level he hadnt just swung a fist hed lunged forward and reached between the branches of takpussehs trunk closed his fingers hard in takpussehs nostril and pulled back savagely to keep himself moving the teacher screamed his digits had whipped around wess rib cage with his ribs collapsing and the air sighing out of him wes dawson reached along the trunk and slid his thumb under takpussehs thick right eyelidwas he flyingand did his damnedest to twist it off he didnt remember any more why did you do it they never had the least intention of negotiating anything he said they came to take the earth away from us dmitri grushin took dawsons chin in his hand and twisted it to put them eye to eye do not attack them again you would kill us all for nothing for nothing they were quiet for some time then arvid and dmitri began to talk wes with too little russian quickly lost track he was more interested in the pictures in his own mind presently he asked did you notice they threw away half their ship yes arvid said the external fuel tank and the massive looking ring i think it was a modified bussard ramjet explain its a way of reaching the stars fusion drive but you get your fuel by scooping up interstellar hydrogen arvid dismissed that certainly nobody has ever built a bussard ramjet how would you recognize one after they got going they changed something it made a violet glow behind the ship arvid the point is that they threw it away when they got here it was used to cross interstellar space and they dropped it they let it fall back toward the stars theyre serious theyve got no plans to go home i was more interested in watching our captors so they dropped it to save weight of course but well as if your ancestors had burned the mayflower yes they came to stay arvids eyes went to the trapdoor in the ceiling which once again was closed against them did you notice anything else worthy of comment wes pounded a fist on his knee twice they were at saturn when the voyagers went by they spent years there we might have noticed something if saturn wasnt so weird wed have had fifteen years warning it is difficult to put the mushroom cloud back iato the steel casing at least we know this is the mother ship this is all theyve got they did not exceed lightspeed they didnt even come very close wes had been watching for the effect of relativity stars blueshifted ahead and reddened aft it hadnt happened good they cannot expect help but they must be desperate where can they go if we defeat them theyll have to land sometime they must expect to beat us on the ground theyre crazy arvid saw no reason to answer dawson was not of his nation but any cosmonaut knew that from a military standpoint the command of space was priceless the soviet union which had always expected to rule the world had held that position until three days ago yeah well they didnt show much of the inside of the ship they showed only the last leg of their approach to earth they showed the mother ship being refueled but they didnt show where the fuel came from so maybe they scooped methane snow off a moon and refined deuterium and tritium out of it but why didnt they show that theyre hiding something of course something specific of course the trapdoor swung open the platform descended into a wary silence takpusseh was quite alone his right eye was covered with soft white cloth another patch covered his nostril he carried his branched trunk at an odd angle a second fi followed him down the soldiers remained above the breakers faced the humans alone the captives looked harmless enough they were clustered in a corner frightened wary the black one was on his back and trying to roll over he seemed to be just becoming aware of the aliens raztupispminz told them move away from the dark one the humans discussed it instant obedience would have been reassuring but in fact they seemed to be interpreting for each other then they moved away the black one protested and tried to move in the same direction then his eyes fixed on raztupispminz he breathed as if the chamber had lost its air his eyes and mouth opened improbably wide as raztupispminz walked toward him raztupispminz set his foot solidly on the black mans chest he lifted it and backed away you he said and his digits indicated the crippled one come the humans discussed it heatedly then nikolai pulled himself across the floor on his hands dawson had moved without permission he knelt by the black man with his bony digits on the mans throat he spoke to the others in english dead tnkpusseh let it pass rather than interrupt the ceremony roll raztupispminz said and he rotated his digits in a circle nikolai didnt appear to understand raztupispminz forcibly rolled the man onto his back set his foot on the mans chest and stepped away he pointed to another you one by one the soviets submitted to the foot on the chest until only dawson was left then as they had discussed raztupispminz stepped aside and takpusseh came forward the man stood balanced forelegs slightly bent hands open palms outward it came to takpusseh that dawson expected to die it wouldnt bother takpusseh that much if he did he swung his digits with nearly his full strength dawson ducked under it fast and lunged forward takpusseh caught him on the backswing and flung him spinning across the cell and against a wall as the man started to topple takpusseh was there catching him and rolling him on his back the man blinked opened his eyes and mouth wide frozen in fear takpusseh raised his foot over dawsons chest i was almost the last to be thawed awake some of the sleepers were braindamaged they fought or they didnt respond at all most accepted the change it was breakerone raztupispminz who accepted their formal surrender my grandson though older than i discounting the eights of years slept this was nothing new to him his task it was to break me too nonetheless he was uncomfortable because we are related or because afterward must teach him his profession your position wont change grandfather who but you has the training to break alien forms of life to the traveler herd but the traveler herd has changed and you must join it again i roll over on the floor feet in the air trunk splayed vulnerable others watch my spaceborn grandsons foot on my chest there thats over now you must begin to train me his voice dropping for my ears alone to break me i must know something of what we must do i feel it now the foot lightly crushing my chest takpusseh lowered his foot a mere tap would not do this was no token surrender he felt the mans ribs sag before he lifted his foot dawson waited for more but there was no more he rolled side convulsively groaning with the pain of damaged ribs now you belong to the traveler herd takpusseh said in his own speech he saw dawson take it in and relax somewhat dawson moved to join the other prisoners is the black one dead takpusseh asked what killed him the one called dmitri answered in the fithp speech fear you fear foot make dead take him out takpusseh summoned the warriors two came down and moved the black man onto the platform it rose it descended to take the fithp up one by one takpusseh went last farmhouses generally in war the best policy is to take a state intact to ruin it is inferior to this to win one hundied victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill to subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill suntzu the art of war countdown h plus hours larry niven jerry pournelle the house had belonged to carlottas grandmother trujillo had married castro had married de alvarez families whose names were respected when the lowells and cabots were field hands carlottas sister juana had inherited the house she married a man with the unlikely name of david morgan of course dawson wasnt exactly in our conquistador heritage either carlotta lay in the exact center of the big fourposter and tried to count the spots on the ceiling thoughts came unbidden her superb imagination showed her a torn puffball of a corpse dry and brittle falling through vacuum and the savage sunlight of space a dissection table with monstrous shapes around it a carved corpse the parts arrayed on a silver platter surrounded by cooked plants of unearthly shape voices chittering or booming as the banquet began no she leaped from the bed the floor creaked as she scurried across the room to the door the house was old begun as a ranch house before the civil war added to as family required and money enabled it had been built in clumps and not all the additions fitted well together although carlotta rather liked the general effect now it had only four inhabitants carlotta david juana and an ancient housekeeper from xuahaca who called herself lucy juanas children had long moved away and sharon is in peterborough new hampshire will i ever see her again thank god the telephones worked long enough for me to tell her to stay there how could she travel bright sunlight flooded the ball outside her bedroom and when she reached the kitchen the windup clock said it was midafternoon lucy had put away the gin bottle or did i finish it to get to sleep there should be some left in it she went to the cabinet but she felt lucys disapproving stare desayuno senora gracias no por favor solamente cafe and damned right im going to sit on the patio in my housecoat whos going to see me or care if they do the patio was too large when carlotta had visited as a child the gardens were famous through the state pumpkins melons vegetablesall won prizes at county and state fairs now there was a big flagstone patio where the melon patch had been and a field of sweet peas where celery and chard had grown no gardeners plenty of people unemployed but no one wants to raise vegetables for a retired professor and his wife but it does make a nice patio she sat at the big wroughtiron table lucy was setting the coffee down when the thunder began thunder from a clear sky was not unheard of in kansas but this didnt come in claps and die away it rolled in and stayed renewed itself grew louder and faded and grew louder still then brilliant points were drawing straight white lines across the sky sowing clouds of dots that drifted away to west and south lucy whimpered in terror and the need to reassure the older woman kept carlotta calm invasion parachutes what came for wes has come for me but nothing showed directly overhead not here not yet anyway carla a voice spoke from behind her yes juana what is happening the noise had brought her sister outside juana morgan held a small transistor radio that poured out static as she frantically turned the tuning knob this way and that for once you will not look disapprovingly at me in my housecoat in midafternoon vapor trails i think perhaps the professor will know he went to town to buy newspapers juana paused and more gin ah carlotta shrugged and glanced significantly at lucy theyre not coming here she said miles away not to dighton either are you sure juana demanded yes how the hell can i be sure and what could we do about it if they were coming here or to dighton its ten miles to dighton and david has the only damned car david didnt think theyd come either juana said but his national guard colonel wanted to mobilize maybe thats where david is with the guard could be what good is that bunch of old men with worn out equipment wes always voted for bigger appropriations for the guard but nobody was really pushing it lucy perhaps it would be well to get out the candles and the storm lanterns juana said si lucy shuffled away still glancing up at the sky and looking away in fear give her something to do and she bears up well carlotta said she stared at the open work of the tabletop i wish i had something to do so do i carlotta nodded yeah i wouldnt approve of me as a houseguest either its as much your house as mine juana said i havent forgotten how much you and wes loaned us she sat across from carlotta hell get smashed every night if thats what it takes you really loved the guy didnt you yes still do sorry you dont know hes dead no there was another peal of thunder juana shuddered i wish it had happened to me carlotta frowned i mean that it had been david up there instead of wes damn that sounds horrible i meanwell youre really in love with wes its breaking you up id miss david were very comfortable together butwell i wouldnt be like you i hate to see you like this carla you were always the strong one yeah i sure look it dont i oh damn juana damn damn damn what am i going to do juana looked up at the dotfilled skies and shuddered the motorcycle was intact harry looked around furtively no sign of the enemy he lifted the motorcycle and stood it on its stand the saddlebags with his gear had vanished theyd taken them along with jeri and melissa god damn the bastards harry cursed steadily until he had control of himself then he felt ashamed cursing wouldnt change the situation hed lost two women he was supposed to protect the fact that he couldnt have done anything about it didnt help much he felt a lump in his pocket the little beretta was still there they hadnt bothered to search him he thought about that for a moment then began to search the wheat field sure enough a bluegray object was just visible in the wheat the automatic with dirt in the barrel one of the invaders must have flung it aside why the saddlebags then clothes jeris and melissas clothing which means theyll be keeping the girls why take them and not me but there was no answer to that the motorcycle started easily enough it hadnt been damaged at all he heard noises ahead the invaders were still in logan harry cleaned out the barrel while he felt something stir in his guts but then he shook his head it would be pointless the invaders wore body armor his pistol hadnt done him any good at all when there were only a few of them charging into logan to rescue jeri wouldnt do jeri any good she might not even be there any longer he tried to remember the map that part of kansas was laid out in a grid roads at section and range boundaries other roads parallel to them few diagonal roads farmhouses at regular intervals dirt tracks crossed the wheat fields those tended to parallel the main roads too but they led to farmhouses not towns logan was several miles ahead harry gambled that thered be a farm access mad leading north before he came into sight of the invaders he put the pistol into his kidney belt where he could reach it easily and started off east he saw the smoke long before he reached the ruined farmhouse he came up slowly ready to leap off the motorcycle and run into the wheat he stopped several times to listen but there was nothing to hear the dirt road led through the wheat fields to the farmhouse he could go back the way hed come or go on he went on the house itself was a wreck roof sagging doors torn from their hinges but it hadnt burned the barn was burned to ashes the bodies of a man and two dogs lay in the dusty yard between the house and the barn a shotgun lay across the mans chest another dog whimpered from under the wreckage of the farmhouse ho anyone home harry shouted there was no answer except the whimpering of the dog he stopped the motorcycle and got off large tracks were visible in the dust they didnt really look like the tracks of elephants because they left claw marks nothing on earth left tracks like that he stalked cautiously around the yard and after a while he went inside the house there were womens clothes in the closet with the farmers clothes another room had been occupied by a boy harry guessed hed been about melissas age ten or eleven a model of the starship enterprise hung from the ceiling and toy guns stood in the corner clothing for a small boy was flung onto the floor two dresser drawers were empty prisoners theyre taking women and children but not men that doesnt make sense there were letters scattered across the front room floor john thomas kensington rfd harry went back outside kensington lay on his back his eyes staring upward to the sky hed been torn in two halves by one shot the bore on those alien guns was as big as a fist twenty yards from his body the ground had been torn up by something large thrashing in the dust and there were dark stains john thomas kensington had sold his farm dearly harry saluted and went back into the collapsing house they take their dead with them dead or wounded a shotgun ought to do some damage at hat range wonder what he was using the refrigerator had been wrecked but the food inside wasnt spoiled harry rooted around until he found bread and cheese and lunch meat and made a sandwich while he was looking for bread he found a box of shells for the shotgun it was number six bird shot suitable for doves and quail not much of a load for elephants he waited until hed eaten before he went to take the gun from the mans lifeless fingers the dog under the porch continued to whimper bury the dead shoot the dog before it turns feral or starves harry had always believed himself tough but hed never thought hed be faced with decisions like this dead bodies were matters for the police and the coroners office and the undertakers there wont be a coroner harry went looking for a shovel he made another dozen miles before the sonic boom tore at his ears harry braked the motorcycle and looked up three contrails led from the west passing nearly overhead harry cheered go get the bastards he shouted as he watched one of the contrails broke into a ball of black smoke something bright seemed to stab upward from the east and the second contrail died the third traced a complex curve then it too ended in a ball of black smoke damn damn and hell harry started the bike again the big situation map in the war room changed every few minutes but no one was sure how current its information was a vast area of kansas stretching northward into nebraska was covered with bright red symbols someone had finally got stylized parachutes to show where alien units had landed they covered an area that looked much like an amoeba with its nucleus at great bend pseudopods reached east and west the situation room was the center of the underground north american air defense complex it was located under nearly a mile of granite separated from the outside world by sealed corridors water barriers guard rooms and more granite a row of offices overlooked the situation room jack clybourne stood outside one of the office doors jenny came up to him and winked he didnt respond im supposed to report to admiral carrell jenny said her voice held slight irritation sure jack shook his head sorry hon im about as useful as a fifth leg here wheres the president safer but im the only presidential protective unit agent here and i have to act like it yeah look theres no such thing as off duty down here but we have to eat sometimes sleep too dinner tonight id love that ill be around she grinned if they leave the door open be sure to watch the screens youve got pictures of the aliens we think so jenny tapped at the door it wasnt closed properly and the door swung open one wall of the office was glass it overlooked the big screen displays and control consoles on the floor below there was one desk president david coffey sat there staring at the maps admiral carrell stood next to him general bland stood grimly on the other side of the desk from carrell his lips a tight line roughly a circle admiral carrell said but what do they want the president asked this is obviously a reconnaissance in force carrell said he shook his head as to what their ultimate aims might be i dont know sir he looked up to see jenny at the door come in major have your intelligence people got the displays ready yes sir we have reports from refugees and some pictures one brought out the pictures should be up from the lab any minute have you seen them no sir theyre color and you dont look at color while its being developed but you have descriptions yes sir well tell us the president demanded mr presidentsir it will only be another minute until the pictures are ready idsir id rather you saw for yourself refugee reports general toland said theyre letting people out then yes sir if theyre walking no vehicles allowed out anyone who goes out is required to undergo a sort of ceremony ceremony yes sir theythe sciencefiction people say its reasonable given the way the aliens look but major your air of mystery is rapidly becoming tiresome admiral carrell said the phone chirped saved the admiral lifted the phone carrell yes put the photographs up on the big screens let everyone see what were up against there were five screens one by one they filled with pictures of baby elephants some hung from paper airplanes and wore elevator shoes others were on foot all earned weirdly shaped rifles laughter sounded on the floor below but it soon died away as the screen showed photographs of ruined buildings and wrecked cars with alien shapes in the foreground bodies lay in the background of most of the pictures jenny studied the photographs they were quite good the photographer whod taken them said shed sold to sports illustrated and other major magazines thats the enemy they do look like elephants admiral carrell said yes sir jenny said but theyre not really elephants no theyre invaders general toland said the president studied the screens carefully then turned to jenny this ceremony what was it before theyll let anyone leave the area they control they make you lie down on your back arms stretched out overhead then one of thealiensputs his foot on you after that youre free to go and your scifi people think thats reasonable the president asked yes sir the way the aliens are built they must think in terms of trampling their enemies beneath their feet they may be the biggest animals on their planet most earth species have a surrender ritual this is theirs the president nodded slowly god he looks awful i wonder if he got any sleep at all do your experts have any theories on what the invaders want the president demanded the earth jenny said general toland was adamant kick their butts dont piss on them he said mr president we cannot commit our forces piecemeal youve got to let me gather my strength before we go in there american citizens are being killed there property destroyed god damn it theyve invaded the united states david coffeys voice was cold with anger his hands gripped the arms of his chair we have to do something whats the army for if it cant defend the nation toland fought visibly to control himself that is hardly fair mr president admiral carrell said the army is not generally deployed to fight enemies within the nation if theyd let us call up some reservists before that goddam ship got here general toland muttered mr president im doing all i can our best units are in europe and central america and lebanon and theres no chance we can get those troops home not while the enemy dominates space they can see everything we do see it and kill it jenny thought lasers for the airplanes kinetic energy weapons for ships so when will we be able to do something for our people general toland the president demanded two more dayssir i hope mr president we cant mass our forces the commander at fort knox loaded tanks onto a train to send west they hit the train their air defenses are superb anything we send into that area either gets zapped from space or hit by a groundlaunched missile or worse jenny said they all looked at her theyre setting up groundbased laser defense systems the reports are just coming in ill have them on the screens in a few minutes lasers the president said yes sir much better than ours so what the hell are they doing with them general toland demanded jenny shook her head we dont know sir it appears theyre setting up a strong perimeter defense inside the area they control but we dont know because we cant get inside there to find out so they have it all their way the presidents voice was low and tired as if hed already been defeated it frightened jenny not all their way sir she said some reports get out mostly ham radio they dont get to broadcast long before something smashes them also theres bound to be resistance national guardsmen farmers with deer rifles sure theyll fight toland said even without orders jenny nodded but theyll be disorganized we cant communicate and theres nothing else we can do the president asked there was despair in his voice with all our power all our nuclear arsenalcant we use nukes on them theyre all mixed in with our people admiral carrell said general do something hurt them the president said hit them hard isnt there any place where there are a lot of them and none of our people none no not many yes toland said the president stared grimly at the screens hurt them now it will help american morale but sir that was an order general toland snapped to attention yes sir i take it you dont want a general bombardment no but they cant have it all their way we have to hurt them how else will we drive them out of america why are we so sure we can do it jenny almost blurted it out we may not be able to drive them out admiral carrell said we may simply have to kill them all it may come to that general toland said it comes under the heading of destroying the country in order to save it what we need is neutron weapons what would they do they kill without destroying the cities general toland drummed his fingers against the glass wall of the office if our people are inside behind stone walls in basementsdont most kansans have root cellars places underground many do the president said a few feet of dirt would protect our people toland said if the elephants are out in the open we could zap them without destroying kansas only trouble is we dont have the bombs why not the few we have are in europe admiral carrell said carefully because of public protest we were never allowed to manufacture any large number of neutron weapons i have asked the laboratories at sandia and los alamos to try to assemble makeshift enhanced radiation weapons but they cannot give us a schedule for their delivery but this is insane the president said a few thousand elephantshow many are there anyway we dont know jenny admitted certainly fewer than fifty thousand even so it must be a significant part of their ground combat strength general bland said more troops than they can afford to lose if we kill them all they may have to leave us alone in future they still control space admiral carrell said major crichton you look like a lady who wants to say something yes sir jenny answered you asked me to get the science fiction people to work it wasnt hard theyve got a number of ideas about the war well the president demanded sir i think it would be better if you heard for yourself david coffey frowned then suddenly he grinned sure why not as you say theyre the only experts we have when night came david morgan still wasnt home no gin either carlotta thought only two inches in this bottle shed found blackberry wine in the root cellar it would have to do they sat by candlelight in the living room there were distant sounds of thunder and far to the east and south were flashes of light the skies were clear overhead juana sat next to a kerosene lamp with a jane austen novel arent you worried carlotta asked sure but what good does that do davids got a good car and a rifle he cant phone what should i do i dont know what about she paused and after a moment there were more distant sounds about that nothing we can do should we run away where would we go its miles to the nearest house and lucy cant walk that far dont you have another car not one that works even if we did where would you rather be i dont know want some wine no and you dont think i should either to hell with you carlotta drank the blackberry wine it was much too sweet morning came bright and clear and cloudless a glorious kansas day except for ominous black clouds rising far away in the east there was still no sign of professor morgan carlotta and juana sat outside on the patio with coffee the night sounds were gone an hour passed then part of another then there were noises and dust to the west cars trucks lots of them juana said she listened again sound strange now maybe is a good time to run whats the difference carlotta asked maybe theyll know something about wes juana peered down the mad its the army she shouted our army carlotta was almost disappointed she counted a dozen tanks and five truckloads of soldiers they came up the drive and circled on both sides of the house going right on past and out toward the abandoned barn one vehicle that looked like a tank but had wheels drove up to the house and stopped an elderly officer with a graying mustache got out joe juana called he saluted lieutenant colonel halverson kansas militia maam he tried to grin come to see if you need help have you seen david juana demanded yes maam major morgan will be along in a bit he helped us round up troops thought he ought to come home last night and tell you but he said youd understand and we sure did need him him and that fourwheel of his what do you intend colonel carlotta asked she remembered she was dressed in a wrinkled housecoat and was ashamed this is my sister juana said mrs dawson halverson asked pleased to meet you maamhe climbed down off the armored car as to what we intend well first im waiting for my helicopters takes time to get them spruced up meantime we came out to see if you needed help when the choppers get here were going south and east until we see what the hell has invaded us carlotta nodded a dozen tanks two of those armored car things trucks and helicopters weekend warriors most of them are pretty old but you look formidable enough fast work started mobilizing the guard the night they started shooting halverson said there was pride in his voice been rounding up troops from all over the county would have called major morgan but the phones were out lucky we ran into him in town but what is happening halverson shrugged juana we havent been in touch with any government above the county seat since thosealiens started shooting phones dont work nothing but static on the radios most of our communications stuff was designed to work with satellites and we sure as hell dont have any of those left even so his back straightened i dont figure washington wants me to just sit back and wait for orders not while theyre dropping out of the skies soon as my choppers get here were going to show em what it means to mess around with americans especially kansas jayhawks the jayhawk war a general never knows anything with certainty never sees his enemy plainly nor knows positively where he is the most experienced eye cannot be certain whether it sees the whole of the enemys army or only threetenths of it it is by the eyes of the mind by the combination of all reasoning by a sort of inspiration that the general sees commands and judges napoleon bonaparte memoirs countdown h plus hours harry spent the night in a wheat field using wheat straw for bedding and more of it piled on top to stay warm he didnt dare risk a fire there were flashes and thunder all around him by counting time between flash and sound he estimated some were as close as three miles far too close morning came and he missed jeris camp stove and cocoa cant think about that got to get moving but goddammit should have done something should have saved her hell i should have left her by her carshed have been safer come with me ill take care of you shit the motorcycle ran fine he estimated that he had another twenty miles to go and fuel for thirty harry turned up the lane toward the big house and shook his head in disbelief made it by god at least it certainly looked like the place wes had once described and it was on the right road ten miles west of dighton and there was no other house within a mile it was nearly noon the skies were blue and clear and there were only occasional thunderclaps and flashes of colored light he frowned an army light armored vehicle stood in front of the house there were deep tread marks on both sides of the drive leading out behind the house half a mile out through the fields were at least six tanks a couple of obsolete m abrams tanks and at least two bradley infantry fighting vehicles a big blue gm jimmy fourwheeldrive truck stood in the driveway beside the lav harry nodded at it approvingly he let the motorcycle coast up to the front porch two soldiers older than harry sat on top of the armored car one waved at harry hi harry called hi one of the soldiers answered something moved behind the glasspaneled front window is mrs dawson at home harry asked no point in asking why the army had surrounded the house think so a sergeant said hey juana visitor for your sister the front door opened carlotta dawson in blue jeans her hair bundled into a kerchief rushed down the steps she didnt say anything she just grabbed harry and pulled herself against him burying her face in his beard she stood that way for a moment then looked up at the soldiers on the lav he came all the way from la she said to help me tough going the sergeant asked some harry said heard it was bad out west hoover dams gone harry said they took out all the cities along the colorado river same thing happened with all the dams along the platte they seem to like hitting dams an officer came out of the house colonel halverson this is harry reddington carlotta said a friend ofof wes and me hes come from la harry you must be starved yeah but miz dawson weve got to move the damned elephants elephants colonel halverson demanded elephants yes sir harry said the invaders why do you say elephants they look like baby elephants with two trunks youve seen them then yes sir i sure have harry winced this wasnt going to be easy why tell it at all shot one too but they wear armor so i doubt if i hurt it armor yeah body armor and they have rifles they kill people they kidnappedthey took some people prisoner from a farmhouse killed the farmer just how close did you get to them harry shuddered too damn close close as you and me one stood on my chest he wouldnt say that it shamed him halverson looked skeptical howd you get away from them they let me go look you guys do what you want but mrs dawson and me have to get out of here theyre all around its damned lucky they didnt get here yet tell me more colonel halverson said tell me everything theres just not that much harry said they wore elevator shoes and they came down on paper airplanes if i say that they came down on hang gliders then bigger stuff landed how big where near logan they had flying things about as big as a jetliner only not so wide in the wings and a floating thing about as big as a diesel semi thats what i saw there may have been bigger tanks field guns none i saw and they let you go yeah sort of they let others go yes from logan southwest of here halverson pounded his right fist into his left hand but we know theyre east of us and nobodys come out of there they would too if theif those things would let them maybe theres something they want to hide son you better tell me everything you know gradually halverson dragged the story out of harry finally it was done so i found the gun harry said i thought about going after mrs wilson but i came here instead halverson looked thoughtful hell what else could you do youre no army the next time theyd just shoot you but i sure wish i knew what theyre hiding out to the east colonel the sergeant seated on top of the armored car jumped off he looked older than halverson yeah luke colonel i heard a funny story last night over in collinston collinston thats fifty miles from here what were you doing in collinston took some of the boys over for a drink you didnt need us we werent going anywhere next time you leave camp you tell me he chuckled okay so you found a bar open in collinston guess it takes more than war and a parachute invasion to close the bars in that town sure does anyway there was a guy in the bar hed been drinking a lot so nobody paid much attention he said hed seen an elephant a little one in a willow patch outside of town thought it escaped from some circus because it was a trained elephant trained trained how halverson demanded dont know harry carlottas voice was low and urgent harry thats an invader we have to go capture it we have to get it alive maybe it knows about wes harry we have to harry gulped hard sure but i need gas ill get it out of davids car hey hold on colonel halverson said i cant let you do that why not carlotta demanded youre going east youll see lots of invaders you dont need this one butlook those things are armed it didnt hurt that man in the bar carlotta said why would he think it was trained maybemaybe it lay down and rolled over holy shit harry said hey she might be right yeah but colonel my husband was a personal friend of the president president coffey himself sent wes up to meet the aliens its my right to find out what happened to him you give harry some gasoline and then go fight your war harry and i will do the rest yeah harry thought sure i say we go in after them evan lewis sounded very sure hell joe we have to we cant let thosethings run all over kansas wasnt me arguing with you captain lieutenant colonel halverson said he looked at the others seated at juana morgans dining room table evan lewis who ran a tractor sales and repair agency and commanded the tanks george mason lawyer who commanded the six helicopter gunships the fourth man at the table was david morgan retired professor of business administration halversons adjutant and chief of staff morgan was the smallest one at the table and he spoke with a clipped eastern accent that irritated hell out of joe halverson but he was certainly the smartest man in the battalion and i still dont like it george mason said colonel we dont know what were up against and we dont know what the army has in mind so what do you suggest we do halverson asked wait for orders how heroic captain lewis said enough david morgan spoke quietly but they all heard him we dont need bickering so which side are you on professor evan lewis had never liked professor morgan on the other hand it was david morgans house and they all felt like guests military uniforms or not i agree with colonel halversons reasoning morgan said the invaders are hiding something to the east were a cavalry outfit its our duty to explorebut carefully in particular we have to be certain that any information we get will be useful that wont be easy theyre jamming all communications and the phones dont work joe halverson nodded thoughtfully suggestions major well have to string things out use the bradley vehicles as communications links he sketched rapidly on the table cloth corporal lewismorgan nodded to evan lewis everyone knew that evans son jimmy was an electronic geniusjimmy rigged up those shield things that let the tanks talk to each other as long as the antennas are aimed straight at each other fine we send the choppers forward as scouts and flankers making sure they stay in line of sight to the tanks tanks in the middle concentrated enough to have some firepower spread out enough to not make such a good target then string the bradleys and the lavs out behind as connecting links what do they connect to mason asked we leave two troopers here with my wife and a radio juana writes down everything if we dont come back she gets the hell out not much chance shed have to do that halverson said hell were not an army but weve got a fair amount of strength here he looked out the window at his command six helicopters with missiles a dozen tanks with guns and missiles the communications werent any good because the invaders were broadcasting static from space but even without communications a troop of armored cavalry was nothing to laugh at sounds all right to me lewis said at least well be doing something id rather wait for orders george mason said but what the hell im ready if you are joe halverson stood right lets go im jimmy lewis the corporal said he climbed through the attic window to join harry on the roof of the big frame house harry nodded greeting hi they tell me you invented this he hefted the handtalkie radio whose antenna was wrapped in a tinfoil cone stiffened with coathanger wire yeah jimmy lewis said his tone was serious its the only way ive figured to keep communications you have to point it pretty tight though or youll lose the signal harry regarded the device then the similar but larger tinfoil monstrosity on one of the bradley fighting vehicles in the yard down below yeah so i point this at the bradley and maybe i can hear what then use this jimmy lewis said he handed harry a sony tape recorder theres three hours of tape on there more than enough just plug it into the radio here like that and turn it on when we move out listen in the earphones and youll hear a tone if youre pointed close to the tank and nothing at all when youre dead on except when theyre talking then youll hear them talk of course it sounds hard but its pretty easy really sure major morgan was in the front yard harry couldnt hear what he was saying but juana morgan didnt like it their housekeeper sat in the front seat of the fourwheeldrive jimmy but juana morgan didnt want to drive it finally though she got in and the blue jimmy drove off and now its just carlotta and me david morgan stood very straight as he went to his tank and climbed in colonel halverson came over to stand below them bout time jimmy he shouted up at them yes sir corporal lewis waved to harry and crawled back inside through the window thanks mr reddington halverson shouted i need all my troopers good of you to fill in i doubt youll be needed but yeah no problem colonel of course carlottas goin nuts wanting to go get that elephant maybe its safer up here thanks then halverson said he walked briskly up the line to the lead tank and climbed in he stood in the turret for a moment then waved dramatically wagonshoooo he shouted the helicopters rose in a cloud of dust and swept forward and off to each side in groups of three the tanks fanned out and moved ahead leaving the bradleys behind watcher this is jayhawk one do you read harry keyed the mike roger jayhawk one this is watcher course is degrees moving forward at hours the tankers voice said in harrys ear harry started guiltily and switched on the tape recorder when the bradley began to move eastward it was much harder to keep the radio aimed properly harry braced it against the chimney the rooftop was steep and it wasnt easy to keep his footing the helicopters wove in complex patterns ahead of the tanks moving ahead at twenty klicks the voice said about ten miles an hour harry thought he could still remember kilometer signs on highways although he hadnt seen one in years a halfhour went by the helicopters and lead tanks were nearly invisible the others were strung out behind them harrys radio contact was a good five miles ahead and it took all his attention to keep the antenna aimed properly he was about to key the mike to tell them that light overhead the tankers voice shouted harry could see it a bright green flash more visible high up than near the ground its moving in a circlenumber three helicopter reports the beam is moving around them in a circle its tightening in on them there was a pause no contact with the choppers colonel halverson reports theyve all been attacked by some kind of beam jesus so far nothings shot at us there was a roar and the sharp snap of multiple sonic booms harry looked up dozens of parallel white lines crossed the sky from the southwest they dropped like the lines in missile command downward toward where colonel halversons force was centered there were bright flashes at the horizon and along the line where the connecting vehicles had been strung out after a long pause there was the sound of thunder jayhawks this is watcher harry said any jayhawk this is watcher come in harry poured the last of the gas into the motorcycle what was it carlotta asked i dont know it looked like a video game it was unreal harry went on checking the motorcycle making a motorcycle work was a good test of sanity and one he could win death from the skywe owned the sky once then the soviets took it away now weve got to take it back from baby elephants motors in good shape well make it fine youll have to hold the rifle he handed carlotta the winchester that david morgan had loaned him not an elephant gun but itll give them pause to think morgan had said not a loan anymore they were dead all of them hed waited an hour maybe i ought to go look no carlotta was positive youll get yourself killed its more important that we capture that stray mrs dawson you dont know thats a stray what else could it be harry shruigged all i know is im gettin damned tired of ridin this motorcycle and i wish i had another tube of preparation h but my back isnt as bad as it was all aboard he patted his pocket to be sure the tape was in it somebody would want that tape i will never go metric harry sang a clump of cars and people was clustered around a big semi ahead were just about to collinston harry shouted that looks like trouble he slowed and drove the motorcycle up to the semi a highway patrol cruiser was parked nearby and a lieutenant of the highway patrol stood facing a knot of angry farmers and truckers most of them held rifles or shotguns oh shit harry muttered the lieutenant eyed harry and carlotta red beard dirty clothes middleaged woman in designer jeans he watched carlotta dismount yes madam i am carlotta dawson yes dawson my husband was aboard the soviet kosmograd lieutenant i gather there is an alien here damn straight one of the truck drivers shouted goddam snout blew george mathers in half he brandished a military rifle now its our turn we have to take it alive carlotta stated bullshit this one was a farmer i come out of logan lady the goddam snouts killed my sister theyre all over the fucking place howd you get out foot on your chest harry asked the driver looked sheepish thought so harry said look give us a chance the military wants to question that thing well go in after it he pointed to the willow trees a hundred yards from the highway over there right over there and go to hell someone yelled lets go harry said he gestured to carlotta she climbed on behind in there there was a dirt path leading to the clump of willow trees as harry started the motorcycle he heard one of the truck drivers we can blow it away when he gets out there were mutters of approval when he stopped at the swamps edge he could hear something big in the creek for harpanet things had become very odd he had gone through terror and out the other side he was bemused perhaps he was mad without his herd about him for comparison how was a fi to tell try to surrender fling the gun to the dirt roll over belly in the air the man gapes turns and lurches away chase him down he screams and gathers speed falls and runs again toward lights harpanet will seem to be attacking cease hide and wait a human climbs from the cab of a vehicle try again the man scampers into the cab emerges with something that flames and roars harpanet rolls in time to take the cloud of tiny projectiles in his flank instead of his belly the man fires again he has refused surrender harpanet trumpets rage woe betrayal he sweeps up his own weapon and fires back the enemys forelimbs and head explode outward from a mist of blood in harpanets mind his past fades his future is unreal his digits stroke his side feeling for the death wound no death wound no hole big enough for a digit to find what did the human intend torture harpanets whole right side is a burning itch covered with a sheen of blood an eight to the eighth of black dots form a buzzing storm around him he lurches through the infinite land away from roads downhill where he can within the buzzing storm and the maddening itch the jaws of his mind close fast on a memory vivid in all his senses more real than his surroundings he moves through an infinite fantasy of planet seeking the mudroom aboard message bearer green tall green plants with leaves like knife blades but they brush away the hungry swarming dots water mud he rolls through mud and greenery over and over freezing from time to time to look smell listen harpanets past fades against the strange and terrible reality if he has a future it is beyond imagining a mistgray wall there is only now a moment of alien plants and fiery itch and cool mud and here mudroom and garden mushed together nightmarishly changed he rolls to wash the wounds he plucks gobs of mud to spread across his tattered flank afraid to leave afraid to stay what might taste his blood in the water and seek its source the predators of the homeworld were pictures on a thuktun ghosts on an old recording tape but fearsome enough for all their distance what lurks in these alien waters but he hears the distant sound of machines passing and knows that they are not fithp machines a machine comes near louder louder harpanets ears and eyes project above the water the machine balances crazily on two wheels like men it slows wobbles stops humans approach on foot harpanets muscles know what to do when he is hurt exhausted friendless desperate alone harpanets mind finds no other answer but he sees no future he lurches from the water alien weapons come to bear he casts his gun into the weeds he rolls on his back and splays his limbs and waits the man comes at a toppling run no adult fi would try to balance so the man sets a hind foot on harpanets chest with such force that harpanet can feel it he swallows the urge to laugh but such a weight could hardly bend a rib nonetheless he lies with limbs splayed giving his surrender the man looks down at his captive breathing as if he has won a race we got him harry shouted now what he waved uphill where a score of armed men hidden waited with weapons ready i can talk to them carlotta sounded doubtful they wont listen and dammit this is my snout they cant kill it now harry thought furiously a guilty grin came and he lifted the seat of the motorcycle where he kept his essential tools youve thought of something maybe he dug into the tool roll and found a hank of parachute cord it was thin strong enough to hold a man but not much use against one of those he gestured to the captive using both hands to make get up motions the alien stood it looked at them passively gives me the creeps harry said he clutched his rifle one in the eye and we dont have a problem see if itll carry you harry said carry me sheena queen of the jungle i know theyre strong enough a dozen truckers and farmers stood with ready weapons harry walked ahead of the invader leading it on a length of cord carlotta rode its back sidesaddle she beamed at them hi she called none of the watchers spoke perhaps they were afraid of

scholars life assail toil envy want the patron and the jail dr samuel johnson vanity of human wishes countdown h plus hours pavel aleksandrovich bondarev fingered the priceless tapestry covering the bare concrete wall it doesnt really look like a bomb shelter he said lorena rolled lazily in the big bed they are very nice rooms she said her own room was just down the corridor close enough that only a few of bondarevs staff knew just how late she stayed they wouldnt talk as secretary to the acting commander of the soviet space defense forces lorena was one of the most powerful women in the soviet union as long as my wife is not offended she must know but so long as i am discreet lorena rolled off the bed and walked to the closet where his uniforms hung she fingered the shoulder straps on one of them i had never thought to see you a general she said and now there is talk of making you a marshal of the soviet union hah you do not wish promotion of course not i never wanted to be part of the military at all i would rather talk with the aliens than fight them they were in space for decades out between the stars where there is no interference no radio noisethink of what they must have learned they have destroyed half of russia and you wish to talk to them he sighed i know it is impossible perhaps though when we defeat them i will learn what they know of stars only it is not so certain that we can defeat them whenever we launch a missile they destroy the missile base they have landed in america perhaps the americans have captured aliens perhaps and perhaps not it is late she moved provocatively he didnt react so you are satisfied for the moment she teased perhaps later i have other things to concern me boudarev said lorena laughed they do not always keep your attention a chirp sounded from the other room bondarev put on a robe he could not cut short a conversation with whoever called on that phone bondarev here he said narovchatov da comrade narovchatov i am told that the americans have called you only to test the telephone line i did not myself speak to them who did my secretary what was said nothing nikolai nikolayevich comrade polinova spoke to an american technician she was told that the americans wished to speak with me but then the connection failed bondarev spoke nervously should i have reported this but there was nothing to report it is a matter of great concern narovchatov said we have been unable to make contact with the americans the chairman wishes to speak with the american president are your technicians working on reestablishing this connection the failure was not here comrade narovchatov i understand that the cable crosses the atlantic then passes under the meditenanean and comes through istanbul i believe the break was in marrakech where there is chaos narovchatov muttered da bondarev had sporadic communications with a large soviet armored force in africa but that group was far to the south and east of marrakech lorena came in with a glass of hot tea and set it beside him bondarev nodded his thanks perhaps the kgb has agents in marrakech bondarev said perhaps they could facilitate the repair of the cable a splendid suggestion i will send the orders the matter is urgent pavel aleksaridrovich there is unrest in germany and poland we have reason to believe the west germans may attempt something the americans must restrain them if they can and if they will da i understand have you anything to report only rumors our station in tehran confirms that the invaders have landed in the central united states and there is land warfare the americans in tehran know little else but they pretend high confidence you will call if you learn more or if you make contact with the americans at once your wife sends her regards narovchatov said she is well and your children are well thank you the connection broke bondarev sipped his tea my family is well he said musingly but they did not say where no with the chairman and the politburo somewhere near moscow i would presume she sat on the couch and leaned against his shoulder i am glad they are safe i am also glad your wife is not here the chairman wishes to speak with the americans it is urgent she sat up quickly why there is unrest in poland and germany she cursed they dare da they dare now that we cannot send the army now that the army is needed in the turkic republics and latvia and estonia i hate them lorena said they were under the house inspecting the support pillars carlotta was more frightened than wes he tried to reassure hernot hearing what he was saying but knowing he was lying badly the quake was coming soon these pillars had to be reinforced before the san andreas fault tore loose and sent everything rolling downhill in a spray of debris a sound like a brass trumpet ripped through the world and then the world tilted and everything started to roll wes dawson woke to the blare of the acceleration warning and russian curses and the deep hum of thuktun flishithys drive the floor was tilted not toward a wall but toward one corner the outeraftantispinward corner the fithp must be accelerating and decreasing spin simultaneously the fithp would have no time for prisoners during maneuvers wes did what the others were doing he spread out on his belly like a starfish knd curled his fingers and toes in the paddingdry here though damp throughout the rest of the shipand dozed the tilt grew more pronounced as thuktun flishithys spin decreased after several hours everyone shifted to the aft wall they were awake and talking but not to wes dawson once he heard amusement park in english and nikolai made rollercoaster motions with his hands while the rest laughed another several hours and the aft wall had become a flat floor thuktun flishithys drive was pushing at one earth gravity or close to it the door opened it was a door now and four fithp warriors rolled through without pause they herded the humans into the corridor where four more warriors waited with the teachers female assistant tashayamp dmitri bowed to her greetings he said question destination selves destination podo thuktun tashayamp said ready your minds with no superior present she seemed surer of herself now what gave him that impression wes watched her she walked like an unstoppable mass a behemoth she wasnt adjusting her gait he had seen her veer from contact with warriors and humans alike now the warriors were presumably her guardians and her human charges had demonstrated both the agility and the motivation to dodge her tonplus of mass never mind there was something he wanted from het question destination thuktun flishithy in two mealtimegaps this status will end there will be almost no pull you will live floating for a long time you must learn to live so she said she hadnt answered his question but then they often didnt the corridor branched the new corridor dipped then curved to the right now why the curve this ought to be a radial corridor wes remembered that the streets of beverly hills had been laid in curves just to make them prettier was that it under spin the corridor would rise at twenty or twentyfive degrees but under spin a radial corridor would be vertical fithp couldnt climb ladders the routes inward had to be spirals look for fast elevators too as the soviets had stopped talking to wes so wes had stopped talking to them he had fallen into a kind of game observe deduce who will learn faster you or me tashayamp says well be living in nearly freefall in a day or so what makes nearly freefall and why not spin the ship to avoid it the fithp liked low gravity but not that low what could prevent them from spinning the ship ah an asteroid of course theyve got an asteroid base a small one and were going to be moored to it i wish to hell theyd let us near a window and now were to see the podo thuktun they showed that in the picture show installing the podo thuktun was a big deal so important that they recorded it and showed it to us as important as the fuel so what was it thuktun means message or lesson or a body of knowledge ive heard them use it all three ways thuktun is part of the mother ships name fistartehthuktun the sleeper with the tapestry harness is mated to thuktun and doesnt seem to have a normal mate what then are we about to see the curved corridor ended in a massive rectangular door unlike most this door didnt seem to have automatic controls and it took two warriors to shoulder it aside the troop marched in a spiral ramp ran up the sides of the cylindrical chamber the cylinder was nearly empty conspicuous waste in a starship in the center was a vertical pillar no thicker than wess wrist he looked up to where it expanded into a flowershaped cradle for for the podo thuktun of course it was a relic of sorts a granite block twentyfive or thirty feet long by the same distance wide by half that in height its corners and edges were unevenly rounded as if it had weathered thousands of years of dust laden winds there was writing on it in it wes could see overhead light glinting through the lines something like a threadthin laser had written script and diagrams all the way through the block he was being left behind tashayamp and half the warriors were escorting the soviets up the spiral ramp the other warriors were coming for wes he hurried to join them platforms led off the ramp at varying heights and on one of these three fithp were at work they ignored the intruders fistartehthuktun and his spaceborn acolytes looked down for a long moment of meditation before beginning their work it was a ritual and necessary one could become too used to the podo thuktun could take it for granted that must never happen at one time bloody wars had been fought over the diagram in the central face of the podo thuktun was that diagram in fact a picture of a predecessor half the world had been conquered by the herd that thought it was many generations had passed and heretics had been raped of their status with dismaying regularity before the fithp realized the truth message bearers interstellar ramjet had been made from that diagram the priest and his acolytes turned to the library screen paykurtank tapped at a tab the size of a humans fist the screen responded by showing a succession of photographs one after another granite halfcubes appeared in closeup against varying halfseen backgrounds skip a few koolpooleh suggested i countermand that fistartehthuktun said instantly well at least glance at them all were seeking any relevant information left by the predecessors regarding aliens or winterhome or its natives the thuktunthp were arrayed in order of their discovery and roughly in order of simplicity of the lesson delivered the history of the fithp could be read in the order of discovery of the thuktunthp uses of fire mining and refining of metals uses of the wheel the predecessors had made these easily available to their successors later discoveries had been found in caves or mountaintops or lifeless deserts pause that koolpooleh is this nothing but mathematics i have no trouble reading the line thuktun fistartehthuktun simple plane geometry a list of axioms go to the next one the breaker has arrived with trainees ignore them pause that koolpooleh and paykurtank were watching the humans furtively with one eye each fistartehthuktun pretended not to notice perhaps they could learn from watching the aliens perhaps not the fithp warriors were even now aground and dealing with the prey fistartehthuktun remembered what it was like to run to take prey from a rushing stream to see nothing but mountains in the distance and clouds overhead these creatures must first be defeated surely the knowledge was here all knowledge was contained in the thuktunthp the lifethuktun was surely interesting enough the script and diagrams dealt with biology and fistartehthuktun had studied it before hierarchies of plant life to the left animal life to the right tiny ancient singlenucleated life at the bottom scaling toward complex warmblooded air breathers at the top simple sketches at every level the sketch that was third from the top resembled a stunted fi it was bulky flatskulled with but one branch to its trunk the feet were clubs each with a tiny afterthought of a claw the creatures sketched above the promfl were extinct though skeletons had been found preserved in soft sedimentary rock other pictured life forms had disappeared too but shouldnt that top sketch be the lineaments of a predecessor wouldnt they have considered themselves the top of the ladder of life wars had been fought over that question too it was not easy to ignore tashayamp half an octuple of soldiers and four of winterhomes small flatfaced natives including one in a wheeled cage fistartehthuktun could hardly fail to hear takpusseh lecturing them in baby talk he let himself glance at the humans they didnt resemble that top sketch in any way fistartehthuktun felt a relief he would not let himself admit since his revival from the deathsleep the priests position had never been stronger the average fit aboard message bearer had no grasp of what the predecessors were all about or how much fistartehthuktun didnt know but he had a task he must advise the officers he must seek any relevant information left by the predecessors he had koolpoolehs attention again go on he said the next thuktun explained the making of aluminum not known the shapes of the others predecessors no pictures of selves shape of predecessor minds half known tashayamp was speaking slowly and wes was catching most of the meaning he thought he had to concentrate there were eights of eightcubed of thuktunthp scattered about the world the predecessorstashayamp glanced toward the priest busy at his huge display screen and her breathy trumpet of a voice dropped a little did not know everything they did not know that what they did with their machines would ruin the world for them maybe they did not know where life would be in the world after the world healed they left the thuktunthp everywhere not told things about fithp things about predecessors perhaps thuktunthp were thuktunmeaning message hereto predecessor childrens children but predecessor children were not made arvid asked what happened fistartehthuktun knows i talk to him wait tashayamp turned away she stood behind the priest and did nothing waiting wes looked down from below the cradle had blocked some of the script from above it didnt the sculptors had left a meter or more of margin around the writing it had worn away unevenly leaving bulges the cradle arms could grip the script was lost to him wes studied the diagrams the patterns in the podo thuktun here a spray of dots in which wes could recognize the summer triangle a star pattern there a pattern of curves that might be the magnetic fields in a bussard ramjet podo could mean starflight or stars or just sky certain words and phrases became clear he was sure that thuktun pushithy meant thuktun carrier or message bearer fistartehthuktun was a priest it might bethat he worshiped the podo thuktun he seemed to function as a librarian too loremaster fistartehthuktun had turned from the screen and was talking with tashayamp too fast to be understood not known what happened to end predecessor children tashayamp said perhaps they do not want children because they have destroyed the world perhaps they cannot have children she spread her digits in the pattern dawson had come to call a shrug a futile clawing at the air it meant i do not know and do not believe it can be known she turned back to fistartehthuktun wes studied the star patterns again the constellations are nearly the same as earths nearly but not identical they must be from somewhere near he shuddered can more be coming no only one ship was in the films they showed us nearby is meaningless when were talking about stars fistartehthuktun was speaking again wes moved closer to listen to tashayamp translate into fithp babytalk their quarters had become tolerable as the fithp learned what they liked the padding over the six walls was no longer wet dawson was almost comfortable dmitri was speaking english dawson was ashamed at how glad that made him i am not a communist nobody ever called me that except the goddamn birchers but i cant live alone they were dying wes did it sound as if they destroyed their environment themselves i thought thats what fistartehthuktun said but they must have thought some of them would live changed could it be true do you mean could the predecessors be their ancestors no there was a thuktun onscreen with a column of biology sketches till fistartehthuktun shifted to something else didnt you notice the sketches that misshapen fi was third from the top if you were making a hierarchy of life on earth would you put humanity third from the top no dmith said in some irritation but i might leave humanity off entirely if i were christian or some such then i might put apes third from the top if i seriously liked dolphins and whales thats too many ifs or a christian or muslim might put fanciful angels above him for the moment we might as well believe as tashayamp believes arvid said soothingly the fithp have studied the subject for much longer than the hour we have been granted so a race died of overpollution the world was changed in the changed world something new grew upperhaps a pet or a work animal an evolved dog or horse they do seem to worship the predecessors why wouldnt they wes wondered consider what would happen to tribes who didnt study the thuktunthp there were eight to the fourth power is around four thousand thuktunthp and a lot of them were duplicates for every one of those the first tribeherdto use the information would be the first to rule it must have happened hundreds of times of course they worship the predecessors arvid shrugged i like to think of them as a tamed elephant then the world came apart dwarfing is caused by ages of famine flash floods winnowed those who could not grow claws to grip a passing rock he smiled there is no proof choose the picture you like shape wars dmitri said is it your belief that these were religious wars based on interpretation of the thuktunthp yes he shook his head very strange dmitri laughed why strange human history is full of such the byzantine church was divided and civil wars resulted from what icons were permitted to be shown in churches the christian god has no shape yet one of the prophets was permitted to see his hindquarters not his front you understand only his hindquarters i do not know if that resulted in wars among the jews but it easily might youd think there would be some pictures of the predecessors dawson said perhaps there were dmitri mused onlysuppose there were descendents of the predecessors and the fithp killed them it would not be an easy thing to face that you had killed the sons of your gods one hell of a guilt trip or maybe there were pictures of the predecessors wes said maybe they were destroyed as blasphemous in the period when they thought the bussard ramjet diagram was the shape of a predecessor perhaps arvid said and thenexcuse me dmitri said he spoke rapidly in russian after a while the russians moved away to their own corner leaving wes dawson alone again they dont trust me i might do something to warn the aliens at least i have a few answers i need answers nat reynolds could remember exactly when he got into trouble it started the second morning after the aliens blew up cosmograd ending the sciencefiction convention where he was guest of honor and stranding him in kansas city he was sitting in dolly jordans breakfast room with good coffee and eggs sunnyside up trying to think of what to do now that all the stories about alien invaders were turning bloodily obsolete why couldnt it have been wells martians wed have had em in zoos inside of twentyfour hours theres somebody here to see you dolly jordan had said she set another plate and a coffee cup at the table nat looked up with irritation someone hed met at the ozcon but the man dolly led into her breakfast room didnt have the look he was too old and too well dressed and what was it he just didnt have that sensitive fannish face ive looked all over for you the man said hah you dont remember me do you im roger brooks washington post youd think the press would know by now no sciencefiction writer can be expected to function before noon nat shook his head i have a lousy memory its all right mind if i sit down dolly already set a place for you brooks sat dolly appeared with a coffeepot she was plump and cheerful and smart enough not to chatter in the morning after she filled brookss cup she went back to the kitchen leaving them alone why were you looking for me reynolds asked because you probably know where the government is reynolds shook his head in confusion just before the aliens arrived all the sciencefiction writers vanished brooks explained at least all the hard sciencefiction writers did oho you do know something brooks leaned forward eagerly what nothing real nat said a month or so ago wade curtis called asked where id be when the aliens arrived when i told him id be guest of honor at ozcon he changed the subject and thats all yeah wade wouldnt ask me to violate that kind of promise whats this about the government the president left washington two hours after the aliens blew up kosmograd brooks said by yesterday morning the cabinet and most of the pentagon brass were gone brooks shrugged no stories left in washington nobody there knows whats happening so you came looking for me yeah the writers vanished a couple of weeks ago then just before the aliens arrived the president sent an important intelligence officer to colorado to talk to them i figure thats where the government went to cheyenne mountain kansas citys on the way roger sipped his coffee when the hotel said youd left with the whole sf convention i took a chance and came to the chairmans house sorry you went to so much trouble for nothing maybe not for nothing brooks said look the writers are in cheyenne mountain im sure of it you were invited you have the invitation i have a press pass and a vw rabbit diesel with more than enough fuel to get there want to pool our resources i dont have any invitation to cheyenne mountain i was booked at the ozcon so i wasnt invited all i had to do was say so and i always sign too many book contracts i have trouble saying no if i were a woman id be pregnant all the time reynolds stood at a secondstory window at collins street the apartment building was separated from the street by a wide grassy strip the buildings were old brick with a new mcdonalds just down the block they were in lauren kansas somewhere near topeka hed never been in the town before and didnt want to be here now but there wasnt much choice because while they were driving across kansas the sky erupted with paper airplanes carrying baby elephants hed met carol north at the convention and his address book showed she lived in lauren kansas theyd gone to her apartment we could have kept on driving there cant be that many aliens they cant be everywhere instead theyd parked in an underground lot and waited the invaders came a ceremony reynolds thought it even makes sense humiliating but it makes sense and once theyve put you through that they leave you alone what do they want reynolds turned back to the window in the street outside three men hid among the trash cans behind the mcdonalds theyd laid dinner plates on the street surface from somewhere nearby came the roar of large motors you had to tell them reynolds said it was a story id heard from the hungarian uprising how did i know theyd try it bat turds roger george bergson was itching to kill an alien so you told him how you knew hed try it if it killed him it will and were too close what if they bomb this building roger brooks shrugged george promised they wouldnt to anything to call attention to this place hes going to get himself killed reynolds said and probably us with him stop saying that carol north said please stop saying that okay but it doesnt change anything your friend is doomed lady a thought came unbidden shed come to his room at the convention her relationship with george bergson was clearly an open one would she be faithful to his memory once he got killed that could be inconvenient the roaring grew louder theyre coming roger said the snouts are coming he stayed well back in the room and aimed his camera out toward the dinner plates in the road two large armored vehicles came into view they floated a foot or more off the road surface their crews were invisible inside itll be okay george will kill some invaders and live through it and well all learn levitation and fly to safety right but nats belly and guts were knotted in fear he heard roger say it worked in budapest the first ground effect vehicle approached the line of dinner plates and stopped something protruded from the forward deck and extended toward the plates george bergson and his friends stood and threw their bottles at the armored vehicles two of the bottles hit the lead tank and burst into flames flame spread across the vehicle and rivers of fire ran off its sides and were dispersed by the ground effect fan there was a highpitched whine and grinding noises and the vehicle fell heavily to the roadway two more gasoline bombs arced out the second vehicle began rapid fire holes the size of baseballs appeared in the buildings behind bergson and his crew the men dashed behind the mcdonalds building the gunfire continued the mcdonalds building was chopped nearly in half the upper part of the building fell into the lower part from somewhere far above a beam of greenish light speared the mcdonalds building the wreckage exploded in flame the green lightpencil drew an expanding spiral around the pillar of flame first tightly then in everspreading arcs that grew and grew reynolds dived away from the window there was the sound of crashing glass the tank outside continued to fire and two large holes appeared in the wall in front of him carol and roger brooks dove into the hallway carol lay next to reynolds jesus she whispered jesus christ theyre killing everybodyyou knew reynolds shook his head i didnt know but it was a good guess look at them herd beasts no speed and all their defenses in front and have you ever seen less than six together i bet their ancestors stood in a ring to fight it was a reasonable guess that if someone does something they dont like they go after the offenders whole herd not just the individual the gunfire continued to pound smoke carol shouted the buildings on fire trapped out the back way roger brooks said quick he crouched low and ran down the hallway to the stairs stay low stay away from windows nat reynolds ran down the hall he heard carol behind him roger sat in the biggest cadillac in the lowest level of the underground parking structure it was noon theyd been here almost twenty hours there were sounds from inside another caddy two cars away jeez what does she see in him roger wondered they were at it not six hours after her livein boyfriend bought it and youre jealous because you had nothing to distract you from the thought that theyd tumble the building down on your head or from them there hadnt been any sounds from outside for hours roger couldnt stand it any longer he crept toward the exit another small groupa man two women and four small children huddled in one corner of the garage they stared at roger as he went past but they didnt say anything the ramp was blocked by debris but the stairs were intact roger climbed up pausing at each landing ho he jumped startled the voice had been feminine and definitely human hello its quiet out there she said roger climbed up to the landing she was older than hed thought from her voice roger guessed she was almost forty she wore jeans and a wool shirt and a bandana and her face was covered with soot and grime her nose had once been broken and wasnt quite straight not quite ugly but she could work on it whats happening i think theyve gone im rosalee pinelli by the way roger brooks where did they go she shrugged all i know is they were out there all night i could hear them but they never came in here did you go look she shook her head vigorously not me we didnt hear anything for a couple of hours so about dawn the five guys who were in here with me went out to look she indicated a hole in the concrete structure you can see em through here roger looked there was a pile of bodies in the street thats more than five they made a pile rosalee said they left people alone until some guys blew one of their tanks she shook her head goddam it was beautiful they used dinner plates to look like mines and when one of the snouts stopped they hit it with molotov cocktails beautiful until the snouts blew up the town roger said under his breath yeah i saw it after that the snouts started that pile of bodies out there she said i havent seen or heard anything since about nine this morning but ive been afraid to go out ill look around be carefulhere ill come with you theyre gone brooks said lets get the hell out of here how nat reynolds asked theres some junk on the ramp brooks said but with a little work we can get it clear and drive out arent there cars up above not like this one brooks said he patted the vw diesel rabbit f can get two thousand miles on the fuel in this more now that we drained that truck come on nat ill help carol said she took his hand possessive as hell yeah lets get at it roger said rosalee was already tossing away light debris in an hour they had a pathway he could drive through the four of them piled into the rabbit i dont remember asking either of the women not that it matters reynolds isnt going to leave that one behind and theres room for rosalee i might as well get her story where to reynolds asked colorado springs the governments got to be there east rosalee shouted away from the snouts im for that reynolds agreed they drove up the ramp you sure theyre gone carol asked yeah roger said i looked they came out of the structure lauren kansas looked like berlin after world war ii buildings were gutted bodies lay in the streets not just the pile the snouts had created but others as well godalmighty damn roger muttered he threaded his way through the debris all that in revenge for one tank traitors reynolds said they were killing traitors or rogues or crazies what the hell do you mean by that rosalee demanded we surrendered reynolds said as far as theyre concerned we surrendered and then we attacked them that doesnt make sense carol protested i wonder roger drove past another ruined building how do you know nat reynolds laughed i dont im guessing but look gang im not a scientist and im not a newsman when i guess wrong nothing happens maybe i even sell the story if you guess wrong here youll get us all killed rosalee snarled shall i stop guessing we could die that way too because im the only expert youve got when they reached the end of the debris he turned south despite the others protests there was no sign of an enemy schemes no battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy ancient military maxim countdown h plus hours the engineers who built message bearer must have considered the communal mudroom expendable they had located it just inside the hull this had its advantages under spin a srupks depth of mud fonned a shell inside the hull it would shield the ship from an unexpected attack mud boiling from a rent would freeze in place a plug to hold air the mudroom was under full spin gravity winterhomes mass and surface gravity had been established by telescopic studies a year before the ship reached the ringed giant for sixteen years since birth in many cases the communal mudroom had taught fithp to move under winterhome gravity warriors bound for the surface would have at least that advantage it was the biggest room aboard message bearer covering an eighth of the hull surface of the life support region from the middle it curved out of sight in both directions the mud was good stickywet horneworld dirt below with nearly clear water floating on top fathistebtulk remembered the ceiling as oppressively close and bare it was still close but not oppressively so generations of spaceborn had decorated it with painted friezes above his head was a fullsized representation of a thuktun a weathered granite rectangle covered with script and with a centered representation of a thuktun which was covered with script and a representation of a thuktun which fathistehtulk wondered if the priest fistartehthuktun had ever seen this part of the ceiling such a thuktun would be a legendary thing the thuktunthp spoke of every subject a fi could imagine but none spoke of the thuktunthp themselves nor of their makers fathistebtulk was the only sleeper in a crowd of spaceborn its not that we dont trust planets the gangling warrior said we trust one planet the homeworld the world on which you were born sir we trust other worlds to obey other rules mating seasons fathistehtulk said half listening he filled his mouth and sprayed water at a spaceborn female barely mature who had been avoiding him this social barrier between spaceborn and sleepers had to be broken even if done one fi at a time there was power in fathistebtulks lungs she preened in the spray then sprayed him back she was just able to reach him the gangling warriorrashinggith something like thatwas still talking exactly the target world orbits in about seven eighths of a homeworld year after three generations in space we still follow a mating season of one year and the sleepers because they were wakened at the wrong time i know during your mating season we feel a discomfort an itch we cant wet its the same with us so will both mating seasons be skewed on the target planet the spaceborn dissidents did not obey the custom established by the herdmaster they would not call the target world winterhome suppose some of us adjust and some do not a few generations on the target world and we could all be mildly in heat all the time woo two mating seasons a year might be fun if it comes it will come whether we land or not and thats only one possible problem there are bound to be parasites we never adjusted to a voice bellowed through the room tulk i am summoned fathistehtulk said and he moved toward the voice of his mate answering with a cheerful tulk moving among sleepers now spraying muddy water to greet friends he passed beneath an older frieze the time was mating season by the state of the foreground plants and the activities of halfseen fithp among the trees he had worked on this basrelief himself he was pleased to see that it had been kept up repainted but these next ones were recent here a swath of jet black powdered with white points and a small pattern of concentric rings the winterhome sun repeatedly outlined as it grew larger over the decades there the ringed stormball with its company of moons and the raggedly curved horizon of the foot with a mining party around a digit ship tanker tulk he stopped his dawdling she waited impatiently at the exit smatter than the average female chowpeentulk was turning massive with the increase in her unborn child she said come we must discuss the platform elevator lifted them into a corridor fathistehtulk said we are halfway between winterhome and the foot what can be urgent you were among dissidents so i was dissidence isnt forbidden tulk i think it will be soon the dissidents claim thatthe war for winterhome is unnecessary i remind you that we are fighting that war now will you persuade warriors not to fight even as they struggle with the prey need i remind you that fookerteh is even now on the ground of winterhome and that he is the favorite of kturfookeph ive said little mostly i listen what i hear makes sense we reached the ringed gasball with the ship depleted of virtually every necessity within three years message bearer was resupplied we could have left then if we had not needed the foot or we could have stayed as long as we liked fathistehtulk had not bred her when mating season followed the awakening this was common enough even expected among males who had lost status chowpeentulk remembered that she had been almost relieved her next child would not be of fighting age during the war for winterhome the traveler herd had reached the ringed gasball and were at work on the foot when her season came again again her mate was impotent perhaps she had treated him badly then she remembered her own irritability well enough the next season he had recovered and the season after that had borne fruit her mates status as the herdmasters advisor had been enough he had recovered his selfrespect she had been slow to recognize the other change in him fathistehtulk was still talking space holds most of the resources we need and no prey to be robbed we tulk have you forgotten what it is like to wallow in natural mud beneath an open sky to take natural prey the difference between a shower and rain he hesitated no then what is this nonsense ive talked to spaceborn they dont remember they dont miss it tulk weve started the war and that is well but if we have to back off we know the natives cant follow us we should be prepared for this a generation hence we may be trading with them nitrogen for refined metals trading with fragile misshapen things that look like they would fall over any moment isnt that better than enslaving them into the traveler herd we would then be living with them can you picture them as our equals generations from now that is the fate of successful slaves he laughed as she flinched from that picture it wont hurt to keep those now in power a little unbalanced i want to keep their minds working the dissidents are doing something worthwhile that dangerous destructive humor she simply hadnt noticed in time fathistehtulk was not mad exactly not suicidal he would never hurt the traveler tribe or his family or their cause but political interactions just didnt mean anything to him anymore nor did his mates authority in matters of family in the twelve years that passed between her first and second pregnancies he had lost his sense of these nuances too we are at war she said when a herd moves it must not scatter to the winds it may be a needless war certainly these think so let them do their work without your support youre damaging the position of all sleepers the first step is docility we have not joined a new tribe our tribe was captured from within tulk it may be that i am wrong i intend to find out how but that he would not tell her jenny led the way inside the large conference room was filled with sound although there werent more than a couple of dozen people in the room knots of people mixed groups of science fiction writers uniformed officers and civilian defense analysts stood at blackboards others around tables viewscreens had been set up to show what was displayed on the big situationroom screens it reminded jenny of the newsroom at jpl during the saturn encounter theres ed one of the officers was her brotherinlaw ed gillespie shed heard about his arrival but shed been too busy to see him thered been nothing useful in his report on the mission to deliver congressman dawson to kosmograd and jenny had no time for social visits jack clybourne came in after jenny he looked nervously at the crowd in the room seems all right he said but he watches everyone just the same jenny advanced into the room ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states she got a reaction to that all the military people jumped to attention the sciencefiction writers stared curiously then those sitting down remembered their manners and stood the babble quieted although there was an undertone of whispered conversation the president came in with admiral carrell and general toland he looked blankly at the large mom with its disorderly crowd carry on admiral carell said well major its your show yes sir jenny led the way to the blackboard where ed gillespie stood with the group of writers whod been chosen as spokespeople anson of course he doesnt look very strong dr curtis joe ransom i guess sherry atkinson was too shy by the time the president arrived the writers were talking to each other but they fell silent when he reached them the president nodded to ed gillespie glad to see you general he turned to let jenny introduce him to the writers mr president this is robert anson hes the senior man among the writers mr president anson said formally he introduced the others david coffey the president said major crichton says youve got something for me yes sir anson said thank you for coming ill not waste more time in pleasantries first it now seems clear that their objective is conquest either of the earth or of a substantial part of it the evidence says they want it all what evidence is that the president asked he sounded curious rather than demanding they chose to attack the united states anson said clearly the strongest nation on earth but anson fell silent at the interruption but when the president didnt say anything else he continued clearly the strongest nation at least as seen from space roads dams cities cultivated lands harbors electronic emissionsall would indicate that the united states is the dominant nation anson looked around as if for contradictions but no one said anything yet they chose to land here and according to all the intelligence reports we have theyre setting up a perimeter defense as if they intend to stay well see about that general toland muttered anson raised an eyebrow toland looked around nervously were planning a big attack he said in about two hours with what dr curtis demanded toland looked at the writer with disapproval it will be a large assault the president said mr anson i agree that they intend to stay do they have a choice i dont see how they can expect to launch enough ships to get their people off the earth lasers curtis said they all looked at him he shrugged and pointed to anson sorry its bobs turn well let dr curtis explain in a moment anson said we agree then that theyve come to stay despite their early successes i would be greatly surprised if they expected this first effort to succeed eventually well win throw them out of kansas surely they expect that therefore they plan other attempts one supposes they will make certain preparations for those attempts what might they do the president asked anson turned to joe ransom mr ransom will address that theyve already used kinetic energy weapons ransom said its clear that any ship capable of crossing interstellar space will have a very powerful engine mr president i think theyll drop a dinosaur killer the president looked puzzled but joe ransom was only hitting his stride an asteroid some nine kilometers across very probably killed the dinosaurs and wiped out most of the life on earth at the time theres a layer of dead clay that corresponds to that era and we find asteroidal material in it all over the worldbut skip the evidence it almost doesnt matter what matters is that the aliens have already thrown rocks and theyve got the power to move a small asteroid weve got the mathematics to work out the results the effects will be global and very bad theres an understatement jenny thought jacks scared too well we ought to be depending on how large and where it strikes an asteroid could do just about anything anson said tidal waves may destroy many coastal cities cloud cover we could get weeks or months of endless night and endless rain it could trigger a new ice age you cant be sure theyll hit us with an asteroid the president said its the way to bet i wish we could guess how big it will be mr president anson said they obviously have the ability to do it theyve been out in space for fifteen years surely theyve thought of it i see coffey nodded seriously is there anything we can do about it admiral carrell demanded could we deflect it how they shoot down anything we send up curtis said so what do we do admiral carrell asked anson turned to the other writer dr curtis has given that some thought wade well never beat them while they own space curtis said as long as they control space they can find junk to hit us with one dinosaur killer after another blunt son of a bitch jenny thought we cant stop them from bombarding us with asteroids until we can take control of space again and well never get space away from them while they have that mother ship curtis continued perfect naval doctrine admiral carrell said but a navy needs ships dr curtis orion curtis said old bangbang the president looked puzzled and jenny thought curtis looked pleased as he turned to the blackboard not too often a writer gets to lecture to the president of the united states take a big metal plate curtis said big and thick make it a hemisphere but it could even be flat put a large ship say the size of a battleship on top of it you want a really good shock absorber system between the plate and the ship now put an atom bomb underneath and light it off i guarantee you that sucker will move he sketched as he talked you keep throwing atom bombs underneath the ship it puts several million pounds into orbit in fact the more mass youve got the smoother the ride admiral carrell looked thoughtful and once in space the tactics are simple curtis said get into space find the mother ship and go for it throw everything we have at it ram if we have to hard on the crew the president said youll have plenty of volunteers sir ed gillespie said the whole astronaut corps for starters true enough most of them had friends at moon base odd they did use nuclear weapons there but nowhere on earth is thisorionfeasible admiral carrell asked curtis nodded yes the concept was studied back in the sixties chemical explosive test models were flown it was abandoned after the treaty of moscow banned atmospheric nuclear detonations as far as i know though michael is the only quick and dirty way we have to get a battleship into space michael the president asked sony sir weve already given it a code name the archangel michael cast satan out of heaven appropriate enough name however our immediate problem is to get them out of kansas that does no good curtis said as long as they own space they can land whenever and wherever they want and theres damned little we can do about it mr president we have to get to work on michael now the president looked thoughtful perhaps i agree he turned to ed gillespie general were pretty shorthanded here i believe youre presently without an assignment yes sir good i want you to head up the team for project archangel look into feasibility armament who you need for a design team where youd build it how long it would take report to admiral carrell when you know something perhaps these gentlemen can help you he looked to the writers sure curtis said one thing though yes we could use my partner nat reynolds last i heard he was in kansas city combat area general toland said nats pretty agile though he may have got away and hes just the right kind of crazy curtis said earnestly major crichton can see to that the president said now to return to something you said earlier lasers yes sir curtis said i believe theyll use lasers to launch theft ships from the ground why why wouldnt they theyve got good lasers much better than we have and its certainly simple enough if youve got lasers and power i asked the wrong question coffey said how curtis looked smug again he sketched if you fire a laser up the back end of a rocketa standard rocketmotor bell shape but thickyou get much the same effect as if you carried rocket fuel aboard but theres a lot more payload because you can leave your power source on the ground your working mass your exhaust is air and vaporized rocket motor hotter than hell with a terrific exhaust velocity it uses a lot of power but itll sure work pity we never built one where would they get the power the president asked theyve blown up all our dams they cant just plug into a wall socket curtis pointed to a photograph pinned to his blackboard it showed a strange winged object fuzzily seen against the back ground of space ransom found that picture among a lot of them major crichtons people gave us to look at he said joe ransom shrugged an amateur astronomer brought that in to the intelligence people i dont know how he talked the guards into getting it inside but i ended up with it it looks like theyre deploying big solar grids way up in geosynchronous orbit we looked into building those the president said sure curtis said dryly but space power satellites were rejected too costly and too vulnerable to attack theyre vulnerable not to anything we have now curtis said to attack something in space youve got to be able to get at space coffey looked around for support admiral carrell shrugged its true enough he said theyll shoot down anything we send up long before it can get that high so what can we do archangel ed gillespie said when we send something up it needs to be big and powerful and well armed ill get on it and meanwhile theyre throwing asteroids at us the president said general i think youd better work fast he turned to go one more thing mr president curtis said insistently yes todays attack i suppose youll be sending in lots of armor the president looked puzzled well do it right doctor general toland said he turned to leave and id like to get at it thor curtis said toland stopped whats that it sounds like something ive heard of project thor was recommended by a strategy analysis group back in the eighties curtis said flying crowbars he sketched rapidly you take a big iron bar give it a rudimentary sensor and a steerable vane for guidance put bundles of them in orbit to use it call it down from orbit aimed at the area youre working on it has a simple brain just smart enough to recognize what a tank looks like from overhead when it sees a tank silhouette it steers toward it drop ten or twenty thousand of those over an armored division and what happens holy shit toland said are these feasible admiral carrell asked yes sir anson said they can seek out ships as well as tanks but we never built them curtis said we were too cheap we would not have them now in any case carrell said general perhaps you should give some thought to camouflage for your tanks or call off the attack until theres heavy cloud cover curtis said im not sure how well camouflage works another thing look out for laser illumination thor could be built to home in that way yes we use that method now toland said his tone indicated triumph these guys didnt know everything maybe we should delay the attack the president said general toland glanced at his watch too late with our unreliable communications some units would get the word and some wouldnt the ones that didnt would go in alone and theyd sure be slaughtered on that score weve got to get back up to operations thank you gentlemen the president said as they left jenny heard curtis muttering what do they do if it doesnt work theyll have to call the russians for help the sign read elvira it couldnt have been a large town to begin with now it was deserted except for some military vehicles there were soldiers in camouflage uniforms at the entrance to the elvira little league playing field brooks stopped the car what in the backseat reynolds struggled to wakefulness where are we not far from humboldt brooks said he got out rosalee half awake now got out on the passenger side nat eased himself out from under carols head and arm and wiggled out past the drivers seat carol stretched out in the backseat without waking roger had seen people sleep like that after some disaster in the dark of carol norths mind kinks were straightening out or not she would wake sane or not you cant park that here one of the soldiers shouted he was a very young soldier and he looked afraid thered been an edge of panic in his voice too out beyond him the little league field was covered with troops they huddled around small fires plenty of soldiers no tanks no vehicles at all why further down the road and on the other side in what had been a park was a big tent with a bright red cross on it other tents had been put up next to it there were stretchers outside the tents a mash unit nat reynolds said he kept his voice low full up from the stretchers outside roger rosalee i think we better get out of here not yet brooks went up to the soldiers at the gate he showed them his press card what happened soldier nothin roger pointed to the mash something did maybe look you cant park that thing here they shoot at vehicles maybe at cars move it damn it move it then think about going on foot in a second can you call an officer the soldier thought about that for a moment yeah he shouted back into the camp sarge theres a guy here from the washington post wants to talk to the lieutenant they went from the lieutenant to the colonel in one step by then rosalee was back in the car but nat wasnt he found that odd but he trailed along we dont have facilities for the press colonel jamison was saying in fact mr brooks we dont have accommodations for civilians at all and i dont see any reason why i should talk to you brooks looked around the tent it held two tables and a desk a field telephone and a canteen hanging from the center pole colonel im the only national press reporter here jamison laughed and where are you going to publish roger gave him an answering chuckle okay i dont even know if my paper exists anymore but surely the people have a right to some news coverage of this jamison spoke slowly from exhaustion ive never been sure of that whatever happened to loose lips sink ships okay mr brooks im going to tell you what happened but not for the reason you think then why jamison pointed to nat reynolds your friend there nat reynolds looked up from the map hed been studying what youre an important man mr reynolds colonel jamison said we have a total of no fewer than forty messages from colorado springs and one of them asks us to watch out for you thats why lieutenant carper brought you to me were supposed to cooperate with you and send you back to cheyenne mountain first chance we get now why is that reynolds thought it over and smiled wade the colonel waited dr wade curtis my partner he must be working with the government it follows that hes alive reynolds looked back down at the map were still a long way from colorado if we cant go through kansas we cant jamison said god knows we cant so what did happen brooks asked jamison sighed nothing to brag about this morning we were supposed to make a big push throw the goddam snouts all the way back to emporia went pretty good at first and then then what then they stamped us flat a whole armored division three divisions jamison shook his head as if to ward off the memory the tanks went in everything was fine we saw some of those floating tanks they use and we shot the shit out of them then these streaks fell out of the sky lines of fire hundreds of themparallel slanting like rain in a wind they pointed at our tanks and the tanks exploded thor reynolds said as if he were talking to himself he looked up from the map thats what it was you know what did that to us yah it wasnt just science fiction reynolds said wonderingly reynolds what did they do to my men its an orbital weapon system they dropped meteors on you colonel there wasnt anything you could do shall i explain sure but not just to me jamison said marty marty get on the line and see whats keeping mr reynoldss transportation they need him back at the springs the helicopter came an hour later rosalee was over by the car pacing but carol was awake and frightened what will happen to me nat you cant leave me here no of course not reynolds looked around helplessly for someone in charge he shouted toward the chopper and a uniformed woman came out a major by god jenny roger brooks caned jenny its me roger can you take me to the springs roger hi no theres not room you have to make room reynolds shouted for carol jenny shook her head mr reynolds we have several hundred miles to go the fuel situation is critical we cant carry extra weight picture of a torn man brooks thought so what will he do carols not heavy reynolds said ill leave my suitcase no major crichton was firm mr reynolds youll endanger all of us if you insist believe me your friend is safer here then why am getting into that thing reynolds demanded because the president of the united states told me to bring you jenny said sergeant help mr reynolds aboard reynolds spread his arms broadcasting helplessness if they want me that bad sony carol he let the army sergeant assist him into the helicopter major crichton climbed in after him she turned in the doorway to wave then the door closed and the engine revved up and now ive got five hundred miles to go fuel for six hundred and two women to worry about come on ladies roger said well just have to take the low road war plans the rules of conduct the maxims of action and the tactical instincts that serve to gain small victories may always be expanded into the winning of great ones with suitable opportunity because in human affairs the sources of success are ever to be found in the fountains of quick resolve and swift stroke and it seems to be a law inflexible and inexorable that he who will not risk cannot win john paul jones countdown h plus two weeks jenny laid the printed copies of the agenda on top of the yellow tablets and stepped back to admire her work then she grinned wryly it didnt look much like the cabinet room in the white house instead of a big wood conference table there were two formicatopped folding tables set together most of the chairs were army issue folding chairs although they had managed to get one big wooden armchair for the center of the table a slide projector was set up at one end of the room jenny inspected it turning the light on and off in addition to the places at the table another score of chairs faced the presidents seat in the center the us and presidential flags stood behind the chair they looked out of place against a bare wall itll have to do whats that jack clybourne came in the conference room jenny said jack nodded made you a secretary did they somebodys got to do it jenny protested we dont have a full staff and gotcha yep heck they have me typing his appointment list jack said not that i mind gives me something to do she grinned not going to search for bombs in the flag stands phooey whatcha doing after dinner i dont knowwhy my roommates going outside jack said he grinned of course i could clean up my room you can do that tomorrow see you about midnight now ive got to go get my sciencefiction writers three aides sat at chairs near the wall no one else was in the room it would fill according to rank with the most junior coming in to wait for the more senior jack clybourne studied the names on his list joe dayton from georgia the speaker of the house of representatives hed be the highestranking man after the president senator alexander haswell of oregon the president pro tern of the senate senator raymond can from kansas admiral carrell hap aylesworth with no title listed after his name mrs connie fuller secretary of commerce jim frantz chief of staff general toland arnold biggs secretary of agriculture theyd all have seats at the table jenny came in with the sciencefiction people robert anson he seemed older than the last time jack had seen him dr curtis and a new one this is nathaniel reynolds jenny said mr reynolds jack clyhourne is in charge of security for the president hi reynolds said he looks confused not that i blame him jenny conducted the writers to chairs near the wall then she went out again after a few minutes she returned with an older woman attractive if a bit used important and not on my list at all this is mrs carlotta dawson jenny said aha thank you jack waited to see where jenny would seat her at the table but at one end facing the president but with her back to the writers and staff jenny went out again a few minutes later the rush began ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states jack clybourne announced formally he does that well jenny thought and its needed a formality to remind us that what were doing is important that this is the real thing president coffey took his place at the table he noticed the flags and acknowledged jenny with a nod then he nodded to the chief of staff jim yes sir frantz indicated the xeroxed agenda sheets as you can see we have a lot to cover item one appointments the president has appointed admiral thorwald carrell as secretary of defense mr griffin who formerly held that post will become under secretary and remain with the vice president admiral carrell will also retain the post of national security advisor lieutenant general harvey toland is promoted to general of the army and has been designated commanding general of the united states aimed forces the vice president the rest of the cabinet and a number of congressional leaders will remain in the alternate command post frantz continued for the moment the congress is represented by the speaker and the president pro tern of the senate mr speaker joe dayton stood mr president this is mrs carlotta dawson being that congressman dawson is missing weve asked mrs dawson to take his place sort of represent him its not strictly constitutional but nothings very normal just now the president nodded wearily thank you mr speaker mrs dawson welcome aboard we all pray for your husbands safe return thank you mr president theres another reason for mrs dawson to be here speaker dayton said shes brought in our first by god captive invader and that got a reaction jenny almost laughed but she managed to control her face what if id brought harry redd to this cabinet meeting thank you mr speaker jim frantz said to return to the agenda our first item of business the secretary of defense admiral carrell didnt stand theres little to say early this morning we launched a nonnuclear attack employing three regular army armored divisions supported by a number of national guard units and all the military aircraft we could muster as you all know they were utterly defeated there were murmurs but no one said anything the enemy used a variety of advanced weapons carrell continued the most important were lasers groundbased and orbital and spacebased kinetic energy weapons flying spears if you prefer to think of them that way they seek out and destroy armored vehicles the lasers intercept our missiles they also backtrack and home in on missile launch sites and artillery the groundbased laser weapons are radar directed and sufficiently powerful to punch their way through cloud cover the result was not merely the defeat of our forces but their near annihilation major crichton has recently visited the headquarters of third army major how would you describe what you saw sir it was a disaster area jenny said found only one general officer the rest were killed or missing the mash was overfilled and the only vehicles were commandeered civilian machines or the very few that hadnt been committed to the attack thank you carrell said evenly was it your opinion that the attacking forces gave it their best god yes admiral we could give out a hundred posthumous silver stars without even trying you agree general toland carrell asked yes sir we took our best shot that concludes my report mr president there was stunned silence jesus the speaker said admiral general toland what did we do to the enemy mr speaker i dont know admiral carrell said to the best of my knowledge very little they whupped us dayton said in his careful drawl yes sir they whupped us so what do we do now the speaker demanded use nukes general toland said thats what were here to decide the president said you cant mike kansas senator can was adamant no way we dont have any choice general toland said choice be damned can shouted gentlemen jim frantz said senator i agree its an extreme measure the president said but what else can we do the aliens must be driven off this planet at the expense of my people senator we arent saving the people of kansas by doing nothing the invaders are slaughtering them major crichton you were there describe what you saw yes sir sergeant sergeant malley turned on the slide projector photographs of a pile of bodies at least fifty covered one wall of the room there were gasps we took these pictures in lauren kansas much of the slaughter was witnessed by mr nat reynolds a member of our special advisory staff mr reynolds will answer questions later mr president our attacking forces found a number of such scenes during the brief period of their advance refugees report that wholesale slaughter of hostages is their general response to any act of resistance next slide sergeant she showed another dozen pictures before mercifully turning the lights back on senator carr looks sick well he might i dont feel very good myself mr reynolds the speaker said you saw this happen nat reynolds stood yes sir more or less why did they do that the president demanded reynolds explained the attack as soon as the one tank was destroyed the other started shooting and they called in the lasers after theyd shot up enough buildings they went hunting individual people and when they found anyone they killed him and added him to the pile jesus senator can crossed himself they thought they were killing traitors reynolds said what does that mean the president asked theyre herd beasts i doubt they do very much on their own initiative as far as they were concerned the whole town had surrendered and when they were attacked the whole town was in rebellion its the way their minds work major crichton the president said youve been interrogating the captured alien yes sir do you agree with their assessment we havent learned much from the prisoner except his name sir name rank and serial number eh no sir he seems totally cooperative its just that hes confused hes insane curtis muttered or certainly will be why do you say that dr curtis admiral carrell asked herd beast curtis said what nat saidthey dont do things on their own initiative like elephants like zebras isolate one of them and what happens he shrugged so were trying to bring this one into our herd it might work too president coffey looked interested how do you do that never leave him alone curtis said talk to him reynolds said surround him with people until he believes hes human curtis finished have you learned anything useful the president demanded no sir jenny said we know they took prisoners from kosmograd carlotta dawson said ah thats good news president coffey said then he frowned i suppose its good news at all events we must decide what to do now during the fifty years since its first construction the underground complex east of moscow had been decorated air conditioned carpeted and enlarged there were swimming pools barbershops and fine restaurants the reinforced concrete walls were covered by tapestries and paintings and everything had been done to disguise the fact that it was at bottom a bomb shelter party first secretary narovchatov strode on parquet wooden floors to the chairmans office and remembered another time long ago when stalin had reviewed a guards division during the great patriotic war against hitler the germans were so close that the guards had marched across red square and walked directly to the front to take part in an attack from review to engagement with the enemy he thought that will not happen now the enemy is not so close but there are enough enemies tartars hungarians poles latvians czechs were in open revolt and many others even the ukrainians were restless narovchatov strode past the chairmans secretary halt comrade narovchatov narovchatov looked up in surprise a guards division colonel stood with three armed soldiers i regret comrade narovchatov that we must search you there was a roar of laughter from inside the office chairman petrovskiy appeared in the doorway he chuckled again it is well that you are alert comrade colonel petrovskiy said but i think you need not be so diligent with the first secretary who is after all my oldest friend come in nikolai nikolayevich my thanks comrade colonel return to your duties nikolai nbrovchatov closed the massive door behind him and stood against it he had not had time to react now he thought of the situation outside and frowned da chairman petrovskiy said it can be that serious come and sit i have much to tell you will you have vodka or whiskey i will join you in a cognac narovchatov took the drink and sat in front of the massive desk to humanity petrovskiy said no idle toast they drank not an idle toast at all the chairman said i had a call today from the american president ah a very strange call petrovskiy continued the americans want our help as we need theirs narovchatov said exactly did you tell them this in part i told them that unless they undertook to restrain the germans we would not be interested in talking with them petrovskiy paused dramatically they agreed instantly i heard the president give the orders but of course i could not be certain petrovskiy continued but i believe they were sincere nikolai nikolayevich they are truly desperate the alien invasion is succeeding narovchatov shook his head in disbelief as he had when he first heard that an alien armyof small elephantshad landed in the american heartland succeeding da the enemy holds their breadbasket the source of their grainand the americans have been unable to dislodge them they have lost some of their best military units for a moment narovchatov felt triumph then his grin faded but anatoliy vladimirovich if they cannot drive the aliens from the planet if they cannot we certainly could not the chairman said grimly nikolai nikolayevich no matter who wins we have lost it will be many years before we regain our strength do you agree da anatoliy vladimirovich even if there were no military difficulties even if we regained control of the provinces and the warsaw nations without further difficulty it will take years merely to replace the dams and bridges i believe we must help the americans petrovskiy said slowly how in every way we can they have a plan a coordinated attack on the enemy ships in space and on the alien forces in kansas we will both use our remaining strategic rockets we have few enough left narovchatov said i know the chairman paused the americans also want us to use submarine forces for what some to fire at enemy ships in space some to fire at kansas at kansas they also wish us to fire longrange strategic rockets at kansas to bomb kansas narovchatov said wonderingly anatoliycomrade chairman this is madness da the kgb believes that too they know of this petrovskiy nodded my call was recorded i had not known that trusov could do thatbut within minutes after the president called he was here he admitted listening to you da he professed loyalty but regarded conversations with the americans as a matter of state security narovchatov thought furiously thus the colonel and his guards outside your office and elsewhere i have sent them to your quarters and to protect your daughter and grandchildren are things that serious then petrovskiy shrugged chairman trusov was nearly hysterical he could not believe that i might seriously consider this proposition let the aliens destroy the united states he said the enemy of my enemy is my friend and the americans are the enemies of communism everywhere the aliens are herd beasts they will respect communism that is why they have invaded the united states the americans have lost only one state they have fifty let the aliens weaken them more that is what he said could he be right do you believe so narovchatov shook his head slowly no these aliens these elephants iare the real enemy they will enslave us all the chairmans face clouded and that we will not permit he said his frown deepened and he pounded his fist against the desk no one shall rule us russia shall always remain independent the worst of the czars knew that much russia shall obey orders from no outsider we must not allow that narovchatov sighed you are correct as always anatoliy vladimirovich but i am afraid the kgb is everywhere and if they resist what shall we do we will call your soninlaw and order him to work with marshal shavyrin together they will develop a plan narovchatov nodded agreement pavel aleksandrovich will be loyal he said have known shavyrin almost as long as i have known you petrovskiy said i can trust him within hours he can be with bondarev at baikonur but he must be warned when he joins bondarev he must take with him his loyal troops his headquarters guards and his personal staff it has come to this da narovchatov stood i will see to it he moved to the door then turned when anatoliy will russia ever have a government without fear he did not wait for an answer an octuple of warriors came for them gravity was next to nothing the humans moved in a chaotic cloud bounding from the corridor walls nikolai as agile as the rest warriors moved four ahead and four aft keeping orderly pace using slippers with surfaces like velcro that interacted with the damp rugs takpusseh and tashayamp waited where a section of rugcovered wall had been pulled up leaving a black hole greeting takpusseh said cheerfully we must find a task for you until number six digit ship arrives you will clean the air circulation system climbing is one thing you may do better than fithp you will find it easy now that thuktun flishithychaytrif what wes remembered that chaytrf meantfoot now that the mother ship is mated to a foot never mind tashayamp was distributing equipment to each human was given a sponge a bag like a plastic garbage bag a smaller bag filled with soapy water and a flashlight all had handles big metal loops suitable for a fis digits they were strung on a loop of cord the outer ducts need you most takpusseh said empty the collectors into the bag wipe the sides for this days mission circle this way spinward his trunk described a clockwise arc go as far as you can prove your endurance then come out at any grill summon the first warrior you see any warrior will escort you to your cells would the fithp really allow prisoners to explore their air duct system arvid and dmitri seemed as bemused as wes but they were obeying looping the line loosely around themselves best to assume that hed be watched even so wes would enjoy the chance to spy a little certainly the soviets would nikolai was being urged into the hole arvid and dmitri followed theyll assume that well want to stay together but i don think well have to wes moved toward the opening a branch of living hose looped around his ankle pause a moment takpusseh said dawson you are to be separated from the others from this moment raztupispminz is your teacher when you see a warrior tell him raztupispminz wes shrugged the soviets hadnt been good company lately the cause i attack you the cause we decide this go he moved through the air duets cleaning as he went the work was not difficult do what they want for now dmitri wants us docile he may be right for now he worked until he was too tired to go on five or six hours he thought there were wing nuts on the outsides of the grills fingers had to reach through the grills to turn them that was easy enough the wings were five inches across suited to fi digits wes was talking to himself before he realized that the screws turned the wrong way takpusseh must have wondered if the humans would be reduced to screaming for help through the grills he called to two passing warriors take me to raztupispminz one stopped wesdawson you are to go to a restraint room wes paused to refasten the grill then moved away between the warriors lorena brought the teapot more tea comrade marshal she asked thank you no marshal shavyrin said he glanced at the clock on the wall then at lorena pavel bondarev saw and made a tiny gesture of dismissal lorena left the room bondarev thought she closed the door heavily but if so marshal shavyrin did not notice it it is fantastic shavyrin said a hastily assembled report with bright red coven lay on bondarevs desk next to bondarevs ancient brass telescope shavyrin lifted the report and idly thumbed through the pages fantastic he repeated i agree bondarev said yet we must believe the telephone chirped bondarev touched a button to put the telephone on amplifier bondarev petrovskiy da comrade chairman bondarev said we have prepared the report you ordered marshal shavyrin is here good you are well leonid edmundovich da comrade chairman very well general bondarev you have spoken with the american generals da what they ask is barely possible comrade chainnan will it succeed bondarev looked helplessly at shavyrin the marshal was silent for a moment then said comrade chairman who can know yet it may be the only possible plan the timing however is very critical and your recommendation do we do this shavyrin was silent well the chairman demanded it is very critical shavyrin said finally part of their plan depends on their pershing missiles they are to fire them from germany to attack the alien spacecraft many of those missiles will come toward the soviet union there will be no way to know their real targetswhich might be moscow or kiev or our remaining missile bases there is more shavyrin continued whenever we have launched missiles the aliens have bombarded the base from which they came they will attack our remaining bases few strategic rocket forces will remain after this battle if the americans do not use their missiles we will be disarmed and nearly helpless and they will retain their strategic striking power suppose they do not launch their pershing missiles but keep them they could destroy us within minutes whenever they wanted and we would be unable to retaliate narovchatovs voice came onto the line is it your recommendation that we do not cooperate with the americans no comrade first secretary shavyrin said but it is my duty to make you and the chairman aware of all the implications we have very little time chairman petrovskiy said the american president is waiting for my answer he says the situation is desperate i am inclined to agree i must give him our decision now all depends on the pershing missiles shavyrin said if the americans do not launch themfor any reasonthen it is unlikely that our missiles will get through the enemy defenses if the americans are successful then some of our missiles will reach their targets bondarev the chairman demanded i believe this may be our last chance if we do not aid the americans now then the americans will be defeated and how long will it be before russia falls to the aliens your recommendation this is recorded not only the chairman the kgb will listen if we fail comrade chairman i recommend that we aid the americans provided that they use their pershing missiles all of their pershing missiles in both england and germany to assist our penetration you agree marshal shavyrin da with those conditions comrade chainnan there was a long silence then the chairman said very well i will inform the american president and we will soon tell you the time for this attack there was another pause then the chairmans voice came on again academician and general of the army pavel aleksandrovich bondarev and marshal leonid edmundovich shavyrin i instruct you to take command of all strategic forces of the soviet union including the submarine forces and to employ them in aid of the battle plan codenamed whirlwind if you jointly agree you are authorized to use all of the forces in your command in aid of the american effort to drive the aliens from the planet is this understood da comrade chairman shavyrin said pavel bondarev gulped hard da something in the air the enemy of my enemy is my friend arab proverb countdown h plus three weeks pavel bondarev looked up at the big clock on his wall ten minutes he said marshal shavyrin grinned da you are nervous comrade of course bondarev said with irritation we are about to make the most important decision in russian history should i not be nervous certainly but you will permit that i do not openly join you i have known for five years that i might be faced with this moment true bondarev said he looked at the twin electronics consoles installed against one wall of his underground office lights winked in complex patterns in the lower right corner of each console was a switch bondarev patted his throat to feel the key on its silver chain does it make it easier the peasants say you can become accustomed to anything even hanging if you hang long enoughwhat was that there were sharp sounds from outside bondarev went to the door no do not open that door shavyrin commanded he lifted his telephone colonel what is the situation he listened for a few moments they must not enter he snapped the cost does not matter our orders come from chairman petrovskiy himself do what you can what you must he said he put down the phone bondarev looked the question at him kgb shavyrin said they have sent soldiers as well as their agents my security forces are resisting them but pavel lifted the telephone get me chairman petrovshy shavyrin shook his head colonel polivanov has already reported that the kgb has cut the telephone lines we no longer have communications with moscow bondamv looked up in horror but before he could speak the door opened lorena came in what are you doing here bondarev demanded she hesitated for a moment then showed what was i her hand she held a small automatic pistol you are both under arrest in the name of state security she said no bdndarev shouted not you the kgb is everywhere shavyrin said he reached for the telephone stop that lorena shouted hysteria tinged her voice comrade i must speak to the rocket forces shavyrin said to order them to aid the americans she said never the aliens will destroy the soviet union then they will do it anyway shavyrin said understand this the americans are to launchhe glanced at the clock on the walleven now are launching their pershing missiles those missiles will come toward us they are supposed to provide a diversion to allow our missiles to penetrate but there is always the chance that the americans will use this as an opportunity to attack us with that in mind i have given orders that if the rocket forces do not hear from us they will attack the united states not attack kansas but all of the united states i know nothing of this she shouted you will move there to that wall away from the desk away from the telephones lorena bondarev said lorena you cannot do this he moved toward her she backed away stop i will shoot i will bondarev advanced the little gun spat at him he felt a sharp pain in his chest lorena he shouted he swayed against the wall she looked in horror pavel pavel as she spoke marshal shavyrin moved he lifted the brass telescope from bondarevs desk and swung it bringing it down on lorenas head striking so hard that the telescope bent over her head and a lens fell onto the floor she collapsed instantly shavyrin dropped the telescope and moved to close the door then he hurried to bondarev comrade he said pavel pavel heard him as from a distance he tried to take a deep breath but pain prevented him and he heard blood burbling in his lungs more shots sounded from outside in the corridors they seemed much closer iam alive bondarev said each word was an effort he looked at theclock it is time we must know did the americans fire the pershing missiles shavyrin lifted the telephone polivanov shavyrin here colonel did the americans fire their pershings there was a long pause i see shavyrin said do we have communications with the strategic forces i see thank you he put the telephone down the kgb has cut us off from all reports from the west he said carefully their spetsnaz troops came in such force that we could not hold all of this headquarters my troops chose instead todefend the command circuits which remain intact he pointed at the winking lights the keys will work comrade academician what do we do pavel breathed in short gasps it hurt terribly he collapsed in a chair in front of his console the pershings we will never know about the pershings shavyrin said and from the sounds in the corridors we do not have much more time as he spoke he unbuttoned the breast pocket of his uniform and took out a key he looked at it for a moment then inserted the key into his console and turned it you know more of these things than i pavel i have aimed my panel it is your decision now shavyrin drew his pistol and turned toward the door but i think you must decide quickly jt felt as if his head was padded with cotton wool each breath hurt and shavyrins voice seemed to fade and return what must do we cannot know we cannot know have the americans tricked us could the kgb be right lorena lay on his persian carpet the broken brass telescope lay over her left arm partly covering the expensive bracelet that pavel had bought her he could not see whether she was breathing the gunfire in the corridors outside was very close quickly pavel fumbled with his shirt buttons it seemed to take forever to open the links of the chain and when he tried to jerk it off it wouldnt break patience he opened the catch at last and for a moment stared at thebrass key then quickly and decisively he thrust it into the key switch and turned it one by one the lights on the board blinked from green to red it is done bondarev said da shavyrin said there was a loud click as he released the safety catch of his pistol there was something in the air it affected all fithp differently spaceborn females only felt a nervousness a wrongness they tended to snap back if approached wrongly sleepers were easily distracted they had to be held to their duties even spaceborn males felt a belligerent optimism as if their bodies wanted to dance or fight defensemaster tantarentfid had the air circulation running on high the only effect was a breeze something in the air even the human fithp might have known the difference among all the alien scents the sleeper mating season had begun the skewed mating seasons had come twice a year for fifteen years the herdmaster knew the feeling well but he couldnt help it he felt good all over the war was going well minor reversals had occurred on winterhome but the base was still in place we learn and this gathering will produce results pastempehkeph didnt use the display room much though his predecessor had it was too large for comfort he hadnt seen it since the history lesson since the day dawson attacked his own breaker he felt he needed it now message bearer could run itself for a few hours and screens wouldnt do it must be a full gathering he wanted to watch their body language seven fithp rested on their bellies in a circle the herdmaster his advisor both breakers the attackmaster the defensemaster and fistartehthuktun the herdmaster looked around at the fithp he had summoned he said we are going to leani why the humans behave as they do we will learn now even fathistehtulk looked uneasy and that was somehow gratifying priorities first defensemaster what is our status tantarentfid was the youngest present he was a smallish male space born mated father of two male children well below fighting age he was not known to have dissident leanings his predecessor who did had been retired while the foot was departing the ringed giant the defensemasters business was the survival of the traveler herd his domain included air systems food sources hull integrity the main drive course determinations the mounted digit ships and the lasers that would defend the ship from meteors or alien weapons he shared these last three domains with the attackmaster he answered readily enough message bearer is fully able to defend itself and well beyond attack range in any case main drive running well weve used more than half our fuel of course and that will have to be replaced sometime sixteen digit ships moored for boost and more returning from winterhome were on schedule well match with the foot in two days in twentytwo days well have set the foot on course as you and attackmaster koothfektilrusp may decide well disengage and leave winterhome on a fast parabola you have prey in the air ducts yes the breakers have had some success in training the human flthp they show a gratifying agility for two days now weve had them cleaning and reimpregnating the filters we had hoped that would take the mating scent out of the corridors but tantarentfid clawed the air perfunctorily well reserve the humans as backup to the automatic systems the breakers can best tell you whether they would react well during a real emergency good enough attackmaster koothfektilrusp hows the texture of the mud the attackmasters business was war i believe we can hold the base on land mass two he said digit ships are in transit with prisoners and loot if things continue to go well we will not need the foot but we must make that decision soon he paused then weve lost digit ship twenty how did you lose this digit ship koothfektilrusp reared up on his forelegs digit ship twenty was rising on a launch laser during heavy weather we believe that the beam itself precipitated a funnel storm the beam was blocked by clouds and debris the ship rose too slowly the pilot tried to land during that vulnerable period an aircraft fired a missile some losses had to be expected of course spaceborn had little grasp of planetary weather choose another topic attackmaster i have the impression that the prey continually repudiate their surrender they do your response the attackmaster looked uncomfortable which thuktun shall we read fithp do not do such things my warriors trample all humans within sixtyfour srupkithp of where prey break their bond to the traveler herd if a prey hides well enough to survive our wrath we take him to be sane and harmless but this is hard on my fithp herdmaster it is hard to crush those who have surrendered i have my problems too breakerone is the attackniasters approach correct i dont it wont teach them surrender herdmaster attackmaster koothfektilrusp has told us this they attack after surrender singly and in octuples and in still larger groups this goes beyond an epidemic of rogues it grows likely that the typical human resembles dawson and not the soviets they make their own decisions each an entire fithp wobbling on two legs killing those who were not involved in a breach of faith may accomplish nothing at all or give them reason to question our sanity dawson fumf the herdmaster considered he must have answers was he even asking the right questions to call such behavior insane is futile if all are insane advisor you have been uncommonly silent lead me herdmaster breakerone there is the matter of predictability if all are insane are they all insane in the same fashion not even that i have no complaints of the soviets but takpusseh stirred and fathistehtulk caught it breakertwo they keep secrets the soviets speak their own language though they practice the thuktunspeech too they know more of the air ducts than we have asked them to learn ask us again after digit ship six gives us more prisoners fathistehtulk turned to another source keeper of the thuktun what have you learned the prey are described as insane i remember the pflit of the homeworld speaking of the homeworld to a fellow sleeper fistartehthuktun waxed loquacious of course the pflit reproduced at a furious rate they were little mottled gray beasts the same colors as the sunward forest they lived in and the way they clustered made fithp look roguish an individual life meant nothing in the survival strategy of the pflit so they evolved no defense against predators and they migrated in swarms even if the path led off a cliff what insight are you seeking the prey throw their lives away but they dont breed faster than we do probably true takpusseh said you miss my point the advisor said is it not true that nature shapes life to fit its style of life were wasting time pastempehkeph thought but he wasnt sure and he didnt speak a herdmaster must trumpet softly lest a suggestion be taken for an order the life thukiun tells us so fistartehthuktun said slowly the thuktun of the long path shows how new forms arise from old evolution goes by groups by herds but ripper fthuggl live alone attacking their prey one on one all rogues they need room to find prey they meet only to mate fithp surrender in herds or accept surrender into the victor herd what style of life has shaped our prey the preythey dont surrender to superior force perhaps they die to guard genes related to theirs or think of a hunting carnivore takpusseh said in sudden excitement food is scarce so they scatter siblings might be separated by seas or mountains more dangerous predators come might a prey die to kill them because the marauders might reach its genotypes but humans are omnivores raztupispminz reminded them still the sky of winterhome seethed with aircraft before our attack i think you have it they do not remain in families like ripper fthuggl individuals go to make their own territory to kill something dangerous is for the good of all for surviving heroes it may even mean mating privileges to judge by our studies of their broadcasts we believe that they have no specific mating season indeed they do not always remain with one mate the herdmaster called them back to specifics what does this do for us if true into the uneasy silence fathistehtulk said it makes us aware of the awesome magnitude of our problem we take surrender in herds do we our prey doesnt come in herds a family might be scattered across half the planet surely whatever the attackmaster was about to say would never be heard his digits flipped back to cover his skullthe classic reflexive response to threatas he listened to the shellshaped phone under his earfiap it is not good news the herdmaster waited if there were danger to the ship both he and the defensemaster would know instantly what could be important enough to interrupt this meeting he knew soon enough the attackmaster took a microphone from his harness flee save what we can he returned the microphone herdmaster we no longer have a base in kansas how is this the prey have used thermonuclear bombs bombs rise among the orbiting digit ships but these can be stopped stopped of course but more bombs fall on our base and our ships are too busy to stop them bombs are rising from both land masses and from the sea prom both land masses the advisor looked thoughtful you are certain i am certain of nothing advisor they sow radioactive fire on their own croplands herdmaster i must certainly the herdmaster stood releasing his fithp to their duties they scattered what now he demanded what do you make of this advisor fathistehtulk struck at invisible flies would not tread on the breakers ground your advice drown you soviets and dawsons tribe cooperate when they must as we hear of our losses we must not forget this go fight your war he spoke to the herdmasters back roger brooks drove south then angled west for two days there had been cornfields and no sign of war rosalee was stretched out taking advantage of the now roomy backseat of the rabbit road conditions had been mixed good roads alternating with stretches where the highways and intersections were utterly destroyed its still a long way to colorado springs theres nothing on the radio and im half asleep roger asked carol are you slept out she hadnt spoken in hours her eyes were wide doing a continual slow swivel shejumped when he spoke and said yeah i must say thats the damnedest convention i ever half saw i believe it though i heard about one in st louis that was canceled and nobody told the guest of honor why do you go oh mostly we go to meet each other i guess and the people who write the books we read flicker of a smile there were three men for every two women and the ratio used to be even better and fun things tend to happen like the masquerades and listening to the dirty filksongs filksongs and half a dozen writers going off to dinner with an editor to pay and nat taking me along and the room parties and the elevator parties and smoffing damn she was crying i guess im in mourning im sorry about george but he did get a tank i dont think anyone could have stopped him did she blame roger apparently not george i thought that was stupid i told him so george her head was turned away watching the passing cornfields she broke a long silence in a sudden rush of words itll never happen again its all dead the publishing industry is probably dead half of science fiction is obsolete were all going to be scrabbling for something to eat for years to come and how can you hold a convention with no airlines she misses science fiction if the best troops in the army cant drive the aliens out the whole damn planet is doomed and she misses science fiction it came to him suddenly and frighteningly that the war might already be lost that first night nat had a threepound lobster savannah and he started talking to it hospital station thinks they can cure you the federation doesnt think your people can defend themselves alone now will you speak of your troop movements wretched crustacean by dessert we were calling him speaker to seafood her voice changed oh my god the corner of rogers eye had caught light brighter than sunlight he braked without looking what is it they it hitting us again he eased the rabbit over to the dirt rim of the highway before he dared look one glance was enough dont look he opened the door and slid out low follow me rosalee wake up and get out on my side stay low the blast came not as bad as he had expected followed by a wind followed by another blast and more wind the rabbits windows rattled by then all three were crouched on the highway side of the car there were more bright lights high overhead and another to the north when the light died a little roger peeked over the hood fiery mushrooms bloomed amidst the kansas wheat fields mushrooms i think this is the real thing he said not meteors atomic bombs and thats occupied territory those are ours bombing kansas roger laughed and meant it if youve got a better idea you should have been in the helicopter at least were fighting back he peeked again there were four firemushrooms in view all a good distance north a thread of actinic green light rose from hundreds of miles away something was blocking it at the skyward end something rising another fireball winked near the base of the beam roger ducked fast waited looked again fireball rising no laser beam an orange point high up drifting down what was that all about whatever lasers were aliens atomic bombs were men and the bomb had interrupted something come on guys roger gloated ruin their whole morning part footfall cleanup the destiny of mankind is not decided by material computation when great causes am on the move we learn that we ate spirits not animals and that something is going on in space and time and beyond space and time which whether we like it or not spells duty winston churchill rochester new york countdown h plus four weeks western kansas was a black dimpled land the army pilot gave the craters a wide berth flying carefully upwind a stutter tried to surface when he spoke and he spoke seldom his motions were jerky he couldnt have seen films of deathbeams spiraling in on other helicopters but rumors must have spread jenny guessed that he was waiting to be speared by green light sifting beside her jack clybourne was as calm as an oyster jenny saw reports from the observatories as they came in and she kept no secrets from jack earths most recent moons still included more than a score of destroyersized spacecraft but the mother ship had disappeared into interplanetary space with half its retinue and the remaining ships seemed to be doing nothing waiting if the pilot had known what jenny knew he might be calmer but the vivid green death was still possible jenny wasnt as calm as she looked jack clybourne was jennys own true love but he was not about to outmacho her from time to time at jennys orders the pilot skimmed low over burned cornfields and along broken roads the roads were strewn with hundreds of what might have been gigantic tablecloths in neonbright colors and thousands of dinnerplatesized pieces of flattened foam plastic the hangglider fabric would become clothing come winter for refugees who would be glad to have it but the alien landing shoes would be indestructible litter a hundred years from now farmers would still be digging them up in the cornfields would those farmers have hands or bifurcated trunks there were black skeletons of automobiles and corpses enough halfburned human and alien corpses to satisfy anybody the helicopter circled a village and jenny couldnt find a single unburned structure the inhabitants had fled ahead of the aliens and the aliens had fled from fission bombs and nobody remained to fight the fires rarely bands of refugees looked up to watch the helicopter pass few tried to wave it down jennys eyes kept straying to the alien ship it had been in sight for nearly an hour less than ten miles away now it dominated the flat black landscape it had fallen several miles it was foreshortened its hull split like a navy battleship dropped on its nose it must have loomed large in the refugees eyes like a coyote on a freeway a fi corpse lay in the road flattened to a pancake silhouette and rotted almost to its crushed bones its hang glider hadnt opened shed seen dead snouts here and there they stripped their dead but often left them where they lay cremation would have been easy enough stack the bodies and one blast of a fithp laser would do it the helicopter settled near the stern jenny and jack got out they walked alongside the ruined hull only the warships tail an outsize rocketnozzleshape with jet scoops facing forward had survived the crash intact the hull had split halfway along its length jack chinned himself on the edge of the rip nothing a fuel tank forward of the tank wall the hull had wrinkled and torn again from the bent nose a glassless window winked the opening squeezed almost shut where ripped metal gaped conveniently wide they climbed inside jack leading the way they came out faster than they went in jenny took off the gas mask and waited jack clybourne ran into the cornfield after a few moments she heard sounds of gagging she tried not to notice sorry he said when he came back sure i almost lost my lunch too first assignment i get outside you havent done any harm jenny said were not likely to do any good here either the ships a mess its a job for experts experts he looked at the wreckage youd send your dreamersforhire into that its their job jack shook his head he said well its for sure there werent any survivors yes too bad damn straight jeez youd think theyd have left some of their troops behind they must have been ready to evacuate just in case jenny said maybe they planned it that way maybe they did just what they came for kansas is gone this place is a wound a cemetery weve got no dams no highways no railroads and were afraid to fly and weve got one prisoner how many of our people did they get jenny shook her head i dont know a lot from the missing persons reports but we cant rely on those were stalling she thought look ive got to go back in alone no need for both of us to get sick no i wanted to come i wasnt doing any good inside the hole clybourne put on the gas mask rrready his voice sounded hollow from inside the mask they reentered the rip in the life support system the interior was twisted and bent crumpled walls showed crumpled machinery and torn wiring buried inside alien bodies lay in the corridors they stank too many days had passed since the combined us and soviet bombardment had driven the aliens back to space alien bodies had bloated and or ruptured jenny tried to ignore them they were someone elses job she hoped the biologists would come soon to remove them not that i know what im looking for she went deeper into the ship her flashlight picked out the remains of equipment wherever she pointed jack took photographs the whine of the recharger for his electronic flash sounded loud in the dead ship nothing was intact there cant be anything here or theyd have melted it from space wouldnt they how do they regard their dead ill have to ask harpanet get reynolds to ask him she cotrected herself the sciencefiction writers seemed to spend all their time with the captured alien and jenny couldnt face one not after this a large steel door lay ahead it had been locked but sprung partially open in the crash jenny pulled and it moved slightly she wasnt strong enough to move it farther jack slung the camera over his shoulder and took a grip on the door when they pulled together it opened just far enough to let them squeeze by the room was tremendous with a low ceiling and a padded floor that was now a wall it was filled with death for a moment she didnt recognize what she saw then her flashlight played across a human face a childs face sweetly smilingshe was relieved to see that it was a doll there was a white bloated thing wrapped in bright colored tartan under the doll jenny moved closer until her light showed what the doll rested on like a findtheface puzzle now her eyes found human shapes a knee the back of a head a man folded in two around a snapped spine but all piled together like melting clay they must have been jammed in like cattle here a shape that made no sense at all with human and snout features until it snapped into focus an alien guard must have struck like a bomb when the ship came down and at least three prisoners had been under him she gagged and bile filled her mouth splashed against the gas mask reflexively she lifted the mask the smells of death filled her lungs she turned and ran from the ship the bridge hummed with soft voices behind message bearer a glow was fading dying its death was carefully monitored one couldnt turn the main drive on and off like a light switch lest showers of lethal particles burst from the magnetic bottle and spray through the ship puffballs of flame streamed from sixteen digit ships mounted along the aft rim finetuning message bearers velocity bridge personnel watched the view from a sensor pod that reached out from the hull like a bigheaded metal snake pastempehkeph watched the screens letting it happen his flthp could manage this without his help thrust shifted him against the web that held him to his couch he watched a blackandgray mass approach his ship the foot was woefully changed within the outer fringe of the gas giants ring they had found a roughsurfaced white egg two makasrupkithp along the long axis against a backdrop of terrible beauty it had been like something out of the shape wars a heretical representation of the predecessors a featureless head lacking digits and body lacking everything but brain the mining team had chosen it for its size and composition out of an eightcubed of similar moonlets over the next ten homeworld years its icy strata had hatched water and air and fuel its rockandmetal core gave up steel alloys and soil additives for the garden section it was no longer an egg sixeighths of its mass was gone the ice was gone leaving ridges and gouges and runnels and pits in a makasrupklong nugget of black slag a faceless alien head had become an asymmetrical alien skull it drifted closer now an ugly omen i hoped that we could shunt it aside pastempehkeph said we gave ourselves the option said his advisor if the prey had proved tractable our present foray might have become a base of operations we might have taken winterhome without the foot pastempehkeph trumpeted in sudden rage why do they always wait to attack its not a serious question herdmaster fathistehtulk was placid as always we organized our foray over the past several years why would they not take a few eights of days to gather their forces so now they have used fission bombs on their own garden regions and i must admit that that seems excessive mad mad then if they are truly mad our problem is worse yet give thanks that it is the breakers problem not ours not yet it will be soon yes but digit ship six approaches with new prisoners and a considerable mass of loot the breakers should learn a great deal when it arrives the herdmaster trumpeted satisfaction that at least was as expected nothing else is why have the natives not sent messages before there was anything to say they wanted to talk fathistehtulk said now that we have some estimation of our relative strengths they say nothing no demands no offers twelve digit ships are destroyed and vast stretches of cropland and the preys herdmasters have nothing to say to us perhaps the breakers will learn why again that overly placid languid irritating voice there is nothing to be done the herdmaster told himself he is advisor what would i do in his place message bearer surged backward and shuddered a fi turned and said herdmaster we are mated to the foot soon we may begin acceleration have we a course this was the moment long ago the predecessors had destroyed a planet now continue the plan guide the foot to center its impact on winterhome the breakers group will find us a more specific target he stiffened suddenly in a lowered voice he said fathistehthlk i believe i forgot to do anything about the mudmom phoo defensemaster i saw to it that the mudroom was fully frozen before we stopped our spin tantarentfid said complacently i evacuated your private mudroom too herdmaster good well served pastempehkeph shuddered at a mental picture globules of mud filling the air fithp in pressure suits trying to sweep it away lack of a communal mudroom would cause its own problems henceforth every fi would be vaguely unhappyas if the skewed mating seasons were not enough he lifted his snffp high i drown in afloat of troubles fathistehtulk made sympathetic gestures not sympathy answers defensemaster bring the breakers the attackmaster and the priest to the conference pit we must make decisions regarding the prey and the foot attackmaster we have discontinued the base in kansas koothfektilrusp said digit ships are in transit with prisoners and loot we lost digit ship thirteen which carried the bulk of what we had gathered but we saved several prisoners and some material on other ships how was this one lost koothfektilrusps digits snapped back to cover his head did he feel threatened we did not anticipate that the american fieni would bomb their own major foodbearing domain we did not anticipate that the soviet herd would cooperate with them and that they surely did our beams stopped many of their suborbital bombs but many got through and the launch devices had moved before we could fire on them the ship thirteen was rising on a launch beam when a thermonuclear missile from a submarine vehicle destroyed the laser facility the bombs were they all from the soviet herd from desert territories on the soviet continent and from offshore of the american continent from submarine vehicles that were shielded by water when our lasers fell none of the thermonuclear devices came from the united states itself the herdmaster pondered that breakerone must we assume that the united states herd has surrendered to the other or has the soviet herd attacked our foothold in kansas risking their wrath raztupispminz glanced at takpusseh before speaking you must also consider that two human herds may cooperate when neither has surrendered to the other the herdmaster had feared this too many answers were no answer and yet we may prosper attackmaster koothfektilrusp said soothingly there is lithe industry little transportation in our chosen target area we may find genotypes clustered when we land following footfall footfall yes keep to specifics must the foot fall breakerone raztupispminz said they must be made to know that they are hurt takpusseh stirred but kept silent hurt in america they will starve they have seared their crops with radioactive fire the herdmaster took firm hold of his emotions the air was heady with pheromones and seven spaceborn males were ready to butt heads attackmaster the foot koothfektilrusps answer was predictable stomp them show our might we have chosen the location herdmaster this time we attack a weaker herd we must secure a foothold on winterhome and expand from there weather following footfall will make retaliation fficult fate gifts us with a side effect the weather worldwide will be wetter and mole to our liking show me koothfektilrusp lit the wall screen under his direction a globe of winterhome rolled and stopped the attackmasters digit indicated the body of water that rogachev called the indian ocean here in the center look how the waves expand from the impact point east they roll many makasrupkithp to the island nations north even further westward they cover the lowlands where we see city lights the highlands are left free northwest fuel sources that serve worldwide industry are drowned these herds that cooperated against us may still not cooperate with the savage herds of the southern hemisphere and wild air masses make transport impossible to them and where would they send their forces we might land east or west or north the rolling sea subdues the prey in all directions my sleeper aides tell me that the foot has the mass and velocity to do the work we want they would drown by eight to the eighths the herdmaster mourned in advance have you chosen our foothold here i think we would find not only mines but possible allies one problem herdmaster launching facilities will be a problem here or anywhere we must build in continual rain perhaps we must launch through rain requiring more laser power making a launch more conspicuous the herdinaster felt himself relaxing he knew military strategy this was easier than talking about the craziness of the prey which made his mind hurt advisor fathistehtulk vented a fluttering snort possible allies his digits swiped at thin air we cant know that the attackmaster snapped back they have little transportation we will find true herds when they surrender the herdmaster was tired enough do it your way attackmaster ive heard no better suggestion breakers keep me aware we must understand the prey we must teach them our way to your duties he waited while the rest scattered then fathistehtulk you know planet dwellers better than we have we erred could we win withozu the foot a herdmaster could not ask the advisor repeated what breakerone had said they must know that they have been hurt whether that will be enough herdmaster can you spare me now go fathistehwlk your mate nears her term the soviets moved in a series of horizontal leaps launching themselves down the corridor in long trajectories the gravity was very weak so weak that it took many seconds to fall from the center of a corridor to its wall nikolai found the conditions perfect he had no trouble keeping up with the others even though they used their legs for propulsion and he had to launch himself with arms alone sometimes he turned flips as he traveled through the corridor they keep dawson in his cell dmitri said for five days they have done this why arvid shrugged it did not seem to me that he caused them any special trouble perhaps takpusseh bears a grudge i think not dmitri cursed fluently dawson is a fool and may get us all killed we could strangle him arvid said dmitri looked thoughtful for a moment no we do not know how our captors will react docile comrade we will continue to be cooperative if they wish more geography lessons you will give them they learn nothing they have not obtained from childrens books from the united states they wish us to join their herd we will do so they reached the entry point nikolai removed the grill and climbed into the air duct dmitri and arvid followed when they had first been given the assignment arvid was sure that the ducts would be too small for fithp in an emergency a young fi might be sent in to make repairs but there were not even handholds for such a case yet would prisoners be let loose where they could not even be monitored surely there would be cameras he had thought the cameras would be hard to identify but they were not nikolai located a brushrinined ring of just the right size to fill a duct it was in a recess not moving there were glass eyes at opposite points and a metal tentacle coiled around the inner surface a cleaning robot during the next few days they looked for others occasionally one would be seen far down a tube it was comforting to know that they were watchedand how show your stamina takpusseh had said dawson wouldnt have the wit to hide his capabilities if they permitted him out of his cell they had not seen him for days dmitri and arvid and nikolai stopped when they were tired but before they were exhausted four days in a row today was the fifth day and it was timeto move a ringshaped duct cleaner was far behind them rolling on ball bearings in the outer rim arvid and dmitri moved side by side close together they had become good at that nikolai was ahead of them perhaps the cameras would not see him perhaps he would be seen but not observed in the waving of alien limbs three humans might well seem to be two if another duct cleaner appeared ahead dmitri would say casually another time none did nikolai spotted a side duct ahead he speeded up taking his cue arvid and dmitri speeded up too the curve of the corridor had left the duct cleaner behind when nikolai disappeared axisbound arvid stopped to clean out a dustcatch the robot had him in view when he caught up to dmitri the rabbit topped a final rise pikes peak had been visible ahead for hours now they could see its base the city of colorado springs lay spread out in the valley below them were here roger said now what carol asked are you sure nat is here will he want to see me yes and i dont know roger said what

thats for sure rosalee agreed maybe it will always be different meetings who travels alone without lover or friend but hurries from nothing to naught at the end ella wheeler wilcox countdown h plus five weeks digit ship six was moored in place at message bearers stem while fuel flowed into the digit ship chintithpitmangs eightsquared now reduced to fortyone moved through the airlock and forward along the mating tube the prisoners had suffered on the trip out hours after takeoff warriors checking their cell had found the air stinking with the smelt of halfdigested food they must have been breathing the stuff until the air flow pulled it out in freefall they were like fish out of water they acted like they were dying chintithpitmangs warriors had to tow them like baggage they towed other baggage food stocks maps books full of pictures tape cassettes and projection machines chintithpitmang himself moved clumsily one leg was braced straight and it interfered with his every motion a thermonuclear device had exploded near the ship just before takeoff chintithpitmang and six prisoners had slammed against a wall the prisoners with their negligible mass were barely bruised but chintithpitmangs right hind leg had snapped under him two octuples of warriors met them at the end of a makasrupk of tunnel they all looked irritatingly clean and healthy chintithpitmang was glad to mm his prisoners over to them if any died he preferred that another have them in charge he took the shortest route toward shreshleemang his mate would be waiting humans in a corridor startled him he was reaching for his gun before he realized that they must be prisoners they seemed to want something he glared at them and kept moving the next corner brought him face to face with fathistehtulk had the herdmasters advisor noticed may your time stretch long advisor he said and would have passed stay said fathistehtulk i need you chintithpitmang suppressed a fluttering snort of displeasure but the advisor sensed it anyway this is of massive importance and none other will do be persisted you are of the year zero fithp and a dissident so is your mate she will assume that yow duties kept you at the ship until you can explain to her come dmitri and arvid climbed wearily from the air duct two female fithp looked at the soviets and passed on a passing fi warrior trumpeted anger at them they flinched back dmitri frowned why did he do that i thought they had their instructions he may have had other instructions arvid said no he was injured a ship must have arrived from earth that series of thuds this morning da injured warriors will not like humans the next ii warrior seemed friendly enough perhaps he was glad of a touch of strange in his life he made conversation and the soviets answered in kind he dawdled for the benefit of the tired ductcleaners who moved a little more slowly than necessary hide your strength the herdmaster looked up from his viewscreen and snorted angrily his digits pounded a baseballsized button communications get me fathistehtulk find out why he isnt on duty will you talk to him yourself no send him here has digit ship six arrived it arrived while you slept herdmaster after you have the advisor get me breakerone the advisor doesnt answer herdmaster what never mind get me breakerone the screen showed raztupispminz looking as if his youth had returned power could do that for an aging fi he had had power while breaking the sleepers to their new role now his human charges had given him his authority back we will put the new prisoners to distributing the dietary supplements he said and let them talk with the soviets with tashayamp present first however i intend to house them with dawson dawson has been alone for several days now we hoped that like a newborn meatflyer he would fixate on me if he had no other companionship did it work it is too soon to tell but i think not dawson is not newborn he talks to me but not as a new slave talks to one who has taken his surrender there is anger if not impudence herdmaster i wonder if there is a surrender symbol among humans that we have not discovered he surrendered he must be made to know the implications at your orders drown you your task is not within my thuktun i advise only you will do what you can in whatever way you feel is good and you will accept full responsibility for failure lead me herdmaster companions from dawsons herd may give him back his rationality your scarlettufted female was considered a curable rogue will her presence in dawsons cell affect dawsons sense of reality mice accepted surrender she obeys orders eightcubed leader siplisteph says she seems saner than most keep me informed are the air ducts clean raztupispminz bridled at his sarcastic tone the prisoners have covered perhaps six sixtyfourths of the network theyre doing well herdmaster you are aware that a battle might destroy the duct sweepers or rip the ducts open the humans are gaining practice against real need your meaning wets my mind i take it that they are indeed being broken to the traveler herd breakerone hesitated then they do not interpret orders rigorously one has explored regions to which he was not assigned this may demonstrate the curiosity native to a climbing species or they may hope to gain knowledge that will make them of more benefit to us still they do not obey carry on the herdmaster broke contact get me chowpeentulk if he knew chowpeentulk she would know where her mate was under almost any circumstances communications tracked her to the infirmary where chowpeentulk was in the act of delivering an infant even a herdmaster had to wait sometimes the cell door was ajar it opened to wes dawsons touch he pushed it shut with his feet and heard the lock click thoughts and memories boiled in his head he pushed them deep into his mind concentrating on the pain in his leg and on not appearing injured the fithp are not telepathic he thought but why take chances the cell was large and lonely he had lived there for five days now he liked the elbow room and he hadnt liked dealing with the soviets nonetheless theyre punishing me but for what it must be punishment to a herd beast being left in solitary must be agony they want to break me i wont let them think of something what theres nothing to read thuktun flishithys main drive was a universal subliminal hum in dawsons mind its source was a gnawing ache it must be pushing against an enormous mass for the acceleration to be so low the fillip must have a hell of a big reserve of deuteriwntritium mix thats an ominous thought its a big ship and it can fight it has to be dt mix any other assumption is worse a fusion motor using simple hydrogen would have to be far more sophisticated halfway from science fiction to fantasy wes dawson preferred a more optimistic assumption endlessly he waged the fithphuman war in his mind the door opened the intruder wailed as she entered she had bright red hair and a pale face that would have been pretty if she hadnt looked so sick she was slender as a pipe cleaner fragilelooking freefall was making her terribly unhappy wes caught her arm the newcomer wailed at him without seeing him others came into the cell a blond girl no more than ten years old floated gracefully to remove his hand from the slender womans arm its all right alice the girl said makes me sick oh god im faaaluinggg new prisoners not astronauts my god theyve invaded earth the thinfaced redhead screamed again and the blond girl said something soothing wes pushed woman and girl toward a wail recoiled from the opposite wall and was with them before they could bounce away he pushed the womans hands into the rug surface until she got the idea her fists closed tight and she clung the blond girl stayed with her now he could look at the others there were four more one was a boy of nine or so blackhaired darkly tanned two were in their fifties weathered like farm people umnistakably man and wife from the way they clung to each other the final one was probably the blond girls mother she had the same shade of blond hair and the same finely chiseled nose she floated at arms length like an acrobat the blond woman looked at him hard wes dawson senator did she expect him to recognize her he didnt he smiled at her congressman which way did you vote jeri wilson we met at jpl fifteen years ago when the voyager was passing saturn uh republican a long time ago she couldnt have been more than twenty then maybe not that old and hed met a lot of people since right the saturn encounter seems almost prehistoric now how did you get here we were captured sure but where you dont know jeri asked oh i guess you wouldnt we were captured in kansas the aliens invaded kansaswhere in kansas not far from your wifes home jeri said about forty miles from there how the devil do you know where my wife is staying dawson demanded we were on our way there jeri said do you believe in synchronicity i dont not really butwell actually its not too big a surprise nothing is now wes shook his head in confusion aliens in kansas why were you going to find carlotta its a long story jeri said look we were going west getting out of los angeles when we ran out of gas i was afraid to stop anyone until i saw harry reddington hairy red you know him yes he tried to help us and whenwhen that didnt do any good he was trying to go help your wife and he took us with him only the aliens landed all right wes said i can get the details later is carlotta all right i dont know something happened in kansas something bad for the snouts because first they were happy and then all of a sudden our guards turned mean snouts thats what everyone calls them now good name he turned to the others didnt mean to ignore you you must have a lot of questions some the man said reckon the lord will tell us what we have to know the woman added she put a protective arm around the boy john and carrie woodward jeri wilson said from kansas but they didnt see any more of the war than i did and gary capehart they left his parents behind we dont know why and thats my daughter melissa and her friend there is alice whats going to happen to us good question i wish i knew whats wrong with alice the redheads face was pressed tight into the wall padding and her back was stiff jeri said she wouldnt tell us her last name she said a bomb hit menningers and they all ran you know menningers she must have been a patient carrie woodward sniffed loudly the voice came muffled free wing wes said i beg your pardon the small face turned halfway i was on the free wing no locked doors you know what that means i wasnt one of the really sick ones okay wes said pleased to meet you all i was getting lonely he didnt try to shake hands none could have spared hand they were all clinging to the dubious security of the wall rug arent there others we thought so jeri said but we havent seen any are you the only one alive from kosmograd no there are some russians the fithpthats what they call themselves and youll have to learn their languagethe fithp sometimes keep us together and sometimes separate us there are a pair of them in charge of teaching us teachin what carrie woodward asked her voice was filled with suspicion language customs people they will expect you to suitender formally sooner or later takpusseh or raztupispminz one of our fi teachers will come here and expect you to roll over on your back and hell put his foot on your chest dont fight he wont crush you they already did that melissa said jeri laughed we were scared silly but really why would they wait till now wed just float away once thats done they expect you to cooperate not just passively you mean they think were one of them now melissa asked something like that dawson agreed he pointed casually to the large camera in one corner of the room they have no sense of privacy he said they watch us when they please jeri wilson frowned john woodward looked at the camera then seemed to hunch into himself he doesnt look good like giorge did it isnt right woodward said his wife nodded agreement maybe but thats how it is dawson said okay jeri said so we learn to act like snouts and learn their language are you hungry melissa shook her head jeri said hah no alice said oh and reached into her blouse and pulled out a big vitamin bottle the pills were big too and the label was a books worth of tiny print listing thirtyodd vital nutrients and their sources bee pollen comfrey dandelion fennel hawthorne berry ginger garlic foti dong quai siberian ginseng rose hips you raided a health food store alice said yeah they took me through a grocery and a health food store and made me point at things i thought wed need any objections not bloody likely he swallowed a fat pill with greenish flecks in it dry theres some food from thesoviet station and the fithp grow some things we can eat if you close your eyes first but ive been worrying about vitamins what was it like jeri wilson asked you were on the space station he told it long it didnt look like anything would interrupt them for a while your turn dawson said alice wasnt eager to talk until she got started we were in the basement along the walls it was just like a tornado scare they crowd all the patients in in any order mixed in with the orderlies its the only time you see the ones on the locked wing anyway there was a terrific noise and some of the walls fell in anyone who could still stand up ran away screaming even some of the orderlies i just ran i got into the zoo next door and hid in the mammal house but there wasnt any place to hide really james came in and i told him to go away but he wouldnt when the horrors came in i thought some of the zoo animals had got loose the aliens had moved through topeka through shattered buildings and corpses beginning to decay they took books and magazines from libraries and drugstores anything with pictures they led the prisoners through a supermarket and various small stores jeri and melissa and the woodwards had refused to cooperate but alice tried to assemble a collection of fresh and canned food vitamins and mineral supplements did you have a chance to get coffee hell no i didnt get cigarettes either bad for you i got some herb teas though and when dawson laughed she looked furious the images on the video screen faded raztupispminz continued to stare at it as if that would bring meaning to what he had seen finally he turned what do you believe this means he asked takpussehs digits flared the herdmaster will not be amused raztupispminz hissed he glanced at the camera in one corner perhaps he has seen already his annoyance will be as nothing when fistartehthuktun sees these recordings takpusseh said he flared his digits again we know they have curious courtship and mating habits apparently the females are continuously in estrus and do not care what male satisfies their urges then how do the females control them raztupispminz demanded it cannot be possible much is possible takpusseh sighed forgive me grandson but you have seen only life aboard ship you have never lived on a world rich with life they eat their own kind and sing as they do i do not care to live on such a world if that is what we saw takpusseh said we must ask the prisoners does dawson speak well enough no nor do i know their speech so well but tashayamp does she has been studying takpusseh took a deep breath then another raztupispminz did likewise pheromones filled his lungs a sweet flavor grandson you are my only relative takpusseh said leader of my family i wish to speak with you raztupispminz backed away slowly then settled to a crouch he waited until takpusseh was similarly postured speak i wish you to carry winter flowers with me ah i have seen you grow stronger with new domains i am glad takpussehbut have you not waited overlong the time is upon the sleeper herd and you are hardly able to be rational i know of no unmated sleeper who would have me to mate i speak of tashayamp ah of acceptable lineage and competent in her work yes he let his voice trail to nothing without a stop but takpusseh said yes she is not comely indeed some would say she is misshapen yet i find her attractive enough and as you say she is diligent at her work it happens seldom that spaceborn mates to sleeper do you know that you are acceptable how should i i have no one to speak for me none save you yamp raztupispminz mused her grandfather is persantipyamp he is said to be irascible a warrior in his day and say no more there was no war bus had there been it could only have been against the sleepers you wish me to speak with him i ask that my leader tashayamp raztupispminz snorted wry mirth have little experience in this i should ask you what to say our roles are indeed reversed in all ways let me see if i recall the words i am to say know them takpusseh admitted but let the customs be kept he listened as raztupispminz stumbled through the traditional lecture that the fithp mate for life that mating is an alliance forever not to be entered through passions are you certain it is not passion it is time for your herd not mere passion takpusseh said recall i amsomewhatolder than you i was mated to your grandmother i know something of passion and of reason as well yes politically it is a good match the yainp clan holds a wide domain and you have taken your own and you are male mating with a spaceborn female it is not as ft it were the other way spaceborn male to submit will speak with persantipyamp and if he will consent i will come with you to present the winter flowers raztupispminz rose to his feet and my congratulations the garden the opinion of the strongest is always the best jean de la fontaine countdown h plus five weeks they had floated forward then inward along half a mile of spiral corridor not quite in freefall but with so little gravity that motion was difficult for the newcomers wes tried to help where he could two alien warriors carried large boxes tashayamp led the way a huge door opened for them a cargo door much bigger than would be needed to pass a fi they entered this huge chamber must be along the axis of the ship forward of the chamber of the podo thuktun a line of yellowwhite light ran down the middle too bright to look at directly elsewhere there was green everywhere green with splashes of carmine and yellow alien plants grew in cages rooted in thick wet pads fixed along the walls green banners flapped in the breeze from the air conditioning a field of yellow flowers turned as if to look at the intruders here was a roughly rectangular block of loose dirt vines wrapped it loosely and it was riddled with seveninch holes a head popped from a hole and was gone before wes could react a streamlined head it had been like a ferrets with red beads for eyes it was finally like being on another world wes stole a glance at the others jeri wilson was keeping her calm carrie woodward expected to be killed at any moment the prospect didnt seem to frighten her much before she allowed herself to be escorted from the cell she had led the others in prayer and stared disapprovingly at wes dawson when he didnt join in melissa and gary were gaping not frightened but delighted plants birds animalsand distant objects after confinement in cells and corridors melissa pointed at something above them it was gone before wes could see it but they all stopped to look takpusseh looked back impatiently come they followed hastily otherwise the warrior fithp would use their gun butts as prods not brutally but playfully as if they were herding children a tree grew along the ships axis thirty feet tall one continuous green leaf ran round it in a spiral guy wires along its trunk braced it against lateral acceleration something dived at wess head he ducked as the warrior behind him casually brushed the thing aside with his mink the thing flapped off shrilling a musical curse a bird they were everywhere longnecked birds with large colorful aft wings that turned up sharply at the tips and small canards set to either side of the long neck wes gaped in wonder is this your food source he asked ours and yours takpusseh waved his trunk at a plot of bare dirt it must have been recently cleared dust and plant detritus floated in the air around it the teacher said now you have plants from your own world to grow here space has been set aside john woodward came forward to the boxes of soil gingerly he took a handful and rubbed it in his fingers good kansas soil he said maybe well live long enough for something to grow you will live takpusseh said he peered at the farmer do you suffer for your distance from your home one day you will land with us woodward didnt answer his eyes glittered for now you will grow your own food tashayamp said on the level trays and in those she pointed to cages filled with earth there is a flower this she held out a flower bright shaped like a long thin trumpet it was as large as a sunflower with wild colors strange shapes lurked deep within the blossom shes learned english fast wes thought but her posture is strange why i wish could read their body language we have seeds she said you will grow this in soil from your world what if it wont grow john woodward demanded it will grow if need we will mix soil from other world it will grow and thats important wes asked it may be she said she glanced at takpusseh you will begin now you will also grow to feed you takpusseh took a seed packet from one of the boxes it was tiny in his ropy digits he peered at it tore it open some of the seeds spilled a warrior was prepared he swept a finemesh net through the cloud takpusseh himself ignored the incident farming is different when you float seed must be pushed in so with small tool no your digits are small enough water comes from below from wall against forward wall find special tools sticks to hold plants against thrust tools to stir dirt john and carrie woodward were examining the dirt plot they began taking seeds out of the boxes john said plants should grow taller here with a question in his voice the children moved warily away their eyes wide with wonder something like a bird whizzed past not there tashayamp called she motioned the children back to the group you wait here do not disturb those aft from the grove of spiralwound trees came the windinstrument murmur of fithp voices the herdmaster had climbed a huge pillar plant like the humans themselves in the minuscule gravity he had become a brachiator he found the viewpoint odd amusing he watched in a forward corner of the garden the human prisoners worked the herdmaster admired their agility newly trained dirtyfeet that they were they seemed docile enough as they planted alien seeds in alien soil yet the breakers disturbing reports could not be ignored much longer it was more than enough to make his head ache yet here were smells to ease his mind plants in bloom and a melancholy whiff of funereal scent the end of life for the traveler fithp was the funeral pit and then the garden twelve fithp warriors wounded on winterhome had gone to the funeral pit after digit ship six returned them to message bearer the garden was in perpetual bloom seasons mixed here created by differing intensities of light warmth moisture the alien growths might require alterations in weather he hoped otherwise winterhome would be hospitable to garden life if the humans actually persuaded anything to grow here the herdmaster would have preferred to loll in warm mud but message bearers mudrooms had been drained while her drive guided the foot toward its fiery fate he had sought rest in the garden and it was here that the year zero fithp confronted him in the riot of scents he had not smelled their presence suddenly faces were looking at him over the edges of leafspiral below him on the trunk of the pillar plant he looked back silently letting them know that they had disturbed his time of quiet born within a few eightdays of each other in an orgy of reproduction that had not been matched before or since the year zero fithp all looked much alike smooth of skin longlimbed and lean why not but age clusters didnt always think so much alike these were the inner herd that led the larger herd of dissidents one was different he looked older than the rest his skin was darkened and roughened one leg was immobilized with braces and there was a look this one had seen horrors with the advisors consent the herdmaster had chosen to divide the year zero fithp half the males had gone down to winterhome they were dead or alive and circling winterhome after the natives counterattack that injured one must be fresh from the wars the herdmasters claws gripped the trunk as he faced nine fithp below him for a moment he thought to summon warriors then a sense of amusement came over him dissidents they might be but these were not rebels so they sought to awe the herdmaster did they and they had brought a hero fresh from the wars no these were no rogues they wanted only to increase their influence you have found me he said mildly speak still they were silent two of the smaller humans wandered toward the group but were retrieved by tashayamp now the humans worked more slowly they watched no doubt though they must be out of earshot what passed here might affect all the herds of winterhome still it was an imposition and the herdmaster would have asked tashayamp to remove them if he could have spared the attention finally one spoke advisor fathistehtulk had said that he would gather with us he said that he had something to tell us he did not come we are told that he has not been seen on the bridge in two days he has neglected his duties pastempehkeph said mildly he has avoided the bridge and his mate nor does he answer calls i have alerted my senior officers but no others is it your will that i should ask for his arrest they looked at each other undecided one said firmly no hercimaster he was a massive young fi posed a bit ahead of the others rashinggith the defensemasters son so you do not know where he is either we had hoped to find him through you herdmaster ha i have asked his mate she has not seen him yet she has a newborn to show the herdmaster became serious there are matters to decide and we have no advisor what must i do they looked at each other again the teqthuktun precisely pastempehkeph breathed more easily they still worried about the law and their religion not rogues not yet i can take no counsel nor make any decisions without advice from the sleepers it is the teqthuktun the pact we made with them and fistartehthuktun insists upon it now i have no advisor and there are matters to decide speak what must i do you must find another advisor the wounded one said indeed this hardly required discussion the traveler fithp might continue on their predetermined path but no new decisions could be made without an advisor fathistebtulk might be dead or too badly injured to perform his duties he might have shirked his duty crippling the herd at a critical moment he might have been kidnapped and if some herd within the traveler herd had been pushed to such an act it would be stripped of its status but the advisor would still lose his post for arousing such anger for being so careless for being gone the herdmaster had already decided on his successor still he must be found you the injured one herdmaster i am eightsquared leader chintithpitmang he had heard that name but where later you must come fresh from the digit ship do you know anything of this or are you only here to add numbers i know nothing of the advisor what i do know later you rashinggith if you knew where the advisor might be you would go there his digits knotted and flexed i assuredly would herdmaster but you might not tell me is there a place known only to dissidents a place where he might commune with other dissidents or only with himself no herdmaster we fear for him there must be such a place but the dissidents themselves would have searched it by now i too fear for fathistehtulk the herdmaster admitted i went so far as to examine records of use of the airlocks following which i summoned a list of fithp in charge of guarding the airlocks i chance to know that no dissidents guard the airlocks rashinggith said an interesting admission i was looking for more than dissidents did it strike any of you that what fathistehtulk was doing was dangerous consider the position of the sleepers in herd rank the advisor is the only sleeper of any real authority the sleepers could not ask his removal yet he consistently opposed the war for winterhome how many sleepers are dissidents i know only of one fathistehtulk they looked at each other and the herdmaster knew at once that other sleepers held dissident views later there are sleepers in charge of guarding the airlocks the drive is more powerful than the pull of the foots mass a corpse would drop behind but would not disintegrate the drive flame is hot but not dense our telescopes have searched for traces of a corpse in our wake pause there is none shall we consider murder then by dissidents seeking a martyr or conservative sleepers avoiding future embarrassment or did fathistehtulk learn something that some fi wanted hidden or is he alive hiding somewhere for his own purposes rashinggith what did fathistehtulk plan to tell you the herdmaster looked about him do any of you know did he leave hints did he even have interesting questions when last you saw him we dont know hes dead rashinggith said uneasily enough the herdmaster said we will find him i hope to ask him where he has been that was a halftruth fathistehtulk would cause minimal embarrassment by being dead on to other matters the herdmaster had remembered a name chintithpitmang you had someting to say nervous but dogged the injured warrior got his mouth working the prey the humans they dont know how to surrender they can be taught there was aa burly one bigger than most i whipped his toy weapon from his hand and knocked him down and put my foot on his chest and he clawed at me with his bony digits until i pushed harder i think i crushed him of the prisoners we brought back only the scarletheaded exotic would help us select human food even after we take their surrender they do not cooperate must we teach them to surrender four billion of them one at a time we must abandon the target world if we kill them all the stink will make winterhome like one vast funeral pit chintithpitmang was one of six officers under siplisteph siplistephwas a sleeper his mate had not survived frozen sleep and he had not mated since he had reached winterbome as eightcubed leader of the intelligence group it was an important post and siplisteph had risen higher still due to deaths among his superiors the herdmaster intended to asic him to become his advisor subject to the approval of the females of the sleeper herdand fistartehthuktun as keeper of the teqthuktun chintithpitmang was among those who might have siplistephs post why did you seek me the herdmaster demanded the response was unexpected first one then others began a keening wail the rest joined it was the sound made by lost children frightening why do i feel the urge to join my voice to theirs we no longer know who we are herdmaster chintithpitmang blurted why are we here we bear the thuktunthp the creatures do not seek the thuktunthp they have their own way chintithpitmang insisted if they do not know the thuktunthp how can they know they do not seek them could this one be worthy of promotion are any shall i ask him to remain no now is not the time to judge him fresh from battle and still twitching injured and plunged suddenly into the scents of blooming winter flower and sleeper females in heat chintithpitmang you need time and rest to recover from your experience go now all of you go for one moment they stood then they filed away the herdmaster remained in the garden trying to savor its peace chintithpitmang did not now seem a candidate for high office another dissident yet he had fought well on winterhome his record was exemplary give him a few days meanwhile interview his mate then see if she could pull him together he didnt remember shreshleemang well though the mang family was a good line at a shipmasters rank the female muss be suitable and competent where was fathistehtulk murdered or kidnapped he had suspected the year zero fithp but that now seemed unlikely they were nervous disturbed as well they should be but not nervous enough they could not have hidden that from him who then had caused the herdmasters advisor to vanish how many of what leaning he might face a herd too large to fear the justice of the traveler herd though the secrecy with which they had acted argued against it there were herds within herds within the traveler herd it must have been like this on the homeworld too though in greater deeper more fantastical variety even here sleepers spaceborn dissidents fistartehthuktuns core of traditionminded historians the breakers group driving themselves mad while trying to think like alien beings the herdmaster must balance them like a pyramid of smooth rocks in varying thrust he is late dmitri whispered we must go not yet we will wait for him arvid rogachev said but we will wait dmitri shrugged he obeys me because he has no choice ye he considers himself my superior perhaps he is he is a better snate gist there was a rustle behind them and nikolais legless form appeared from a lateral shaft he fell to the corridor between them catching himself with his arms just before he struck the deck once more arvid marveled at how agile a legless man could be in low gravity whert have you been dmitri demanded nikolai ignored him and turned to arvid comrade commander i have success he said come arvid led the way out of the air shaft they took their time about attaching the grill covers arvid worked in silence although he didnt feel especially tired he thought of how exhausted he was and presently he felt it be wary do not let them know our true strength dmitri says this i am beginning to think like kgb now is this good i have seen women nikolai said in an undertone ah dmitri said arvid felt a twinge women i have been long in space where in the center of the ship in a garden area comrade commander they were with the american dawson dawson how has he deserved this the newly arrived warriors dmitri said they came with those new prisoners from earth were they russian no comrade colonel they were by their dress american there were children also three women two children a man and dawson i could not know what they were saying nikolai lifted the heavy grill crippled arvid thought he has more strength in his arms than i have in my legs tell us dmitri said as you ordered i explored farther than ever before at first i took each turn that presented itself there are grills everywhere there are radial ducts some ducts are too small even for me butnikolai stretched his antis above his head exhaled completely and grinnedi can make myself narrow the fore end of thuktun flishithy is too far we expect to find the bridge there but i made no try to reach it i saw a big mom full of sleeping fithp all females sleeping with all four feet gripping the wall rugs like gigantic fleas i saw a slaughterhouse or a kitchen fithp were cutting up plants and animal parts and and arranging them but there was nothing like a stove i tired of this and went inward along radial ducts i found the room of the podo thuktun and the priest all alone at the television screen he muttered to himself too tow to understand i found the greetthouse region it is lighted it was there that i saw dawson and the newcomers they were all at work planting things the garden is at the center of the ship there were many fithp i saw no need to watch dawson longer and i had little time so i continued aft i found what may be a bridge aft of the greenhouse no ducts run aft of that point it may be an engine room serving the main drive but it is also an emergency bridge da dmitn said at the axis it would be quite safe like the podo thuktun so the room is circled by television screens square and thick with the same proportions as the podo thuktun i saw our prison empty of course i saw dawson and one of the newcomers a redhaired woman working in the garden they worked together but they ignored each other i saw you comrade rogachev hehhehheh very industrious you looked go on arvid said there was much on those screens one showed three of the fithp watching a viewscreen on the screen they were watching were scenes of a man and a womancomrades the man had an enormous pecker and she swallowed it all of it what is this dmitri asked sharply i have told you what i saw nikolai said on one viewscreen were three fithp who watched a viewscreen on that viewscreen was that scene and others like it what else did the woman do arvid asked nonsense dmitri hissed what did the fithp do when they saw this comrade colonel they must have found it interesting because they rewound the tape and watched it again then they spoke among themselves and spoke into communications equipment so dmitri said to himself what arvid demanded i do not know why but i find it disturbing dmitri said did you see who they spoke with no soon that screen was blank i waited but there was no more then when i was ready to leave i saw two views of the main control room and there is a window so it must be at the fore end i knew there must be other screens so i circled through the ducts for another view nikolais voice had dropped until he was nearly whispering dmitri and arvid crowded close they pretended to have difficulty replacing the fastenings for the grill i saw outside four screens in a row three look at the stars and the views move back and forth so does the fourth but it looks out on black rock at one end of its swing the screen looks along the hull of thu ktun flishithy the fore end is right up against the rock do you remember the films they showed us thu ktun flishithy leaving that other star the nose was up against a kind of ball pushing it now it is against black rock that has been carved like the kind of sculpture the americans in new york are so fond of twisted shapes that tell nothing arvid said so they have an asteroid base but they are pushing it dmitri said cant you feel it the hum of the drive he had learned to ignore it but it was there pushing ityes where i cannot think we will like the answer so nikolai you saw along the hull was it smooth or was there detail i was lucky one of the starviews turned to look sideways at an oval hatch it opened while i watched and a big metal snake uncoiled then the view shifted and it was a view from the head of the snake looking at another metal snake as it coiled itself into its own hatch then it turned and looked back along the hull i saw quite a lot before it turned again and looked at nothing but stars aft of the ship is a violetwhite haze ships are mounted along the rim big ships but there were many empty mountings empty good dmitri said perhaps ships we have destroyed and perhaps ships that remain to attack our world arvid said you have done well nikolai women it has been long confrontation for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good for the good that i would i do not but the evil that i would not that i do st paul epistle to the romans countdown h plus six weeks the herdmaster paused at the door more problems awaited him inside at least i will no longer have the strange views of fathistehtulk to confound me one of the guards moved to open the door where can he be he must be dead a secret corpse and a key to more terrible secrets thipartethfuft lead me herdmaster have the funeral pits searched i am certain that the advisor is dead and i wish to know how he died at once dead or not i had no choice pastempehkeph trampled conflicting feelings deep into the muddy substrate of his mind the traveler herd must continue and without an advisor no decisions are possible a replacement was needed i have found one why am i so disturbed siplisteph is a good choice he has been to winterhome he commanded spaceborn and they accepted his leadership the sleeper females acclaimed him even though he is not mated now he must mate pastempehkeph thought of eligible females there are so few would the sleepers accept a spaceborn mare for the advisor that would go far toward uniting the traveler herd the door opened pastempehkeph moved decisively into the theater he need not have bothered to compose himself siplisteph raztupispminz and fistartehthuktun were shoulder to shoulder before the projection wall they did not look up thipartethfuft lifted his snnfp to bellow for attention but the herdmaster laid his digits across the guard officers forehead there is no need come let us see what so fascinates them the equipment had come from winterhome the only fithp equipment was a makeshift transformer to mate the human recording machines to message bearers current the herdfnaster stood behind them the forward and inward walls were a smooth white curve a screen that would serve under thrust or spin advisor breaker and priest were in agitated argument their waving digits made shadows on the forward wall where two humans similarly waved their arms and bellowed trumpeted a sound no fi could have matched to fithp ears it seemed a song of rage and distress their clothes were thick layered a padding against cold the male waved something small and sharp that glittered at last my digits are whole again raztupispminz translated meaning the herdmaster asked the three fithp turned quickly your pardon the breaker said i did not hear you enter no matter i ask again what was the meaning of what the human said none he was not crippled raztupispminz turned back to the screen the ilerdmaster waited the humans on the screen huddled conspired all in that earsplintering keening voice have you ever heard them speak like that the herdmaster demanded once nikolai the legless one spoke like that at length once but far more softly thcy call it singing what are they building breakerone raztupispminz only folded his digits across his scalp the other recordings raztupispminz demanded siplisteph you have brought others siplisteph only needed a moment to change tapes the four humans looked soft and vulnerable without their clothing two patches of fur apiece only pointed up their nakedness alien music played eerily across fithp nerves mating said breakerone odd i had the idea they sought privacy when they did that herdmaster that isnt the females genital area at all but that is the males oh yes ive never seen it in that state but of course they usually cover themselves does it seem to you that she might harm him accidentally the priest spoke why would they record this advisor where was this found all tapes came from two sources a building that displayed of such and one room of a dwelling theyre marked ah this came from the dwelling the scene had shifted here was the same female and a different male both covered not for long raztupispminz said i dont see how children could be born of this yet they seem to think theyre mating ah that seems more likely could we be viewing an instnction tape might humans need instruction on how to mate a ridiculous suggestion the priest scoffed what animal does not know how to mate entertainment siplisteph said so i was told by one who surrendered you are certain breakerone asked no i know too little of their language fistartehthuktun continued to stare at the screen i i think there can be no good reason for such an entertainment the herdmaster moved forward to join siplisteph it was irritating that his advisor must here perform two functions at once you have been to winterhome you have seen thousands of humans more than any of us have you formed opinions none nowhere in these tapes do humans act as i have seen them act i wonder if they act the part of something other than humans not predecessors but there are words god and archetype they could hardly pretend to be ready to mate show me the first one again the herdmaster said and presently he asked did we just witness a killing show that segment again siplisteph did an arm swung the man in the strange chair mimed agony the chair tilted and the man fell backward through the floor they never die so calmly the new advisor said they fight until they cannot the neck is very vulnerable raztupispminz objected a nerve trunk could be cut but the fat one would then be a rogue why does the female associate with him could a pair of rogues form their own herd you are quiet fistartehthuktun what do you believe of this the priest splayed his digits wide herdmaster i learn later i will speak you do not seem pleased there was no answer a place of puzzles pastempehkeph said they surrender and have not surrendered their tapes show rogues acting in collusion they live neither in herds nor alone what are they what do they believe themselves to be fistartehthuktun asked perhaps that is more important an interesting question raztupispminz said quietly pastempehkeph bellowed want answers i have enough interesting questions to keep me busy thank you very much razwpispminz bring them all all humans here now herdmaster is this wise bring just one i want to keep them separate as we study bring them at your orders herdmaster raztupispminz waited this is the moment if there is to be any challenge there was none raztupispminz turned to the communications speaker on one wall gary and melissa were bounding around the cell in an elaborate game of tag the rules werent apparent but it was obvious that the game couldnt have been played in normal gravity jeri wilson lay against the down wall and hugged her knees she was wishing that the children would stop and glad that they didnt they were all right prisoners of monsters far from home falling endlessly they were taking it well stop feeling so damned sorry for yourself hell if gary can take it you sure can next youll be whimpering jeri turned her head within her arms no we dont want melissa to hear that john woodward lay near by hes trying but its like hes fading out carries all that keeps him going its the toilets i could stand anything if theyd just give us a decent toilet were not built to use a stupid pool of water with everyone watching she heard the lowpitched hum that signaled the door was opening by the time it was open the tag game was over by tacit agreement they were all together opposite the doorway jeri recognized tashayamp behind her was a full octuple of warriors all armed they dont bring guards unless theyre taking us somewhere jeri thought but they dont always bring them then either weve gone places with no one but tashayamp or one of the other teachers so why do they sometimes have armed guards its like melissas tag game there are rules i just dont know them all come tashayamp directed in the fithp tongue where wes dawson demanded come tashayamp turned to lead the way out right jeri said she uncurled and dove across the pens come on melissa the others followed with dawson bringing up the rear tashayamp led them through corridors toward we center of the ship they entered a large nearly rectang larroom with huge steps around three sides machinery had been set up near the fourth wall four fithp watched them without comment tashayamp followed them in the eight fithp soldiers stayed in the corridor dawson moved up beside jeri and said theater weve been here no seats jeri said then laughed at a mental picture of a fi collapsing a beach chair of course no seats whats ah that videotape machine must have come from kansas the one in the fancy harness hes a priest or librarian or both the one at the top of the stairs is the big boss they call him the herdmaster something like that dawson imitated the flthp sound the other two are teachers at least i call them that theyre supposed to teach us but they dont always so im not sure every time i think i understand them something else happens and the door opened again to let in three men in coveralls one had no legs but it didnt seem to bother him russians that stocky one was on tv before the snouts came i thought he was handsome arvid rogachev dmitri something or another and the one with no legs is nikolai i never heard them call him anything else dawson said rogachev he looks even better in person wes dawson is a bit of a wimp compared to him and what does that mean am i looking for a big strong man to take care of me would that be such a bad idea you will watch tashayamp said she bellowed something infithpl the screen lit up jeri caught a glimpse of the leadin deep throat what is this jeri asked carrie woodward had a puzzled look john didnt we hear something about that movie the russian dawson had called dmitri frowned the other one seemed amused for this they have taken casualties the screen raced past the titles to the sex scenes then it slowed to show linda lovelace doing her stuff in living color carrie wood ward watched just long enough to be sure of what she was seeing gary melissa come here youre not to watch this come gary capehart went to her at once melissa looked doubtful you come here young lady now carrie was insistent melissa looked to her mother for guidance o lord now what melissa do as she says aw mom now carrie gathered the children to her ample bosom how dare you she shouted dont you critters have any sense of decency at all no shame the herdmaster trumpeted something tashayamp replied now what kind of trouble has she got us into what is your difficulty tashayamp demanded why have you done this you know perfectly well its not decent to show pictures like that mrs woodward dawson said they dont think the way we do and of course youve seen worse carrie said she faced away from the screens away from the herdmaster that left her facing the russians i leave it to you is this decent for children she demanded of them not at all arvid agreed dmitri said something harsh in russian badworse tashayamp said what does it mean bad why is this bad i think they really dont know mother john woodward said his voice held wonder they really dont i was trying to tell you dawson said you keep out of it you dont know either john woodward said your kind never did all of the snouts were talking at once until the herdmaster trumpeted they fell silent instantly i keep telling you they dont see things as we do dawson said his voice rang loudly in the silence john they didnt make these movies they found them in kansas remember that john woodward interrupted him then canie started to say something one of the teachers trumpeted raztupispminz commands that you speak one at a time tashayamp said there are many meanings of good and bad dawson began the teacher said something else not to begin with you tashayamp said she pointed to the russians what is bad about this filth typical capitalist garbage for the mind dmitri said why does this surprise anyone the capitalist system caters to anyone with money and inevitably produces decadence its freedom of speech dawson shouted i dont like it but i dont have to if we start shutting peoples mouths where not we carrie woodward said wed lock up the people that peddle that filth if it wasnt for you federal people we had a nice decent town until your judges and your laws came the two teachers were both speaking at once until the herdmaster intervened tashayamp spoke at length obviously trailslating since she used several human words what can they make of this what do make of it jeri wondered you believe this bad tashayamp said you all show digits extended if you believe bad the woodwards showed palms up held at arms length then the russians jeri held her hand out what do believe i dont really want melissa watching this stuff she might get the wrong idea about what men and women are supposed to do women arent toys free speech and all that but yes i guess id be happier if they still had laws against pornography less ammunition for perverts dawson was the only holdout finally he raised his own hand you agree this is bad tashayamp asked i do for children dawson said i just dont think we have the right to stop it why bad for children its filth carrie woodward protested not fit for anyone you do notdo these things tashayamp asked jeri smothered a laugh came woodwards face turned beet red my lord no we dont do that no one really does that well in your world maybe my turn to blush this is true no one does these things some do john woodward admitted decent people dont they sure dont put it on film the word decent means what tashayamp demanded means rightthinking people carrie woodward said people who think and act like theyre supposed to not like some people i know tashayamp translated there was more discussion among the fithp weve got to be careful wes dawson said lord knows what ideas theyre getting none they shouldnt have congressman carrie woodward said firmly they dont think like us youve seen the toilets havent you look we all have to give them the same story dawson insisted say little dmitri said in russian jeri was surprised that she could still understand it has been a long time evidently dawson had understood that too right best they dont find out too much find out what that we dont act the way we want to thats the very definition of human y explain this tashayamp demanded how many humans do bad things all of them jeri blurted capitalists dmitri said commies woodward retorted all humans do bad things tashayainp demanded all do what they know they must not do tell me this they all began speaking at once jeri sat against the wall with melissa she wasnt really part of the discussion wes dawson was having with the russians but she was too close to ignore it perhaps we have told them too much dmitri said dawson said its better if they understand us what you call understanding a military man would call intelligence information arvid rogachev said what can it hurt arvid youve been helping them with their maps they show me maps and globes i nod my head and tell them names for places this is not your concern its my concern if you side with the fithp look arvid youve seen what theyve done destruction and murder i understand war i but do you understand what they could have done they came here with a mucking great asteroid and were still moored to it suppose theyd come with the same size asteroid but a metal one hundreds of billions of dollars worth of metals now they negotiate trade metals for land for concessions for information anything they want they could buy themselves a country if we wont play even if we buy the metals and dont pay their bills theyve still got their mucking great asteroid to drop dmitri grushin was nodding grinning what a pity they dont understand money they are not capitalists thats your complaint dawson and who cares theyre going to smash the earth at least they decided they wouldnt make the children watch deep throat and those other tapes jeri recalled going to a theater to see deep throat stupid but theyve put us all together and now there are three more men to watch me use the toilet john and carrie woodward stayed near jeri as far from the russians as possible but it wasnt far enough they could still hear they kept gary with them theyve got a problem but were going to have to get along with the russkis jeri said carrie did you notice that you and john sounded a lot like the russians yeah john woodward said i noticed theyre for decency not like dawson hed excuse anything no he wouldnt there are things people can do and things they cant do carrie woodward said isnt that what insanity means cant tell right from wrong no alice was across the room far enough away that theyd nearly forgotten her it wasnt why i was in menningers why were you there none of your business i was afraid all the time of what carrie woodward asked alice looked away dawson looked over at them the woodwards wouldnt meet his eyes carrie continued to talk to jeri as if dawson were not there dont tell me you never wanted to be better than you are carrie woodward said everyone wants to be better than they are jts what it means to be human maybe youre right jeri said we dont do the things we think we should and we do things were ashamed ofwhat was it in the book of common prayer we have done those things we ought not to have done and we have left undone those things we ought to have done and there is no health in us people have wanted to do the right thing for most of history but nobody really knows what right and wrong are dawson protested sure they do jeri said c s lewis saw that well enough most of us know whats the right thing at least most of the time the problem is we dont do it thats how were different from rocks they dont have any choice about obeying the laws they do what they have to do we do what we want we sound like an undergraduate bull session perhaps this is true arvid said but we would not say laws but moral principle dmitri said firmly established by marxist science commies dont have morals carrie woodward protested this is unfair it is also not true arvid said come we do not so much disagree you and i it is your leader your congressman who protests carrie looked to her husband they didnt say anything an hour later they were summoned to the theater again this time the fithp stood in formal arrays herdmaster and mate at the top others on steps below him most with mates tashayamp stood near him she trumpeted for silence the herdmaster spoke at length finally tashayamp translated you are a race of rogues you say you wish to live by your laws but you do not do it you say you have always wanted to live by your rules and you do not now you will you will become part of traveler herd live as fithp live but under your rules this we will give you this we promise you will teach us your laws then you will live by them you go now the phony war let us remember lord tweedsmuir had told a wartime audience in a ringing phrase that in this fight we arc gods chivalry the british people far from remembering they were gods chivalry began to show such a detachment from what was variously called the bore or the phoney war that the government became seriously worried laurence thompson countdown one week to footfall three weeks after the jayhawk wars high fleecy clouds hung over the san fernando valley the temperature stretched toward a hundred degrees with a hot wind sweeping down to shrivel any vegetation not protected from it ken dutton carefully closed the door to his greenhouse once inside he dipped water from a bucket and threw it around wetting down the lush growth then he hastened outside to turn the handle on the makeshift fan drawing fresh hot dry air through the greenhouse when that was done he went inside the house had thick walls and cooled rapidly at night so that it was tolerable in the daytime dutton lifted the phone and listened there was a dial tone there often was he took a list from the telephone drawer and began to make his calls im still the chef he told con donaldson but i can use some help can you get here around noon bring whatever you can find in the way of food and tell me what i can count on now rice rice he made a note how much rice lots i mean really a lot she giggled only good thing about this war im losing weight because im getting sick of ricehey i look good youll like the new me great okay then bye he inspected his list and dialed again there was no beef in the land sarge harris complained cattle cars are too big snouts blast em think theyve got tanks or weapons in them probably not the major says theyre not doing that just now but no point in arguing yeah chicken costs an arm and a leg too maybe thats how chicken farmers get red meat sarge said hehheh sure look what can you bring eggs traded some carpentry work for them good bring em ken hit the cutoff button and dialed another number patsy clevenger admitted to being one of the lucky ones an occasional backpacker shed stored considerable freezedried food in sealed bags but the steady diet was driving her nuts she jumped at his offer sure she could bring a freezedried dessert and flavored coffee mix and pick up anthony graves who was seventy and couldnt drive anymore ken shifted the receiver to his other ear the copeleys lived at the northern end of the san fernando valley they could get fresh corn and tomatoes and almonds and oranges could they bring a pair of relatives because the relatives had gas hell yes he tried marty carnell just on the off chance the meteorchewed highways had probably stranded him somewhere on a dogshow circuit but marty answered ive done this once before and it worked out ken told him it isnt that everyones starving things havent got that bad but anyones likely to have a ton of something and none of everything else and the way to make it work is to get all the food together and make a feast sounds good okay get here around noon for dinner stone soup takes time and i want sunlight for the mirror id guess well eating all day and night come hungry have you got meat i found a meat source early on i can keep the dogs fed till i run out of money but its horsemeat ken ive been eating it myself bring it can you bring five pounds four will do it and you wont recognize it when i get through marty ive got a great chili recipe lots of vegetables the offutts would have to come by bicycle chad offutt sounded hungry with no transportation how the hell were they to get food how about some bottles of liquor in the saddlebags ken agreed for charitys sake damn near anyone had liquor what was needed was food ken hung up he caught himself humming while he lugged huge pots out into the backyard and set them up around the solar mirror it seemed almost indecent to be enjoying himself when civilization was falling about his ears but it did feel good to finally find a use for his hobbies the copeleys had brought everything theyd promised and yellow chilis too the pair of guests were a cousins daughter and her husbandhalliday and wilson shed kept her maiden name both much younger than the others and a little uncomfortable they seemed eager to help ken put them to cutting up the copeleys vegetables save all seeds right the lost weight looked nice on con donaldson she chatted while she helped him carry dishes things were bad throughout the los angeles basin yeah ken had to agree con had tried to get to phoenix but her mother kept putting her off she wouldnt have room until her brother moved out and then it was too late the roads had been chewed by the snouts meteors yeah ken had tried to get out too he should have asked someone to bring dishwashing soap someone must have an excess of that marty was cuffing horsemeat into strips could be a lot worse he said we could be dodging meteors i cant figure out what the snouts think theyre doing they think theyre conquering the earth ken said its their methods thatre funny theyre thorough enough i havent heard of a dam still standing have you no big ones no big bridges either but they dont touch cities could be worse he might have fled with no destination in mind still it was hard times food got in but not a lot and not a balanced diet there would have been no fruit source here without the copeleys oranges and the lemon tree in graves backyard reflected sunlight blazed underneath kens largest pot the water was beginning to boil he ladled a measured amount into the chili then moved it into the focus hed built the solar minor while he was still married and after the first month hed almost never used it theyd gone vegetarian for a few months too and his wife hadnt taken the cookbooks with her he had the recipes he had the skills to build a balanced meal and the phones worked sometimes if the snouts shot those down he might try to form a commune his nextdoor neighbor had fled to the mountains leaving the keys behind more important hed left a full swimming pool covered to prevent evaporation the water would last until the fall rains and the goldfish would keep the mosquitoes down then there was the golf course across the street the president asked everyone to grow food especially to put up greenhouses there wasnt any water for the golf course but there were flat areas good places for tents if the commune got big enough when the aliens had blasted kosmograd everything had turned serious so had kenneth dutton two years before hed studied greenhouses but in one twoday spree hed built one from plastic and glass and wood and hard work and goddam had he been proud of himself it worked things grew you could eat them hed built two more before hed even started the stone soup parties just because he could past two oclock and the offutts werent here yet not surprising if they were on bicycles especially if malnutrition was getting to them sarge harris hadnt arrived either lateness was less a discourtesy than a cause for worry had dishshaped craters begun to sprout in city roads the snouts had been gone for three weeks but when might they return and with what patsy clevenger arrived with anthony graves graves was short and round and in fair health for a man pushing seventy he had been a scriptwriter for television he brought treasure lemons from his backyard and a canned ham they settled him in a beach chair from which he could watch the proceedings like a benevolent uncle ken pulled the kettle to the side where sunlight spilling from the mirror would keep the chili simmering an hour he announced to nobody in particular he dumped rice into another pot added water and set it in the focus fistfuls of vegetables went into the water pot cook them next chop up vegetables boil or steam them add mayonnaise and a chopped apple if you had it leave out a few vegetables fiddle with the proportions forget ome of the spices as long as you didnt put in broccoli it was still russian salad if you could get mayonnaise where was sarge harris sarge didnt arrive until four i got a late start and then there was a godawful line for gas and then i tried three markets for potatoes but there werent any at least he had the eggs ken set cora to making them into mayonnaise the sun was getting too low for cooking mayonnaise didnt need heat coffee did better start water warming now sometimes there was no gas patsys flavored coffee could be drunk iced room temperature given the lack of ice the chili was gone and a vegetable curry was disappearing and the copeleys young relatives were just keeping up with the demand for lemonade there was breathing space for ken to find conversations but he tended to drift when his guests started talking about how terrible things were by and large they seemed cheerful enough it felt like cora might stay the night and that would be nice since it felt like patsy would not tarzana didnt have electricity ken dutton and his guests stayed outdoors light came from the bellies of the clouds reflected from wherever the los angeles and san fernando valleys still had electricity occasionally a guest would go inside feeling his way through the darkness toward the flickering light from the bathroom at the next stone soup party there would probably be no candles at all hed boiled a few eggs to decorate the russian salad that looked like it would hold up until the party was over some of the guests were cleaning out the pots it had been settled without much discussion better to get most of the cleaning done before ken served coffee the suspicion existed that anyone who conspicuously shirked cleanup duties might not be invited back for some it was true sarge poured a torrent of dirty water into a patio drain at least we kicked them out of kansas he said graves who had seemed half aseep in his beach chair said did we im told they spent much of their efforts raiding libraries and collecting well memorabilia items that might tell them something of our nature sure wouldnt you it was a reconnoitering expedition in a way it reminds me of the phony war the what the old man laughed i dont blame you nineteen thirtynine to summer of germany and france were officially at war you see but nothing was happening they stared at each other across the maginot line between two lines of trenches and did nothing the papers called it the phony war i expect they didnt like not having a story for the rest of us it was a calm and nervous time like now nothing happening precisely then the nazis came rolling across and took france and nobody said phony war any more patsy followed through suddenly theyll bomb all the cities at once they might give us a chance to surrender first the trouble is theyve never answered any of our broadcasts this may be that chance by their lights and were obliged to work out how to surrender well how if we spend all our time thinking about how to surrender thea theyve got us beaten patsy said heatedly id rather be trying to flatten them even if we lose a few cities ken nodded though the thought brought a chill los angeles behind him marty said ken could i have a word with you they stepped inside found chairs by feel it was too dark to read expressions faint sounds from somewhere in the house might indicate that a couple had felt their way to a couch or a bedroom life goes on marty asked were you serious about getting out sure marty but there are problems i dont own a piece of the enclave yeah well i do as long as the law holds up heh after the law stops mattering is when a man needs something like the enclave and im short in my dues well they might no what i was thinking was john fox hes inthis isnt to get aroundhes in shoshone just outside of death valley camping out till this is all over he knows what hes doing ken never knew you were much of a camper no but fox is and he might be glad to see us if we showed up with food would you like to go with me ken glanced through the picture window automatically before he answered no fights going nobody looked particularly unhappy the russian salad hadnt disappeared yet though bess churchs wheel of cheddar cheese had gone like snow in a furnace the host wasnt needed good he said food and camp gear sure i dont have camp gear and i bet its in short supply anyway suppose john isnt glad to see us no way we could phone ahead shoshones still a good bett why in gods name would even snouts bomb shoshone and john doesnt own those caves we camp out nearby no then where i mean no im not leaving ken dutton had made his decision before he understood the reasons now they were coming to him in the sight and sounds of his crowded and happy territory maybe im crazy im going to stick it out here yup youre crazy thanks for dinner martyd go ken realized he hadnt done any of the cleaning up he wasnt planning to come back jenny woke to a tingling in her left arm the one that had been under jack when she opened her eyes she saw his hello sailor new in town he grinned i like watching you she extracted her arm to look at her watch time we got to work we still have an hour he moved closer to her not that i can its all right but i cant sleep so she sat up lets watch the weirdos weve got pickups in the snout room sounds good he stayed in bed with the sheet over him fastidious likes to see me nekkid but not to be seen id say it was cowardice but how can you say that about a guy wholl put his ass in from of a bullet for the president maybe his scars are classified is this legal jack asked sure im intelligence i can do anything yeh as long as they dont replace the supreme court jenny weve got to obey the rules because we can get away with not obeying them its all right the writers know theyre being watched and harpanets a prisoner no rights satisfied yeah and theres nothing else to watch on my tv i guarantee you that she switched on the set the picture swam into focus an empty box of a room no rugs no furniture no occupants nothing but a movie screen and projector and a broad doorway with edges of freshly cut concrete wrong room she said and fiddled again weve already assigned three rooms in the complex and god knows what theyll think they need next hem the alien lolled at his ease in a sea of steaming mud the humans around him were in beach chairs and swimsuits mud had splashed sherry and joe and nat who were crowded close to the edge wade curtis stayed farther back wearing an african safari bush jacket and seated in a foldup chair with a beer can in his hand just above him was a huge globe of the earth a bar on wheels showed in one corner see they took our swimming pool we move the furniture out when nobodys using it the alien likes his floor room jenny said how about a swim jack eyed the mud with distaste no thanks have you got all the rooms bugged no hell no half these hardsf people are exmilitary and theyd spot that and the other half are liberals weve got pickups in the mudroom and the snout room and the refuge thats the room they use to write up their notes and talk and get drunk but its right next to the snout room the muds new he seems to like it doesnt he can you get us sound too sure jenny turned a dial wade curtis unmistakable voice boomed from the speaker weve pretty well driven the traveler fithp out of kansas were picking through the debris now wed like to know where the fithp will attack next i wasnt told harpanet said his pronunciation was good yet something blurred the words loose air escaped through the nose and lips and there was an echochamber effect perhaps due to his huge lung capacity jack said he learns fast ive talked to french diplomats with thicker accents but jenny was repressing a shudder the carnage in the smashed digit ship was still with her and she had trouble facing the snout curtis was saying your officers dont seem to tell you much of what youre doing no a fi learns little because he might be taken into the enemy herd that has happened with me i have told you this the alien might have been affronted it is a new way of thinking and hard for us sherry atkinson said we must learn what we can she slipped into the mud quite unselfconsciously and rubbed behind the aliens ear with both hands she was already the muddiest of the lot jenny noted curtis asked did your superiors show interest in any area besides kansas kansas the region you invaded this area wade pointed the erstwhile snoutheld territory in kansas was already circled on the great globe with a black magic marker no such interest was shown in my presence what were afraid of is a massive meteorite impact something of asteroid size the alien was silent for a time reynolds busied himself at the bar suddenly the alien said thuktun flishithymessage bearerwas docked to a moonlet of the ringed planet for many years this many the aliens trunk emerged from the mud and he flexed a clump of four digits three times pushing we were not told why i once heard officers call the mass chaytnf what does it mean it means this part of a fi the alien rolled one broad clawed foot emerged the scifi types all seemed to freeze in place but jenny didnt need their interpretation her hand closed painfully on jacks arm my god its real of course the foot theyre planning to stomp us theyre talking too damn much huh the aliens talking a lot more than they are the blurry voice from the tv set was saying it was not so large as many of theasteroidsat the ringed planet i think to the th standard masses standard mass is your mass about eight hundred pounds curtis took a pocket calculator out of his bush jacket jesus twentyseven billion tons nat reynolds said at ten to twenty miles per second that couldharpanet where are they going to drop it i was never told that it would be impacted against earth if so the herdmaster may have sought more data perhaps in kansas jesus jenny jack said theyre telling too much we have to see them now when a pretty girl enters a swimming pool the natural thing to do is follow nat didnt follow at once the pool was filled with thick mud but he was already muddy and there were showers he set his glass down jumped in and waded forward harpanet turned and sprayed sherry with a jet of dark mud nat saw her startled and appalled before she threw up her arms and turned her back hell sherry was from oklahoma this was hardly fair a california boy knows how to waterfight nat half cupped his hands and sent water jetting at the invader the alien preened he liked it sherry was laughing and three others had leaped to her aid and were jetting mud over the aliens back curtis tall wife showed impressive ambidextrous firepower the alien sprayed them back impartially with the capacity of a small fire truck his digits splayed from around the nostril jack clybourne and jenny walked into a mist of mud and a roar of echoing laughter and a water fight raging at the center they stopped in the doorway and waited none of the threat team noticed them the water fight stopped and two muddy writers were now fondling the aliens trunk reynolds asked can you bend it in any direction no sherry began braiding the bifurcations the digits does this hurt no discomfort the trunk lifted and writhed and was no longer braided i wonder just how mobile your tail is curtis said from behind the alien the short somewhat flattened tail flapped up down left right control the speed of a floating car with tail accelerate and stop mmm we couldnt drive your cars then even if we could capture one not one two human could drive or i drive for you nat reynolds noticed the visitors he moved to the doorway without disturbing the rest major jenny did you notice that hes telling us how to steal fithp cars i wondered how much you were telling him jack said nat looked at jack he grinned and said anything everything harpanet is part of the threat team you neednt be so damned flippant he acts like hes switched sides snout to human i take it hes got you convinced were still watching clybourne but its a little more than that he expects us to act like hes switched sides hes not putting any sweat into convincing us sherry thinks its herdbeast behavior i still dont think you should be telling that alien exactly what were afraid of at all times why what is he going to do disguise himself as a general and walk out change clothes with one of us come on or wait for rescue clybourne if the snouts can get him out of cheyenne mountain weve bloody well lost but never mind that think about this somewhere in the sky aboard their mother ship theyve got human prisoners they got some from kansas they may have saved some from the soviet space station theyre probably treating their human prisoners as if they had changed sides if nobodys shot his mouth off too much itll be just like hogans heroes with the fithp totally gullible and the prisoners running rings around them jacks eyes changed he said mr reynolds do you really believe that or are you spinning daydreams oh some of both but it could be true for a while before the aliens catch on our people might actually do some damage and then one human does some damage theyll kill them all wont they i saw those piles of bodies in topeka nat nodded soberly id have liked to meet wes dawson again the snouts are ruining what used to be a fun thing anyway you can see were learning things yeah the asteroid strike will be an ocean strike they like things wet vaporizing a billion tons of seawater wont bother them at all i guess its time to talk to the president again shoshone was a short strip of civilization in the midst of alien wilderness a market a gas station a primitivelooking motel a diner the population must once have been about twenty now at first glance there were none he drove up the dirt track behind the motel the track led through a field of immature tumbleweeds still growing not yet nomadic they were well distributed as if cultivated or as if the plants had made agreements between them this three square feet is mine you get the same intrude at your peril but the plants looked dead and dried the kind of plant that ought to grow in hell martin carnell drove on through slowly fox had described shoshone to him once where were those caves he spotted foxs truck he parked beside the truck and went wandering on foot there was a timeless feel here as if nobody could possibly be in a hurry martin turned the dogs loose into the desert they dashed about enjoying their freedom running back to make contact and dashing away over the small knolls he missed sunhawk at fifteen years sunhawk had gotten too old marty had had to put him to sleep just before kens stone soup party marty wandered up and down the low rock hills presently he found the rooms five of them dynamiteblasted into the rock they were roughly rectangular with shelves and in one instance a door all the comforts of home he thought miners miners would think in terms of dynamite what were they after bauxite had there been real caves to be shaped marty crossed the low ridge puffing on the other side were more caves and john fox dressed in khaki shorts and a digger hat looking up at him fox didnt seem surprised to see him hello marty i heard you clumping around the rock carries sound hello john im carrying some perishables youre invited to dinner is it just you me and the dogs thats darth hes just a puppy darth had come running up to sniff at fox before rejoining his master and ive got lucretia and chaka and here thiss othello the dogs were behaving more or less how are things in los angeles not good short of food no electricity in spots but mainly theres a feel i think the snouts are going to start bombing cities any minute now why no reason anyway i got out what are your plans stay here if you dont mind a neighbor i have fresh artichokes and avocados and bay shrimp also fresh fox looked doubtful a case of wine too fox stood up okay the prisoners thus in the highest position there is the least freedom of action sallust the war with catiline countdown one week to footfall it was exhausting work jeri hated it machines can do this they have machines to do it why us the why didnt matter she didnt know what the fithp would do if she refused to work but she didnt want to find out raztupispminz sent them out in groups but no one objected if they separated jeri didnt think the fithp would ever understand the human need for privacy simply to be alone some of the time but they were beginning to accept it they can watch us better work wearily she took up the cleaning materials and began you are diligent the voice from behind startled her oh hello commander rogachev arvid we have no rank here he laughed cynically we have achieved an equality that marx would have admired although perhaps not in quite the way he envisioned i thought you were a good communist he shrugged i am a good russian you work too hard take a short rest but they he lowered his voice dmitri says and i agree that we must not show them our true strength if you work hard they will expect hard work always you harm the others if you do too much work sounds like a good excuse all right lord knows im tired she stretched out in midair letting the weak gravity slowly take her to the airshaft walls feels good to relax i would kill for a cigarette arvid snorted there is nothing to kill there is nothing to smoke either it wasnt that funny but she wanted to laugh and she did playing up to the nearest hero shut up so you are here with your daughter where is your husband drowned i am sorry so am i we hadnt lived together for a year but i was going to meet him and the snouts blew up a dam the first night i guess the same time they captured you his house was below it arvid pointedly looked away hes nice or trying to be are you married i do not know i was like you we had not lived together for some months but that was not estrangement i was in space now so many have died my wife was russian the base was in the ukraine john woodward tells me he heard tales of revolt in the soviet union the moslem republics would see this invasion as the punishment of allah the ukraine was never satisfied to be part of russia either perhaps he shrugged so many have died doesnt it upset you not knowing of course we russians are great sentimentalists what should i do mourn to her i am dead even if she lives i am not likely to see her again in any case jeri gasped i i guess i never thought about it that way were none of us going to get back alive are we arvid shrugged again the only way we will be taken to earth is as part of their herd that implies victory for them i do not believe russia will surrender easily or the united states americans are stubborn stubborn maybe thats it we like to say we love freedom did you hear much of russia arvid asked seriously no there was a little on the radio about how russia was being attacked just like we were i didnt see much of what they did to us the dam i saw that and harry told me about other dams and bridges and they made a big crater on a main highway right where two highways crossed but i didnt see much until they landed and that was the first attack arvid said the next time will be more serious what will they do the ship is mated to a foot i do not think it will be long mated nikolai has seen it he told her of nikolais report so you think theyll throw the asteroid at earth why should they not arvid asked seriously no of course it makes sense she shuddered and we thought it was bad when they attacked the bridges and dams nows when it gets really bad yes i must say it is pleasant not having to explain these things to you she made an irritated gesture women arent stupid you know he shrugged some are some are not as with men perhaps it is time to begin work again come we can stay together if you do not mind its all right fog lay across the bellingham harbor and rain drizzled from the skies from the harbor area distant sounds of work drifted up to the enclave hammers trucks barge motors something that buzzed theyre sure building a hell of a greenhouse isadore said he laughed george tateevans looked at their own efforts and joined the laughter well i guess its more than we did they went back into the house kevin shakes watched them go then went back to work i thought wed done pretty well he said sure miranda answered enough to send mom up the walls in fact they had done a lot where picture windows had surrounded the xshaped house now there were steel shutters where the tennis court had been above the hidden bomb shelter there stood the skeleton of a greenhouse kevin was nailing glass plates into place with exquisite care hed finished the bottom two rows now he must work on the ladder with miranda to hand him tools and panes and move the ladder on its wheeled base george tateevans and isadore leiber came out carrying half a dozen sheets of glass laughing as they came kevin heard still isnt talking to you vicki is ominously silent iz i thought it was over once we got the shutters up you know the house feels like a prison i never thought wed be living in a prison and then she settled down and then there was the president saying everyone should build greenhouses and two days later you and jack were saying that for once the fuzzyheaded liberal son of a bitch was probably right kevin miranda howre you doing so far so good kevin said maybe another two days you could start planting now lets look it over iz the older men set the glass on a pair of sawhorses isadore followed george around the corner and into the greenhouse they walked the imaginary aisles avoiding the white chalk markings put down to show where the plants would go there was no glass to diminish their voices george was saying iz by the time we got serious about the greenhouse all the glass in bellingham and most of the plastic was bought up where else were we going to get glass you can see their point though clara too damn straight all right so its ugly why do we have to have all the women on our backs its not just ugly we took out the windows that means well have these damn shutters till we can take down the greenhouse if ever maybe we can put the windows back after the government job gets going from above their heads kevin said what isadore looked up in surprise george didnt bother iz youre nuts depend on the government for food god knows what the governments going to do with the stuff it grows but you can be sure we dont get any of it sure kevin said why else would they build greenhouses at the harbor unless they were going to ship it all out well never get any what make you so sure it is a greenhouse george asked oh come on its been all over the radio isadore said anyway what else could it be they say theyre setting up a whole regional grain belt theyll renovate the harbor and dredge it because they need it to ship the grain out isnt that great after all the trouble we spent finding ourselves a sleepy little backwater town yeah i suppose george said isadore nodded another thing pricesll go up thatll hit your dad kevin but we can stand it rohrs should like it thingsll get crowded tourists traffic jams kevin miranda called yeah lets take a break but when his sister had that edge in her voice there was something to it even their father knew that be right with you he slid down the ladder what he asked when they got to the water bucket i was out with leigh last night yeah you sure were you were out late enough to have dad pacing the floor mother wasnt too happy either she kept saying you had to be safe you were out with a policeman but she didnt mean it something happen something we need to tell them did he propose are you pregnant well maybe but not that she giggled no leigh told me something hes seen an astronaut astronaut gillespie the one who commanded the last shuttle the flight that took that poor congressman up to the russian space station gillespies in charge of this big government project and theyre setting up all kinds of guard stations fences everything for a greenhouse thats what i wondered leigh says they told him its to protect the food that makes sense look at all the trouble dad went to to protect ours sure maybe but an astronaut why kevin i dont know randy i dont either and i think we should tell dad bill shakes was toting up accounts with the help of his pocket computer kevin and miranda waited until they saw him pause then kevin said weve got an astronaut in bellingham shakes looked up so major general edmund gillespie he went up to kosmograd with dawson now hes here miranda found out about it yesterday he was careful not to say last night miranda took up the tale leigh spent day before yesterday and part of yesterday taking him all over bellingham i asked him where he was and he told me all about it whats he want i mean gillespie i dont know leigh says he looked over everything he looked at the harbor he looked at the railroad he toured the whole town all that for a government greenhouse shakes scowled so weve got a real live astronaut scouting bellingham were getting too damn conspicuous the thing about being a survivalist is you keep your head down we have to miranda said theres no gasoline and leigh says theyre going to close off the highway except for essential traffic to save maintenance hmm it was easy to see what bill shakes was thinking bellingham lay between mountains and the straits of juan de fuca restricting highway use was the same as not letting them leave town not that theres anyplace better for us to go to shakes said carefully weve invested a lot here and we cant take it with us well we thought you should know kevin said yeah yeah why an astronaut i suppose he doesnt have much of anything better with the snouts shooting spaceships out of the sky still it doesnt fit shakes frowned you like this deputy sheriff dont you yes good see more of him kevin suppressed an urge to giggle jack clybourne stood in the doorway blocking the presidents path no sir he said firmly mr clybourne admiral carrell said mildly no jack said firmly before the president goes in there you get that alien out or you give me a hell of a lot more gun than this pistol and thats final admiral carrell sighed jack jenny stepped forward how do i get him out of this jack will you agree if i bring in sergeant bonner and two mps with military rifles you cant do that sherry atkinson protested we cant make harpanet feel that we dont trust him damn it all mr president wade curtis said yes mr curtis the president asked he sounded as if he was suppressing a chuckle their top brass travel with armed guards harpanet wont see anything unusual in having the president escorted by soldiers do you think i will need them mr curtis no but i see jacks point if harpanet decided to take on the president hed be damned hard to stop incidentally if youre going to do this do it right none of those dinky little mattel toy rifles get a couple of thirtyoughtsixes and where will we find those jenny asked theres one in my room ransoms got another curtis said thats why mr president joe ransom finished his presentation the room filled with writers and engineers and soldiers stood in silence so that the only sound was the heavy breathing of the alien captive impressive president coffey said he looked bewilderedly around the room until his eyes met those of the alien harpanet stood thirty feet away as far as clybourne could put him with four armed combat veterans between the alien and the president and still too close jenny thought what do you call him has he a title the president asked just harpanet mr president robert anson said any title he might have had from his own people was lost when he surrendered and we have not yet given him one harpanet the president said quietly lead me have you understood what was said here yes is it true they will drop a large asteroid on the earth the alien spread his digits he says he cant know sherry interpreted but your ship was to be mated with a foot yes the s sound fluttered is there anyone here who disagrees the president demanded there was only silence president coffey began to pace well have to warn as many people as possible worldwide god i wish they hadnt made such hash of our communications yes admiral i think we dont dare dare what warn the world wed be condemning millions tidal waves storms earthquakes volcanoes itll be like a weeklong disaster movie festival and if we do issue a warning we will certainly condemn thousands tens of thousands admiral carrell said they will flee from the coasts all the coasts but its better than doing nothing mr president robert anson seemed to have aged ten years in months but his voice was firm and insistent yes mr anson if you issue a warning people will flee the coastal towns bellingham is a coastal town but you dare not have people flee from every town except bellingham anson said he is certainly correct admiral carrell said if you issue a warning you will disrupt project archangel perhaps permanently and archangel is the only goddam chance we have curtis said the president sat heavily his fingers drummed against the desk after a few moments he looked up thor would you send mrs coffey in please ill speak with the rest of you later thank you for your advice mrs carmichael had told alice a story once later alice had asked around and everyone had heard it the psychiatrists probably thought it did their patients good maybe it did a motorist finds himself with a flat tire on a back road late at night theres a fence someone is peering through it not doing anything just watching the motorist sees a sign in the headlights hes parked next to a mental institution he takes the flat tire off putting the five nuts in the hubcap the stranger watches he pulls the spare tire out of the trunk the stranger watches motorist is getting nervous whats a maniac doing out so late at night why is he staring like that motorist rolls the tire around from the back and steps on the rim of the hubcap which flips all of the nuts into tall weeds motorist goes after them he finds one nut the mental patient speaks take a nut off each of the other tires put them on the fourth wheel four nuts each itll get you to a gas station motorist says thatll work then hey thats brilliant what the hell are you doing here patient says im here for being crazy not stupid the air pipes were a little more than a yard across there we no handholds at first alice had floundered lost and nauseated and fighting the fear of falling it was better now jeri and melissa actually enjoyed the low gravity and theyd shown alice how alice had always been thin pale face fiery hair slender body vividly pretty for whatever that was worth now she was gaunt she tried to eat but there was no appetite and the horrors tried to foist nauseating alien plants and meat on her the others accepted such treatment they ate canned food and alien food they ate the vitamins and protein powder and brewers yeast she had supplied and they thrived living wasnt worth the effort under these circumstances alice had slashed her wrists once long ago for reasons that seemed trivial now something sharp would presently come her way yet she was half sure she wouldnt use it after all who would care the little girl melissa treated her with something between fear and contempt jeri was nice but she spent a lot of time with the russians i think she likes the big one he does things for her brings her things got the blanket to put around the toilet pool that was nice nobody does things for me they resent me with wes dawson it went far beyond resentment he gave orders he lectured he taught the language of the horrors an expected the women to use it he was persuasive and smooth and condescending like that first psychiatrist they had given her the one who thought using qtips was a form of masturbation shed gotten along all right with the second one mrs carmichael had looked a little like jeri wilson a little plumper and not as scared alice thought the horrors were worse than dawson anything short of instant obedience puzzled them they solved the problem by prodding with their trunks or the butts of the twistedlooking guns they wouldnt listen to anything she had to say they treated her like a thing if alice mclennon slashed her wrists it would be one less damn thing for the horrors to worry about this cleaning of air pipes it was makework a way of keeping the prisoners busy like picking tomatoes at menningers alice wasnt fooled im here for being crazy not stupid the horrors were too big to fit in the pipes what had they done before people turned up maybe they had rotorooters or maybe the pipes just never needed cleaning or shed glimpsed something like a steel doughnut just the size of the pipe with a glittering eye that watched her from a distance robots and like the makework at menningers it served its purpose theyd pushed her into the ducts when she balked those rubbery split trunks were irresistibly strong she floundered in there disoriented and nauseated and took the great wad of cloth and the plastic bag that were shoved in after her then she hadnt done anything for a while then she started to clean the pipes well there was dust and rust and it came off there were wads of goop and soil and feathers in the filters and moving around in the pipes she began to learn a kind of skill there were no handholds of course not the horrors had never expected that living things would need them in here she learned to move in a zigzag jumping style swiping at the sides with the cloth it worked it worked and she was getting better at it but it was makework and she couldnt wait to get back to the garden with its open spaces some of the plants were sprouting alice was afraid to touch them mrs woodward chuckled rice i might have known it would be rice rice likes it wet what do we do now nothing there aint any bugs here if it aint broke dont fix it maybe we want to block off the water pipes that feeds some of the other stuff alice nodded she pushed herself back to look at the vegetable plot was that another tuft of green where theyd planted corn and runner beans together alice belatedly realized that she was too far from a handhold it didnt bother her much she was used to freefall she floated waiting for thuktun flishithys minuscule thrust to pull her someplace useful something wrapped around her ankle she jumped as if shed been electrocuted and looked down at a cluster of tentacles a broad brown head wrinkled with age and recessed eyes raztupispminz you have learned to recognize me good how is your health alice im fine your plants are sprouting i am pleased i think our plants will grow in your world alice held her face expressionless dawson had suggested if the plants grew well earth would become more desirable to the horrors and she hadnt believed him should the plants die easy enough but shed have to go on eating what they fed now i want to explain something the teacher said you may have noticed that some of the fithp are acting strangely the mating season has started for one class of us the sleepers and it affects their behavior they are not turning rogue but do not irritate them youre not a sleeper are you and takpusseh is mating season goes with the females the sleeper females are spaceborn and so is tashayamp for most of the year many days to come you may see me as neuter she studied him but there was nothing to be read in his alien face yet this was a teacher and a manipulator can you hear thought hear thought he snorted no but i can see you talk of mating with females you shy from males when you can you are thin in the hips your breasts are flat sometimes there are fithp who are shaped like females but never come into season alice leapt away back to the seed plot back to the company of the other prisoners nobody had ever suggested such a thing to her they thought she was strange yes but a neuter a freemartin if she didnt like men it was because men were were she feared the teacher would follow but in fact he was was speaking to another fi to the other teacher takpusseh she remembered now that men had tried to tell her that she was strange to put her on the defensive fuck me to prove youre a woman the thought of being raped by raztupispminz was ludicrous and horrible mostly ludicrous she decided no man had ever started by telling her to think of him as a neuter tashayamp took her back to the cell with mr and mrs woodward and wes dawson they were there long enough to eat and use the toilet the only thing that could have made that tolerable to alice was watching how it bothered the others an hours rest then fithp came to escort them to the ducts none of the humans had noticed that she wasnt talking maybe they were glad alice broke away from the others as soon as she could and let the wind carry her away farther than shed ever gone before she wasnt feeling sociable presently she braked herself and began desultorily to clean the walls the wind had grown cold it matched her mood she hardly noticed at first but the wall was even colder on one side here was a curve to mark a side channel in the duct but it was blocked by a hatch she passed it soon the wall warmed alice went back she didnt like taking orders and she didnt like knowing that things were hidden from her the goddam psychiatrists always had something they werent telling her there was a slot to house the hatch alice got her fingers into a crack and pushed and the door moved back against springs enough to let her through the air was terribly cold and still she followed a short duct and found a grill ten yards beyond was a peculiar surface black and nearly smooth but with undulations in it like very dirty ice with her face pressed to the grill alice could see the curve of it like the inner wall of a cylinder she studied it for a time there was a bulge in the surface like an unfinished raised relief painting a frieze of one of the horrors dirty ice dawson had said what the horrors liked mud it puzzled them that humans bathed in clean water but frozen mud the grill was loose in her hands she pushed it aside and floated in it was frozen mud on one side a ceiling of painted friezes on the other the artwork was weird alien sometimes beautiful horrors fithp half hidden among weird trees she recognized some from the garden area here a good representation of one of the horrors faced a block covered with alien script and sculpted into the opposing mudbank was a similar shape shed freeze here alice backed into the duct pulled the grill after her and set it in place alice didnt like secrecy she would have to learn more she found an exit from the air shaft this part of the ship was strange and she didnt know how to get home it was hard stopping one of the horrors in the corridor she said raztupispminz and followed it after it gave up trying to talk to her she was tired and she ached the horrors on earth had stopped her before she got around to collecting conveniences like cosmetics and liniment cleaning out air ducts was so much like flying she hadnt noticed how hard she was working she wanted ben gay she wanted to curl up and wait for the pain to go away alice wants to tell you something melissa said jeri stirred wearily how do you know she keeps looking at you but she wants to see you alone i know mom i can tell alice is yeah interesting can you read her mind or are you guessing or what jeri floated lazily over to grip the wall beside alice howd it go words bubbled out quickly jeri i found a peculiar place cold enough to freeze your ass off locked off black ice everywhere or something like it a long way from here storage room anything stored there no just ice all along the one wall the hull wall dawson said they like mud maybe its their idea of a big spa why would they freeze their spa lets ask arvid alice looked afraid again he wont hes a good man alice oh all right rogachev frowned deeply frozen solid i didnt touch it it must have been it was cold no gravity no spin because we are mated to the foot they cannot bathe in mud under those conditions but from the pictures they showed us we know they enjoy that they will have a place for mud and they must keep it when there is no gravity da so they froze it in place that makes sense jeri said yeah alice agreed all right explain this one there was a shape in the mud like a frieze like one of those horrors under a blanket how as if it were lying on its side yeah now what was that wes dawson was close enough to hear youre sure of this yes a frieze of a fi i didnt say it was a frieze i said it was like that alice said certainly dawson made his voice soothing he made no move to come closer to her arvid what do you think i do not know i think we should tell raztupispminz we will consider that arvid said he turned to dmitri you have heard da they spoke rapidly in russian jeri took arvids arm they learn languages quickly she said they say they dont know any russian arvid smiled if they have learned rapidly enough to comprehend the accented dialect we are now speaking nothing will defeat them he turned back to the others the liquid syllables continued finally dmitri nodded arvid turned to the others da we will do it then alice you must tell your story to our masters the mudroom was warm enough for comfort and the mud was thawing by the time pretheetehdamb arrived raztupispminz had told him that the redhaired human was certified rogue she could be hallucinating the comfort that gave pretheetehdamb vanished as he entered there in the ceiling was a frieze of thowbintherthuktun a halflegendary priest of two eightcubeds of years ago opposite thowbintherthuktun was an entirely similar bulge some fi must have an odd sense of humor he must have entered the mudroom after acceleration stopped had shaped the mud into a ribald parody of the ancient discoverer of the podo thuktun but preetheetehdamb was beginning to shiver and it comforted him that his octuple were all spaceborn remove the mud he told one of his fithp carefully but waste no time we resume acceleration shortly this couldnt have happened at a worse time within hours they would release the foot then there would be violent maneuvers as they placed thuktun flishithy in position to send down the digit ships the invasion of winterhome was about to begin and now this the warrior scraped away softened mud with the back of his bayonet and fathistehtulk began to take shape the herdmaster waited impatiently for the call then pretheeteldamb came onto the screen there was activity behind him report it is indeed fathistehtulk herdmaster he was drowned we find no breaks in the skin by now the corpse was free from the ice visible in the screen it rotated slowly for inspection by the octuples physician theres a deep groove in fathistehtulk trunk above the nostril it might have been made by a cord pulled very tight but it wouldnt have killed him mud caked in the fis mouth it looks like a ritual execution he was drowned thank you pastempehkeph broke the connection the octuple clan must be informed the women will not be pleased murder murder was rare among the fithp it was almost always the beginning of rebellion we approach the final moments herdmaster the attackmaster said what shall we do run away drop the foot to slow the humans confine them to their planet while we take the rest of their solar system which is more valuable than the planet anyway fathistehtulk would have given that advice gladly advisor siplisteph will not the sleeper women will never consent to that nor will fistartehthuktun attackmaster lead me continue with the battle plan you are in charge of thuktun flishithy footfall i dreamt the past was never past redeeming but whether this was false or honest dreaming i beg deaths pardon now and mourn the dead richard wilbur the pardon countdown footfall the funeral pit was a cylinder of soil garbage bones and what remained of the honored dead all being gradually churned into an indistinguishable matrix instruments sampled the blend for acidity bacterial population temperature the atmosphere within was unbreathable workers in pressure suits maintained a cavity in the matrix open at the fore end they had removed several tons of it into the garden to make room for this days funeral proceedings the cold had preserved fathistehtulk his eyes looked off at different angles as lines lowered him to join the silent fithp his digitcluster bent strangely above the nostril one eye met pastempehkephs my breath was closed with rope and then with mud why both what might i have said that i did not say while alive who never hesitated to speak who closed my mouth with mud the herdmaster shook his head i will learn he had already spoken his formal farewell to todays halfdozen dead recognizing posthumous accomplishments sometimes authorizing upgrades in harness colors before a corpse was stripped for burial elaborate funeral practices had evolved among the spaceborn during three generations of interstellar flight inevitably they were geared to a life in spin gravity the funeral pit was on the ships axis ceremonies were held in the leavetaking chamber a partial ring along the lip of the funeral pit where spin gravity was almost nil todays ceremony obeyed tradition the main drive was running at high thrust the hum of it was everywhere yet there was almost no acceleration pastempehkeph sensed the immense mass against which message bearer was pushing message bearer was even now issuing its final direction to the nickelandiron residue of an icy moonlet she must break loose within a breath or ride the foot down to winterhorne had a lessor personage led these rites they might have been postponed until after the maneuvers but after they separated from the foot there would never again be time fathistehtulk deserved all honors and even if he did not i could not seem niggardly in granting honor to a former herdmaster chowpeentulk watched through glass as fathistehtulk came rest in the moving earth her digits wrapped the child and held it to her throat to suckle he was male eight days old under light thrust he would already have walked in nearly freefall he drifted with waving legs he seemed to enjoy it my mate was murdered chowpeentulk said who i face too many answers pastempehkeph said your mate was never careful of whom he might offend she trumpeted wildly the child startled flung its stubby digits across its head and tried to burrow between chowpeentulks legs in the minuscule thrust its efforts lifted her from the floor it was strong for a newborn the loss of dignity slowed her not at all this crime was committed against the whole of the traveler fithp she bellowed sleepers and spaceborn how can we hold together unless the murderers face judgment the herdmaster let silence follow letting chowpeentulk see how the others the fithp and the little clump of humans stared at her then we will solve this you know that i like puzzles do you also know that i must fight a war he looked into the funeral pit farewell fathistehtulk you have too much company he joined takpusseh as they were leaving fathistehtulk had always the virtue of asking interesting questions he said now i must find my own you will have an advisor said takpusseh bah siplisteph will have to be trained breakertwo did fathistehtulk ask you interesting questions takpusseh snorted i did not find them so he wanted to interview the humans in privacy why he would not say the humans are not his thuktun i told him that i myself would translate and that i would inform you of all that transpired he declined he said that he would simply wait for me to do my job very proper said pastempehkeph did he propose questions for you to ask he did not a pity will you be on the bridge during footfall no to think of humans as enemy or prey would ruin my empathy with them such as it is tashayamp left them at the cell door you will stay in place be prepared to cling to the walls first that wall but change walls when you are warned the direction of pull will change often before each change you will hear this she trumpeted then spoke in a breathy trombone chant you understand good they went to the bulkhead jeri dug her nails into the rug it is indelicate arvid said but they gave no indication of time it would be well to use the facilities while we are able good thinking dawson said ladies first nobody else wanted to be first so jeri went it wasnt so bad now that arvid and nikolai had rigged a blanket to enclose the shallow pool jeri went back to the wall melissa i want you here if you do not object i will stay with you also arvid said thank you what did you think of their funeral rites arvid asked my anthropology teacher said funeral rites were the most important clues to a tribal culture jeri said but i think that was because she was an archaeologist and graves are about the only things they can find with anything important in them the predecessors must like bad smells melissa said because that place stank gary giggled agreement jen said there thats what i meant theres nothing arbitrary aboard a spaceship they dont have to put up with that smell they want it it must be part of the funeral the sense that the dear departed is turning into fertilizer then plants then arvid said you understood more of his speech than i i got some of it too wes dawson said the long speech by the priest he talked about fathistehtulk coming back to traveler fithp i wondered if he meant in person do you think they believe in that jen asked dunno dawson said the body recirculates maybe they think the soul does too i think not arvid said else why would they make no mention of the newborn one the predecessors are always with us he said how could that other species join the traveler fithp their bodies recirculate and there are the thuktunthp but of course they do not believe bourgeois myths of gods immortality dmitri said there is much to admire in these fi they work together and if need be they give their lives for herd john woodward sniffed loudly and turned away that one didnt alice said the widow said he was murdered and the bull elephant wasnt happy about it either an interesting mystery arvid said who might have killed him well never know dawson said why do you say that dmitri demanded the leader told the widow that he would find the murderer he has great resources why would he fail why would he tell us if he did would we know the name hey i read mysteries too but i expect to know the names of suspects the bull isnt a detective jen said he has too much else to do and people im kind of scared all this violent maneuvering theyre going to do something special but what i am very much afraid we all know arvid rogachev said jeri took a fresh grip on the wall carpeting major major wake up jenny sat bolt upright yes sergeant message from australia maam theyve seen it oh my god she strained to open her eyes and peered through sleep at her watch five am comin fast about an hour to impact sergeant ferguson said the admiral mailey already woke him up scuse me maam i got to get the others the threat team had split into two groups around the coffeepot and the large globe ransom and curtis already had coffee and were tracing paths on the globe water i was sure of it ransom said sure curtis muttered why at bloody dawn why water a naval officer asked ransom didnt look up from the globe lieutenant a meteorite that size actually does more damage if it hits water itll rip through the water and the ocean floor into the magma the energies dont go back to space the water absorbs them and you get even more heat from the exposed magma it all goes into boiling the ocean we think a quarter of a billion tons of seawater may vaporize salt rains all over the world jenny shuddered how many people will it kill lots curtis said look he traced a path northward from the indian ocean bays they funnel the tsunamis let them build even higher before they break calcutta bombay the rann of kutch all gone persian gulf same thing east africa we have to warn them im sure the aussies have done that ransom said it does not matter admiral carrells voice was even jenny reflexively straightened to attention sir we have no reliable communications with east africa i believe that mr ransom is correct and that the australians have sent a warning but if not theyll know soon enough curtis said what about ships subs we still have communications with the submarine fleet dont we in fact yes carrell said our longwave devices still function i have already given the appropriate orders reynolds came over with coffee curtis pointed to a spot on the globe reynolds bent to examine it tsunamis hurricanes i wish we knew exactly where itll hit curtis said maybe we could tell just how much weather slop will get into the northern hemisphere lots ransom said its too near the equator mess up both hemispheres reynolds said neat fear fire foes curtis muttered tsunamis hurricanes rainstorms he stood with a satisfied look one thing it wont hurt bellingham thats a comfort someone said goddam right it is curtis said about the only one weve got as strategy its hard to beat joe ransom said look when the tidal waves shut up a young naval officer shouted later man but for now just shut up jenny bent over to listen as curtis and ransom continued to talk to the east the island of madagascar would shadow mozambique and south africa a little the waves would wash tanzania kenya the somali democratic republic wash them clean of life northeast it would wash the saudi arabian peninsula the arabian sea would focus the wave a mountain range of water would march into iran and pakistan thats the end of opec jenny thought with a flash of vindictive triumph the end of the oil too india would be covered north to the mountains the bay of bengal would focus the wave again it might cross burma as far as china the islands of the java sea would be inundated the wave would wash across western australia my god the naval officer said in sudden realization theyll try to land afterward of course but where thats why its such a marvelous strategy yes mr ransom admiral carrell said where would we send our fleets india saudi arabia australia africa south africa curtis said look here most of the industry and white population are down at sea level tsunamis will wreck all that beyond the coast is the drakensberg escarpment up to the high plateau country and thatll survive just fine so they land at johannesburg and pretoria and they have themselves an isolated industrial foothold admiral carrell bent over to examine the globe perhaps a horp warbled through the room now hear this ten minutes to estimated time of impact the room fell silent herdmaster pastempehkeph felt the tiny thrust decrease further as he made his way to the bridge matters there ran over smooth trails koothfektilrusp turned to say the foot is on target the defensemaster may break us loose at any time do it said pastempehkeph defensemaster you lead now he settled himself on his pad and set his claws on the recessed foothold bars a recording bellowed for attention throughout the huge ship take footholds take footholds thrust in eight breaths the herdmasters claws tightened on the bars what can go wrong the drive wont fail us weve been running it steadily for many eightdays the prey cant possibly stop the foot now if they could harm message bearer they would have acted earlier message bearer surged steadily smoothly backward swinging round to face outward from winterhome as the pitted and gouged mass of nickel and iron moved away a magnificent blueandwhite crescent moved into view thrust built up and the herdmaster felt himself sagging into the pad his muscles grown slack in low gravity protested he welcomed the feeling of gravity at a thrust higher than homeworld gravity acceleration peaked then the motors on the digit ships began to fire and thrust rose again the crescent was dead aft growing tremendous message bearer was accelerating outward and backward from winterhome the foot would strike ahead of message bearer the impact point would still be in view the herdmaster summoned a view of the humans quarters theyd reached the restraint cell safely they were on their bellies on the padding it looked uncomfortable thrust dropped in increments as pairs of digit ships left their moorings around the aft rim the herdmaster watched their pulsing drive flames curve away they must decelerate more drastically to take up orbit about winterhome the last four merely took up station alongside the mother ship if something deadly rose from winterhome they might be of help but nothing broke the curdled clouds the terminator swung round until half the disk was lighted and the foot was invisible against the night side there just inside the shadow a red pinpoint flare the pinpoint glowed orange then white then blinding white all within the fraction of a breath herdmaster pastempehkeph contracted his pupils it wasnt enough he turned away the lurid light on the walls of the control complex flared and held and dimmed he turned back a white flare was dimming expanding reddening rings of cloud formed and vanished around an expanding hemisphere of flame clouds spread outward through the stratosphere hiding what was beneath fistartehthuktun spoke formally our footprint is on their sea bed attackmaster its right in the middle of that stretch of water is that where you wanted it exactly on target said koothfektilrusp well done message bearer was passing winterhome at sixty makasrupkithp per breath but winterhomes rotation kept the footprint in sight a fireball stood above the planets envelope of air it clung to the mass of the planet like a flaming leech light reflected orange from a solid stretch of cloud cover the fireball stood in a ring of clear air a ringshaped ripple beneath the cloud sheet expanded outward at terrible speed the ripple picked up distortions as it traveled the shock wave through the ocean distorts the cloud cover koothfektilrusp said like bulges moving beneath a fallen tent our experts will be able to pick out the contours of the continents and ocean floor by the way they retard the wave it was mysterious and horrible it only suggested the millions of prey who would drown beneath the clouds and the seawater thus we achieve equality with the predecessors said fistartehthuktun the herdmaster was jolted are you serious i dont know what horror lies beneath that fortunate shroud of water droplets how many of the prey will we drown how much terrain do we bar to the use of any living thing what was our own world like when the predecessors were dying and our fithp were brainless beasts the layer of cloud was now flowing backward into the fireball another layer formed above high in the stratosphere beginning to spread waves of blue light formed and dispersed pretty pictures abstracts but on an awesome scale one may hope that we have not invented a new art form awe and horror the herdmaster trampled them deep into the bottom of his mind we came to take winterhome do the thuktunthp hold knowledge to help us understand this perhaps we accept do we not that the predecessors altered the natural state of a world their world our world now winterhome is our world look how we distort its natural state what did their meddling cost the predecessors have we done better have we done better we must speak again you and i but this path was chosen long ago and we must follow it attackmaster you may assume command of the digit ships begin your landings commander anton villars stared through the periscope and tried to look calm it wasnt easy an hour before the message had come to uss ethan allen the longwave transmitters were reliable but slow the message came in dots and dashes code tapped out and taken down to be put through the code machines it couldnt be orders to attack the soviet union there was no soviet union villars had been prepared to launch his poseidon missiles against an unseen enemy in space instead large object rpt large object will impact s latitude e longitude hours zulu observe if safe stop impact energies estimated at megatons rpt megatons stop any information valuable stop godspeed stop carrell safe from four thousand megatons there wasnt any safety villars urge was to submerge and flee at flank speed off to starboard the island of rodriguez blazed with the colors of life jungle had long since given way to croplands in the center bare rock reared sharply a peak a third of a mile high waves broke over a surrounding coral reef that reef would provide more cover when the tsunami came but it was a danger too fishing boats were straggling in through the reef probably doomed there was nothing villars could do for them it was just dusk clouds covered the sky it would be difficult to see anything coming four thousand megatons bigger than any bomb we ever dreamed of much less built the crew waited tensely john antony the exec stood close by about time antony said if their estimate was on if their time was off so were their coordinates i know that i had the same instructor at annapolis as you did somebody laughed and choked it off the news had filtered through the ship as news like that always did the cameras were working villars wondered how many would survive he peered through the darkest filter available four thousand megatons suddenly the clouds were blazing like the sun first flash at hours seconds he called log that where where would it fall all in an instant a hole formed in the clouds to the northeast the glare became gods own flashbulb and the cameras were gone get those other cameras up villars bellowed at men who were already doing that his right eye saw nothing but afterimage he put his left to the periscope he saw light he squinted and saw light glaring out of a hole in the ocean a widening hole in the ocean with smoothly curved edges wisps of mist streaming outward and a conical floodlight beam pointing straight up the beam grew wider the pit was expanding clouds formed and vanished around a smoothly curved wall of water sweeping smoothly toward the sub the rim of a sun peeped over the edge i make it about forty miles east northeast of present position okay thats it villars straightened bring in the cameras down periscope take us to ninety feet how deep the further down the less likely well get munched by suface phenomena but if those tsunamis are really big they might pile enough water on top of ethan allen to crush us flank speed your course is degrees that leaves us in deep water and puts rodriguez between us and that thing for whatever good itll do so weve seen it a sight nobody ever saw well nobody who wrote it down anyway now all i have to do is save the ship ethan allen was about to fight the biggest tsunami in human history and just now he was broad on to it he glanced at his watch tsunamis traveled at speeds from two hundred to four hundred miles an hour call this one four six minutes left standard rudder bring her to degrees bring her to aye aye the quartermaster answered warn em villars said now hear this now hear this damage control stations stand by for depth charges might as well be depth charges the ship turned it surged backward villars felt the blood rushing into his face somewhere aft a shrill scream was instantly cut off and the captain heard a thud minutes later theres a current captain were being pulled northeast steady as she goes goddam we lived through it the news came on at nine am when you could get it marty always listened fox didnt always bother no matter how early he got up marty always found fox was awake with a pot of coffee it was no use persuading fox to go easy on the coffee when we run out we do without until then we have coffee was his only answer to martys pleas to conserve you know your trouble marty marty looked up from the radio he was trying to tune eh youre still connected to that world you left as long as you let civilization worry you its one more way the desert can kill you relax go with the punches theres nothing they can do to us weve already given up everything they control now its us yeah sure marty tuned the set carefully you think youve quit huh hed thrown a wire for an antenna across the top of the tall pole somebody had set up as a flagpole years ago it worked pretty well four hours after dawn shoshone would normally have been a furnace this morning some strange clouds wispy and very high had begun to form quite early they werent thick enough to block off the sun but they must have had some effect it was still hot enough to bring sweat fox said im just taking a break ill save the world when it wants saving again okay so nobodys worried about the snail darter when the sky is full of bugeyed monsters but ive listened to you john and youd still like to make washington not washington anymore yeah atom bombs in kansas dont ruffle your feathers i think i got it tuned ruffled feathers be damned fox had his selfinflating mattress stretched out on a flat rock he didnt seem to notice the heat sprawled out with his coffee mug sitting on a flat stone he looked indecently comfortable the question is whos going to listen shh ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states hey john we got the president on yeah but fox moved his mattress closer my fellow americans this morning the alien invaders struck at earth with a large artificial meteor which landed in the southern hemisphere in the indian ocean the effect was that of a tremendous bomb my advisors inform me that we can expect some severe weather effects meteor fox muttered he looked up and marty did too there were more clouds now and they were swirling changing growing dense and dark streaming east like foam on a breaking wave marty remembered how fast clouds moved in a kansas tornado these were moving faster global weather will definitely be affected this makes project greenhouse even more important i call upon every one of you to raise food in small pots indoors outdoors wherever you can if you can build greenhouses do so county agents and other department of agriculture experts will show you how america must feed herself marty thought not here we wont but the grin wouldnt come global weather fox said again christ have they thrown us a dinosaur killer indian ocean how long will that take marty i wouldnt know how much gas do we have about five gallons better gas up the truck i think i want to use it by noon the clouds covered the sky the sun that had blazed like a deadly enemy since martys arrival two days ago was hidden now marty watched fox with some concern for fox watched the sky as if he feared a corrosive rain the rain started at one the first huge drops drummed on the truck cab and marty lifted his face to taste it it was only plain water not plain not at all and marty felt a thrill of fear when he tasted silt and salt fox shouted lets go go where come on damn it marty jumped in after him he had just time to whistle up the dogs and let them jump into the truck bed he was a little worried about darth who was young enough to try jumping out when the truck was moving damn dogs cant even stay and watch the camp sure they can if thats what you want marty said are we coming back huh yeah were coming back then stop long enough for me to tell them what to do oh yeah sure fox stopped the truck marty posted the dogs except for the pup whod have to come with them guard chaka looked up mournfully but obeyed the rain was falling hard now rain in july in shoshone above death valley seabed silt when the meteor struck in the indian ocean i dont believe this where are we going place i know come on fox drove down the dirt track to the main road a big gasoline tanker was parked at the diner marty felt a twinge that tanker held enough gas to get them both to the enclave in bellingham a hundred times over i wonder where hes taking it they drove up the paved road then turned left onto a gravel road fox drove as he always did faster than marty would but carefully he ground his lean jaw as he drove whats got to him they rounded a peak and drove onto a wide ledge fox got out slowly marty followed darth came with him huddling against his leg death valley was spread out below them barren as the moon more like mercury marty thought remembering the terrible heat but he could see very little rain obscured the view and a fog was rising too the rain would evaporate as it struck fox gestured like satan offering christ the world this is what trapped them the first ones here look how gently it slopes down its just barely steep enough to stop a horsedrawn wagon from getting back up ive been here and youve seen the devils golf course and scottys castle i dont doubt and the dunes but have you seen the life the rain was loud but john fox was louder he wasnt shouting he was letting his voice project as if he had an audience of thousands its like another planet here plants and animals have evolved that couldnt survive anywhere else if conditions for a moment the roar of wind and rain drowned out even john fox it was as if a bathtub of salt water had been poured on martys head he screamed john john whats happening the damned aliens theyre terraforming earth to their own needs theyve thrown an asteroid in the indian ocean and i was trying to stop atomic plants i should have been screaming for atomic plants to power laser rockets i tried to stop the space shuttle damn me for a fool theyve smashed every environment on earth damn you he shouted into the sky pour fire on the earth pile bodies in pyramids we can live anywhere well hide in the deserts and mountain peaks and the arctic ice cap and one day well come forth to kill you all death valley was a bowl of steam there was nothing to see yet john fox peered into it seeing nightmares an old sea bed he said in an almost normal voice a salt sea theyll all die the rain fell part four the climbing fithp footprints hear now this o foolish people and without understanding which have eyes and see not which have ears and hear not jeremiah the contorted moonlet dropped away dwindled vanished earth grew huge a flashbulb popped above the indian ocean and was replaced at once by a swelling darkening fireball ringshaped shadows formed and faded in and around it far from the central explosion new lights blinked confusingly in points and radial streaks the earths face streamed past terrifyingly close but receding now a wave in the cloud cover above the indian ocean raced outward losing its circular shape as it traveled northward it took on a triangular indentation as if the edge of a blanket had snagged on a nail india dawson said how fast are you running this tape thirtytwo times normal tashayamp answered what is that alice asked land masses the tsunami distorts the clouds arvid said so does the ocean floor dawson amplified but not as much thats india going under those flashes would have been secondary meteors debris even water from the explosion thrown out to space and reentering the atmosphere thats india going under goodbye krishna and vishnu the elephant god jeri shuddered dave took me to india once so many people half a billion arvid stood near she felt his warmth and wanted to be closer to him tashayamp said number arvid said eight to the eighth times eight times three human fithp in india where the wave goes now yes dmitri spoke rapidly in russian stalin thought that way arvid snapped dmitri shrugged expressively what was that about jeri wondered arvid didnt like it at all stalin he would have been pleased to have a simple answer to the india problem its easier to deal with problems than people the distortion in the clouds swept against africa then south here was clear air and a ripple barely visible in the ocean but the outline of the continent was changing bowing inward cape of good hope jeri muttered she watched the waves spread into the atlantic recorded hours must be passing she found herself gasping and suspected she had been holding her breath the waves were marching across the atlantic moving on argentina and brazil with deceptive slowness and a terrible inevitability cloud cover followed boiling across the oceans reaching toward the land masses my god jeri said how could you do this it is not our choice raztupispminz said we would gladly have sent the foot safely beyond your atmosphere but your fithp would not have it so look what you made me do alice said in a thick selfpitying whine her voice became a lash all the sickies say that the rogues say that when theyve done something theyre ashamed of it was somebody elses fault they can say all they like carrie woodward said we know they came all the way from the stars to ruin the land you should not say such things said takpusseh you do not want this to happen again you will help us help how dawson demanded you wes dawson you tell them more come dmitri spoke again in russian arvid shuddered the screen changed again clouds moved so unnaturally fast that jeri thought they were still watching a tape until takpusseh said that is now winterhome earth was white the cloud cover was unbroken rain everywhere nikolai said the dams are gone there will be floods the earth was distant now and no longer turning beneath them synchronous orbit nikolai said above africa look white streaks blazed across earths night that was africa and the digit ships were going down go now tashayamp take them the bull elephant said dawson raztupispminz stay the herdmaster waited until the rest had left the theater then before he could speak dawson said i will not tell my fithp to surrender if dawson made to grip his eyelid the herdmaster would simply slap him across the room he said you will raztupispminz tell him details but later wes dawson did you speak with fathistehtulk name not known dawsons eyes flicked sideways at raztupispminz wait second in leader status advisor yes he came to me raztupispminz you permitted this breakerone raztupispminz hesitated then gestured affirmation the advisor thought he might find an unusual angle of approach i thought it worth a try takpussehs thuktun at the time had been the soviets raztupispminz had been studying dawson alone balked by takpusseh fathistehtulk would have had to go to raztupispminz dawson what was said the human still lacked skill in the speech of the thuktunthp questioning him took more time than the herdmaster liked but he persisted according to dawscons tale when he reached his room after his first foray into the ducts there was a piece of cloth over his night light and a fi was waiting for him a pressure suit helmet and glove covered its face and digits then how can you know you spoke to fathistehtulk the herdmaster demanded i make him take it off did you how reason he was in my room he will not tell he asked questions we take winterhome query is this wrong we use moons and circling rocks not want planets query is it true tell why tell if humans took wealth from space the rogue human shrugged i tell fi wes dawson congressman i dont understand said the herdmaster warrior under foot of enemy give his name standing and number and not else wrong tell more he said dawson you gave your surrender i said i not surrendered to you who are you if i talk to you who is enraged the arrogant creature actually had a point very proper he take his helmet off i take the cloth off the light he said i am the herdmasters advisor query war with earth is wrong we want space not earth i said yes of course you did go on what is dawson tried to wrap his mouth around an unfamiliar fithp word fufisthengalss dissident you have no need to know speak further he said he is fufisthengalss fufisthengalss are many fufisthengalss want to go away from winterhome i say it sound pretty to me query i can help he said give me reasons if thuktun flishithy leave winterhome i tell him about loot of moon and mars and asteroids metals oxygen bound in rocks and dust things to make in freefall cannot do under thrust power from sunlight not thinned by winterhome air not blocked by winterhome storms and winterhome night we only begin to take the loot of space when you come to take the loot of winterhome let us alone and we move all dirty industry to space turn winterhome into into garden fathistehtulk would have enjoyed hearing that he enjoy he is hurrying he leave before i finish i not see him after dawsons digits flicked toward the screen that showed fathistehtulks corpse some fithp disagree with fufisthengalssthp did you have more to tell yes one time we have foolish entertainment given by television imaginary fithp from another star come to winterhome rob oceans of water for their own planet no sense why not go to saturn the ringed gas giant for water where it is already frozen to be moved with ease where are no human fithp to shoot back the tale sounds foolish enough but traveler fithp are no smarter message bearer is fithp home for eightsquared years or more supplied again at saturn could last forever why you need to smash winterhome that is in my thuktun not yours do you know or guess who killed my advisor many fithp not one no fi does things alone this insight was hardly worth the mentioning save for one thing the herdmaster had asked around dissidents warriors returned from winterhome mated and unmated females juveniles nobody knew anything it seemed impossible and even dawson thought so you speak well more the humans shoulders moved not fufisthengalssthp for fathistehtulk must have been of that fithp not human for he wanted to leave winterhome unhurt did he offend fistartehthuktun do fithp kill for what they believe we do why do you suspect fistartehthuktun i do not the warmakers they killed the herdmasters advisor are they many can you choose one who is nearest to becoming rogue smashing winterhome is a rogues act you must have many possible rogues the herdmaster bristled his urge was to kill the creature on the spot yet he had never even considered the priest you have thought this through in detail why we love puzzles like this dawson reverted to english detective stories i have read many tell me all you know of the advisors death it may be i can help another time raztupispminz you should not have concealed the advisors activities did it never strike you that they might have caused his death no herdmaster how could they pastempehkeph splayed his digits i cant know that yet tell dawson what to say to his fithp on winterhome afterward i will send you to winterhome the african fithp must have one who understands human behavior and the breaker fithp must learn more raztupispminz gasped covered his scalp and said nothing the herdmaster turned away he would never have sent the leaders of the breaker team into action except as punishment and the breaker knew it yet he was probably the best choice in a few breaths there would be spin the herdmasters family mudroom would be available again jenny had never seen the president look so tired he wore a faded flowered robe and his feet were thrust into slippers without socks he took the cup of coffee jack clybourne brought without thanking him and listened impassively as jenny and admiral carrell delivered their report in south africa the president said dr curtis was right then how do we know the cable through dakar is still working admiral carrell said we have reports from their government in pretoria i wouldnt count on that lasting understand mr president we know very little is there anything we can do the president asked carrell nodded to jenny we cant think of anything sir we could try to send ships but but they still have lasers and flying crowbars president coffey said tell me major is there anything to oppose them south african commandos jenny said their national guard dont they have a regular army yes sir theyve always had the largest army on the continent most of it was on the seacoast david coffey ran both hands through his thinning hair then carefully smoothed it down we can assume they destroyed the rest from orbit what else sir there is or at least there was when we still had communications a soviet army about three thousand miles north of their landing zone but we dont even know if theyve heard about the invasion and when we call moscow nobody answers we cant count on the russians the president nodded wearily theyll see something weird happening in the sky can you get a message to them i dont know or if theyd believe anything we said try admiral so theres nothing we have that can drive them out admiral carrell shrugged nothing i know of we have a few missile subs we could order them to attack except that we can not know the precise areas to strike and we can be certain they have placed their laser battle stations to protect their troops it took everything we had everything we and the russians had to burn them out of kansas the president said i guess its obvious we wont throw them out of south africa jesus is he giving up so long as they control space they can do as they will admiral carrell said suppose we throw them out of africa there are millions of asteroids in the solar system perhaps the will drop the next one on colorado springs or perhaps they bring in a series of smaller ones to land in san francisco bay lake michigan chesapeake bay admiral must we surrender carrell snorted youre in command mr president im from annapolis for two years my table was just under the banner dont give up the ship certainly i wont but archangel admiral carrell said coffey snorted do you really believe in a spacecraft powered by atomic bombs it has to work carrel said youre saying thats our only hope i know of no other i see the president looked thoughtful so everything depends on keeping secrets if they learn if they so much as get a hint that he frowned ive forgotten bellingham yes they blast bellingham and were finished all right if thats our best hope lets protect it i want a personal progress report jenny sir send jenny admiral promote her and send her up there he looked around the room and saw jack clybourne jack yes sir you must feel useless here yes sir hell most of the time the only person whos armed who can get within a mile of you is me you know security procedures go with colonel crichton and look into what theyve set up at bellingham the president ruined his hair again i should put on a swimsuit and go talk to the dreamer fithp jenny thought what he grinned at her fleetingly the scifi writers they cheer me up they dont tell me horrible things arent happening i dont mean that but it doesnt seem to bother them they think bigger than that like an interstellar war is a great way to build up to the real story and that tame snout of theirs it helps to know that they will surrender if we can just hit them with something hard dawson appeared in the cell something more than an hour after the rest arrived he was shaking he looked about at several sets of more or less questioning eyes and he said they want me to tell the earth to surrender the russians eyes met arvid grinned and dmitri shrugged and nikolais expression went quite blank i wont do it wes dawson said vidkun quisling pierre laval benedict arnold id be remembered longer than any of them dmitri asked why would you consider it wes flopped on his back on the padded aft wall looking at the featureless ceiling he said theres a symbol it looks like a fi on its back it means dont bomb me people can paint it on greenhouses and hospitals and trucks carrying food like a red cross but if they use it wrong itll be rocks from the sky again if you do not speak you cannot make food shipments safe dmitri demanded yeah there was some other stuff threats mostly another foot wes shuddered i wont tell them that we have no evidence that they have other asteroids ready to drop arvid said they dont need them there are plenty more where they got that one jeri said or in the asteroid belt it might take a few years but theyve got years theyve already spent what fifteen years just since they reached the solar system sure they can bring another and another but its worse than that alice demanded what could be worse than another foot theyll go to the moon wes said they dont need to to saturn or the asteroids theyve wiped us off the moon the gravitys low and they can get as much moon rock as they want no god why jeri wanted to curl into a tiny ball wes what will you do you tell me i need help and all the time theyre listening watching while we talk about it perhaps arvid said just perhaps it would be better if you make this speech it would have to be carefully done we could help you prepare he looked significantly at wes they want me to talk the human race into surrendering theyll tell me what to say if i say something else theyll cut me off whats the good of that arvid glanced casually at the watching camera one must paraphrase a long moment passed then wes mused of course the fithp will need help with their phrasing their english isnt that good but yours is the rest were asleep alice curled in a protective ball one arm thrown across her face the other reaching to clutch the wall rung they had never been given blankets they slept in the clothes they wore thuktun flishithy had gone over to spin gravity and alice could feel an eccentricity a wobble dmitri snored with a sound like complaint alice uncurled the hell with it congressman dawson slept a few feet from the rest on his side with his head pillowed on one arm alice watched him sleeping he looked quite harmless yet he frowned in his sleep foot he muttered feet giant mee meteoroid imp everybody in menningers had nightmares it wasnt rare for alice to wake in the middle of the night then she would watch and listen and the others werent any better off than she was she used to wonder about that if shed spent any amount of time in a dorm she thought she would have known she wasnt unusual and if she hadnt been sent to a girls high school she might have grown used to persons of the male persuasion shed have known how to handle them like other women did if her parents dinosaurs oh god like the dinosaurs dawson said in a breathy moan alice had never seen a man whimper poor bastard he could tell the world how to safeguard their food and hospitals but what would they remember wes dawson urging them to surrender to the horrors wes dawson traitor unfair learning what the horrors had planned wes dawson had tried to tear the nose and eyelid off teacher takpusseh hed told mrs woodward about it in alices hearing alice tried to picture that it must have been a short fight so safe so harmless asleep but he was the only one who had fought back greatly daring alice reached out and touched wes dawsons wrist too little pressure would tickle him too much would wake him he stopped breathing and so did alice then i can kill them they can die wes said his face relaxed his lips parted slightly and he was deep asleep after a moment alice curled up beside him maximum security those who will give up essential liberty to secure a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety benjamin franklin the helicopter settled onto the parking lot behind an odd gray building granite base brick towers at each corner an elderly man waited with two others all in tan uniforms they held umbrellas against the drizzling rain jenny and jack followed them inside im ben lafferty sheriff this is deputy young and deputy hargman anything you want just ask them actually wed expected to see the military intelligence people jenny said lafferty screwed his face into an exaggerated squint and eyed jennys bright new silver oak leaf well lieutenant colonel im a colonel in military intelligence myself matter of fact im the senior one here his grin faded and his face lost all traces joviality this is my town lady the state of washington never had much need for washington dc and bellingham never got much out of the state we had a nice little university town he until you federal people came jack clybourne reached into his pocket jenny laid her hand on his arm i can sympathize sheriff she said were just doing our job and whats that what the hell are you people building down in that harbor and dont give me crap about greenhouses green houses dont need big iron things brought in hung under barges there is a war jack clybourne said so they tell us tell you if youd seen that crashed ship in a moment jack clybourne had calmed himself but the sheriff had backed away a step i brought some films and i can get more i believe i can persuade you that theres a war were losing it we need all the cooperation we can get yeah sure you do the sheriff glanced at his watch okay hargman and young will take care of you i got to go he left the office without looking back what was that all about jack clybourne asked deputy young looked thoughtful then lowered his voice he has a point we got along fine until all of a sudden they announced this big greenhouse project only it isnt a greenhouse is it i never heard of a greenhouse needing an astronaut general to run it air force jenny said he happens to be my brotherinlaw that so you still didnt tell me why we need the air force to raise groceries or why all the security stuff there is a reason deputy hargman snorted sure there is one good enough to get this town and everybody in it killed by a meteor not if they think its a greenhouse jenny said theyve never bombed a food storage place how will they know thats what this is maybe you take your chances jack said just like the rest of the world look one hint gets to the snouts that bellingham has a secret and he spread his hands no more bellingham young said how would they find out tv more likely radio police radio even cb jeez hargman said look just what is this secret were protecting what do you care jack demanded jenny remembered the gray face of the president hey look were all on the same side remember whats important is not to let them get the idea there is any secret about bellingham lets work on that round up the cbs hargman muttered wont be easy hey wont that make the snouts suspicious no cb chatter here at all jacks chin bobbed up and down well set up fakes lots of chatter but it will be our people doing it thanks sure deputy young said but dammit i dont like not knowing what im protecting you dont want to know jenny said general edmund gillespie closed the door and the sound of hammers and riveting guns died away jenny could still hear them but they no longer tore at her eardrums the office was cluttered plans and blueprints covered every desk and table and more hung on the walls jack clybourne removed his ear protectors with a look of relief max general gillespie said you remember my wifes kid sister they promoted her lieutenant colonel a wide grin split max rohrs face hey jenny good to see you thats great and this is jack clybourne gillespie said max is the chief construction foreman on this job max jenny and jack are here as let me put it right as personal representatives of the president theyll go back and report to him okay rohrs said i knew we were important max youre all we have jenny blurted yeah i knew that gillespie waved them to chairs drinks we have a good local beer i recommend it he opened a refrigerator and produce several bottles they had no labels and the bottles were not a alike sure jenny said jack frowned but accepted a bottle so how are we doing jenny asked not bad max rohrs said matter of fact were way ahead of schedule whys that well we got that nuclear sub hid out in the harbor plenty of electricity and weve got every computer design system on the west coast that all helps mostly though its just theres no paperwork max said no telephone lines to washington the engineers plan something the computer people check it out e and i agree and it goes in no conferences and changeapproval meetings we just do it it helps that everybody busts ass gillespie said thats for sure were here to get this done not make money and take coffee breaks it shows too jenny thought max doesnt look as if hes had a nights sleep in a month and ed looks worse so when can i report shell fly max looked thoughtful supposed to take a year more but ill be surprised if we cant launch in nine months maybe sooner he unrolled a sheath of drawings look the heavy work is the base plate the barges bring that in pieces and we have to put it together heavy work but its still just welding and riveting then theres the gun that puts the bombs behind the butt plate if that fouls well were putting in two separate tbgs what thrust bomb guns oh but theres all the electronics and life support and dont i remember they needed nine months just to change toilets on the shuttle sure nasa style gillespie said we just install the damn thing of course it helps that were not shaving off ounces weve got plenty of lifting power you sure do is everything coming in on schedule no but were dealing with it gillespie said maybe youve noticed there arent many of my air police here just enough to guard the inner fences i sent the rest over with colonel taylor to the bremerton navy yard to put the fear of god into those bastards which sped up deliveries something wonderful rohrs said here lets have another round he fished out more beer bottles weve learned a lot of security tricks gillespie said from vietnamese mostly refugees jenny asked some refugees but mostly former viet cong they know a lot ways to hide convoys hollow out logs to transport steel tunneling all the things they did to us maybe you should have kept your security troops here jack clybourne said i dont think your local sheriff is enthusiastic about your project yeah i know gillespie said i thought of telling him what were doing maybe that would get him working why not jenny asked no no telling what those people will do if they know whats going to power this beast gillespie shook his head the only safe place for miles around will be in the ship everything else will go somebody may think its better that the snouts drop rock on the harbor than have fifty atom bombs go off here its hard to believe anyone would deliberately inform jenny said but its better to be safe all right what we need then is cover stories what are you building if its not greenhouses we thought about that a lot gillespie said how do you like a prison prison secret for political prisoners explains why there are so many soldiers if anybody gets too suspicious we let them think weve got political prisoners from kansas collaborators we couldn keep in kansas because theyd be torn apart by mobs deserters it might work jack said and if they dont believe that what do you fall back on thats as far as weve nested cover stories like an onion jack began drawing concentric circles on a notepad penetrate one and you come to the next and you still dont have the real secret so whats the next one bathyscape gillespie asked underwater research facility under construction no why keep that a secret hell well come up with something lets keep talking jenny leaned over to look outside the circles jack had printed greenhouse inside the first collaborators they drank snouts jenny said eh captives a big research facility to study captive snouts the aliens wouldnt bomb that but wed have good reason to keep it secret from our people thatll work in fact thats why we house the collaborators here to talk to the snouts clybourne smiled so who do we have who can design prisons we have the skeleton of a good story now we put flesh on it what would you import whatever it is we have to bring it in and show it were supposed to be growing food ships would take food out well bring them in full and send them out empty next to greenhouse he wrote food and an inwardpointing arrow next to collaborators he wrote jail jailers within the second circle snouts get snouts weve got snout prisoners but theyre crazy they go where theyre pushed they dont talk even to each other but we can show them to people jenny grinned its the first time ive seen jack get really turned on about something other than me circles jack said layers the security system is in rings just like the cover stories they look like theyre set up to keep you out and they will if youre not too determined but the real purpose is to keep you in if you do manage to penetrate heck well have a prison not too large maybe but big enough to take care of anyone who learns too much it all sounds wonderful but arent you forgetting something rohrs asked sheriff lafferty isnt going to help you do any of this we do it ourselves yeah rohrs scratched his head but mr clybourne jack jack i dont have anybody to spare jack chuckled now how did i guess that its okay first thing we get some army troops in here intelligence types rohrs said sure mps too construction engineers to build prisons and combat troops just in case jack said the next time we talk to sheriff lafferty i want him to know hes talking uphill did i just hear something tear general gillespie asked it sounded like the constitution jenny caught the look on maxs face interesting he looked disgusted a liberal general were fighting snouts here no jack clybourne was positive what you hear is the sound of bellingham being put outside the boundaries of the united states he opened his brief case and removed a document i hold here a presidential order suspending the rules of habeas corpus in the bellingham area its quite constitutional i play by the rules general yeah but when word of that gets out it wont the first thing we do when the troops get here is seal off bellingham no one leaves what about people from the highway there isnt much traffic now rohrs said you cant see the harbor area from the highway jack said the big hill with the university on it is in the way so we leave service stations alongside the highway and alls well for people who go to them but anybody who goes further into town to the other side of the hill they dont leave thats all but what about there was a knock at the door rohrs shouted but no one heard he went to the door a flood of sound washed into the room the workman at the door shouted max turn on the radio theres something important okay thanks rohrs closed the door and the hammers and rivet guns became tolerable again what station clybourne asked theres only one rohrs went to the radio that perched above a file cabinet a voice boomed out it sounded familiar like a professional orator they will take the surrender of all humans and they will incorporate them into their herd those of their race who surrender become the property of the herd eventually they or their descendants may find status therein son of a bitch general gillespie said thats wes dawson they all stood when the president came in he gestured impatiently for them to be seated reynolds stood with the rest of them with its haphazard furniture and refreshments the room looked like the green room at an underfunded sciencefiction convention but it felt weirdly like the white house most of the dreamer fithp were present harpanet was not commander i understand that you have a tape the naval officer looked young for his rank yes mr president its just as we received it weve put it through filters to clean out the noise but nothing else play it then yes sir the navy commander gestured there was a short hissing sound and then a voice from outer space my fellow americans im wesley dawson formerly a congressman from california im now a member of the chtaptisl fithp which is to say the traveler herd i am alive and well and i send my regards to my family we have been well treated by their standards by their standards the words stood out dawson must have intended them to the human fithp aboard message bearer have been brought together there are three russians commander rogachev lieutenant colonel dmitri grushin and commander rogachevs sergeant there are six americans in addition to me mrs geraldine wilson and her daughter melissa gary capehart aged nine john and carrie woodward of lawton kansas and alice mclennon who was formerly resident in topeka were all alive in reasonable health due largely to alices forethought in bringing us dietary supplements the fithp complain that their warriors have not been well treated and that many were killed as they attempted to surrender the fithp regard this as barbaric dawsons voice registered bitter amusement the surrender gesture is easily seen they lie on their backs rendering themselves helpless this gesture is deeply embedded into their psychology one might say it is deep within their very souls they do not surrender lightly and when they do the submission is total you may believe this it is true their leader or admiralthe word translates to herdmaster as closely as anything elsehas asked me to speak to you in order to save slaughter he says that he can deliver many asteroids and drop them precisely where he wishes they do not need to go to the asteroid belt they can use lunar rocks their command of space is complete and they have begun construction of a lunar base when they first approached earth we all wondered what they wanted we know now they intend to live on the earth they intend that all humans submit they have come to stay they mean to be the dominant but not the only intelligent species on earth they have assured meand i believe themthat they will take the surrender of all humans and they will incorporate them into their herd those of their race who surrender become the property of the herd eventually they or their descendants may find status therein for biological reasons humans will never be able to integrate as fithp have traditionally done but our descendants will be their partners the human herd will be allowed to live under manmade rules they will study us to know what those rules shall be we will be allowed to choose our own rules so long as they do not conflict with fithp dominance but they insist that we must live by the rules we choose they do not tolerate rogues we will achieve mankinds oldest dream to be one people with one philosophy one set of rules for all of us they do nothing alone a individuals acts are taken to be the responsibility of his grout in particular the fithp mating practices are entirely instinctual going by mating seasons and they mate for life goodbye to individualism reynolds shuddered a moment later hello monogamy interesting dawson went on they intend to do what they must to rule the earth they regret the great loss of life from the foot but this will not stop them from sending another and another until humans understand the great power of the fithp until you do understand they have no wish to kill noncombatants there is a symbol dawson was describing a fithp on its back oh we use a red cross urge you not to misuse the symbol they will be watching using the harmless symbol for military equipment or installation will result in bombardment of all the places so marked they se more than you believe they can see their radars and lasers are efficient and powerful they would be do understand dawsons recorded voice said the chtap tisk fithp mean what they say they have crossed lightyears a space to come here they will not go home they will be here for centauries they are a collective people who live by strict rules in herds evolution has eliminated all the rogues from the fithp they will give humans good treatment by their standards they would prefer to take the earth in good condition but take it they must their large spacecraft is their world until they do very good wade curtis said his voice was loud in the quiet fuck him hes staring at the walls centauries alpha centauries joe ransom said they let him get away with a lot you caught that at the end theres no backup what theyve got weve seen and they cant go home i was right there uses his tone of voice like a fine working tool by their standards sherry mused i wonder if theyll want us to follow their mating seasons and of course the fithp wont catch any of that the president and the navy men watched in evident surprise the dreamer fithp were all over that speech like dogs on a stag monogamy anyway sherry he made quite a point of it i wonder if they saw some xrated movie whatever curtis said dawson is one smart son of a bitch can we hear that again the airduct pipes narrowed alice felt trapped and for a moment she thought of turning back then she set her jaw hard and went on she rounded a turn he was there wes dawson was curled into a small ball fetal position the really sick ones do that in the movies they always go violent the therapists would love it if they could get that much action on the closed wards dawson didnt move as she came closer to him he didnt answer wes its alice i ate shit for the sake of that dontbombme symbol she said nothing didnt i used to do that try to blow the therapists mind by using dirty words and mrs fitzpatrick caught me at it well im going to be famous you were wonderful you told them all about the horrors god the way you used your voice and the snouts didnt even suspect he started to uncoil alice moved away slightly but you already know what i was trying to do wes said half uncoiled he still wouldnt look at her they wont wes dawson now they can forget quisling we all agreed alice said we all thought you should do it yeah just like fithp everybody does everything together look its all right alice ill be all right he faced her at last thanks for finding me ill be okay he smiled and damn i looked real but shed seen so many phony smiles see im fine maybe he is he didnt look helpless now alice took a deep breath i am not a freemartin she moved closer to dawson abruptly he launched himself at her she couldnt move fast enough to get away and he wrapped his arms around her and drove her against him she felt panic if i fight him now hell never get over this she felt him draw her closer still she felt smothered and wanted to flee she tucked her head down nose below his armpit to breathe she didnt struggle he curled against her and was still except for his jerky breathing he held her but he wasnt moving slowly she relaxed the tension in her muscles as shed been taught beginning with her toes ankles then calves his tears soaked through her hair and wet her scalp almost without volition her arms went around him and she held him its all right she said its all right i needed a hug my god i needed to be hugged alice thanks its all right mud bath we shall not fail or flag we shall go on to the end we shall fight in france we shall fight on the seas and oceans we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender sir winston churchill after dunkirk footfall plus six weeks nat was measuring ingredients into a blender he moved briskly lime juice sugar rum scoop out half a crenshaw melon add ice low setting the blades tended to break on the ice at higher settings in defense against the godawful noise he moved up alongside harpanets head and raised his voice youre used to long wars there are records from the homeworld the shape wars lasted five generations there were others harpanet paused for thought then i cannot comment from the losers point of view i never wondered until you taught me for the winning fithp wars are long losers cease to be a fithp the traveler fithp did not taste war until now was the taste to your liking nat hit the button that ended the howl of the blender digits swiped at thin air how can i know i fell from the sky i lost my fithp i tried to surrender no human knew how to take my surrender you have warriors from kansas isnt it ask them theyre not sane curtis joined the group left alone too long maybe harpanet let his digits and lower eyelids droop in the gesture theyd learned to interpret as sadness ransom held his glass out for reynolds to fill i sure feel sorry for dawson curtis nodded yeah poor bastard risks his arse to give u some information and a lot of nerds think hes turned traitor what worries me are the ones who think he meant it and want to take his advice maybe we should sherry said but it wouldnt work there are too many like you and ransom you ought to be glad of that hey reynolds moved between them have a drink hi poured sherry you dont want to surrender no but i dont want to fight either wasnt you we asked to fight curtis said enough ransom said the question is what will the president do he sure didnt take it very well maybe hed want to quit nah curtis said hes not my favorite choice but hes go more guts than that sure he damned well better have harpanet spoke insistently what are you leading me to eh you speak of challenging your herdmaster sherry laid her hand across harpatiets brow its not what it sounds like she said but they said we are the dreamer fithp reynolds said we say anything but were not going to challenge the president wade wasnt ever thinking that way he put an edge to his voice were you wade no of course not curtis grinned wolfishly besides it wouldnt work nat filled a sizable mug with what remained in the blender about half swim ssshure yeah ransom said only i want a real drink not that slop wade sherry thank you yes curtis said after a moment sherry atkinson nodded and followed them out reynolds and harpanet walked into the mudroom and into the mudfilled pool without interrupting their conversation it faltered when they noticed the near stranger the president of the united states floated in the warm mud with his eyes closed harpanet dipped his nostril nat said not in the face he looks too tired to play i heard that the president said i am harpanet shimmied the wall of his flank sent warm muddy water sloshing gently across president coffey the president smiled heating just one end of the pool he asked who thought that up human fithp need it too warm too much surface for volume shed heat too fast nat said the guy who thought of that was the curator of the san diego zoo george pournelle he had some very rare rhinos and he didnt know what kind of temperature they liked so he put a temperature gradient across the cage and let them make their own decisions the president nodded he was in the hottest part of the pool he looked very relaxed he opened one eye and fixed it on harpanet youve hit us hard harpanet asked was it the foot it was youve killed a great many people not i i am of the dreamer fithp now can i help it was a rebuke the president stirred reynolds have you seen the tapes yeah this is a melon daiquiri have some i dont have any mouth diseases neither do i and thanks for not asking jesus you make them big were you going to drink all of this yeah i told you ive seen the tapes the president drank he said nice are we going to live through this the species is hell they cant conquer us some of us will live we could get down to the men in the walls whats that william tenn humans living like parasites in the aliens environment and we still win because were small enough to hide in places they cant get to but it wont come to that this is our planet and we own every corner siberia the sahara greenland they cant come after us there they dont have to david coffey said they just keep pounding away killing more and more people until we cant stand it any longer if we have to give up anyway why prolong it let the survivor types go to siberia the rest surrender it is sensible harpanet said no reynolds wanted his drink but he was too polite to reach for it in the first place it wouldnt work too many would stay behind pretend to surrender but theyd hide weapons and kill snouts whenever they got a chance you cant surrender for everybody i agree well the fithp think you can theyll hold us all responsible what the fithp call surrender we dont know how to do that coffey said but we have to do something maybe the fithp lasers only come in a couple of frequencies we can make reflective paint for those frequencies paint them on the bombers thatll take a while wont it sure set up a research station harpanet said the lasers can bechanged the color can be made different reynolds shrugged so maybe that doesnt work the president let himself sag into the mud he still had reynolds mug of melon daquiri what else should we be doing study our friend harpanet find out how to keep him happy im for that harpanet said why isnt anyone studying me the president asked plaintively harpanets bound to need things maybe its dietary supplements things that dont get into our foods settlers in brazil had a terrible time with vitamin deficiencies the soil is peculiar well theres bound to be something missing from african soil not for us we evolved there but the traveler fithp didnt whats missing how can we stop the fithp from getting to it maybe they cant sleep in total darkness keep knocking out their power sources and in a few days theyll fall over no said harpanet okay no but you see what im getting at we tried playing baseball with harpanet theres no way to put a glove on him of course so we tried tossing a softball around maybe he could catch it barehanded he cant he cant throw it either this skill was not prized among the traveler fithp harpanet said placidly we could probably rig up a glove for him nat said earnestly it would look like an umbrella but he could catch he still couldnt throw hes hopeless with a football i thought he would be but itsweve got films and weve been showing them to your soldiers and it gets them rolling around on the floor harpanet spreads his trunk like a great fan and the ball either goes through it or ricochets away we want to try basketball or volleyball we think the ball is big enough that he wont lose it the president was laughing so hard that it looked like he was going to lose the mug so nat took it this is research mr president the delicate point im trying to pound home is that harpanet is at his limit he mug nat drank then handed across the mug hes at his limit thats all he gets just so good and no better we still play of course we all need exercise him most of all sherrys sure were anthropomorphizing maybe the fithp have games wed be awful at but i think shes assuming symmetry where there just isnt any need for it the fithp have bad hands theyre just bloody clumsy and no wonder with no bones in their grasping digits i think theyre a young race god knows humanity never finished evolving in any direction but i think the fithp are even younger than that theyre too young to have space travel they didnt even discover it for themselves what got them here was those great granite messages left by an extinct species they shouldnt be here at all theyre doing well considering their handicaps we need to know their handicaps set up a research station you have other prisoners now study them theyve got a mating seasondawson said so too and emphasized itand their mating practice is more reflexive than ours can we duplicate their pheromones and drive them nuts the president was still laughing somebody told me once that im not fit to mold the future because im only allowed to think up to the next election who is it that plans for the future of the human race speaking nat took the mug drank deeply passed it back then why am i in charge somebody told you it was your turn in the barrel and made you believe it coffey laughed thats one way to look at it my god when i think of what i had to do to get this job mr reynolds nat reynolds nat i ought to come down here more often only i dont suppose i can why mr clybourne ive sent him off on an errand but hell be back so you ignore him reynolds said i cant do that hes doing his job the best he canand maybe one day i really will need him you might at that reynolds thought if youre done warming that mug things got a little hazy thereafter nat remembered making another batch of daquiris harpanet cut the melon but he was fairly clumsy at it he did none of the drinking the fithp didnt use alcohol theres plenty we can do elephant guns we should be producing them as fast as we can who makes elephant guns there are people i can ask said the president the british they made a big doublebarreled rifle a nitro express round up all you can find reynolds said send em to africa somebody there can use them he laughed it worries me to excess there may be a young zulu warrior somewhere who doesnt have an elephant gun are your stories that bloody too ah ive got something harpanet are you willing to speak to your ship i am they will take it that i am speaking for your fithp i know but you can at least tell them that you were allowed to surrender they may be afraid to try by now good said nat now dawsons sign of the friendly fithp the dont bomb me yeah said the president is it possible they want that sign so theyll know where our food sources are so they can bomb them harpanet reared displaced mud made a godawful sucking sound they would not bomb the localsurrender sign they would not all right coffey said mildly by the same token we use it only where appropriate reynolds thought if it isnt on the bellingham greenhouse theyll notice if the sign is too big theyll notice i cant say any of that where harpanet can hear at that moment the president winked at him reynolds looked at the foaming glass and shuddered whats that one of the last alkaseltzer in existence you ungrateful bastard joe ransom said and wade found you a vitamin b here bless you reynolds washed the tablet down i think it was worth it even at worst he needed to get drunk did i save civilization i cant quite remember yeah we watched you from the tv in the lounge you got him thinking about the long run we think you put some iron in his spine i hope so nat moved gingerly down the hall toward his room then he stopped it shook up harpanet a bit he told me hed never had a conversation with his herdmaster much less an argument hell get over it now he thinks youre more important than he thought ransom glanced at his watch my turn i guess you know something i hate mud why couldnt they like swimming in something sensible like lime jello archangel we are done with hope and honor we are lost to love and truth we are dropping down the ladder rung by rung and the measure of our torment is the measure of our youth god help us for we knew the worst too young rudyard kipling gentleman ankers did you have a good flight the president didnt wait for an answer what did you learn theyre in good shape sir jenny said the scheduled launch date was late next year but general gillespie thinks hell be ready months before that good david coffey rubbed his hands briskly together the sooner the better jack hows the security situation better now that i was there clybourne said there was a bit of a problem with the local sheriff but we fixed that hell cooperate now he sure will jenny thought weve laid it all out jack said like an onion highway patrolmen only theyre marines no cb radios except ours with army intelligence people simulating cb chatter i expect you had your work cut out rounding up all the cbs the president said yes sir jack said there was one place full of survivalists mostly from los angeles of all places los angeles is in pretty good shape the president said yes sir but they cant get back there anyway they had a dozen radios we got them all they sure didnt like giving them up sure you got them all yes sir general gillespie has put together a weapons team jenny said boeing engineers some navy people even a retired sciencefiction writer good choice theyve been useful here yes sir anyway theyve invented a lot of weapons stovepipes they take one of the main guns off a navy ship wrap a spaceship around it not a lot of ship just enough to steer it add an automatic loader and nuclear weapons for shells steer it with tv jeez whod fly that theyve got volunteers the president smiled broadly good damn good what else sir you wont believe all the stuff theyre putting on that ship torpedoes with hbombs cannon bundles of gammaray lasers that go off when the burst from the drive bomb hits them anything that can hurt the alien ship one of the engineers was trying to get them to truck the old x from the museum at edwards it maneuvers in space doesnt it but i dont think theyll do that its easier to add another stovepipe and people really will fly that the president said damn all well beat them yet all we have to do is hang on until its finished he glanced at his watch cabinet meeting in an hour you two have been outside ill want you there to answer questions one thing though nothing about why you went north or even where you went most of the cabinet doesnt know about michael the president paused im thinking about making it a totalrestriction any who knows about michael stays inside what do you think jack shrugged if you say so sir i didnt necessarily mean you two i may have to send you up there again but everybody else everybody who wont be going up northwhy should they know there were all these stories about ufos kidnapping people that wasnt the fithp jenny said sir he laughed i know that theyre not that smooth they shouldnt even be in space at all he sobered they evolved too fast theyre clumsy theyre bad at toolmaking there are gaps in their knowledge and we can exploit those well win colonel you know i could even begin to feel sorry for them whats got into him pictures flashed through jennys head a doll resting on a gingham skirti dont feel sorry for them but id rather see the president like this than ready to give up jenny fidgeted uncomfortably cabinet meetings were important but most of the cabinet didnt know the crucial secret it must be tough trying to run the country without knowing how we plan to win item two the secretary of commerce jim frantz said connie fuller pushed her chair back as if she were going to stand but decided against it i too will be brief she said and im afraid my report is almost as gloomy as admiral carrells was first the good news a lot of greenhouses are going up crops are being planted in backyards on school playgrounds golf courses lawns of public buildingsnearly everywhere given any luck at all we wont have people starving i wish i had more good news but i dont most of our dams are destroyed so are most bridges some were fired on others were washed out in the floods that followed the dams the earthquakes got more mr president the united states is chopped up into a series of isolated regions and theres not much we can do about it the interstate highway system is destroyed there are secondary roads and old highways but travel on them has not been safe sometimes they let big trucks alone not always no train is safe ships areoften fired on even now the president asked after using mr dawsons symbol they all looked at carlotta dawson for a moment she met their gaze with a smile then she looked down at the table she doesnt know about archangel shouldnt they tell her she deserves that much i was just coming to that mrs fuller said so far we have no confirmed report of a vehicle or installation marked with the harmless symbol being fired on weve been somewhat careful about where we use it good the president said thats vital we must not abuse that symbol mr speaker yes mr president we need new legislation making it an act of treason to misuse the snout harmless symbol i would appreciate it if you would get that done immediately the speaker nodded slowly if you think thats wise its vital mr speaker if you insist on knowing why ill tell you at another time thank you no i want strict enforcement president coffey said any law enforcement agency is authorized to stop attempted abuse of that symbol by any means required including destruction of the offending installation thats important the chief of staff wrote in his book yes sir ill get the executive order out right away i can understand the need general toland said but the troops sure wont like taking casualties tell them to shut up and soldier admiral carrell said weve put the fithp symbol on the archangel dome and on the ships coming into there no bigger than anywhere else we had to otherwise we might as well paint bomb me on them but if somebody paints that on an ammunition truck connie fuller shuffled her notes on the plastic tabletop we dont have much electricity gas pipelines are working and some oil lines they havent bothered nuclear power plants theres no reliable way to move coal so we dont have much electricity were able to ship some staple foods but we cant move enough foodstuffs in short mr president there is no national economy there was a long silence the speaker cleared his throat yes mr dayton they dont hit nuclear plants seems to me there were a bunch of those stalled by red tape all across the country could we get cracking and complete them a good question the president said jim look into that will you no problem theres a switch of course we can get them completed if all the antinuke idiots stay out of the way including you well need that electricity mrs fuller said if we have electric power we have a civilization if we dont there wasnt any point in finishing that statement message bearer was under spin the fithp seemed to prefer their gravity low and alice was near the axis anyway the ducts curved more tightly here she moved in lowangle leaps against the wind hurrying dust puppies tended to clump where the pipes turned and she stopped occasionally to clean them away she heard something ahead she called wes yeah how are you doing i dont think the ducts were this clean when they were new she rounded the curve its makework she said yeah but it lets us explore sooner or later well use what we know want to make love he banged his elbow he turned around clutching it staring openmouthed she started to laugh he said sure i want to make love ive been chaste for months are you aware that im a married person how far away is your wife carlottas twentytwo thousand three hundred miles away wait a minute thats geosynchronous orbit measured from the center of the earth and were over africa so another two three thousand miles he was treating this as all too amusing alice said so shes not likely to come barging in on us no why me alice i think you killed the bulls advisor good the amusement had gone out of him again why me who elsewould have the guts any cluster of eight or more fithp who didnt like his politics alice grinned shed been scared to death when she made this decision but play your games congressman but you wouldnt be hesitating if you werent guilty oh i dont it wasnt like you think he did it how was it then i didnt sneak up on the poor fithp and strangle him in his sleep i the violence she knew was buried in wes dawson surfaced in his face for a moment she regretted her decision you can always find an excuse if the horrors were listening thered never be another chance she moved closer to him rage was in his eyes and they looked through her i thought i had it all fixed the herdmasters advisor wanted to leave earth what he wanted from me was arguments to use i by god was willing to give them he ran out of time the first time we met so we set something else up after five days we were still cleaning out the ducts near the hull dawson said the bull probably thinks hes training us to make repairs in that area id seen the mudroom i knew how to reach it fathistehtulk was supposed to be waiting in the mudroom the duct was warmer this time you saw the door with a knob the size of a soup bowl i turned the knob and the door went back on springs i squeezed through i left my gear in the duct just behind me there were warm and cold currents mixing grill at the end i looked through and saw a lot of black mud the air currents set up ripples in it but there wasnt enough thrust to move it we were still pushing on the foot then nobody was there she could feel the disappointment nobody nothing not then i was very very nervous i kept wondering what he really wanted military information it was a silly way to get it theyre not that tricky yeah i didnt know that then if he tried something i didnt like i was going to back down the duct scream for the warriors and lay a charge of mutiny on him but maybe he just wanted me on record encouraging mutiny myself i thought id better see if there were witnesses so i took the wing nuts off and worked the grill loose i was going to go in but i heard something so i pulled the grill back in place fathistehtulk came in walking along the wall on those velcro shoes they wear he got right to the point like wed never ended the last conversation he told me about the dissidents the fufisthengalss mostly spaceborn who dont think conquering earth is worth the bother it sounded ideal i was actually wishing i had dmitri grushin with me he said there are a lot of dissidents and they want to make peace but they um theyre diffident they dont want to make waves they dont want to be rogues stick with the herd like voters in the natural state they need jazzing up something to get them moving his eyes shone and he waved his hands excitedly i can see why they vote for him especially women she felt a tingling in her loins it was a feeling shed long since known was dangerous and for a moment the old fears came back he wont like me he left her no time for more thought i said it would be easy to make peace i tried to tell fathistehtalk how often yesterdays enemies become todays allies i think that confused him for the fithp yesterdays enemies are todays slaves are tomorrows citizens i think he believed me though he would i would i told him if the fithp would mine the asteroids we could trade their metals for our fertilizer and soil and nitrogen wed all get rich i told him wed grow fithp plants and animals for them theres bound to be somewhere on earth where any damn thing will grow that grows in water and air i really dont think i lied to him at any point alice i cant blame myself i was being as persuasive as i knew how theyre different theyre crazy its a great story but get through with it shed never felt that way not since a certain high school dance the anticipation had been there but things had gone too far too fast and she panicked and ran from the car and the next morning everyone knew the tale for a moment the dread rose in her again but this was very different she hadnt expected to find herself playing therapist should she resent it oh but i had fathistehtulk all figured out he said i talked about how to use space im good at that too i was doing the research in my teens solar power collectors freefall chemistry alloys that wont mix in gravity singlecrystal fibers stronger than anything you can make in a gravity field theyd missed a lot of that why its not in their granite cubes alice theyre powerful but theyre stupid not stupid crazy maybe or something in between they dont think for themselves maybe they never had to but i told him i told him about mass drivers its easy to put stuff in orbit from the moon olearys plan to mine the asteroids do you know that one you land a fully equipped mine on a metal asteroid put a big bagaround the asteroid you refine the metal but you keep the slagthats what the bag is for you make hemispherical mirrors from the metal and use them for solar power more metal becomes a linear accelerator it gets longer and longer before you quit the accelerators so long that the asteroid looks like the head of a sperm now you run slag down the linear accelerator you get a rocket with arbitrarily high exhaust velocity you put the rest of the asteroid into orbit around earth and you told him all that in fithp wes dawion stared then laughed i stuttered a lot and used simple words and waved my hands through the air i must have got it across it killed him how i told him too much the fithp dont know he said you must be of our fithp when we take the riches of the worlds you must be swallowed into the traveler herd wess chest was heaving i thinkif i hadnt known it was my mistakei wouldnt have been so mad i said we could tell them anything they wanted to know he said i hear more than you say dawson you want this wealth for your fithp if we do not fight you for your own planet we will presently fight you for the others i threw the grill at him and jumped behind it the grill bounced off his head must have startled him i was still in the air when i realized i was committing suicide he turned his head away he must have remembered how i attacked takpussehand i kicked against his shoulder and was headed back into the duct just trying to get away thinking damn ive blown it i made the duct and wiggled in quick like an eel something wrapped around my knee i looked back and the grill aperture was full of a fis face and the other digits were reaching for me nightmare alice found herself gripping his arm and her nails she eased off but didnt let go and he hadnt noticed i must have been crazy maybe i couldnt have pulled loose i didnt even try i snatched my gear and swarmed back down the duct at him felt like i was attacking an octopus i squirted that bag of soapy water in his eyes pfoosh he backed away a little and i jammed my feet into the duct walls and shook the line loose and knotted it around his trunk above the nostril and pulled it tight then i heaved backward you know he didnt have any leverage i pulled back and he came with me he had all eight digits around me it felt like he was tearing my leg off but he couldnt get a digit around my neck because i kept my chin tucked down i pulled that line just as tight as i could and hung on and after a bit the grip slacked off i guess the digits werent getting any blood i pulled him farther into the duct and i clawed that dooronsprings open and hooked the line over the knob wes looked at her suddenly from there on it was murder so youre an inhuman murderer go on what yeah but this inhuman would have blown the dissident movement apart it was easy it wasnt as if i was fighting a fi any more i was fighting a fis head his torso was out there in the mudroom useless as tits on a boar i had a tourniquet above his nostril i crawled down toward his mouth he said dawson you gave your surrender i said i was raped alice burst out laughing wes said english of course i wish i could have said it in fithp hell they dont have rape i crawled down until i could get my knees braced under his jaw and i jammed his mouth closed his digits were patting at me and i could hear him thrashing outside after a while all of that stopped i held on for god i dont know how long his eyes werent looking at anything and he wasnt moving i kicked him out into the mudroom i pulled the grill into place and then i couldnt find the goddam wing nuts it looked like itd stay so i just left hed wrenched my knee and hip they were hurting when i got out of the ducts i hailed a soldier and he didnt notice couldnt read a mans face maybe or a politicians by the time i reached my cell my knee was the size of a football in gravity i couldnt have moved but i had four days to heal before thu ktun flishithy disconnected from the foot you didnt push him into the mud nope i dont know who did that there are some funny politics going on aboard this ship alice smiled slowly thats frustrating well congressman im still here yeah he studied her for a moment he was a little afraid of her she saw as if she were dangerously fragile youve had some time to think maybe what you need is just a hug god knows i owe you what was he waiting for she hadnt intended to say do i look to you like a freemartin a what raztupispminz thought i might be a thats ridiculous you get a freemartin when a female calf has a twin brother it gets too much of the male hormones humans cant be freemartins good she said and launched herself at him down periscope surface captain anton villars deliberately kept his voice flat and dull they cant watch the whole ocean its just too damned big isnt it ethan allen rose silently to the surface the lookouts swarmed up into the conning tower after a moment villars felt moist cool night air all clear sir villars climbed the steel ladder into the moonless overcast night topside was a steady westerly wind he estimated it at nine knots the sea rolled with large stately swells some topped by whitecaps a light rain pattered down onto the submarines deck the african coast lay dead ahead villars studied it with his night glasses he didnt dare risk a radar sweep quiet as the dead his exec said not the most cheerful image villars muttered sorry captain bring em up villars said at last there were twentysix of them fourteen had painted their faces black the others including colonel carter their commander hadnt needed to carter looked at the sea and grimaced more weather than i like not much choice villars said yeah okay carruthers get the boats inflated the troopers climbed gingerly to ethan allens pitching deck some of the waves broke just high enough to send spray flying across it they inflated their boats ready colonel one called softly right captain if you can send up our supplies villars nodded to his exec the crew passed up a number of boxes each wrapped in waterproofing materials they laid them into the boats and helped the soldiers lash them into place youve got a long walk villars said sorry i couldnt get you any closer its okay carter said i didnt want to ask before villars said but i will how you get this assignment carter grinned wolfishly my grandmother always said we were zulu made me study the language i hated it i never real believed her but what the hell it made a good story so when the president wanted to send elephant guns to the zulu nation who better to send he was still grinning as he climbed into the boat the warning bell bonged miranda shakes put down her book as went to the window to see who had opened the gate kevin

marty owns part of this place hell work with me well earn our keep the minstrels is war a biological necessity as regards the earliest cultures the answer is emphatically negative the blow of the poisonous dart from behind a bush to murder a woman or a child in their sleep is not pugnacity nor is headhunting bodysnatching or killing for food instinctive or natural bronislaw malinowsri phi beta kappa address harvard university footfall plus twelve weeks roger brooks drank the last of his coffee it tasted of burnt breadcrumbs they made coffee with breadcrumbs in the british navy or at least the hornblower novels said they did could mrs tinbergen be doing that she surely could outside his boardinghouse window was pouring rain it had been that way almost every day in the months since footfall rain and everyone too busy to talk to me he repressed other memories of army guards ordering him away from the gate into cheyenne mountain and one sergeant getting so impatient that hed drawn his automatic of the three weeks before hed found a representative of the post and got a new credit card so he didnt have to fish in garbage cans for food that memory got too near the surface and he growled trouble rosalee asked nothing much like hell she came around the table and put her hands on his shoulders i know you too well yeah actually it was strange rosalee was very nearly the perfect companion hed even considered marrying her can i distract you i met this army girl about nineteen she said mrs dawson is inside the hole i guess that figures shut up inside the hole came in just before footfall with a strange character and a captured snout a what yeah rosalee looked smug still love me jesus rosalee this character she came to the springs every night in a bar across town interested the name and the sign outside were new the sign in particular was a good painting of a fi on its back an oversized man standing with his foot on its torso i like that roger said they both got off the bicycle rosalee shrugged ill come get you at dinnertime she pedaled off to where she gets moneyno dammit i dont want to know it was still early afternoon the friendly snout was cool inside with a smell of old wood and leather and tobacco smoke tin customers were few and some wore army uniforms at the bandstand a small toughlooking army man was teaching a ballad to a civilian the big redheaded man was jotting down what he heard repeating each verse by guitar and voice thats him roger took a table against the wall the waitress wasnt more than sixteen owners daughter for damn sure nobody cares any more interesting how disasters make people mind their own goddamn business instead of other peoples rum sour no rum whiskey whiskey sour lemons cost four times as much as whiskey still want it roger produced his gold american express card sure yes sir as hed expected the drink was corn whiskey probably not more than a week old it needed the lemon juice and so do i vitamin c and the post can afford it the music and words were sung not quite loud enough to hear and distracting hell if theyd just sing it straight through and get it over with the redbearded man seemed intent on his lesson roger decided to wait him out he took out his notebook and idly flipped through the pages there was a column due at the end of the week somewhere in here is the story i need colorado springs military intelligence outfit interviewing national guardsmen from the jayhawk war area two turned loose two days before didnt want to talk to me security probably that bottle of i w harper rosalee found took care of that rafael armanzeiti didnt look like a kansan i was aiming for the head of course it was standing broadside to me and i shot at something and the recoil jerked it back and i thought id missed it whipped around and i was looking right into that huge barrel while it pulled the trigger a dozen times in two seconds i must have shot out the firing mechanism it must have known i was going to shoot it armanzeiti had laughed it did the damnedest thing it fell over and rolled just like id already shot it belly up legs in the air just like a dog thats been trained to play dead you shot it sure but my god how stupid do they think we are jack cody when that beam started spiraling in on us greg bannerman just pulled the chopper hard left and started us dropping jump out he said no special emphasis but loud me i jumped i hit water and there was bubbles all around me then the lake lit up with this weird bluegreen color i could see the whole lake even through the bubbles fish weeds a car on its back bubbles like sapphires something big splashed in and then stuff started pattering down metal globs of melted helicopterive got one here i caught it while it was sinking the light went out and i came up for airthere was a layer of hot waterand then i looked for the big chunk and it was chuck waving his arms drowning i pulled him out when i saw his back i thought he was a deader charred from his heels to his head i started pushing on his back and he coughed out a lot of water and started breathing i wasnt sure id done right but the chare was just his clothes it peeled off him and left him like naked and sunburned except his hands black crisp he must have put his hands over his neck but wed be dead like the rest if we didnt just damn well trust greg bannerman heres to greg las animas colorado prosperous man middleaged in good shape gymnasiumandmassage look good shoes good clothes all worn out he needed a lift i didnt want to stop but rosalee made me do it said he looked like somebody i ought to know damn that woman has a good head for a story good head harley jackson gordon i kept passing dead cars then burning cars i tried to pick up some of the people on foot but they just shook their heads it was spooky finally i just got out and left my mercedes sitting in the road i walked away and then i went back and put my keys in it maybe someone can use it after this is all over and i couldnt stand the thought of that mercedes just rusting in the road but it felt like bad luck so i walked and yes the snouts came and yes l rolled over on my back but i dont much like talking about that part if you dont mind colorado springs genevieve marsh tall slender not skinny handsome solid bones no money nervous sick of talking with military people wanted a change dinner and candles rosalee left me the money to buy her dinner and bugged out goddam shed make a hell of a reporter if she could write they had us for two days we thought they were getting ready to leave and i guess they were and they were going to take us with them we all felt it but on the last day some of them brought in a steer and some chickens and a duck or maybe it was a goose the aliens took us out of the pen and they looked us over then they pulled me out and i was hanging on to gwen and beatrice so tight im afraid i hurt them and that crazy man from menningers who spent all his time curled up with his head in his arms they pulled on one arm and he had to follow he never stopped swearing no sense in it just a stream of dirty words they aimed us at the road and one of them sswatted me on the ass with itstrunk and i started walking pulling gwen along beatrice in my arms and then we ran beatrice was like lead we didnt wait for the crazy man when the spaceship took off we were far enough away that we only got a hot wind and that glare but they took the rest with them and the animals took our place maybe they think the steer will breed near logan whole bunch all types digging around in a wrecked howard johnsons nobodys too proud to root for garbage now shit gino pietsch i knew thered be a tornado shelter every building in kansas has something even if its a brick closet in a motel room i broke in and i found the tornado closet and i hid the snouts never even came looking i guess they didnt care much if you were the type to hide every so often i came out just long enough to get water and i was in the closet when the bombs came and getting pretty hungry but not hungry enough to come out how much radiation did i get am i going to die lauren kansas that page was nearly blank roger stared at it i have to write it down some day damn damnation not just yet roger brooks nathaniel reynolds rosalee pinelli carol north the snouts were all over the city george bergson came up with the notion of using molotov cocktails to wreck a snout tank the guitarists put away their instruments at last roger got up unsteadily three cornwhiskey sours had hit him harder than hed expected he moved over to the man with the fading red beard mr reddington hairy red thats me and you roger brooks washington post capital post now yeah gotcha heroes need publicity i hear you have some good stories to tell im collecting war stories drink sure but i gotta run my ride leaves in five minutes reddington turned to the bar watneys millie

cant sell that use it or lose it roger let harry lead him to a table they sat and roger studied harry while opening his notebook beard and hair trimmed corn patiently but not artistically clothes are clean and almost new and dont quite fit supplied by the army harry we have a lot to talk about id like to buy you dinner he took out the gold amec card and handed it to the barmaid reddington hesitated a bare instant may i bring a friend sure what time do you like call it seventhirty the friendly snout was more crowded now with citizens and army and navy personnel the civilians had dinner the service people drank i like it rosalee said but where do they get the food mess sergeants making a bit on the side roger said thats why the service types wont eat here you know that for sure dont have to she drew away from him in mock horror but roger its news and youre not digging it out now just a damn minute gotcha yeah okay look rosalee it would only be a little story no prizes and id get half the army on my case and i dont need roger im the one who keeps telling you to relax roger let thick sarcasm creep into his voice by their standard there were no menus prices were listed on a blackboard mostly too high the drinks are dependable roger said dependable you can depend on them to take the lining out of your throat harry was drinking a brandname beer but i noticed there was yeast in the bottom of the bottle anyway they take plastic oh goody is that him she glanced toward the doorway hairy and red but hes with three people hardly surprisingcarlotta roger bounded across the room carlotta dawson grinned widely and came to meet him i thought it had to be you from what harry told me i saw your column you knew i was out here and you didnt come find me were busy in there roger she lowered her voice so no one else could hear they have me sitting in for wes roger thats off the record really off the record shit carlotta im glad to see you hell ive lost track of everybody

old friends carlotta said carlotta have you heard anything about wes not since his speech roger what are they saying about him do they call him a traitor roger gestured helplessly not around me or me harry said but they do some do not the doctors not the farmers and grocers just damn fools there are always damn fools harry said and then there are the ones who say dawson was insufficiently persuasive because we ought to give up before they kill us all lots of fools roger said harpanetthe alien harry capturedsays that wes told the truth they do treat captives well wes did that well carlotta anybody who knew him would know that i guess i worry too much her mood changed harry thanks for inviting me out ive been inside far too long time to have a little fun roger its really good to see you again this is rosalee i picked her up in laurenah hell it sounds wrong weve been together since never heard you run out of words carlotta laughed rosalee good she doesnt know she told me

you get rosalee whispered mind your own business you expected that woman shhh i hoped you told me harry knew her now just listen they sat rosalee ive known carlotta since she was in high school pleased to meet you rosalee hairy red bowed as he shook her hand this is tim lewis lucille battaglia lewis was the man who had been teaching harry to sing lucille was small and dark and pretty and in uniform spec adjutant general corps personnel probably shuffling papers when she isnt mooning over every word reddington says when does it stop raining roger asked the colonel says in about six months

insisted families ive heard the senior staff have their families with them some do carlotta said roger i hear you were part of a raid on the invaders roger laughed okay i give up look i only witnessed that raid mostly it was georges idea whod you hear it from carol oh shit carol had gone inside on the insistence of nat reynolds the goddamn scifi people can get their groupies inside and i cant even get past the outside gate actually it was georges idea i was along to watch how much did that woman tell reynolds was no more a hero than i was hell im not blowing a months expense money to talk about me harry tell your story wow lucille said thats really something ive never seen a snout except harpanet the one you captured harry well it was sufficiently hairy harry said if the snout didnt kill us the farmers would we took the motorcycle downhill till we could smell the swamp and then we walked lucille found hairy red awesome roger found that amusing but carlotta laughed something between a snort and a giggle see if itll carry you the man says sheena queen of the jungle a snout armed with an assault rifle i dont think it ever crossed harrys mind that i might chicken out so i couldnt harrys just the right kind of crazy you know what he said when we got to those farmers but carlottas backing him up he must be a real hero aw come on roger moved his nowclean dinner plate so he could take notes i never saw action lucille said but ive seen harpanet nuts classified are there any stories you can tell i havent been told so harry has all the good stories harry has the stories but carlotta knows whats happening bellingham evelyn got pregnant and married that guy what was his name max max rohrs has a sick mother in bellingham had to live there and evelyn went with him shell still be there what in hell is linda gillespie doing in bellingham he watched corporal lucille from the corner of his eye when he said we didnt see any sign of snouts after the bombs went off now they tell me those were soviet bombs she didnt react i wonder how the sub commanders felt they finally got to bomb us i never saw a snout tim lewis said i talked to plenty o guys who did dave pfeiffer and i made a song about what happened to him he joined the army after we got here i dont know where he is now but id guess hes chasing down refugee snouts lets sing that song said hairy red desserts coming tim lewis protested oh hell sure they moved to the bandstand and opened guitar cases customers started to look around bellingham lindas not there to meet a lover im the one lover shes got if shes there ed gillespie is there air force general on the presidents personal staff in bellingham why penny for your thoughts rosalee said shh theyre going to sing the battle of garfield by david pfeiffer and tim lewis it was just five days after the battle in orbit like snowflakes they came drifting down from the sky monsterthings dangling from bright frail gliders we watched and we talked and we all wondered why to northward and east of us they made their landing set up a strong point out near great bend but some had been scattered by wind while they drifted and four landed near us to settle with men bob and les forward and bill top kick tuning old amvets came by on the sixth morning bright they had fifteen men with them combat vets mostly they called saddle up for a hell of a fight tom kinney had seen them and told us about them right down toward kinsley and headed our way elephant dwarves with their two trunks aswinging and rifles to shoot with is what he did say ed gillespie air force general fighter pilot but with administrative and science experience cant fly now theres nothing to fly no airport worth mentioning there anyway evelyn told us about bellingham seaport town old decayed university pacific northwest where it rained all the time even before footfall so mike tried to track them and we kept our distance we set up an ambush and bided our time as they came in closer i picked out the last one and sighted my hk to make his life mine charley cut loose with ak an old souvenir from that old asian war the rest of us fired on time from position these snouts wouldnt push us around anymore the snouts fired back as was to be expected but two tumbled over and thrashed in the wheat grenades came aflying and i picked up shrapnel that peppered my right hand and both of my feet pacific northwest rains all the time cloud cover railroad goes there old seaport goddam its perfect theyre building something there something they want hidden under cloud cover it flies why else have an astronaut general there something that flies into space i rolled to a culvert just under the roadway i was lucky i did as we fired last round cause they called on their buddies that waited in orbit called for support and laid hell on the ground green fire came humming and cracking and burning scorched out our positions and killed every one left me in the culvert awounded and bleeding and one living snout that had started to run it came to my refuge and looked up the pipe there then reached in and grabbed me and pulled me outside its trunk gripped my rifle as it pulled me from safety but i put a slug through its eye now out from garfield police came ariding on horses to look around after the fight they found me and patched me and gave me some bourbon and took me towards home in the quiet twilight so raise your glass slowly to memories around us and drink to those boys who have gone on their way they died fighting bravely for freedom and kansas against enemies of the u s of a something they want to hide too big to hide in a factory building something big that flies into space god damn carlotta had listened politely harrys a hero not a bard yeah

bandana and wiped his face thai the last of it good ken dutton said he went over to the pool edge inspect sarge and his crew had shoveled the last of the mud out lets hope the new wall holds sarge laughed it will but come on its a good wall so was the old one it just wasnt designed to live through a giant meteoroid impact patsy clevenger looked up from the pool bottom where she been scooping the last of the mud into a bucket the dinosaur werent either ken were lucky the house didnt slide down the hill youre right there footfall had triggered earthquakes houses fell freeway over passes collapsed power lines went down ken dutton had heard it was much worse in san francisco and through northern california in los angeles the quakes had merely been annoying compared to the mudslides three months of hard rain had produce now maybe the worst was over with three swimming pools cleared of mud and ready to fill the encampment across the street was growing part of the golf course was covered with aluminumframed plastic greet houses filled with young tomatoes and beans chickens clucked in the pens hed built in what had been his neighbors cabana patsy climbed out of the pool where shed been working lot of all you survey she said something like that ken admitted you love it she accused thats not fair i dont mind patsy said i didnt used to like you very much you tried everything and werent very good at anything nownow its like you found what you do best im glad some body can cope thanks but im hardly the only one i hear about people all over the valley greenhouses cornfieldsone chap came by the other day hoping to borrow an olive press i never thought of that one there are lots of olive trees in los angeles ken looked up at the sky it was partly overcast but there were patches of blue los angeles was supposed to be a desert one day it might be again nobody really knew anyway we have another place to store water come on in ill spring for coffee real coffee sarge asked why not damn im for that the sink worked fine now that sarge had rigged up pipes theyd have running water as long as the rains filled the swimming pool up on top of the hill above them the house that stood there had been one of the first to go fortunately it had gone down the other side of the hill ken watched cora carefully measure out water into the kettle coffee sarge harris said wistfully i think i miss not having morning coffee moren anything sure wish we could have another stove soup party i already put out the invitations ken said the next time theres enough sunshine or if the gas comes back on cora carefully lit the bottled gas stove which it wont i keep hoping we can save up get a bottle or two ahead but we cant not with all those kids to cook for it works out sarge said or has so far just barely ken said cora was watching the kettle ready to turn it off the second it was hot enough she didnt look up ken felt relieved cora was the only one who knew how well hed done by taking in city orphans it hadnt been as much trouble as hed thought with sarge and his wife to help they put the kids into two empty neighboring houses and sarge got them organized like a military outfit with their own leaders and everything ken hardly saw them and it had paid off nicely not only were there enough ration coupons and gas bottles to trade for a few luxuries but everybody knew about the kids and his increased ration tickets so the local ration wardens didnt come searching his place hoarders werent highly regarded ken had known food would be scarce but whod have thought that heat to cook it with would be the hardest thing to come by no sun cora was just beginning to bulge i suppose ill have to marry her maybe not either way shes going to make me send patsy away unless i can get somebody to marry patsy somebody hungry wholl act jealous they took the coffee into the front room anthony graves was in his usual place by the big front windows they faced southeast and got just enough sun to grow tomatoes in pots if somebody would spend enough time taking care of them graves was glad to do it there wasnt a lot else for somebody his age randy conant was there too sarge gave anthony graves a quarter cup of his coffee ht liked graves he carefully ignored randy conant get much written sir some graves said he grinned i never expected to write my magnum opus long after i retired i think its great sarge said randy conant mumbled something what cora asked i said it was shit enough sarge ken said sarge harris hadnt moved but his face told it all randy why dont you go turn over the compost heap fuck all let somebody else do some of the work sarge i said thatll do randy we all work now get going before i forget youre my sisters kid dont do me any favors uncle ken maybe ill take that advice whew patsy said it gets thick hey im sorry randy said i get upset thats all all this work and what for what for sarge demanded yeah what for were gonna lose anyway just like that dawson guy said they can keep dropping rocks on us until we have to give up why dont we do it while weve got something left peace in our time thank you neville chamberlain graves chuckled youre gonna fight the snouts with quotes sure have another some folks win by winning some folks win by losing i think you get off on looking stupid randy theres a lot of people think like i do bullshit sarge you wont hear it patsy said but hes right i hear them down at the market nice people they just want things the way they were before the war started thats what they wont get graves said whatever else they wont have that look what happened after world war ii everything changes after a war win or lose itll be worse if we lose sarge insisted sure people dont tame very well i dont want us to surrender cora said butwell would it be so awful that congressman dawson he said theyll let us live under our own laws live the way we always said we want to monogamously youd like that ken thought thats what the commies always said sarge shouted true enough graves said id rather have them than snouts patsy said what difference does it make what youd rather have randy demanded nothing we do makes any difference theyre up there and we cant hurt them the armys doing something sarge was positive what just what can they do i dont know but theyre doing something you heard the president he sounded good confident and you really believe in politicians i mean you really trust them hell you hate president coffey a lot of people hated roosevelt graves said a lot more than youd think but he won the war its different now randy said dont you see its different if there was something we could do some way we could fight but theres nothing we just sit here and let them drop rocks on us nothing we can do and theyll get bigger and bigger theyll kill us all and we cant do anything about it he laughed shit we sure cant do anything we cant even surrender we can hang on graves said stay alive and be ready to the washing of the spears an assegai has been thrust into the belly of the nation there are not enough tears to mourn the dead king of the zulu after the battle of rorkes drift we are winning attackmaster koothfektilrusps image blurred slightly and his voice hissed african night lay below message bearer the dark cloud coy flared with chains of wild power surges the herdmasters nerv screamed at the sight but he couldnt look away repair the broken lines lest the ship die he waited for the atmospheric electric discharges to end they came less frequently now when the fithp had landed in the first weeks after the foot they had been near constant the image solidified we have captured wonderful machine which make electrical power and transportation devices machines that make other machines we have slaves the land is wide and it is ours we eat the native food we must learn if poisons are present or nutrients are missing ship samples to message bearer for chemical analysis we will on the next launch herdmaster chintithpitmar wishes to return for the mating season we will miss him sorely but he has surely earned the privilege yes i remember your reports yet chintithpitmang is a dissident of the year zero fillip what have they found that the look so far can you truly spare your best warriors you continue to lose fithp yes herdmaster we will always lose warriors until we have culled out the rogues from among these humans fistartehthuktu was correct this is a race of rogues rogues everywhere they may be more rogues than normals the acolytes are studying this to see how it could have come about herdmaster we may have come just in time to save these humans as if it were meant to be herdmaster we gain a new domain a wide domain we stand on high places and we cannot see the bounds of our territory your domain grows large and the fithp grow fewer the warriors sicken of slaughter it will not always be so the true humans learn we kill rogues only it is the task of warriors to kill rogues the herdmaster suppressed an urge to trumpet how are you sure there are what you call true humans i will show you the attackmaster gestured and stepped aside two stepped into camera view breakerone raztupispminz and a dark human male covered with drab cloth as the important ones always covered themselves he stood half out of camera view for fear of standing too close to the breaker this one is called botha he held high rank in the afrikaans tribe he knows little of our speech but i will give you his words he is eager to end this war the human spoke at length his voice went up and down now a mumble now a whine pastempehkeph heard it as a plea he speaks strangely tashayamp said pastempehkeph turned to her is it not english yes herdmaster but not as i have learned it the breaker spoke he says that the war destroys and both humans and flthp lose he says that he would do what he could to end the fighting and let humans and fithp live together this he calls peace he says that now he can do nothing we took his surrender in a ceremony broadcast to all the humans here and because they have seen my foot on his chest many will no longer obey him the herdmaster trumpeted in rage then why seek leaders at all must we take surrender from each we have not enough feet for every human no herdmaster we allow them to gather they have gatherings much as we do where the eldest speak for all their decisions are binding these humans do nothing without meeting and talking we will allow these eldest to meet and take their surrender they will name this botha as leader he will then command the human warriors to keep order and enforce our domain something had changed in the african fithpit was visible even in the monitor screensand the herdmaster began to see why was this peculiar approach your own idea breaker herdmaster the human fithp always want to discuss terms before they surrender from curiosity i began to discuss conditional surrender with small human fithp over my objection atackmaster koothfektilrusp put in i was mistaken when a human fithp surrenders under agreed terms the members tend to honor their surrender not all surely some fight on herdmaster but those are rogues known to all to be rogues in defiance of their own leaders we kill the rogues the humans will aid us in this then we will have one herd again colonel julius carter tried once more ive got three wounded men one of them will die if we move him man im only asking for shelter the afrikaners turned us away i hadnt expected it but they did but this one is english the farmer spread his hands helplessly i cant hehes a white soldier blanqui not black like me brant chishoim laughed bitterly do you think that matters now great god man dont you think i want to help carter let his voice grow cold with menace if you dont help us well kill you and burn your place the farmer nodded wearily i expected that will you kill my wife and children too and my neighbors and their women and all their children were americans not monsters if the jumbos find you here theyll kill us all do your worst colonel youre not as bad as them ah shit carter said you know damned well i cant just shoot you if youre going to stay here it would be better if you did shoot me and put my body where the jumbos will find it chisholm said dropping his voice conspiratorily maybe then theyll blame you and not everyone here shit carter couldnt keep it up we wont hurt you but man we need help we worked our way up from the coast bad down there its bad its worse than you can think buzzards everywhere buzzards and bugs and everything dead and smashed rotting corpses left by the waves new corpses too we brought the guns as far as we could now we have to find somebody willing to go get them and use them and theres nobody left with guts all right well move out can i leave corporal allington with you yes take all his equipment take his uniform too whats wrong with him we shot up a snout patrol and they called in their lasers hes burned over almost half his body okay well take care of him as best we can if they ask ill say he was burned in a motor accident they probably wont as long as we bring in the crops they pretty well leave us alone i guess its pretty rough for you too carter said rough yes you could say that id head for the bush but what would happen to the wife and kids let me tell you yank a man with four small children doesnt have a lot of choices sure what would i do brant magtig commandos a tall blond woman rushed into the room she stopped when she saw carter magtig here in our house chisholm spoke briefly in afrikaans despite the lessons hed taken while aboard ethan allen carter didnt understand any of it my wife katje chisholm said colonel carter of the united states army i see that he is colonel do you understand the danger you cause here yes maam i didnt have a choice one of my soldiers is hurt where is he carter waved toward the barn and what do you wish to do leave him with you i guess carter said then well go back in the bush and what will you do there whatever we can to hurt the snouts och i could wish to go with you that is impossible let us bring your soldier into the house and get your commando away into the bush three miles north from here you will find a deep ravine filled with brush go into it and wait i will send mvub you must speak with him mvubi our zulu headman he will help you go now go and hurt them but in the name of god go far from here mvubi was old and darker than an american ever gets carte guessed him to be sixty he squatted to make drawings in the dirt here kambula white soldiers they do not speak english o afrikaans jantji says they are russian they hide they wish to fight they ask zulu to help them some go to join them russians they must have come south through mozambique hell of a long way to come do you know any zulu who wan to fight yes take me to them mvubi rocked back and forth on his heels finally he stood i will the airlock door swung ponderously outward and the smell of winterhome hit him in the snout fookerteh flinched then sniffed mustiness alien plants quite different from the life of kansas a tastelessness the buildup of biochemical residues in message bearer was missing here over all the smell of the funeral pit lesser ranks waited behind him but fookerteh paused at the top of the ramp to examine the spaceport it was large with hard paved strips set within other strips of closecropped green vegetation strange winged craft manbuilt and large enough to hold eightsquared fithp were parked at one end of the field humans were loading them other machines guided by humans moved across the field to the digit ship and a human crew began loading boxes and baggage from the digit ship onto their vehicles orderly and proper koothfektilrusp has not stretched his domain with words the humans work for us there were tall thin columns in the distance smoke trailed from their tops wind blew much harder than comfort demanded water fell in fat drops the sky was a textured uneasily shifting gray vast and far and everywhere was the faint but unmistakable smell of the funeral pit fookerteh went down the ramp to where birithartyamp waited they clasped digits your presence wets my back welcome to my domain companion of my youth birithartyamp said formally then he lifted his digits i am truly glad to see you when they told me you would come down i arranged to greet you myself come i will take you to the mudrooms i thank you they walked across the hard surface gravity pulled at fookerteh the sky was so big stretching distances he had not seen since he left the war in kansas can you notis there no way to bury the dead birithartyamp sniffed i had nearly forgotten you will not notice the smell after a few days perhaps at night or when you come from the clean air of the mudrooms fookerteh we have buried the dead within our domain beyond he swept his digits in a wide arc toward that endlessly distant sky the waves drowned numbers you cannot hold in your head when the wind blows from that way or that it is strongest today the smells are faint fookerteh shuddered it will pass in a season in two seasons they had left the hardsurfaced spaceport soft loam sank under their feet and a new smell was in the air spiral plants stood as tall as their knees winterfiowers were just visible as loops of vine above the soil in a year they would be blooming see death makes the land fertile the flying scavengers they are called aasvogel in the dominant language vultures in english they do their work as do the running creatures and the worms and insects they do their work that the garden will be green is it not always so you sound like a priest fookerteh said birithartyamp flailed digits across his friends shoulder mocker here is the mudroom my officers await us inside all but one who will join us presently you know him chintithpitmang yes chintithpitmang was a dissident fookerteh had avoided him before we go inwhyare you here birithartyamp asked urgently it is as you suspect my mothers mate wishes to smell through my nostrils and feel through my digits he trusts koothfektilrusp but he wishes another view i was sent good it is as i hoped the herdmaster will sniff your thoughts and believe we are winning fookerteh the path is long and twisted but we can follow itand the domain is endless the mudroom had a random primitive look of course it lacked the curve of spin gravity but it was shapeless a mere hole dug in the dirt filled with water churned and heated it was twice the size of message bearers communal mudroom on the far side was an endless cascade of water plummeting into a separate pool this was the way a mudroom should be fookerteh sagged in the warmth resting muscles strained by winterhome gravity eyes halfclosed his snnfp just above the surface he was glad to be out of the stinking wind we were told of an animal large resembling the fithp they call it elephant birithartyamp said imagine a tremendous fi with only a single digit these creatures are truly enormous i will show you one that masses more than eight times your weight fookerteh snorted incredulity i agree but it is true and these are not the dominant species of this planet they are not many humans believe them to be the most intelligent of all species living on the earth save for themselves of course even a single digit may manipulate tools yes but badly their digit is primitive compared to ours and our digits are yes it is not important they are large and powerful but the human called botha said that unless these elephants were protected they would all be killed killed by what by the lesser humans for food by those we fight in the wild areas fookerteh we win but you do not yet know the valor of their warriors and ours fookerteh let warm mud flow along his sides a creature that massive should be unstoppable yet humans killed them technology he sensed a mass above him and reached up to clasp digits with chintithpitmang well met companion of my youth there was a strangeness a distance in chintithpitmangs voice the fi bore new scars he was armed and wore the harness of an eightcubed leader infrared nightseeing goggles and other equipment fookerteh did not recognize hung from his harness he stood like a wall in the gravity that had fookerteh sagging his look made fookerteh uneasy well met fookerteh responded will you not join us birithartyamp said chintithpitmang is one of the elite jungle warriors most of them are sleepers youve seen reports i have chintithpitmang have you seen these elephants i have they are large and fearsome not so fearsome as the humans who kill elephants and fithp alike machines speak with as much warmth as you the reports say that we have lost many fithp in the jungles many more simply refuse to fight there why death and madness wait in the jungle chintithpitmang said winterhome is strange enough to fithp who know only the closed spaces of message bearer two young warriors came to take their leaders weapons and aid him in removing his harness fookerteh recognized members of the year zero fithp they looked like each other but not like the year zero dissidents that fookerteh had just left on thuktun flishithy chintithpitmang might not have seen his subordinates his eyes looked past the walls of the mudroom we are warriors and our enemies find us all too conspicuous in the open the jungles you havent seen them fookerteh but youve seen the spiral plant in the garden picture that as average size and eight to the eighths of them growing and smaller plants swarm at their feet it sounded strange and terrible but chintithpitmang was saying at first the jungle felt safe we couldnt see that terrible infinity of sky and landscape we could hide from human rogue snipers among these huge plants he snorted a sound like a gun going off in the jungles the humans move where we stand fast tangled trapped there is a strangling creature like a length of rope the plants hide human snipers far more easily than they hide us they use arrays of pointed sticks planted butt down angled and smeared with poisonous substances throw yourself out of the path of a spray of missiles and you will find yourst impaled on pungi sticks hidden in the low vegetation we learned there came revolts among warriors who refusd to enter a jungle we ended with the elite junglewarrior fithp but most spaceborn simply cannot find the right mindset fookerteh you may inform your father that sleepers will eventual hold the highest ranks among the african warriors but you adjusted i did do you notice anything strange about me fookerteh you have surely changed fookerteh had been avoiding it he thought now he could not chintithpitmang behaved like incipient rogue some warriors hunt alone we move through the jungles as on the plains seeking human rogues when we find them we call down laser fire from the digit ships an octuple would find the rogues the best hunters are those who go alone or in pain without those we must needs cede the jungles to the humans yet i fear what it does to our minds fithp minds are not geared for such wholesale killing we dont speak of the numbers of the dead not among ourselves and not to the lesser warriors rumor spreads and there is always the stink we are always aware of what our foothold here has cost both humans and ourselves the wholesale killing of whole human tribes due to the rogue behavior of one or two members has been forbidden by your father and the attackmaster both it continues nonetheless for it is effective day by day the humans become more submissive many now cooperate with us and so we are winning fookerteh mused we win there are costs many deaths were caused by difficulties in perception our lives aboard message bearer haven prepared us to recognize what we see fithp have wandered of cliffs or broken their legs in holes or shied from something harmless into real danger the human enemy finds the simples of hiding places indecently effective in spotted green clothing they seem to vanish many have guns yet even without guns they kill us pointed sticks fly from the greenery chintithpitmang voice trailed off and his eyes focused on fookerteh as if seeing the mudroom for the first time fookerteh i have applied to return to message bearer for mating season well you might you shall i was told good chintithpitmang walked into the mud bringing a bow wave with him he sank eyes halfclosed and it seemed he would not speak again then i fear the paths my mind would walk if i missed mating season i have already walked too far from the life i knew i came to learn such things the attackmaster had never spoken of such can you tell me how pheegorun died im told you were there i was there chintithpitmang was deep in the mud eyes fully closed now only his head protruding we were not even in danger i cannot think we behaved stupidly nonetheless we did not understand africa as we do now you must see the jungle i will show you we had tamed it when i arrived though the cost was high when i stepped off the floatfort i found pheegorun examining what might have been a primitive digging tool chintithpitmang spoke without body language his voice was almost a monotone it was as if the emotions raised by his terrible tale had long since been burned away by time or by worse to come pheegonin said here eightcubed leader you can see that theres a blade moored to one end the native throws the stick and hopes the bladeend hits one of us hard enough to penetrate skin were pheegorьn a friend chintithpitmang would have swatted him across the shoulders mocker but this was a subordinate a sleeper a stranger are you in fact joking no they make it work they kill us with these why doesnt it turn end for end how can they throw it so hard chintithpitmang considered a long thin mass would have the proper moment of inertia if it could be thrown straight but how perhaps if you hold it properly at the end perhaps lead me chintithpitmang picked up the long shaft with just the tips of his digits he raised it into place above and behind his head point foremost and threw it it traveled some four srupkithp and landed sideways pheegorun tactfully said nothing chintithpitmang said pause maybe if i he retrieved the spear this time he carefully wrapped all eight segments of his trunk the same way round now when i let go it should spin right lead me eightcubed leader the spear traveled four srupkithp and landed sideways take it said chintithpitmang give it to a prisoner and let him demonstrate chintithpitmang who had been seeing nothing at all was abruptly staring fookerteh in the eye of course pheegorun must have tried this already he had seen the spear kill and he had studied it longer than i he must have perceived me as a talkative novice an interloping fool he was a good fi a good officer he might have been one of the elite what happened he followed my orders the man was very black and very tall and nearly naked of clothing and hair the hair of his head formed a huge puffball there was paint on his face and patterns and ridges in his skin carefully applied scars of the prisoners he was the only one unwounded he had stood up from the bush with a spear in his hand too close to the column a soldier in the rear had knocked him flat with a swipe of a gun butt rolled him over and taken his surrender he wore strange harness ancient fur pieces encircled his ankles and wrists once splendid but now bedraggled feathers hung about his neck his head was circled by a green furred band all of his harness was old and brittle stained with earth and sweat they had seen many dressed that way the man listened to his orders he looked about at his audience of a hundred fithp warriors then without answering not so much as nodding he strode to the spear and picked it up holding it in the middle chintithpitmang felt he would never get used to the sight it made his belly queasy as while a spacecraft was involved in a finicky docking why didnt the man fall over he was tall and narrow even by the standards of men and if he fell he ought to break his neck but he didnt fall he stood almost motionless weaving slightly as pheegorun pointed to the target put it as close to the dot as possible he called he was standing a safe eight srupkithp away would this work as he expected pheegorun must know how closely his eightcubed leader was watching the man raised the spear level with the ground aimed at the target he raised himselfon his toes and still didnt fall he slapped the spear haft with his free hand the spear turned ninety degrees and so did the man and pheegorun was looking straight down the halt pheegorun turned to run eight srupkithp distant or not he turned to run and half his soldiers were raising their weapons the spear flew it thudded deep into pheegoruns side pheegorun froze chintithpitmang glimpsed the black man standing calmly arms at his sides in the instant before the guns tore him apart pheegorun took his surrender they dont think like us never mind it flew straight i saw it the medic studied pheegorun without touching him i want him to lie down he said some of you help first brace him while i pull the stickblade out two soldiers held him with their mass while the doctor pulled pheegorun screamed at the pain it was deep inside him tearing its way outit was out held bleeding before his face chintithpitmang watching horrified felt the tearing inside when pheegorun tried to breath good now brace him pheegorun can you hear me lean to the left you should be lying down pheegorun couldnt make himself move the doctor pushed and he leaned anyway and was lowered to his left side his own weight was forcing his lungs shut exhaling was a matter of letting it happen despite the agony but inhaling was like lifting a mountain the doctor said this will end the pain i believe the stickblade punctured a lung i must cut him open and sew up the wound save him if you can said chintithpitmang pheegorun was dying he must have known it he had to speak now or die silent his eyes found and locked on chintithpitmang did you see the danger and he was reduced to gasping his eyes filmed over the doctors knife was cutting into him he tried to make his mouth work not loud enough chintithpitmang bent his ear next to pheegoruns mouth pheegorun gathered his will forced his rib cage to move gathered breath like a thousand daggers and spoke thumbs he said and died his village chintithpitmang screamed the demand coordinates someone answered chintithpitmang shouted into the communications box five eights of makasrupkithp away green lines laced down tight spirals when they were done chintithpitmang turned the prisoners who from his tribe they all were when the work was finished chintithpitmar sent two captives away to tell others i can guess what he was thinking their thumbs are more dexterous than our digits we were the supreme tool users until we came here we were ready for the wrong things we guessed some of the preys advantages his greater numbers his knowledge his own territory his grasp of an inferior technology that he ha at least built himself with no thuktunthp for guidance pheegorun was dying and he thought to warn me i had heard such talk from others since but it is wrong what if the thumbs let them make their machines smaller we have the thultunthp to give us more powerful tools and they haveonly then selves you violated orders fookerteh remarked you destroyed a entire fithp i did i did it in rage and i did it to correct my own mistake shape your own lessons we have lost only two more fithp in this region chintithpitmang said the others bring us cattle an milk have you done it since no not yet but it changes me this war i need the wisdom of the females i need my mate treason treason doth never prosper whats the reason for if it prosper none dare call it treason sir john harington a light drizzling rain kept them zippered and sweating in their waterproofs today wasnt bad they had huddled through days of rainladen gales that would have blown harrys motorcycle off the road the sign read bellingham city limits the freeway offramp led to what had once been a main road now it hardly looked used they drove past closed service stations closed motels a closed black angus restaurant one gas station was open but there was a sign no gas no services i dont know why im open either want tea most of the houses were boarded up bellingham has an unfriendly look roger shouted in his ear it seemed to make him happy where the hell was that turnoff the map showed the main road forked with one fork going off west around western washington university and down to the harborthere it was harry took the other branch it curved east and went under the freeway past a shopping center that didnt look completely closed after that there were only houses the enclave wasnt easy to find it lay at the end of a winding road and it didnt look much like the place that had once been described to harry it seemed too small and the tennis court had become a greenhouse there was a heavy fence and a gate with a big j arthur rank kind of gong set up so hed have to get off the bike and go past a concrete barrier to ring it they sure dont encourage casual visitors which figures harry drove slowly past unsure there was a small woods at the end from there they had a view of the area in front of the garage john fox hes there roger shouted fox oh yeah i remember him never met him harry sal how do you know how many pickup trucks have a california personalized license plate that reads ecofreak oh that one harry turned the motorcycle around so now what we go in before i just wanted a shower now i know i want to meet your friends okay harry stopped at the gate the gong wasnt as lot as hed thought it would be jack mccauleys round face had picked up angles and a closely clipped black beard men wore beards these days all across the country his shoulders and arms had gained muscle mass they strained his old shirt im telling you up front weve got the room he said but drive on in georgell be glad to see you harry but what in hell is a newsman doing here roger smiled lightly were planning a feature lifestyle theres a lot of interest in colorado springs on how the rest the country is doing mccauley eyed roger closely yeah sure well come on in but theres no story here the house and grounds looked like a construction site hart thought they put the bike next to foxs truck roger looked it and nodded in satisfaction they found george tateevans working on the greenhouse harry wasnt surprised to see that george was cleanshaven h would be george drove in a nail straightened stared at harry and whistled its really hairy red he smiled warmly dam all harry youre not as clean as you used to be but somehow you look a lot better hows the back wonderful i havent had to see a lawyer in months mee roger brooks with the washington post weve both come out of kansas kansas harry i expect everybody would like to hear some stories about kansas youve come all the way from washington naw from colorado springs harry said colorado springs george said carefully yes harry i guess you better come to dinner as long as you understand the situation theres no room here harry no spare beds we have tents look around you the only place you could put a tent would be in the driveway well think of something harry said he grinned look george im used to telling tales for my supper tonight though think you could throw in a shower it didnt surprise roger brooks that there was plenty of water because there was water everywhere too damned much water this was different he showered in warm water not as much as roger wanted because the pipes in the rooftop heat collector didnt hold that much but more than roger had enjoyed for a long time i better enjoy it ill pay for it it had been a long trip i chose the right guide we got here but now harry will tell his war stories again the dining room was large with a long table in the center at one end was a lecturn the whole place reminded roger of the refectory in the christian brothers monastery theyd stopped in on the way up from colorado springs the brothers had taken in travelers the way monasteries did in medieval times theyd also put all the local indolents to work in gardens and vineyards the room grew crowded john fox seemed genuinely glad to see roger rogers memory held the names as they came a useful skill for a newsman foxs friend marty carnell george and vicki tateevans harry had called george super survivor his wife was quiet and it became clear that visitors made her uncomfortable isadore and clara roger didnt get their last names clara wanted to know what was happening in the capital others the man at the gate jack mccauley his wife was harriet and she was listening a lot while making up her mind about something bill and gwen shakes occupied the head of the table there were a lot of shakes kidsa lot of kids for that matter and roger let their names slip through his head unclaimed shakes was concerned about rogers story we dont need any publicity dont need any dont want any id tell you how tough things are if i thought youd believe me i wont be writing much about bellingham roger said or any other specific place anyway if youre worried about getting lots of new company forget it harry and i could have stopped cold half a dozen times and thats on a motorcycle press credentials and a gas ration card nobodys coming to bellingham and nobodys printing anything about bellingham but before we left the springs we went through all the files i could nothing nothing at all since long before the snouts dropped the dinosaur killer i can taste it a secret a year old hidden from snouts and citizens alike a lot of people have come to bellingham harriet mccat said yes its getting crowded clara added the markets crowded lines long lines for almost anything except staples dairy products hah most places there are lines for those too harry maybe you have it better than you think dinner was spaghetti there wasnt any meat in the sauce there was cheese and fresh stewed tomatoes from the greenhouse conversation became local while they ate its wet everywhere isnt it fox asked pretty much so roger told him we were never able to out except for a couple of days in utah you must get more here than id have thought fox snorted heck bellingham wasnt noted for its sunshine before that snout asteroid hit not like death valley and sudden fury surged into his face before he could hide it what made you think we get sunlight now hot water roger said that was heated in those roof collectors wasnt it sure but it was warm not hot fox said it collects diffuse sunlight miranda shakes said we hot water when theres real sunshine three days so far this ye id kill for a hot bath when dinner ended almost everyone left chores fox said nice to have seen you again roger bill shakes and george tateevans helped carry dinner dish out then came back well offer you brandy but its getting dark out bill shakes said maybe youd rather go make camp where theres light its no problem for us roger said weve made camp in the dark before harry added okay the best place will be up the lane it runs into the woods go up about half a mile cross the creek and theres a clearing be careful how much wood you burn and dont cut any okay isadore brought in two bottles of california brandy two more cases he said to nobody in particular he took thin glass snifters from a cabinet and brought them around george tateevans went to help but poured his own glass half full first the doses that isadore poured for guests were considerably smaller bill shakes waited until they were all seated with their glasses harry you said you have a gasoline ration card yep harry grinned heros reward you know i captured a snout george tateevans started to say something but shakes quiet voice was insistent weve located some fertilizer a dairy farmer about thirty miles from here will sell us some but we have to go get it weve got trucks but no gas what are the chances of buying some gasoline from you zero harry said the cards personal he took a plastic encased card from an inner pocket see my driving license on one side gas card on the other picture on both nobody can use it unless you want to grow a beard and dye it to look like me most amusing shakes said without a smile his head might have come level to harrys shoulder maybe we can exchange favors roger said we go get your fertilizer you let us use a truck for a couple of days harry frowned at him why do we need a truck especially need one that bad id like to look around and my tailbone is tired roger said ill buy that one okay bill well haul your cow shit thank you harry lifted his glass youve done pretty well not too bad it was hard to read shakes smile do you know anything about los angeles theyre coping harry said you didnt go through there george asked he brought over a bottle of california brandy and poured a generous second drink no harry said but theyre coping eh just about everywhere harry said things are tough tougher than here mostly but people are managing one way or another greenhouses vegetable gardens chicken coops on rooftops surprising bill shakes said yes considering theres not much the government can do roger said colorado springs cant even find out what people are doing much less help them thats why things are working george said he knocking back his brandy and poured more get the goddamn government out of the way and people can cope you watch if things get little better good enough for the government to get active ever thing will get worse again look at us weve got government boy do we have government government people out the arse george was wrong of course roger had seen it what made it all work was just enough government government wasnt powerful enough to meddle any more but it could tell those who would listen how to help themselves how to build greenhouse keep the plumbing working deal with untrustworthy water supplies eat all of a steer carcass the things once printed in its survival manuals george tateevans must have expected his survivalists to be the government by now instead of decently dying away the government had taken over his territory if roger could say that just right hed get himself and han kicked back into the street instead he said clara said there are lots of new people here why bill shakes booked edgily at george but george didnt notice big government project in the harbor george said new people coming in navy people computer programmers ship fitting plumberswe have to do all our own plumbing now every plumber for a hundred miles seems to work down there at ui harbor they dont moonlight harry asked they dont even come out for a visit hoohah harry was on his second brandy and you guy came up here to get away from the crowds harry chortled and poured himself another drink without asking there is an amusing aspect to it bill shakes still wore his enigmatic smile i remember a story there was a guy who knew the second world war was coming the news said it all so he looked around for a quiet spot to sit it out and he moved his whole life there he picked an island out in the middle of the pacific way the hell away from everything called iwo jima we havent done that bad george said no but it isnt the quiet little backwater with the siltedup harbor any more isadore said the roads are crowded the prices have gone up there are mps minding everybodys business screw them george muttered but what are they doing down there roger asked who knows isadore said they say theyve built greenhouses and theyre growing wheat you can believe as much of that as you want to and if i believe none of it mirandas deputy sheriff heard rumors that its a prison isadore said political prisoners from kansas collaborators theyve built greenhouses all right but theyre working them with prisoners slave camp serve the snout lovers right harry said they may not have had much choice roger said they could fight you captured one harry roger said carefully but he was alone i saw what happened to people who tried to fight them all it wasnt pretty bill shakes leaned forward you were in alien occupied country tell us about it rogers digital watch said am both brandy bottles were empty and they were better than halfway through a third somewhere during the evening miranda had brought down kevins guitar for harry to play and nearly everybody came to listen while harry sang his songs but then the others had gone away leaving george and isadore and bill kevin shakes was working on the government projectand hadnt come home since he went down to the harbor they got letters from him and word through mirandas boyfriend roger felt the tightness in his guts i shouldnt have had so much brandy its hard to stay in control something big in the harbor big george knows something he hasnt said what about time to turn in bill shakes said hes not drunk i wonder just how much he really drank let me fmish this drink roger said unsteadily he knew he was rapidly wearing out his welcome but i may not get a better shot he went over to george and lifted his glass death to tyrant down with the state right on george grinned and clinked glasses secrets roger said they always have secrets like in vietnam when they kept it a secret they were bombing in cambodia who was it secret from the cambodians knew the viet cong had to know i bet they even told the russians so who didnt know right george said right so now theyve got more secrets george bill shakes said quietly george didnt listen what the hell could they be hiding roger shook his head probably something silly george dropped his voice to a conspiratorial mumble snouts theyve got snouts down there roger woke on the living room floor his head pounded snouts no big secret nothing but a hideout for captured snouts thats ridiculous bellingham vanished from the news before anyone captured a snout and they wouldnt put general gillespi in charge of a snout prison camp but bill shakes believes it he didnt want me to find out if shakes doesnt know whats really going on in the harbor nobody out here does well have to go inside he heard harrys voice from the other room like sheena queen of the jungle miz d hopped on and out we came hey real coffee great there were other voices children and giggles coffee but to get any hed have to listen to harrys story yet again so we achieve escape velocity pastempehkeph thought from here we coast well hold the african continent forever and if new resistance rises well trample it from space ultimately the dissidents may rule message bearer while my descendants trade them metals for food the door to the mudroom opened pastempehkeph waved happily from the mud his fithps mating season had come round at last i have a guest said kturfookeph you what pastempehkeph didnt say that he said enter soak your tired selves this had better be urgent kturfookeph entered with chowpeentulk the females eased into the mud carefully under the low spin gravity a few moments of quiet were allowed to pass during which none of the tension left chowpeentulk then she said my mate was murdered herdmaster what have you done to find the rogue he had thought he could postpone this there was a war on and a sufficiency of dead fithp some fi had removed a problem the herdmaster had taken steps to learn who for he might act again but there had been yet more urgent problems he said tell me first what would you have done chowpeentulk considered a rogue shows he does not speak to his fithp he abandons his mate he does not trouble to hide who he is we have rogues enough the herdmaster conceded warriors on winterhome face strange and terrible pressures but here so you must have noticed him is there a herdless one aboard a member of the traveler herd whom none will associate with no then who could have come and gone so unnoticed chowpeentulk shook her head she was terribly tense why not she had invaded the herdmasters private mudroom he said not a rogue then he did not act alone and if he did he must have shared the secret with someone what would you do now i would ask no ii can lie to the herdmaster that statement is too sweeping but it has some truth i have interviewed the heads of every fithp aboard message bearer the sleepers do not ask that i seek a killer they demanded only that i choose an advisor from among them at once this seemed promising i set my attention on them when that failed me i questioned randomly chosen fithp fistartehthuktuns apprentices tashayamp weapons officers aboard warriors newly come from winterhome mothers newly mated females unmated females humans some spoke of roguish behavior in others i challenged the alleged rogues every accusation was unwarranted none know how fathistehtulk died few even know what his interests were where he might have overturned a secret worth concealing few what have you learned i learned what you must have known chowpeentulk your mate was interested in the human prisoners he questioned one dawson while dawson was isolated so she said in the communal mudbath days before he disappeared he wouldnt tell me what he intended but he thought to learn something it had to do with whether winterhom was worth the taking it would and where does that leave me did he question the soviet prisoners did he learn anything humans may lie even to the herdmaster for i cannot read their body language the breakers were no help it doesnt matter even if we consider that surrendered human might murder a ranking fi another fi murder be involved no frail human could have pushed him into a vertical wall of mud under minuscule thrust a fi must have chilled the mudroom again after fathistehtulk was dead meanwhile a fithpless killer walks message bearer he killed among the highest rank yet nothing shows in his stance he know that he has played the herdmaster for a fool we feared you had forgotten kturfookeph said with a trace of apology in her tone losing my fithp to thermonuclear bombs and wooden stick and madness why should i ignore yet another death but i hay no more footholds here what should i seek some fi appeared and killed and went unnoticed speaking to none chowpeentulk sprayed him the herdmaster didnt react at all a rogue who came and went so simple chowpeentulk i will produce your mates killer within eight days leave us chowpeentulk knew enough to keep silent she surged from the mud and left dripping pastempehkeph said was there no another place where you and that other female could confront me keph she persuaded me there are others who wondered too dont do that again now forget it mother of my immortality the mating season flows always too fast the column made slow progress across the veldt movement was impossible at night the snouts had excellent ir detection equipment on a good day the commando could travel thirty kilometers on foot they had learned that and more julius carter wanted time to understand what he had learned of the strange relationships between the afrikaner tribethey could only be thought of as a tribeand the various black tribes van der stel the thin afrikaner who spoke of kaffirs and expected blacks to call him baasbut who also had genuine respect for the zulu scouts and always listened to their advice mvubi who seemed servile to van der stel and treated carter as an equalbut took his orders from carter and the russians who understood none of this of the dozen whod joined forces with carter only two spoke english and none spoke any other language relevant to south africa a strange country it had been strange before the invaders came now now the whole earth is strange despite the chill wind carter sweated under his heavy pack load they moved in small groups slowly and carefully taking advantage of every patch of cover every depression in the ground up ahead mvubi and his zulu scouts were nearly invisible a steady hiss sounded in carters left ear showing that his radio receiver was on mvubi wouldnt activate the transmitter except in an emergency a short lowpower transmission probably couldnt be heard by the snouts but why take chances it is not far now van der stel said when we reach those trees you will see their spaceport the missile can be fired from there thank god sergeant harrison muttered lieutenant ivan semeyusov looked disapproval at harrison russian noncoms did not speak to their officers until invited and good communists would hardly invoke deity colonel carter hid his grin give em a tenminute break sarge yes sir harrison whistled long and low knowing that mvubis people would hear then he crawled back down the column to pass the word to the americans and russians carter hunched in the lee of the best shelter he could find a wished he could smoke his pipe how good is their sense of smell the wind blew continuously he looked cautiously around weird landscape after all these months there was still the odor of death in the air what is a black boy from pruettigoe doi way down here at least the rain has stopped he said it is cold for november van der stel said summer will late if theres a summer at all carter thought november in south africa should have roughly the same weather as may in southern california warm and dry not this blustery cold the russian officer produced a package of cigarettes no carter said the russian officer put the pack away this is a mad scheme van der stel said so and why are you here lt semeyusov asked his mouth twisted into a deliberate grin learning some manners anyway carter thought it is known that i am mad now van der stфl said ti english found that all afrikaners have the capability now v must show the olifants tell me lieutenant what brings you far from home to aid me in my madness semeyusov wasnt going to touch that one you are certain they will launch a large craft today the russian demanded certain how can i be certain of anything our friends at the spaceport those who load the craft say they believe it will be launched today or tonight or tomorrow i have told you this you think i deceive you naw lieutenant carruthers said none of us think that mynheer ivans nervous we all are with good reason carter glanced at the sun since we dont know when theyll launch the sooner were in position the better lets get moving looks like theyre about to button her up carruthers reported he handed the binoculars back to carter lastminute loading julius carter lay in the grass and turned his binoculars on where had been an airport eight kilometers away the sunday comics had taught him to call them rocket ships this was the first rocket ship he had ever seen shuttles didnt look like this its belly was flat it was the size of a building made the nearby c cargo transport look like a toy take the massive cone off the back and it would look more like an airplane but not very too short too wide too little in the way of fins the only windows were on a canopy the size of a fuselage and that was underneath the nose the point of the nose glittered like a lens but it wouldnt provide a view a laser cannon van der stel had been right as usual this was an excellent place to observe the spaceport high enough to give them a good view but not conspicuously high carruthers might have been reading too much into what he could see on the other hand he might not in the past hour the snouts had certainly closed two cargo hatches on the big ship theyd removed the two loading cranes that went with those ports most of the other baggage carts had been removed to the other side of the field it sure looks like theyre doing something howre the russkis coming we are coming quite well colonel a voice said from behind him ooops thank you lieutenant youve got your missile set up presently good looks like we have about half an hour i will encourage the crew to hurry carter sat in the tall grass and took out his pipe nice thing about a pipe carruthers said dont need to light it colonel spit it out will it work sir i mean they had to carry it a long way and got a better plan no sir its worth a try lieutenant yes sir and no i didnt answer your question son how could i he grinned but to himself as he remembered a story from one of the innumerable arabisraeli wars an arab president had cabled to moscow stop sending surface to air missiles send surface to aircraft missiles so far it hasnt cost us anything but some sweat so far when they launched that russian missile that would all change theyd have to run for it scatter and hope they all made it to the rendezvous points carter glanced at his watch then back to the low railed structure the soviet troops had bolted together okay sergeant spread em out sir there was definite activity at the spaceport all the auxiliary vehicles had been withdrawn now the great hulk of the alien spacecraft sat alone an enormous concrete structure opened nearby the laser carter said hit that and we splatter that ship all over the landscape he handed his binoculars to lieutenant carruthers and turned to the soviet officer all set da semeyusovs eyes glittered expectantly it is a good missile a good missile i sure hope so colonel yeah carruthers theyve opened a hangar something coming outcoming this way shit carter grabbed the binoculars more than a dozen of the fastmoving light ground effect vehicles carter had come to call skimmers moved across the spaceport when they reached the fence they rose over it then spread out across the veldt one was coming directly toward their hill behind the skimmers came eight tanks lieutenant semeyusovs voice was emotionless your orders comrade colonel wait maybe they wont see us the skimmer came on past the area where mvubis scouts were hidden still coming carruthers said colonel if they didnt see his people they wont see us and if they go straight past us theyll see the damn missile carter said theyll be here in a second once past us theyre sure to see the missile he thumbed the channel control on his helmet radio sergeant harrison if that skimmer comes within fifty meters take it out sir harrison was invisible somewhere off to the left lieutenant carruthers unlimbered a light antitank tube custers last stand something like that carter said maybe they wont come yeah sure semeyusov spoke quickly into his phone they are ready the first skimmer reached the bottom of the hill another converged toward it carter lifted the transmitter mvubi usuthu tchaka a moment later automatic weapons chattered from the veldt between carter and the spaceport the trailing skimmer wobbled then fell launch your bloody missile carter ordered its too late to get the spaceship try for the laser anyway with respect colonel perhaps they will launch their ship anyway it is a better target why in hell would they launch during an ambush for answer semeyusov pointed thick white smoke rose from the base platform around the alien spacecraft son of a bitch okay only now we got to stop those tanks carruthers said carefully i dont think mvubis people will hold them long well do the best we can the alien ship rose suddenly the rocket platform that boosted it fell back as a brilliant bluegreen beam stabbed up from the concrete structure at the center of the spaceport any time now carter shouted lieutenant semeyusov spoke rapidly the leading skimmer was climbing the hill toward them there was a sharp flash from the bush to their right a dark shadow moved toward the alien hovercraft rushed at it touched it the skimmer exploded in fire two down hoo hah carruthers shouted bring on the motherfucking tanks tanks hell wheres that damn missile thunder rolled toward them the spacecraft rose on its beam of green fire three smaller beams stabbed downward they moved in an odd pattern there was a flash of fire and the russian missile tumbled in smoke it fell into the veldt the smaller beams moved up the hill toward carter moved past him curved back toward him he was encased in a wide spiral of green the spiral tightened the alien spacecraft vanished in the clouds the iron crab one minute with him is all i ask one minute alone with him while youre runnin for th priest an th doctor sean ocasey the plow and the stars the truck was an older ford club cab with a roomy area behind the backseat the space back there gave roger ideas he brooded the truck rattled and stank of manure but the seats were padded and softer than a motorcycle saddle a difference roger sorely appreciated snouts roger said harry why would they hide snouts al the way up here in bellingham beats me me too but theres a story in it one the people are entitled to know well maybe maybe a pulitzer prize roger mused robert redford and dustin hoffman harry said both with beards yeah look though theyve got guards on all the gates theres no way in maybe i can think of something i see the fine hand of colorado springs here ins no problem outs something different want to give it a try i guess so sure why not but how do we get in harry reddington i have a letter from mrs carlotta dawson for mrs linda gillespie in case you havent heard mrs dawson and i captured a snout in the kansas war that doesnt add up to a pass nobody in coloradosprings knows dick about passes harry said dawson did you catch the name dawson as in the poor schmuck up there on the snout ship i heard the speech the guard said whose side does he think hes on ours by god and hes the only spy weve got too from the sound of that indignant scream harry was about to deck the schmuck but his next words were almost calm and heres my id gas ration card even presidential commendation look heres the letter for linda gillespie harry said mrs general edmund gillespie i heard of her rogers heart pounded if they searched the truck if harry knew how serous this was hed never carry it off snout prisoners in washington state bullshit not a bad story because the snouts on the mother ship wouldnt drop a meteor on their own people and it would have to be concealed because the good citizens might rise to violence against snout prisoners but why confiscate the cbs something was happening here that would bring meteors if the snouts ever learned of it the cbs had to disappear bellingham had to vanish from the news and what if they found roger brooks of the capital post hidden in the back of a pickup truck there was a long silence with things happening but no way for roger to know what they were finally he heard the guard again okay mrs gillespie says to send you on down with your letter her house is downhill from the officers club thats the old university student union building ive marked it on this map just before you get to the officers club youll come to another guarded gate theyll be expecting you go straight there nowhere else when youve gone through that gate go directly to mrs gillespies house nowhere else here take this pass youll need it to get out come back through the same way you went in and end up back here nowhere else got all that yeahyou sure make it complicated wasnt us wanted you in here right thanks sergeant sure any time the truck started up after a while it stopped again okay you can come out for a minute harry said they were on a hillside off to the left was the harbor mist obscured water from waters edge there were outlines of ships like ghosts closer in there were big structures domes some on land some apparently floating on water further out in the hartx was the dim outline of a really big dome a rounded metallic shape lay in the dock area look like greenhouses to me harry said too much activity roger said look listen vehicle moved among the domes industrial soundsrivet guns pounding hammers the whine of electrical drillsdrifted up to them a thing like the shell of a huge metal crab covered several of the docks it was a slice of a spherecurved with curved edges like a section of a nuclear plant containment before the section were welded together curved and wedgeshaped and two yards thick if they were building a power plant here it would be the biggest ever he said aloud theres lots of work happening but its inside theyre not building those domes theyre built so what are they hiding inside the domes that piece of steel shell what does that have to do with anything not snouts well sure snouts but what do they have them working on slave labor we better get moving roger ducked back behind the seats it wasnt much of a house for a general to live in there was moss growing on the roof and it hadnt been painted in years what the hell do i do if they catch me harry demanded catch you what roger asked walking the streets harry theres a whole city here look out there a lot of uniforms a lot of civvies too act natural nobodyll know you dont belong here he glanced at his watch meet you here in an hour well all right roger waited until harry was out of sight down the street then he went up the steep stairway to the dilapidated wooden porch and knocked the door opened yesroger what in the world special delivery from carlotta she sends her best roger said arent you going to invite me in automatically she stepped aside roger closed the door behind him is ed here working he works all the time roger what are you doing here carrying carlottas mail roger thats silly well were touring the country getting stories on how people are living its not all just news im reporting back to colorado springs when i told carlotta i was coming to the northwest she said i should look you up roger had never felt less horny in his life but he did his best to leer at her you dont look glad to see me ed isnt in orbit this time roger and securityroger i dont know how hard they watch the housing but ed effectively owns this place roger youd be better off doing espionage for the snouts at four oclock there were crowds streaming out of the harbor area men women mostly dressed for work they spread outward through the gloomy afternoon drizzle they must live close harry thought they didnt seem to be making for parking lots these werent guards for snouts there were far too many the men were big loud dressed for durability even in their civvies and many still wore hard hats and coveralls heavy construction work types what in hell is going on half a dozen men a dozen more streamed toward a smallish building it wasnt labeled but harry suddenly knew a club a tavern a bar he contrived to emerge from between two buildings he strolled toward the bar trying to look thirsty as opposed to nervous the noise level was high a machineshriek could be heard through a hundred boisterous conversations that and a sound like an elephants scream but elaborated like a maniacs babbling too somewhere there was a snout harry ignored it for the moment nobody stopped him at the door the bar was two deep in customers and getting deeper harry eased into the crowd his hand came out of his pocket with money in a clip think priorities drink first talk second or ill look funny the hard hats were being stacked in piles near the door no problem that harry didnt have one he was dressed rough enough otherwise at the tables they were already chugging beer from the corner of his eye harry watched a big guy finish a pitcher what am i doing here order another drink a glass of that while the big round table was filling up around him that one would be loose enough already harry ordered a pitcher the bartender looked curiously a harrys money new in town huh he said yeah the change he gave back said federal reserve note northwestern grain project it was colored dull blue harry took the pitcher to the big table mind if i sit here all the same with me the big man had nearly white blond hair cut very short he was bigger than harry with huge hands that had been through the wars the voice was accented lots of them are southern southwestern not from up here why harry sat down next to him he pocketed his clip of colorado springs notes but not before the big man had seen it hell know im new here whitey lowenstein the burly man said you they call me hairy red lowenstein chuckled reckon they might what crew you with well yeah lowensteins grin was knowing youll get over that after a while the security systems ridiculous me im a welder he studied harry carefully bet you a pitcher i can figure out your job youre on harry remembered to drink lowenstein reached out suddenly to pat harrys breast pocket hmm no film badge maybe you pocketed it though clean clothes big guy you an educated man harry laughed school of hard knocks sure i got a feeling about you though all newcomers get the security lecture but you didnt say nothing youre an atomjack harry atomjack in a snout prison ill buy the next pitcher and lets leave it at that and what in hell is an atomjack an hour later he knew it wasnt difficult everyone in the bar knew somewhere in bellinghamnobody seemed to know or care exactly wherethere were more than a thousand atom bombs the atomjacks tended them a thousand fucking atom bombs youve got to get out of here roger i never thought id see the day when you started checking papers linda what is going on here believe me roger you dont want to know shes colder than a witchs tits jeez linda youre actually scaring me i hope so hed never heard her speak in that tone of voice what do you think ill do reveal the dark secret of the captured invaders dont you think ive figured it out she looked thoughtful i never thought you were stupid roger look linda for gods sake maybe i should just wait for ed to come home you wont be here that late linda i give up what do you want me to do i want you to go away and not come back you sure made that plain enough if its plain why havent you left linda damn all i came thousands of miles to see you uninvited uninvited but i havent always been unwelcome i know you dont love me but you can at least be friendly thats all over roger it isnt what i meant by friendly either roger sighed it was coming home to him with an impact he hadnt expected its over but theres something else here look i wanted to see you again but ive got a girl back in colorado springs i think im going to marry her i dont know why i wanted to see you first but i did does that make sense that got her iwho is she her name is rosalee linda you wont believe it i picked her up in a parking structure in kansas she laughed no i dont think i do believe that its true though and shes wonderful goddam she really is roger told her about kansas shes listening just like the enclave people listen not much news gets to bellingham roger told it long but paced the story so linda wouldnt get bored so thats rosalee and i guess im in love does she see through you roger better than you do i think you really should marry the girl linda said no the problem is to get you out of here ill call the gate roger fingered his beard with lindas call he could pass if reddington seated in a truck in the dark with a new shift guards no best wait for harry maybe harry would be outside already he glanced at his watch no not time enough have stall tell them reddington what couldnt give my right name and share a drink with me for old times sake maybe im a little ashamed of our old times roger maybe i am too some of them but not the real old times linda you didnt know ed then goddam i wish id married you would you if id asked yes you say that quickly i thought about it a lot are you sorry i didnt let me get you a drink roger good night

that much whiskey even if i did i didnt have that much myself goodbye roger roger went down the wooden stairs to the truck she sure was glad to see you harry i was hoping youd be back yeah lets get out of here sure learn anything his voice sounds thick can he drive naw damn he did get something what too bad i hoped youd be smart enough to pick up a clue i struck out she wasnt glad to see me yeah i saw here you pile in back behind the seat and well get going did she call the guards to get us out yes damn were both too stupid to get anything well maybe i got something harry said for one thing this is no prison really nope no guards lots of welders plumbers construction people but no guards you know what most of those guys are doing welding up a big hemispheric steel plate i mean big that was a piece of it we saw on the docks know something else theres a thousand atom bombs in this town bullshit no shit roger a thousand motherfucking atom bombs all identical they got special crews to work with them call them atomjacks a thousand atom bombs why atom bombs welders big steel plate atom bombs big hemispheric steel plate longburied memories surfaced freeman dyson and ted taylor lectures at a meeting of the l society that bunch of fanatics who wanted to put colonies into space steel plates and atom bombs and a whole moon colony comes down in one piece dont worry about the landing spot because itll be flat when you get down christ on a crutch what harry took the keys from his pocket and climbed into the drivers seat nothing they let people in but if they search on the way out roger waited until harrys attention was fully on the truck then he took the big jack handle from the floor of the cab and rose silently reddington the guard said roger sighed in relief as hed thought this was a new one not the one whod passed harry into bellingham the guard shined his flashlight onto rogers face roger clenched his eyes against the light distorting his face sorry mind moving that blanket sure roger turned from the light twisting to lift the blanket from over the space behind the seat id have been just there the guard was thorough he looked behind the seats and under the truck he inspected the pass he looked at his clipboax notes and compared times but he was polite enough not to shine the light in rogers eye again harry woke in a barewalled office he was lying on a cot two air police sat at a desk across the room when harry groaned and opened his eyes one of the aps went out the door what the hell harry demanded he got no answer at all the ap didnt smile or get up or d anything at all presently the door opened the first ap came in with a mat in us air force coveralls four stars gleamed from the shoulders thank you airman the general said he turned his attention to harry all right mr reddington would you care to tell us whats going on here surehey youre general gillespie harry had watched tv coverage of the last shuttle launch a lifetime ago gillespie looked many years older he said thats obvious enough now who are you you said my name mister you have about twenty seconds to start explaining oh shit general could you make that a minute im just getting used to the idea that roger whacked me on the head roger roger brooks sir roger brooks shit fire that name registered i take it that the man who left this post using your credentials was roger brooks then yes sir and you and brooks came to see mrs gillespie i take it that was rogers idea sure didnt do him any good though what do you mean by that she threw him out i see shit what have i got into your minute is up reddington yes sir look it started in colorado springs actually it started earlier talk fast harry babbled how congressman wes left harry in charge of his house how harry and carlotta dawson had captured a snout and harry got a presidential citation and a gas ration card later gillespie interrupted dammit general im telling you the truth oddly enough i believe you for now though i have a different question where has roger brooks gone the enclave looked normal no one near the gate but miranda shakes roger drove up carefully he was tempted to drive on past take the logging trail and fire roads that led to the nooksack valley and continue east past mount baker great idea one problem harry knows about those fire roads hell tell even if harry wouldnt tell about the route east the truck would never get to colorado springs the motorcycle would emotions chased their way through rogers mind ive got a secret a big secret the biggest ever wow no wonder they made bellingham vanish orion if they catch me theyll lock me up until the wars over i need insurance theres only one kind of insurance that can work i have to tell an editor now quick so the post will keep looking for me if they try to hide me somewhere great plan one problem no telephones no radios not even a cb how am i going to tell the post if i cant tell the post who can i tell hello roger miranda shakes said wheres harry trying to pick up some supplies ill take the bike down to meet him and then well move on heres the truck key where to back to colorado springs i have to get moving harry can wake up any minute is something wrong roger huh no its just a long ride back im not looking forward to it their packs stood next to the motorcycle it took only a moment to lift them onto the rack and lash them in place and now what if they catch methey could do anything what will i do if i get away damn its a big story the biggest too big like finding out about the atombomb before they dropped it on japan cant print it cant let the snouts find out but but people have to know have to know theres hope so man doesnt give up think theres no chance they have to know then is a chance how how to tell people but not snouts there has to be way it wont happen if they catch me theyll lock me up secrets security theyve made this whole town a prison theres too good a chance theyll catch me and just make me vanish an unperson i need insurance maybe i need something else too maybe i need help getting out of bellingham is fox around in the greenhouse john fox if theres anybody who can get out of bellingham and back to the springs its fox he has friends everywhere jus telling him can be good insurance there was something reassuring in the smell of the greenhouse it smelled like life a green and brown smell plants and rich dirt growth and decay john fox didnt turn as roger came up behind him he was even thinner than roger remembered the chamois shirt and lederhosen hung from bones and long hard muscles he was pulling smaller sprouts from a tray leaving the largest have to transfer these in a few days he said john wha roger whats news and he chuckled the navys got a thousand atom bombs in the harbor complex fox turned stared into rogers face you went in yeah a thousand atom bombs all exactly alike and theyre making an enormous steel hemisphere ed gillespie is running it all thousands of workmen and theyre all welders or atomjacks what does that mean to you orion a smile flickered then died theyre building an orion yeah and launching an orion john a thousand bombs going off one by one under that plate i seem to remember you like preserving the environment can you imagine what thatll do to bellingham fox nodded his eyes seemed curiously unfocused youre going to publish publish im telling you at least the enclave can get their heads down when it happens but what about bellingham shouldnt they know fox was still nodding and who else that was the sticking point john im not totally sure maybe theres no way to tell the people and keep it from the snouts the navys right about that the snouts cant learn they cant take their cbs away from the whole country at the same time youll think of something fox lashed out roger was doubled over something huge and heavy had tried to drive itself through his solar plexus and the spine behind it through a haze of pain he tried to sense to orient fox had hit him his bony elbow was crooked around rogers neck squeezing roger could barely breathe they were walking the pressure constricted his voice to a whisper i only wanted to tell you you i hadnt decided anything else john let fox released a hand to push a door open roger thrashed the elbow tightened oh god fox was strong i know you fox said you want that pulitzer prize youd publish youd tell the aliens yourself if that was the only way to get it out they were bending over foxs weight pushing him down face down into water roger got his hands on a cool hard surface and pushed up the porcelain rim of a toilet he was drowning in a toilet and he couldnt get his face high enough and the strength was leaking out of him while the urge to breathe grew to agony i hadnt decided i hadnt decided prayers hear now this o foolish people and without understanding which have eyes and see not which have ears and hear not jeremiah countdown ten months after footfall digit ship fortynine carried vitamins for the human fithp stock of plants and frozen meat for analysis seeds and small animal and an infant elephant and three spaceborn warriors returning for the mating season chintithpitmang arrived to find himself summoned to the funeral pit who had died the airlock guard who gave him his order hadnt known he had aborted his time with shreshleemang he had gone down to the war of winterhome ahead of mating season he had been out of contact and the scent of mating was in the air but chintithpitmang felt only fear who had died while he was gone a small delay could hardly matter chintithpitmang passed through the garden on his way to the funeral pit it was not as he had expected the garden was small cramped the single thriving pillar plant seemed a pitiful reminder that once the traveler fithp had known jungles chintithpitmang had fought in jungles bigger than message bearer his own reactions shocked him he hastened through the garden and into the leavetaking room that half circled the funeral pit it smelled of winterhome a crowd was waiting or so it seemed and one of the crowd was shreshleemang he said mang his mate did not respond there were eyes on him herdmaster pastempehkeph kturfookeph fookerteh a female he didnt know breaker raztupispminz and a human chintithpitmang recognized he asked who is dead fathistehtulk said the herdmaster i have taken the task of learning how he died chintithpitznang you returned from the first battle on winterhome with digit ship six i did what did you do then i turned my cargo and prisoners over to another octuple then i went to see my mate shreshleemang when did your mate reach you twoeighths of a day after digit ship six coupled aft said shreshleemang above the smell of the funeral pit he found her special scent she was in season but her voice was cold as winter the herdmaster asked what delayed you chintithpitmang i was interrupted in what fashion chintithpitmang was afraid to speak the herdmaster blew softly vexed on your way to see your mate for the first time in eightsquareds of days what could have interrupted you a fi high in status or with an urgent mission or allied with your own dissident movement you were intercepted by advisor fathistehtulk this was going to be very bad chintithpitmang saw nothing for it but to tell as much of the truth as he must we met in the corridors he demanded that i go with him where why why he did not say we went to the mudroom it had been thawed he said cold it would be uncomfortable for us it might freeze my guest chintithpitmang i insisted that my contact come alone and he demanded that i do the same though he is a slave i said what is he then a rogue and then i knew he was to meet a human he said i want to question him i think he has much to tell me about the uses of space he surely has motive to be convincing when i speak of this meeting to the year zero fithp i dont want to depend on my unsupported word you must witness unseen i stayed near the far end of the mudroom hidden from the grill by the curve of the ceiling the human was behind the grill i listened herdmaster i hate and fear humans but this one said things i have always believed he knew more of the wealth of the spaces between worlds than we have guessed he spoke of marvelous dreams of asteroid mines of towers that would take loot from world to beyond orbit he told the advisor that the dissidents were right i am not amazed said the herdmaster suddenly the grill came flying out and struck fathistehtulk a stunning blow the human came after it kicked at fathistehtulk and leaped back into the duct what did the advisor say he said nothing he leapt after the human to punish pause what upset the human it had what it wanted you were there to witness exactly what did the advisor say that so enraged a surrendered human trapped after what he had done lying to the herdmaster would be a trivial crime but what did the herdmaster already know the herdmasters accusation rolled forth you confronted me in the garden to tell me that humans are a terrible enemy that we should turn our backs on them after one day aboard message bearer you volunteered to return to winterhome you fought well chintithpitmang what was here that you feared more than the war what were you afraid that a fi might ask what did fathistehtulk say to the human it was impossible fathistehtulk said that descendants of the human prisoners would serve the traveler herd in space with their smaller food requirements and dexterous digits and their greater knowledge of the worlds of winterhomelight was this what enraged the human it was would you recognize this human again it was him that one the herdmaster turned wes dawson did you speak to my advisor a second time the man said wesley dawson congressman chintithpitmang saw you did you see him the man was silent the line you were given for cleaning the ducts we found its mark deep in fathistehtulks snnfp still he was silent the herdmaster said you must speak i dont think so chintithpitmang why didnt you help the advisor i was stunned did it cross your thoughts that the advisor would say things you didnt want heard no my mind had not moved at all i knew so little of humans then a surrendered prisoner attacked a fi of the herd stunned speak further fathistehtulk went after him i thought he was reaching for the human to scoop him out and kill him but it went on too long and i tried to think what to do and then fathistehtulk was pushed out into the mudroom he was dead and you i looked into the duct i pulled the grill out and looked again there wasnt anything i put the grill back i couldnt find the twist fasteners i took the line off fathistehtulks snnfp and pushed him into the mud until he was completely covered then i left i went to the emergency control room and set the mudroom to freeze again why what the human said he might say again if we caught him pfoo you were stunned from the way the advisor reacted dont you think even a human might learn a lesson youve been on winterhome you know theyre bright next time he would say weve certainly wondered if there might be things in space worth having the meteors lead us to think that there are allmetal asteroids and ice strata and air bound loosely in rock but we have not looked well i didnt think of it i think you have lied you shall be isolated none shall speak to you henceforth if you have more to tell me tell a guard the females eyes were fixed on chintithpitmang and he cringed he tried mang and then shreshleemang turned away the herdmaster had already forgotten him dawson we kill rogues the rogue human said we kill murderers ourselves or else we imprison them when a fithp conspires to murder we may kill them all or not it depends on their grievance did you act alone in this alone of course i was alone you had kept me isolated for a week and did you tell others afterward wesley dawson congressman you shall be imprisoned alone none shall speak to you if you have more to say tell a guard the herdmaster watched them being led away he had toyed with the notion of imprisoning them together but chintithpitma would surely kill the man pastempehkeph wanted more than that why had dawson done what he did was there no strategy that would hold a humans surrender to exterminate an intelligent race really would make the traveler fithp equal to the predecessors godlike criminals for all history the priests had taught the fithp children the words of the squuff thuktun it told the tale of the homeworlds ruin many mistakes are mapped here that you may walk around them isolation would break dawson soon enough it would take longer with humans no matter there was time and he must be studied let him be only a rogue a rarity otherwise chowpeentulk stood proud victorious but the victory here was pastempehkephs her mate had died because he rejected the dissident cause she would talk the dissidents were broken now they would never again stand between winterhome and the traveler fithp something had changed in tashayamp she visited the human cell less and less frequently she rarely talked to them the morning after john woodward died she appeared in the spin hatch and looked down without curiosity and was already backing out when jeri called up to her tashayamp john woodward is dead he died in the night tashayamp the teachers mate peered down at the little group clustered around carrie woodward and johns body all alone i thought he sleeps he looks like he sleeps wait tashayamp disappeared tashayamp was quite wrong johns face was slack his eye were open he wasnt breathing how could anyone have missed the presence of death fithp soldiers descended via the lift platform carrie was huddled with her face between her knees the children hung back they didnt know how to help when the warriors wrapped digits around johns shoulder and ankles carrie surged to her feet and stood rigid while they put him on the platform and sent him up the warriors rose after him tashayamp looked down how did he die there was venom in carries answer slowly weeks now hes been getting sicker and sicker he couldnt handle the gravity changes he couldnt sleep right you werent giving him the right vitamins we dont have a doctor being penned like an animal knowing youre smashing our world he couldnt take it now hes dead you come tashayamp said all tashayamp led them toward the axis via spiral ramps by the time they reached the funeral room they were nearly weightless above their heads beyond a glass ceiling a dark slush was in queasy churning motion the stink of it permeated the air two fithp awaited them the bull and the priest the russians were quiet they appeared resigned jeri knew that was how they wanted to appear but what else can we do anyway we will not escape without outside help and no one is going to help us here were all of humanity for twenty thousand miles around save for wes dawson alice was edgy her eyes kept straying to the entrances as if she expected him to appear wes had disappeared over a week ago none of the fithp would speak of him to the humans seeing him absent jeri at last believed that he was dead she moved to rest a hand on carries shoulder howre you holding up ill manage carrie laughed a cracked joyless sound none of us dares go crazy theyd leave us all together wouldnt they wed all go off our heads one by one dont look at me like that alice im all right fistartehthuktun said something to the herdmaster too fast to catch the herdmaster nodded at tashayamp who said query does fistartehthuktun speak last words for john woodward query does one of you speak theres no preacher melissa said mom i dont know jeri began carrie stepped forward jerkily ill do it ive been to enough funerals to know the words he was my husband jeri was close enough to catch the herdmasters words to tashayamp do not translate but remember through the glass she watched two fithp emerge on the lip of the funeral pit carrying john woodward like a sack of grain between them i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin won destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god whom i shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another the fithp soldiers launched woodward toward the center of the vortex of brown muck he moved slowly tumbling stiff with rigor mortis carrie stopped the look on her face was dreadful remember this good man lord remember him and bring him to your peace bring him to rest in your arms let him go to jesus an emptyeyed skull showed through the slowly churning compost heap it was almost conical an animals skull with knots where the tendons of the trunk had been anchored jeri ground her teeth with the need to get out of here before john woodward brushed against the glass carrie must be hanging on to her sanity by her teeth yet she looked and sounded as calm as any early christian about to face neros lions the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of rightousness for his names sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy stall they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord for ever she turned toward the fithp aging but ageless a woman of farms and fields you cant hurt him now hes in the arms of jesus she raised her hands high deliver me from mine enemies o god defend me from them that rise up against me deliver me from the wicked doers stand up arise awake o holy one of israel and be not merciful unto them that offend these little ones i say it were better that a millstone were tied about their necks and they were cast into the sea thou lord shall have them in scorn consume them in thy wrath consume them that they may perish and know that it is god that ruleth unto the ends of the world she fell silent what will they do they cant be afraid of curses god my god have you forsaken all of us are you there are you listening can you listen tashayamp waited god let us out of here return to your place tashayamp told them follow the guards she herself departed with the bull and the priest eat them rage and eat them that they will die and know that god leads everywhere thats as near as i can translate tashayamp finished you see fistartehthuktun trumpeted of course we might have learned something by dissecting the creature but this we would have lost we have never before witnessed such a ceremony and what do you think you have learned i was wrong said the priest despite their shape they are not totally alien we can lead them herdmaster do you see it they have no predecessors none lead them they must lead themselves they have made for themselves the fiction of a predecessor pastempehkeph signaled assent it must be a fiction this god would hardly have tolerated our incursions i wonder how they see him does their god have thumbs and they give him male gender i cannot make myself care they seek a leader greater than themselves tashayamp did you render that phrase accurately fear god i think so we have a book of words from kansas i will examine fear they had reached the bridge the warrior on duty covered his head herdmaster a message chintithpitmang wishes to spea to you i hear we shall be their predecessors fistartehthuktun said i must learn more i wish i could go down to africa you may not we need you here get your data from takpussehyamp tashayamp is your mate easily distracted but at your service tashayamp said an the mating scent thickened in the air the herdmaster left them there the bridge was busy some site in africa was about to get a consignment of meteors the herdmaster settled onto his pad and tapped at the console chintithpitmang was a brown ball in the center of his cell the herdmaster watched him for a bit huddled in his misery he might have been asleep but for his nostril and digits which moved restlessly as if they had independent life eight days give him credit thats a toughminded fi the herdmaster said softly chintithpitmang speak to me the fi started convulsively he looked toward the camera herdmaster i will speak to the dissidents you have done so i recorded our last conversation and broadcast it what would you tell them fathistehtulk said that human help would be beyond price in the conquest of space with their ambitious plans and their smaller food intake and dexterous digits winterhome must be conquered and the humans broken into the traveler herd this is what you said an eightday past what have you to add you should have helped fathistehtulk herdmaster i would have joined the argument against the advisor the human attacked first you let him die he would have destroyed the dissident cause he has you have no other to speak for you why did you hide the corpse chintithpitmangs digits were tight across his skull as if welded i was in shock the advisor betrayed us if the human were caught he might repeat fathistehtulks words dawson holds his peace better than you have you werent trying to protect dawson must i return you to the silence of your cell i heard a snoring sound when a breaths or so after the human left the advisor for dead i still didnt know what to do so i did nothing i heard a snoring sound i turned and his chest was heaving speak further i knew what hed say the dissidents we would have i pushed his face in the mud i pushed mud in his mouth the snonng stopped i pushed him the rest of the way it was whas the herdmaster had expected to hear yet he had hoped what shall i do with you now chintithpitmang i cannot have you loose in message bearer kill me gather the herd as tradition requires we are roguish enough these days i cannot order my fithp to trample you and expect them to stop short of riot besides too many owe you their lives or their mates lives the attackmaster regrets your absence chintithpitmang will you return to africa to fight yes if i am allowed you are sent not allowed forever chintithpitmang i can grasp the pressures that made you rogue but if such happens again you will be trampled the herdmaster tapped at keys and that is well done chintithpitmang will serve us well i will send down others of the year zero fithp let them make amends in africa he tapped more keys the picture changed wes dawson was running nowhere pastempehkeph watched for a bit dawson ran legs pumping making no progress forelimbs pumping in rhythm though they never touched the ground was he already mad did he dream that he chased a fleeing meat animal or that something chased him wes dawson dawson turned as he ran to face the camera he said nothing the desperate longing to hear anothers voice might have been present but the herdmaster saw no trace of it he said chintithpitmang tells me that he killed the advisor fathistehtulk was still alive when you released him dawsons mouth twitched upward at the corners in fair fithp he said i do it better next time pastempehkeph turned off the screen just whose mind was being broken by this treatment spinward around the curve of the mudroom there were the sounds of splashing and softtrumpeted gossip shreshleemang ignored it her status had become uncertain when her mates confession was broadcast this was an embarrassment to her friends these days they avoided her shreshleemang understood this and resented it nonetheless she could do nothing about it she lolled in the mud with eyes half closed she grew aware of others gathering around her they rested in the mud quiet but she could feel their eyes when it became clear that they would not go away she said i remember a time when the mudroom was a refuge from the days cares there was never such a time said chowpeentulk the mudroom has forever been a pond of politics shreshleemang looked up chowpeentulk and kturfookeph seemed to be coolly studying her kturfookeph said your mate is not to be trampled he will be returned to africa he told me himself he has already departed shreshleemang you should join him shreshleemang surged from the mud with the greatest effort she managed to curb her bellow the herdmaster may send me where he wills have you come as his emissary no you are a mated female of the traveler herd with no stain on your character will you listen she sank back i will he needs you males go rogue far more easily without a mate to steady them chintithpitmang lives close against that barrier yes for he has crossed it africa is being conquered but there remain many human rogues in the pacified territory effective warriors are needed chintithpitmang is one of the best but the jungle hunters live under terrible strain often they hunt alone as if already rogue unmated chintithpitmang will be rogue within a days mated he can be an effective leader yes he needs me he has destroyed the dissident cause he has humiliated me personally do i need him chowpeentulk said unmated females go rogue too nonsense we show it differently we do not go on killing sprees but we often develop a distaste for males and for children we play dominance games instead of cooperating with our fithp what are you doing here chowpeentulk what is your interest did you want my mate trampled no i am widowed at my age it is certain that i will never mate again the war kills males particularly unmated males my interest now lies with my children and the traveler fithp the traveler fithp needs your mate sane if you knew how i feel about him you might send me down in order to punish your mates murderer you were dissident too i was and am the traveler fithp owned the stars and planets before ever we saw the shape of the prey we dont need them kturfookeph spoke softly there is no dissident fithp the matter has been decided consented by the new advisor accepted by fistartehthuktun winterhome will be ours the danger of leaving it for the humans is too great fathistehtulk found a true path nothing tried to kill us when we circled the gas giant kturfookeph stood silent chowpeentulk spoke in a voice like falling water shreshleemang did you advise your mate to exercise proper restraint in his efforts for the dissident cause proper restraint we she stopped restraint is the thuktun of females males dont understand restraint chintithpitmang would do anything to advance the dissidents he proved that males need their mates to protect them from such folly he was fighting in kansas far beyond my reach my mate made a mistake there kturfookeph acknowledged the year zero herd were a working fithp separating them drove some toward rogue status just when they were facing a madly alien environment but do you not share blame you will not drive me from the ship said shreshleemang females dont normally fight but she was ready we would not drive you kturfookeph said i will not go to live on winterhome forever what would i do there there is much to do we have a world to hold a new species to bring into the traveler fithp your mate is there many of the year zero will be sent there another spoke from behind kturfookeph once the many fithp was great now there are few if you die childless there will be fewer still shreshleemang had not noticed flarishmangs approach her own greataunt shreshleemangs anger rose at being reproved as a childless sleeper but they werent giving her time to answer the females were gathering round her like a wet brown wall chowpeentulk said your mate will go rogue again it will be remembered that he committed murder while you were present to advise him you will be blamed no male will risk your company you will remain unmated and childless your friends will gather to comfort you of course wont they perhaps not and you will grow old held within the womb of message bearer while others carve our future across the face of winterhome chowpeentulks voice had risen to a bellow do you really think i seek vengeance against whom if your mate went mad who failed to pull him back it was known that digit ship six was arriving why did you not meet him at the airlock i will go where were you i was busy cease i will join my mate in africa we will conquer the human fithp and bind them to us history may judge the result the silvertongued devils and how can man die better than facing fearful odds for the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his gods thomas rabington lord macaulay horatius countdown ten months after footfall the eyesearing light died harry tipped back the welders mask good work he ran his hand along the gridwork now they can put the electrical stuff in his companion grunted what the hell is this narrow rails ran straight down to an opening in the cylinder within which they worked and ended above the floor launching rails harry said look they got these things they call spurt bombs i dont know how they work but when an atom bomb goes off near one of them the thing sort of curls up and dies and when it dies it shoots off a really strong gammaray laser beam what we have here is a gizmo to throw the spurt bombs out where they can soak up some of the energy from the bombs that move this ship how do they aim them black magic hell i dont know all i know is they have to be thrown out and were building the gizmo that does that okay the welder gestured toward the tangle of wires and pipes surrounding them christ this whole ship is one big kludge yeah more all the time too i guess anyway all we have to do now is get out of here harry led the way into the empty bay the spurt bombs were big the nests for them were ten feet tall and a foot across harry climbed a ladder slid sideways through spurt bomb nests and emerged through an unwelded hatch onto the hemispherical slop of the shell the shock absorbers rose above them holding nothing the brick the section that would house men and spacecraft hadnt been mounted yet there were four spurt bomb bays the pair of drive bomb bays were far larger conveyors and a pair of cannon already in place would lead the propulsion bombs under the rim of the shell and fire them into the focus it was all welded to the shell itself six towers rising around a steel forest of shock absorbers and it was all as massive as any freighter nothing delicate about michael a catwalk took them down the shell to the concrete floor beats me how you find your way around whitey lowenstein took off the welders mask and cap ten minutes to quitting time beer ill join you if i can the chuckanut was crowded but whitey had saved a corner booth he had two girls with him harry sank into the booth gratefully and waved for a pitcher wed about given you up lowenstein said you remember pat he took pats hand and held it and thats janet what kept you rohrs wanted to go over some stuff hi pat nice to meet you janet what do you do for the project pats a clerk janet said im a welder like whitey tough job she didnt look big enough either i can handle it janet said whitey watched harry chug a large glass refill it and chug again okay harry i give up ive seen you carrying general gillespies briefcase ive heard your stories about kansas and i even believe them but then ive seen you sweeping floors i watched you connect up electrical lines today you show me where to weld that rail thing and then youre in a conference with rohrs for an hour after quitting time harry just what in hell are you harry laughed youd never guess in a

longer though no i guess not we still have to mount the brick on the shell and the shuttles on the brick i wish there was more than just one way to test those shock absorbers how are they launch what else is big enough for them christ the ships just full of kludgedup stuff its all we can do to get all the kludges put down on the drawings i sure feel sorry for anybody who has to fix this sucker you maybe harry laughed sardonically not me he broke into song you can call out your mother your sister or your brother but for christs sakes dont call me they wont call your sister janet said no women on the flight crew at all yeah i know harry said matter of fact i know most of the crew nice cleancut young men mens right janet said and its not fair oh come on pat said janet you have to be crazy why would anybody want to go up with that well they could ask its gillespie harry said he says women arent strong enough stupid janet said it doesnt have to be the truth look those idealistic young men are supposed to be fixing what the snouts shoot gillespie may not want them rescuing idealistic young women instead if you follow me anyway they dont want you they dont want me either what would either one of us do i learned to do a lot of things when i hung around with the bikers little welding electrical stuff this and that so thats what i do this and that whitey you owe me a pitcher the dreamers workroom was a chaos of tables blackboards maps papers and personal computers one of the tables had been cleared of all such junk a cloth was thrown over it and an impressive array of bottles glasses mixers and ice stood there jack clybourne had the bourbon jenny held out her glass for a refill it was the ancient persians its in hherodotus sherry atkinson wanted to talk faster than her memory would serve her and it caused a stutter there have been plenty of cultures that wouldnt implement a decision theyd taken when drunk until theyd discussed it sober only the persians wouldnt do anything theyd decided sober until theyd discussed it drunk she poured herself another large glass of white wine and drank half of it her colleagues nodded in sage agreement interesting philosophy reynolds said carol laughed she was enjoying her role as the only fan in an endless sciencefiction convention we can discuss it all to death the problem is we dont have any decisions curtis muttered not a goddam thing we can do but wait he was working on his fourth tall drink his wife had long since gone to bed in disgust volunteer for africa if youre so eager to fight sherry said curtis laughed and poured another drink hah he jerked his thumb toward jenny the colonel there is the only one they let out of here they dont let me anywhere near africa jenny was about to say something else but the door opened admiral carrell came in it took jenny a moment for that to register through the bourbon then she jumped to her feet after a moment jack clybourne stood as well curtis looked at carrell then pointedly looked at his watch off duty admiral but we could sober up in a hurry something were needed for i hope not really this is a social visit may i come in curtis looked up and down the table i see no objections come in this is liberty hall you can spit on the mat and call the cat a bastard whatll you drink scotch thank you and dont drown it carrell sat heavily at the table then raised his glass cheers the others responded hope theres something to be cheerful about curtis said very little im afraid angola just surrendered and were pretty sure zaire will when their eightday ultimatum is up joe ransom took a globe from another table and set it on theirs idly he spun it south africa botswana lesotho mozambique zimbabwe angola when zaire goes theyll have just about everything to the equator there was a sizable cuban mercenary army in angola curtis mused yes theyll work for the invaders now admiral carrell said divide and rule sherry said surrender with conditions ransom said they do learn learn too damn fast curtis agreed i dont know reynolds poured another drink what did you think of the message they sent last week not a lot curtis said wade if you knew just how alien the whole idea of surrender terms is to them sherry said carol laughed alien she chuckled sure it shocked harpanet curtis said so theyve got themselves a ruth benedict eh clybourne asked ruth fulton benedict sherry explained anthropologist she tried to explain japanese culture to the us war department in world war ii howd she do jack asked pretty good trouble was there wasnt much anybody could do with the information curtis added theyve done something with theirs sherry said governments surrender and now theyve got human diplomats talking to other governments and some of their tame politicians broadcasting to the rest of the world like lord haw haw ransom said what gets me is some of the bastards buy it curtis said sticks and carrots jenny blurted three large bourbons had left her lightheaded theyve taken to promising electricity from space industrialization powered from space satellites all you have to do is surrender a big deal for the undeveloped countries reynolds said it could be a big deal for us one of these days ransom said how far are we from being an undeveloped country and getting closer all the time reynolds agreed there had been no more big rocks since the foot but innumerable smaller ones still fell their targets were carefully chosen although there was a random element to the bombardment transportation factories crossroads big ocean vessels you never knew what would be hit or when america was slowly becoming a looseknit chain of semiindependent feudalities and there was nothing you could do about it they hit another one today jenny said in chicago an eighteenwheeler truck carrying military uniforms moving about a block from a hospital two blocks from a big grain elevator the center of the crater was fifteen feet from the truck shredded it of course showoffs reynolds said impressive though ransom said perhaps what we need is another pep talk admiral carrell said the president too whats depressing is the stories we get out of africa there are people in their puppet governments who like the way things are quislings curtis said vidkun quisling was an ideologic convert to the nazis yeah but whats attractive about the snouts why would anybody want them in charge clybourne demanded africas so divided you can find a group to cooperate with anything if it will put them on top ransom said unity sherry said theyll unite us even if it kills us reynolds finished heres to unity sherry lifted her glass in a toast curtis raised a clenched fist and sang offkey and the internationale unites the human race reynolds leaped on it more than the human race all the sapient races thinkers of the galaxy unite you have nothing i lose but your chains down with arboreal chauvinism sherry shouted and you want these guys to cheer up the president jack clybournes voice was dull and serious in the general laughter they dont care who wins hey ransom protested you didnt see it clybourne said i did a huge cargo barge stuffed full of people just ordinary people from kansas men women kids dogs dolls all mashed into jelly if youd see it you wouldnt talk like this weve seen it joe ransom said theyve seen your ship carol said your ship and the bodies in kansas theyve all of them seen all of that films if youd been there if youd smelled it youd hate the snouts with your minds and guts come off it curtis said hey were all on the same side carol said come on have a drink maybe weve all had too much sherry said you dont really think well surrender ransom asked i wont clybourne said well we wont either our problem is that were in here outside we might have something to do some way to help rebuild the country in here were useless they also serve curtis muttered who only stand and wait thats our problem jack were supposed to plan for failure what can we do if archangel doesnt work and every damn one of us knows that archangel is it damn right all our eggs are in that basket there isnt another basket and there wont be more eggs so here we sit waiting and the longer we wait ransom said the longer it takes to finish archangel the better the chances the snouts will find out about it or drop a rock on bellingham for the pure hell of it he raised his glass heres to you mr clybourne i just hope you got all the cbs theres another problem admiral carrell said yeah that message inviting us to discuss surrender terms it was received here fine so ransom prompted jenny felt the beginnings of a chill at the base of her spine it wasnt heard ten miles away admiral carrell said tightbeam reynolds said tightbeam direct to here curtis added it took you a week to find out direct to here clybourne looked puzzled a message for the president sent here and nowhere else ransom said weve got to get the president out of here clybourne shouted in due time admiral carrell said however they got their information quislings curtis muttered perhaps however they learned they have had a week and more to act on their knowledge they have not done so but were safe here carol protested arent we against what curtis demanded nothings safe from another foot they wont do that sherry protested how do you know clybourne demanded harpanet they dont attack the top leadership of a herd if humans surrender which we wont ransom said he raised his glass curtis clinked glasses with him if we did sherry continued the president would probably become a high official an advisor to their herdmaster its the way they work they wont kill the president if they can help it it would be like starting a court trial by shooting the other fellows lawyer they just dont do things that way they dont offer conditional surrender terms either curtis said theyre learning this was the heart of michael the bridge looked like an unfinished star trek movie set around the walls were large viewscreens and control consoles with acceleration couches made of webbing at each station and two large command chairs in the center scattered through it all were wooden desks tables and drafting tables nearly all covered with blueprints some of the wall screens were split blueprint at the bottom and camera view of that area at the top as harry watched one of the screens flashed and a new drawing appeared at its bottom done by god max rohrs stood harry break out the champagne right on general gillespie rose from his seat at one of the wooden desks are we really done max well ed we both know this ship wont ever be finished well be making changes right up to launch time but yeah were done you can tell the president that as of tomorrow noon we can launch on twentyfour hours notice harry retrieved champagne from a small portable refrigerator it would have to go along with the desks and tables and file cabinets it was good champagne mums there were a dozen crystal glasses in the refrigerator too how many glasses general harry asked three just now gillespie said harry worried the cork out and let it fly to the ceiling he poured and handed glasses out then lifted one a willing foe and sea room gillespie made a face id as soon the snouts werent willing at all i just want to win max rohrs said ed weve just worked a miracle he went over to the calendar and drew a ring around the date a real live one hundred percent miracle he lifted his glass so god bless us theres none like us you too harry you were a damn big help thanks gillespie poured harrys glass full again lot to do yet gillespie said first we have to bring in the ferryboats tomorrow morning well send all the dependents and everybody but the launch and flight crews over to port angeles harry dropped into one of the command chairs dodging tv screens what about the rest of bellingham we wait on that one yeah if the snouts see theres nobody here going to be tough though what do we do we dont do anything gillespie said well give the sheriff as much notice as we can you dont need to worry harry weve got speedboats for the lastminute crew sure how far away would you have to be a couple of miles if you have shelter at hiroshima the damage at five miles wasnt too bad of course were setting off a lot more than one bomb gillespie drained his glass of course the safest place is in the ship max rohrs said thatll be all military people well but some will be more military than others rohrs said im going you harry almost laughed max didnt laugh yes chief warrant officer maximilian rohrs damage control officer at your service who else knows as much about the way this ship is put together well harry does ed gillespie said hey wait a minute he does doesnt he rohrs came over and clapped harry on the shoulder dont i remember you doing some entertaining in the chuckanut something about it wasnt your regular line of work your regular work was hero something like that gillespie agreed so want to take up your regular occupation again harry tried to stand up but rohrs heavy hand was on his shoulder now hear this i am not an astronaut neither am i max rohrs said i didnt tell you to go and max you and the general designed this ship if have some more champagne harry a pleasure look ive met most of the crew youre not really filling it out at the last second are you no i thought this over fairly carefully general gillespie said what is it that those kids dont know that stuff shouldnt be allowed to get warm harry harry drank gillespie said they know the ship they know whats most likely to happen to it theyre dedicated they know how to be tired and hurting and still keep going because we taught them that pretty much the same way i was taught but harry it was us making them hurt and they knew we could make it harry you had a back problem you got yourself a book of back exercises and you used it while you crossed the country on a motorcycle and got beat up on by the fithp and lost two women and you still kept going and all to keep a promise and you hadnt even promised to do that i want my dedicated astronauts and want you too i dont know wholl fall apart up there and what is it i want harry inquired politely the general half closed his eyes he seemed in no hurry to answer rohrs finished his glass and poured again he was watching the screens the screens hadnt changed in several minutes one from a camera on the dome wall showed michael in full two great towers stood on the curve of the hemispherical shell with cannon showing beneath the lip aimed inward four smaller towers flanked them a brickshaped structure rose above them the brick was much less massive than the shell but its sides were covered with spacecraft tiny gunships and four shuttles with tanks but no boosters the bricks massive roof ran beyond the flanks to shield the shuttles and gunships rohrs said the biggest spaceship ever built by man done by god and im done too harry said gillespie said if we win this if well kill a lot of snouts and the rest will surrender thousands of snouts all trying to join what our threat team has started calling the climbing fithp thousands of snouts sane snouts mostly all learning to be human who will want to learn the name of the man who first captured a snout pour me some more of that said harry thy dastardly doings are past neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the lords wrath zephaniah a fire devoureth before them and behind them a flame burneth joel countdown m hour jenny winked at jack then went into the balcony office the situation room down below was crowded every console held a group all the regular dutycrew plus most of the threat team and anyone else who could think of a good reason to be there come in colonel admiral carrell said your station is here he indicated a table facing the big screens beyond the glass wall the table held a small switchboard and computer terminal jenny put on the headset with its microphone and single headphone and pushed buttons operations colonel walters control here communications test roger i read you five by five another button dreamer fithp here a voice said control here communications test fine she pushed other buttons finally she nodded to admiral carrell communications checked out sir the link with michael has a lot of static it will probably get worse all right carrell went to the door mr clybourne please tell the president that everything is ready and he can join us whenever he likes colonel begin operation moby dick yes sir jenny touched another button on the floor below a siren wailed and red lights flashed harpoon this is gimlet let fly they could hear the cheers through the glass wall then the situation room fell silent crews hunched over consoles one of the situation screens showed the locations of the invader mother ship and all the digit ships they could locate the mother ship and sixteen digit ships were in geosync over africa they posed no danger yet the moon was just setting snout installations there would see nothing africa was wrapped in night for whatever it was worth the invaders would start from their sleep to find themselves attacked eight digit ships were in twelvehour orbits evenly distributed around the earth and three of these passed to east center and west of the united states every twelve hours one would be passing over the south pole when michael launched the others would have to be distracted another screen showed all the effective missiles remaining under us control lights blinked and colored lines flowed across the screens as the main battle computer matched missiles with invader targets general toland came in all ready at my end he said not that the army has much to do unless the snouts start dropping rocks at random good carrell stood at the balcony window his eyes fastened on the screens below after a moment general toland sat at one of the desks one screen faded then was replaced by a map of the south atlantic a bright red line rose from the ocean and arced toward johannesburg god what if it really hits toland said to no one it wont carrell said other lines arced upward from the south atlantic one rose straight up the emp bomb then a bright blue ring sprang up to surround that area weve lost communications with ethan allen jenny reported the nathaniel greene is launching now the emp bomb bloomed into a red patch wide of earths arc more lines sprang up this time from farther south almost directly below the cape of good hope after a few moments a blue circle appeared there too no communications with nathaniel greene jenny said or anywhere else for the next few hours we got our electromagnetic pulse the room seethed with static the office door opened jack clybourne ushered the president in general bland stood jenny saw him but remained seated good afternoon president coffey said continue with your duties he sat at the large desk in the middle of the room actually we have very little to do admiral carrell said the tough work was planning this now it either works or it doesnt reassuring bullshit jenny thought no battle plan ever works seventeen digit ships destroyed in the war we cant find three assume one destroyed unreported and two on the ground in africa where they cant rise in time can we get that lucky another of the battle screens flashed to show georgia and south carolina a network of red lines leaped upward toward the digit ships patrolling in low orbit ten minutes went past the red lines began rapidly to wink out red blotches appeared south of atlanta theyre damned fast toland muttered yes too fast admiral carrell agreed he turned to the president wed hoped to keep them distracted for half an hour or more when does michael go up the president asked in eighty minutes admiral carrell said god help the people in bellingham president coffey muttered god help us all god miranda we cant keep this up im supposed to be on duty so you are she made a point of buttoning her blouse as she moved away from him to the passenger door of the squad car and pretended to be interested in the sparse scenery of the lummi indian reservation all right youll just have to take me home well but not just he rolled over in the seat prepared to follow all units all units proceed with big tango proceed with big tango the radio blared leigh sagged back stunned what is it miranda demanded his look frightened her i dont even know where to start start what damn you he was buttoning buttons fumbling it its were supposed to evacuate the city everybody within five miles of the harbor five miles your place isnt in the zone deputy young said youre almost six miles out but the rez is he leaned forward and started the cruiser and i guess youre riding with me miranda how the hell do i get a bunch of indians to leave their homes tell them why tell me why leigh i dont know they told me that when big tango started we have one hour one frigging hour to get everybody out of their houses and away he put the car in gear so here we go not that it will do any good it didnt look like an indian reservation it looked more like a rural slum punctuated by occasional suburban houses there was only one paved road leigh drove along it and spoke at intervals through the loud speaker mounted on top of the police car hi this is leigh young i have bad news the aliens going to bomb bellingham you have about half an hour to the hell out of here drive ride bikes run walk do anything you can but get the hell away from bellingham harbor he drove around the paved loop there was a numbness in mirandas brain john fox expected something something he wouldnt talk about what can i do give leigh half an hour to get the indians moving but then he damned well better take me home so i can tell dad they were at the end of the loop there were speedboats in the harbor all racing southwest and away headed for port angles escaping escaping what leigh was driving back into the loop run for the hills his amplified voice blared get out any way you can foot horse car dont take anything you dont value more than life dont look back because the glare will burn your eyes out already there were cars moving the other way some of them listened miranda said leigh we have to go warn dad if the snouts are going to bomb us theyre not going to bomb us huh i made that up leigh said then why are we doing this damfino ask the sheriff miranda i already asked him and he wouldnt tell us ask now he has to tell us now well miranda took the microphone from its hook and handed it to him go on ask what harm can it do well all right leigh keyed the microphone dispatcher is the sheriff there hes busy i have to talk with him one moment sheriff lafferty here that you young yes sir sheriff im on the rez most of the indians are moving on but some arent isnt there anything i can tell them thatll make them move out tell them theyll get killed if they stay i did i said the snouts are going to bomb bellingham snouts bomb us thats a good one leigh were going to bomb ourselves theres going to be atom bombs the radio dissolved in static what the hell leigh tuned up and down buzz saws like we were being jammed maybe we are miranda said what leigh what did he mean bomb ourselves i dont know i dont know either but why would the army jam your radio leigh im scared so far so good jenny watched the big wall screens with satisfaction m minus fiftyfive minutes and counting she announced thank you admiral carrel acknowledged melon daiquiri president coffey muttered sir carrell asked nothing admiral i have a good feeling about this yes sir you dont mr president they say that admiral jellicoe at jutland was the only man in the world who could have lost world war one in a single afternoon oh and we can lose something more than that carrell said of course youre right the door opened to admit a mess corporal with a tray of coffee outside the door were half a dozen military personnel plus jack clybourne who was doing his best not to look through the door and across the office so that he could see the big battle screens on the floor below the president grinned mr clybourne sir let sergeant maiheys people act like doorkeepers come in and watch the action sir come in youve earned a ringside seat but well thank you sir clybourne stood against one wall he blends into it like wallpaper jenny thought she turned to wink at him there was a buzz in her headset control gimlet gimlet this is harpoon we have a security breach we have a security breach this went out on police radio air four minutes ago i play the tapes now launch now general toland said there are people in bellingham the president said a lot of them all right so its hard on bellingham launch colonel tell them to prepare yes sir jenny spoke into the microphone prepare for launch in five minutes launch in five minutes more sirens blared on the floor below admiral the president asked admiral carrell put his fingertips together and looked acros their tops at the situation maps give me a minute not much more than that said the general all right first the timing is terrible wed be launching straight up at bogie two and we didnt hurt those digit ships enough if they drop rocks on michael weve had it bland shouted yes carrell glanced at his watch what are we afraid of a laser cant hurt michael a meteor takes time it could be on its way now and ready to hit atmosphere all right i say we wait get ready to launch on ten seconds notice wait the full hour if we can but if gillespie sees a light in the sky hell launch a meteor would flare at fifty miles up and come in at a slant at five to six miles per second wed be twenty seconds in the air when it hit michael would survive michael can blow bogie two out of the sky the general said its all alone we wont see another digit ship for an hour we have a plan admiral carrell said and if we stick with it we lose mr president youre betting everything on this general im aware that its important we have to fight the damn digit ships anyway go now and kill everyone in bellingham president coffey said better bellingham than the whole damn human race oh jesus president coffey stared at the situation screens admiral carrell youre my naval expert take command yes sir colonel crichton get me direct communications with general gillespie sir the first three lines she tried were filled with static general gillespie sir ed this is thor carrell yes mr secretary theres been a possible security leak your local sheriff used his radio is that why theres jamming we cant talk to our own mps thats it general youre to make ready for instant launch watch the skies the first glimmer up there and you go its your ship as of now acknowledged president coffey looked significantly at the admiral mr president carrell said i wont take your time coffey said godspeed general the sirens were still wailing on the floor below general toland was still frowning all right god damn it well do it your way he turned to jenny colonel get me the mp commander in bellingham i want that sheriffs ass in a sling general yes mr president have your mps do what they can for the people in bellingham theyre americans too yes sir john fox heard it first there was high wind with a few raindrops in it fox was turning the compost heap hed managed to make this his own territory nobody else would fool with it his pitchfork probed and he worked around the denser mass he sensed to keep roger hidden bones showed suddenly not clean yet a foot fox grimaced an picked up a pitchforkful of compost he stopped cocked his head there was a sound in the wind motors fox placed his forkful to cover the bones deep then he moved briskly toward the house he opened the door and shouted at the first human figure he saw navy coming back alert everyone ill be at the gate the navy had come twice before first for the cbs then for roger brooks both times they had come in force but not like this you could hardly hear the wind for the roar of motors and they were only just pulling up armored trucks lined the road it must be a nuisance for them john fox thought all that gasoline but they know weve got guns and somebody might do something stupid if there was just a truckful of them he counted eight trucks and more vehicles behind them new cars old cars decrepit civilian trucks a score of them thinning out of sight into the rain four men climbed out of the third vehicle and came up to the gate they looked nervous one was the sheriff old ben lafferty three were navy and fox had seen one of them on their second visit commander arnold kennedy kennedy stepped forward an said you know were coming in weve been through this before john foxs worries were growing nobody had come out the house to join him what did that mean were they getting ready to shoot it out two more came up miranda shakes and that deputy sheriff she dated its all right john miranda said what is it this time who the hell are they fox waved back down the road your neighbors sheriff lafferty said civilians seeking refuge commander kennedy said and you will by god give it to them were prepared to shoot the top off your house what we want is the use of your bomb shelter for about two hours fox nodded orion he thought now how many are there about three hundred youre crazy even elbow to elbow and on top of each other too this is serious you tell the rest of em in there this is serious if they start shooting well take the house off the top of the shelter itll go anyway now you and i are going up to the house they walked around the greenhouse and up to the front door kennedy rang the bell the invaders trooped through the house and through the secret door and down there were storekeepers and navy and indians grandparents and children and infants two old men and a heavy middleaged woman had to be lifted from wheelchairs carried inside and deposited in the three decks of bunks the wheelchairs stayed in the living room along with everything else suitcases briefcases picnic baskets even heavy overcoats the living room looked like a rummage sale the rug was a swamp clara was too angry to scream but bill shakes raged well have to tear up the floor to get rid of all theyve trucked in weve got one count em one bathroom down there and well have to pack people in that too well have to fumigate commander whos going to pay for all this what are you laughing at im sorry mr shakes you submit a bill for damages i guarantee you itll be honored but youd better wait an hour before you add up that bill mr shakes george tateevans felt his insides turning to water what were we supposed to do conduct a point defense against the navy weve got enough firepower here to get us all killed dead and not even jack lost his head quite that bad thank god but they none of them thought it through the navy searched us whe they came for the cbs so they knew we had a bomb shelter half of bellingham is trooping through our basement because weve got a bomb shelter a bomb shelter commander what happens in one hour thats still classified are you out of your you had a fuck of a lot of radio equipment and im not sure in my heart that we got it all and the sheriff used his car radio to try to alert the populace you almost died then mr tate evans ill tell you when i can really but what do we prepare for how long will we be in there hours not days without us it would have been days kennedy said weve got decontamination equipment parked outside ready decontam up the stairs came a riot of noise people were jammed in the stairwell all the way to the thick iron trapdoor something i think wed better do isadore said pass out all the booze i mean it bill you heard the commander the navyll pay for it but thats a supercooled riot in there and something awfuls about to happen and well want them tranquil right medicine too george said the living room held only navy men and the legitimate owners commander get your men to carrying booze ill get the medical kit well set up on the stairs force the rest of those carpetbaggers down to leave the stairs clear and then ill offer you a drink not for the commander checked his watch weve got twenty minutes and then im prepared to drink a toast there were no windows on michael the control room was buried deep in michaels heart between the water tanks with the tower to shield it too for harry and the others there was nothing by tv screens somewhere outside there were still people to talk to gillespie nothing from the president if anything comes itll be a messenger weve got a tight phone to the gate gillespie said if a digit ship changes course anywhere i want to know it and the tinny response were getting some action from the ships we attacked but nothing aimed here how long eight minutes there were cameras everywhere inside and outside michael one camera on the wall of the dome showed all of the great ship the shell the placement guns protruding under the rim six towers around the base the brick standing above them its flat sides hung with smaller spacecraft shadowed by the overhang of the nose the dome that had swarmed with activity day and night for months now looked deserted silent empty gillespie turned toward the repair crew five minutes close your faceplates now then by intercom testing can you all hear me they responded all personnel outside michael get to the shelter and thank you all a dozen crash couches covered the floor harry and rohrs and gamble and the others were strapped down like mental patients the only difference was that they could pull their arms free an umbilical carried oxygen from the wall and made a cold spot on harrys chest harry was feeling claustrophobic and elated heres harry the minstrel in a bygod space suit waiting for launch rohrs said itll be rough on the pilots riding outside like that at least theyve got windows harry said someone said here we lie waiting for an atom bomb to go off under our asses there has to be a more graceful way to say that tiny pelz said dr pelz was an atomjack built heavy and strong he looked strange with his bushy black beard shaved off to fit him into the pressure suit the desks and tables and phones and lines were all gone the ready room was neat and clean padded handholds lined the walls and ceiling harry remembered the men in kansas who had gone forth to battle the enemy with tanks they talked to keep their courage up harry didnt know these men young strong healthy if he told them about his back problem what would they say pelz would understand or rohrs or gamble one minute said a tinny voice and im going they watched for bright light in their screens the snout meteor could fall at any second the silence grew thick the tension stretched until harry could stand it no longer he bellowed sancho my armor the youthful faces looked at him some were grinning he heard gillespies grunt of disgust and saw gillespies elbow move an atomic bomb went off under harry reddingtons ass maintaining a civilization in here was going to be worse than isadore had thought hed never seen human beings crowded close miranda and her deputy sheriff shared a bunk all the bunks held two or three each and if the supports collapsed the bunk would not fall there was no room he heard oh god its another meteor and wished he hadnt it could start an epidemic of fear and it might be true bill shalt was still fulminating at commander kennedy who still hadnt lost his temper quite hey bill isadore bellowed nothing less would be hear we always prepare for the wrong disaster you told us remember shakes turned well this idiot wont tell me what disaster we are prepared for reminds me commander kennedy shouted just how did you go about constructing this place we built it good two layers of why you crammed two thousand indians in here with no deodorant and now you want to know its safe i do its safe two layers of concrete separated by the sound of the end of the world slammed against the ceiling for a moment that incredible crowd was totally silent then it came again slam commander kennedy whooped they made it theyre up its slam first bomb fails you just start over slam if the second bomb fails youre already slam already in the air youll fall theyre on their slam way by god you can give me that drink now slam breakout heroes are created by popular demand sometimes out of the scantiest of materials gerald white johnson countdown m hour god was knocking and he wanted in bad wham wham wham quiet the respite will be brief gillespie bellowed harry barely heard him in the silence after the bombs how many were there twenty thirty stay in harness and be ready for acceleration goddam we made it the screens showed little but clouds harry caught a glimpse of vancouver island and the straits of juan de fuca there would be nothing to see but the pacific ocean anyway presently earth was a shallow arc cloudwhite and beyond it a winking light blip blip blip digit ship under power two oclock high roger i see it gillespie said theres another ensign franklin shouted into the mike then lowered his voice and tried to sound like an astronaut nine oclock low far away accelerating roger stand by for acceleration fire harry was shoved back against his couch in the moment before thrust resumed the screens showed lines of spurt bombs leaving their rails on all sides the spurt bombs looked like fasces bundles of tubes around an axis made up of attitude jets and cameras and a computer they moved in straight lines past the rim of the shell turning as they went wham harry waited nothing then gillespies voice in the intercom wham wham the nearer of the blinking lights had gone out the view in one screen expanded once and again something showed dim against the stars how far object in view nine oclock low franklin had his voice under control now he sounded like chuck yeager in the right stuff might be big mama roger acceleration gillespie sounds tired already maybe hes just bored wham wham spurt bombs rained into the blast the forward view jittered but that distant object was too blunt to be a digit ship other cameras swung in arcs and that glaregreen star was a digit ship and it had found them with its lasers harry switched the intercom to local max when do we turn the shuttles loose not for a while but just now we can shoot anything that moves but if we wait too long harry we all have work to do ed flies the ship we watch for bandits yeah and when the ship gets holes in it we go fix it thats democracy wham wham harry lost count of the explosions blue fire around primary target ensign franklin said he was shouting again sir i think theyre accelerating roger wham wham harrys universe was a madness of noise and jolts as if a giant had put him in a garbage can and used the can for a field hockey puck quiet looks quiet for a while keep your straps on and take a break harry opened his faceplate so did the others in the damage control section i think we took out that first digit ship the second is receding it cant slow down in time to hurt us and the third is around back of the earth odds are we wont see another digit ship for the next hour were moving toward the prime target its running away well give the computers a chance to gather data so we can tell which way to run god knows big as that thing is once it gets started it wont turn fast when we launch the shuttles well have to switch over from automatic aiming for the laser weapons well hang on to the shuttles and gunships as long as we can enjoy max rohrs said he took out a pack of cigarettes anybody really mind he offered them around harry reached out eagerly ensign franklin said pointedly there are studies that prove smoking takes ten years off your life harry you really ought to give that up well i dont believe in statistics what about max hes smoked so long it will probably kill him about franklin looked at the wall chronometer now and ill be in command of damage control nobody wanted a second cigarette harry tried to relax half close his eyes to look like franklin and his two navy boatswains mates his three personal tv sets showed unchanging views down access ducts within the brick harry began playing with the view steam pipes more steam pipes outside looking past the attitude jets into the overhang of the nose shield bandits franklin said half a dozen pulsing lights west and a little south more of them start just above the arc of the earth you can follow them up to the primary target theyre all accelerating got them said gillespie harry slammed his faceplate shut so did the others but more slowly deliberately the lights were far apart and they changed with relation to each other dont panic calmly and deliberately as he could harry adjusted his straps no one was watching pity michaels nose was a thick shield and the butt plate ought to stand up to anything turn either of those toward danger and you couldnt be harmed but if danger came from half a dozen directions wham wham wham michael was pulsing too and the spurt bombs were throwing gammaray lasers death rays eat hot gamma rays foolish centaurans wham wham one of the pulsing lights went out another one bandit south just above europe stand by maneuvering harry heard the faint hiss of steam jets the drive explosions stopped and michael was turning before harry spotted the other lights bandits to starboard i think those are missiles tiny flames wavering against the stars roger blam blam after the shocks of the drive bombs the big antimissile guns were almost gentle stand by maneuvering acceleration wham they attack at night they know us that well for us it is night for them it is day i should have expected this do the prey have other surprises for me already the herdmaster knew that he had been tricked he had been strapped to his acceleration pad for an hour now on duty to handle further emergencies but this was not what he had expected it pulsed like a digit ship but more slowly half a breath passed between explosions we taught them that the herdmaster thought it looked bigger than a digit ship smaller than message bearer four digit ships the lowest in their various orbits about winterhome converged on the intruder the herdmaster saw the pulse drive fail on one of them he watched and another died how did they do that theyre killing my fithp defensemaster you lead message bearer now i obey there were sounds the screens showed sixteen mounted digit ships released from their ring around message bearers stern they formed an expanding ring about the mothership prepare no spin prepare the defensemasters voice was sent through the ship spin decreasing digit ships launched to form a defense screen and where are the others he had lost several himself an hour ago there had been eight digit ships in twelvehour polar orbits passing repeatedly over various parts of winterhome two of those had been attacked by missiles from the sea attackmaster koothfektilrusp had agreed with his assessment the missiles were a diversion like the attack that preceded the bombing of the kansas foothold the prey had already aimed one missile at the fithp base in johannesburg surely there would be more pastempehkeph had set several digit ships to converge on africa ready to fire on missiles aimed at the african foothold wrong five perhaps six could not reach the intruder in time to fight he tapped rapidly summoning knowledge four digit ships were already rising from the moon those carried material to wherever the war effort needed meteors but though two were empty though they had risen as soon as the enemy ship was sighted they would not arrive in time still meteors would be needed the enemy ship had to come from somewhere the ships patrolling africa could he use them sixteen were in eccentric geosynchronous orbits dropping low while they moved east falling outward drifting west while they arced around and fell back but always over africa ten of those were in the upper arcs of their orbit above message bearer lower above africa the remaining six were low enough to engage the enemy the defensemaster was doing his frenetic best to coordinate their efforts and three were not responding he eavesdropped the fi talking to the defensemaster sounded sick or mentally deficient he had something like hiccups like a laser attacked us but not like heat all through the ship fuel pressure very high as if light we cannot see was shining all through the hull gamma ray it may be but where do they find their power we were eightcubed of makasrupkithp distant can you fight your ship no we cannot breath can you hear shookerintbuth has stopped i cant control my digits or my legs controls burnt out too enough of this mourn in daylight defensemaster tantarentfid broke contact with the sick fi you will be certain attackmaster koothfektilrusp is aware of the situation herdmaster im doing all i can what could he tell us possibly nothing this is your thuktun i will see that he is told he gestured to one of his aides it is important that you and the attackmaster coordinate digit ships for simultaneous attack it will be done herdmaster talker get me takpussehyamp be glad even of small benefits the mating season was over breakertwo is tashayamp available too good send tashayamp to fetch rogachev from the human restraint cell and bring him to the bridge you come straight here night jeri lay curled against his chest it was a frustrating experience sleeping with a woman in a public place a woman who did not care that her daughter knew what she did with arvid rogachev but who would not let anyone see her behave improperly alien speech sounded the room tilted sideways arvid felt jeris nails dig into his arm the others stirred what is it jeri demanded she believes that i know everything dmitri shouted in russian so does he wait what else can we do presently the door warning light came on tashayamp stood at the entrance rogachev you will come takpussehyamp moved at a slant it wasnt exactly a run yet it was fast his body tilted against message bearers awkward acceleration message bearer was losing its spin the herdmaster must be preparing for acceleration the bridge was frantically busy the herdmaster summoned him with a wave and pointed i want to know what to expect from that takpussehyamp looked at three displays of the sky black starsprinkled with a crescent of winterhome showing large and a black dot that flashed light around its edge there were sparkles in the flash i am not a technician how did i know you would say that breakertwo i can learn about that craft assume that there are humans in it assume length of twice eightcubed srupkithp or less and half that in width it moves in the manner of a digit ship but more crude probably using fission bombs instead of deuterium fusion assume a bumpy ride query humans can tolerate more shock than we can yes assume at least one weapon which we cant describe query what do they want to do with this win a war the intruder had stopped pulsing the herdmaster said but of course they no listen herdmaster this is no demonstration to give them higher rank after surrender if there were two of these they would have sent two if they know it to be inadequate they would not send it until they could build two i am no predecessor i guess my best guess is that this device is expected to set a human foot on the traveler fithp how you spoke of a new weapon remember that the human fithp must write their own thuktunthp at that moment the unknown ship seemed to explode message bearer must have looked like this when the digit ships were loosed on the ussr space station ships were spreading out around it defensemaster how big are those ships tiny no fi would fit the small ones they must be automatic two or three might wedge themselves into the large takpusseh said automatic perhaps perhaps one human each hardly volunteers rogues captured then forced into ships launched then expected to perform alone in space and under fire with no similar mind nearby no contact with the herd no ridiculous these are big automatic devices we would not have built so large now my digits are whole again remember human rogues may cooperate it was still nonsense the devices were tiny even a single rogue man would not fit take an acceleration pad takpusseh remain defensemaster is the drive ready no herdmaster i need another sixteen sixtyfourbreaths the alien device would need sixteen times as long to reach us we could move if i had kept the digit ships mounted but better to set them free to defend us yes the doorway opened tashayamp entered with the human takpussehyamp curled his digits a private message of affection she pretended not to see tashayamp excellent the herdmaster gestured her toward his station i will need you to translate arvid rogachev look at this the human stood tilted looking about the bridge he came forward lurching gripping consoles and machinery where he could screens showed him the intruder pulsing against the dark night side of winterhome what is this man i expect you to tell me that lead me rogachev braced himself against a console and continued to watch the intruder had resumed acceleration but more slowly now the smaller ships diverged on what had to be chemical flame some toward the two closest of the digit ships now converging from low orbit above africa some moving ahead toward message bearer one enemy flared then became a fog rogachev spoke in the language of the thuktunthp some fi placed weapon well this is a spacecraft carrying smaller spacecraft we know that bombs make it go thuktun students of united states and england consider idea long ago but we make it against the will of the fithp of nations query size of these things the largest is twice eightcubed srupkithp the smallest are five srupkithp in length no more than one srupk thick ah my fithp may ride such small things but i thought united states fithp be afraid the device rose from the north american continent takpussehyamp said that was certain otherwise it would have been seen rogachev they have something that is killing our fithp aboard the digit ships can you make a device that throws gamma rays in a narrow beam not understand tashayamp shine light like laser at two times eight to minus twelve snipkithp wavelength means nothing rogachev said i need tools he gestured tapping on his hand with one finger ah he wants the calculating device from their space city tashayamp said why did i not understand that i was shrewd to choose tashayamp as my mate shall i send for it herdmaster yes rogachev that sparkle within the explosion i not understand either query the united states build some rogue device they did not tell us rogachev laughed a peculiar hackleraising sound he should not do that the herdmaster stamped impatiently tashayamp return rogachev to the restraint cell he turned to takpussehyamp the fikiller has not heard a fithp or human voice in more than sixtyfour days will he be sane will he be amenable to reason herdmaster i do not know i believe he will be both sane and reasonable even though such treatment would make rogues of any normal fi dawson understands how machinery may be used in space perhaps we can learn were finally fighting back no the united states is fighting back arvid corrected himself never mind what have they got can they win can they even catch us the spin was gone gravity was a feathertouch aft thuktun flishithys drive took time to build power but it was possible that the ship could simply outrun the americans tashayamp query you usually have warriors with you for this breath the warriors have better things to do her tone was sharp the fithp could enunciate could decrease the air escaping with the words when they wished here we are the key she used was a bar of metal the lock was magnetic as arvid had established long ago the hatch swung out you have sufficient padding but acceleration may come from abnormal directions be careful grip when you can you will be as safe as any fi aboard now go in the others watched as arrid swung his body around the edge of the hatch they saw him grip tashayamps trunk brace his feet and pull her digits loose from her handhold tashayamp shrieked her first impulse wasnt to crush arvid rogachev it was to tether herself her hampered digits wrapped around the edge of the hatch dmitri leapt from below he crashed into her like a fullback then arvid and dmitri were pulling her trunk in two directions pulling her through the hatch and the hatch was still open tashayamp recovered arvid found himself flying he curled himself into a ball struck padding struck again with less force uncoiled and leapt again the others had got the idea mrs woodward and the children huddled in a corner jeri dmitri nikolai looked to be tangled in tashayamps digits arvid snatched at her harness as he passed climbed around onto her back he found the buckle and loosed the harness straps and a pack arvid opened the pack and swung the contents flew wide tashayamp was screaming thrashing drifting much too near a wall if she could anchor her feet in the padding he swung around her belly caught the wall with his feet and kicked away toward the middle of the cell the fi seemed to be tiring arvid joined the others at her head push them in here he shouted and grasped a digit that writhed like a fire hose five minutes later a furious fi female glared at them over the edge of a bag straps were tight around her ears dmitri moored other straps behind her forelegs and tightened them he cast loose and studied the situation thoughtfully is there a reason to betray our true motives now thuktun flishithy is under attack arvid replied he heard jeri gasp right on alice shouted by whom american one carrier with missiles and smaller spacecraft our last chance dmitri the fithp cannot follow us into the ducts we fight there i see agreed dmitri spoke rapidly in russian no arvid said no what jeri demanded it is state security dmitri shouted in russian he wishes to kill this fi arvid said jeri said hey mrs woodward said you wouldnt do you think those straps will hold her helpless dmitri shouted and so do i but what do we know kill her think of india and kill her over my dead body jeri said she moved closer to tashayamp dmitri shouted in russian arvid replied i will think with what organs i choose i grant you command but not in this think dmitri thuktun flishithy is under attack by the time they find the teachers mate we will be beyond their reach there is no need whatever to kill her you let women think for you he doesnt need women to tell him whats right carrie woodward said i like tashayamp alice said emphatically dmitri looked about him arvid alice jen and mrs woodward were between him and the fi who had stopped thrashing because of an understandable interest in the topic of conversation arvid you may regret this but it is done now let us be gone mrs woodward take the children to the garden it is never locked and you should be safe there if anyone is safe anywhere nikolai arvid with me jeri alice both of you to the garden arvid ordered wes what about him alice cried dmitri snorted contempt have you any idea where he is forget congressman dawson he is untrustworthy he has proved it again and again alice shrugged angrily i dont like you very much imagine my concern you are unreliable go to the garden with the others damn right im coming with you jeri told arvid mother you go with carrie arvid arvid studied her face and nodded do as carrie says jeri said she slapped melissa on the rump now get moving they set tashayamp spinning in the middle of the cell and left her that way they set off forward along the corridor the first grill they passed arvid unscrewed the wing nuts and led half the party inside the rest continued the men in the walls i dont shoot a man for being incompetent in the devils work i shoot him for being competent in the devils work admiration for his technique is part of the process laurence van corr four digit ships were coming near they were half a thousand miles away not close enough to use missiles but close enough to show as brilliant wavering green suns that laser light must be boiling away michaels hull refrigerators chugged pumping unwanted heat into michaels heat sink the water tanks that had been two huge icebergs at takeoff the bombs were still going wham wham wham the spurt bombs were still raining into the blast but gillespie was on the radio link shuttle one im cutting you loose gunships one through six im cutting you loose see if you can damage some bandits for me wham wham wham quiet vibrating through the hull came chunkchunk sounds mooring prongs releasing their passengers flames lit and pulled away the exhausts of the gunboats were bright and yellow solid fuel rockets the single shuttle flame showed faint and blue oxygen and hydrogen they swept away to do battle watch for bandits watch for damage watch temperature gauges listen watch and hang on constant chatter in the intercomm too many digit ships gillespie said if i can kill a few i can outrun the rest jason targets acquired fire when ready acceleration stand by get on the horn and tell the flyboys to leave that nearest ship to me get em away from it fire wham bandits eight oclock high were getting an overheat amidships starboard wham request salvo time problems i need it roger say when stand by targets acquired ready the bomb placement cannon chugged almost inaudibly acceleration stand by wham bandit eleven oclock low wham harrys teeth were clenched the temperature starboard amidships was falling again no major hits on michael a gunship flared brilliant green held died stovepipe five this is big daddy big daddy this is stovepipe four scratch stovepipe five i say again scratch five bandit eight oclock low big daddy this is stovepipe three ill take the new target wham request salvo roger acceleration stand by wham wham three digit ships showed behind them as brilliant green suns temperature rising ventral aft four steam forming ventral aft six wham big daddy this is stovepipe three scratch one bogey two brilliant suns aft big daddy this is stovepipe four scratch stovepipe three wham wham temperatures fell toward normal two lights showed aft the gunships were invisible beyond the battle now living or dead short break gillespie said theyre trying to clump they want to hit us in clusters we wont reach the next cluster for couple of hours thank god harry eagerly reached up to open his faceplate sounds like a good time for an inspection tour max rohrs said get used to moving around in freefall hey give us a break harry said ill suggest it to the snouts harry fastened the faceplate again the ducts were roomy enough they were square in cross section so that patch plates could be all the same size what had been ladders padded rungs welded into the sides had been left for handholds harry knew the ducts like the roof of his mouth the trouble was that he kept bumping into the sides ensign franklin stayed ahead of him franklin hadnt helped build these ducts but he had astronaut training in a weighted pressure suit in a swimrnii pool acceleration stand by the ship surged gillespie was throwing the thrust bombs far back using them less for thrust than to power the spurt bombs still harry snatched a rung only just in time where are we franklin asked about the middle of the brick that was the midpoint later tunnel we just passed port water tank below us here this is top of the equipment bins he looked in and franklin peered past him nothing shook loose welding and cutting equipment patch plates same size as the walls you have to tilt them to get through the ducts i know patches for steam pipes the valve wheels lines and cable nooses of the finest hemp there was a girl who never laid me but she made me scream the five thousand fingers of doctor t franklin said i like her already yeah they continued forward harry tried launching himself from the rungs bouncing slantwise from the opposite wall didnt work best move was to parallel the rungs and keep the within reach its harder to move around than i thought it would be tires you out faster too yeah thats always a surprise franklin said the duct expanded into a maze of pipes pipes five feet wide flared into cones eighteen feet across the cones ran through the hull and outside twelve cones facing in three directions in rows of four each the attitude jets were at the upper port corner of the brick harry said its all so clean im going to hate seeing it messed up in a battle when they told me about the steam pipes i wondered if theyd want me shoveling coal too harry laughed shall we take the cross duct and come down the other side lead on im lost already acceleration stand by wham nikolai led the gravity was still low enough to let them move in great leaps if it gets strong enough he wont be able to move fast jeri thought what will they do then she wanted to ask but the last time shed spoken it had upset dmitri arvid lets that commissar tell him what to do why we arent in russia and he isnt smarter than arvid it was difficult to keep up it was also obvious that the russians werent going to slow for her they moved on through the air shafts each time they passed one of the ringshaped robots jeri felt terror suppose the thing came after them tentacles flailing they moved deeper into the ship where are we going wherever it was nikolai never hesitated as they went through twists and turns jeri caught glimpses of marks by some of the tunnel forks cyrillic letters of course we are here comrade commander dmitri might be in command but nikolai spoke and listened only to arvid rogachev he must not like dmitri any more than i do jeri thought the room below was filled with cabinets and boxes but no snouts dmitri waited impatiently for nikolai and rogachev to open the accessway then dashed ahead of them to begin opening boxes flinging their contents out onto the deck tang and that label says something in russian where are oh dmitri opened another box ha he reached into the box and brought out a big pistol then fumbled in the box again until he found ammunition that belonged to the american greeley arvid said is there another the americans brought several and gave one to me as a gift da there are two he brought out another pistol and handed it to arvid with a box of ammunition only two i wonder if dmitri can shoot as well as i can i dont suppose theres any point in asking arvid loaded the pistol and held it high at last my arm is whole again he shouted in english and what did the snouts make of that picture is there anything else knives i had a walther ppk when they captured me is that in there no arvid opened wall cabinets spacesuits hung like mannequins hah i suppose it is too much to hope there will be filled air tanks if these can be made airtight dmitri said will they not allow us to live in vacuum even without air tanks a few minutes longer not more we can kill many snouts in a few minutes dmitri said let us see if these can be made to fit us mrs woodward was dithering if i thought we could get to that big slab the podo thuktun they worship that dont they wed be even safer they lock it alice said they lock everything but the kitchen and the garden and the funeral pit you dont want to hide in the funeral pit no what are you doing alice was unscrewing the big wing nuts on a grill im going to wes get the kids to the garden hide hide alice they wont harm children carrie you dont want to be caught after arvid and the russians start their moves oh carrie put an arm around each of the children alice ill be fine wes needs me carrie woodward nodded agreement id have gone for my john god be with you alice thanks a recorded voice trumpeted in the alien language take footholds against thrust alice dove into the air shaft behind her carrie woodward gripped the corridors wet carpeting both children clinging to her the pull increased until it was uncomfortable then increased again like kansas more i dont know alice moved through the air shafts somewhere ahead was wes dawson the fithp warriors gestured but didnt speak all right dawson thought theyre still trying to drive me mad have they done it how long since i had anyone to talk to there were only two one before and one behind im strong like superman exercise ive walked all the way from new york city to joplin missouri and theyre still elephants too damn big im as fast as they are faster jump back grab that ones gun but why did they come for me no spin acceleration thrust after all this time why am i out to prove im a rogue wait for me to go for a gun so they can kill me no makes no sense they wouldnt take the spin off just for that damn im as schizzy as alice he stifled that thought alice isnt crazy maybe she got over it alice is sweet and if i live through this what will i do with her carlotta will kill her they were in a shallow spiral curve climbing toward the ships bow thrust had risen to something like earth normal they emerged in a place with windows a place he had never seen except in his mind perhaps a starships control room an alien starship it was dimly lit half the light was coming from square uv monitor screens there were no chairs only pads and recessed holds for the claws of fithp feet the pads would tilt for spin gravity but they were flat now hed guessed from the change in gravity and now he knew thuktun flishithy was on a light footing the warriors were holding back out of the way four fithp stood together in the center of the bridge dawson recognized one takpussehyamp a fi saw them and beckoned the bull stud yes for the warriors immediately brought him forward digits twined round his arms dawson the herdmaster said are you sane he suppressed the urge to roll his eyes up and bobble his finger against his lips yes no thanks to you the herdmaster pointed to a screen the view zoomed toward a distant fuzzy object as dawson watched it flared brilliant green then flared again faint bluegreen threads played against it from distant digit ships the herdmaster gestured impatiently look at that and tell me what it is dawsons lips curved in a smile that is a tape of star wars he said were fighting should i have jumped that soldier hell no this is where they run everything stall wait for the chance to snatch a gun and speak our language dawson we have no time for gibberish you lectured fathistehtulk on devices for use in space lecture me now regarding that if you remain silent i will return you your silence i cant even tell which is which theres too much going on that big blinking thing is that ours no it rose from the united states it carries a weapon that would be a laser but that it sends an impossibly high frequency we have no such in our thuktunthp what can you tell us the last thing wes wanted was to return to the dreadful silence of his cell here was where it was all happening and he wouldn be giving away anything useful gammaray lasers are possible they destroy themselves you only fire them once you power them with a fission explosion the herdmaster bellowed something takpussehyamp spoke too rapidly for wes to follow another fi one dawson was certain he had never seen before listened gravely then spoke slowly perhaps there is nothing in the thuktunthp this would explain why they use so many bombs what is the purpose of the intruder was that a serious question wes said they make war war has a purpose what is the purpose do they seek a not surrender surrender i dont understand they want you extinct theyre coming to kill you they will kill entire fithp females children india india was not all of the human fithp unless you surrender that ship will destroy thuktun flishithy the herdmaster didnt seem surprised he spoke to the fourth fi in the group defensemaster you have heard warriors keep this one there where he will not interfere the guards dragged him to one bulkhead they placed his hands against the damp spongy wall grip each hand was encircled by tentacles the fithp warriors dug their claws into the floor the herdmaster made certain that dawson was held securely far enough away that he could not overhear thrust was steady now the sixteen digit ships which had surrounded message bearer her last wall of defense were dwindling in her wake defensemaster lead me can we avoid battle herdmaster the intruder already has too high a velocity if we thrust lateral to his path he will still miss by only a few makasrupkithp i am thrusting away from him directly out from winterhome he must pass the last digit ships to find us this is your thuktun do it your way takpussehyamp lead me raztupispminz told us that the humans in africa often demand conditions before foot touches chest what words did he use not surrender surrender we took to calling it a negotiated loss of status draft me one to be used if we lose this battle herdmaster is this possible probably not what else are you busy at you have said yourself that this is their last attempt to break from beneath our foot when the intruder is gone then we can let them study how to surrender to us meanwhile exercise your skill prepare for us negotiated loss of status giving them as little as possible herdmaster the call came from one of the lesser posts speak camera twentyeight the herdmaster tapped two buttons a screen lit with a view of an air duct and a small redhaired human female its shes just outside the aft control room watching through the grill send a warrior for her send another send three to the human restraint cell if shes loose they may all be loose and summon tashayamp half a dozen fithp were beyond the grill they didnt seem particularly excited by what they were watching and they were all doing anything but switching the views on their tv sets one view stayed it showed a room like this one but much larger there were windows with stars beyond there was wes dawson against a wall between two of the horrors and there suddenly live on another screen alice saw herself peering through an air duct time to move on alice thought forward windows on a spaceship had to be at the nose steam lord thou has made this world below the shadow of a dream an taught by time i take it so exceptin always steam rudyard kipling mcandrews hymn the big digital timer above the war screens ticked off the seconds since michaels launch when it passed six hours admiral carrell said try it now he put on his own headset jack clybourne sidled through the room like an english butler silently removing coffee cups and emptying ashtrays before fading back against one wall can you type jenny thought she touched keys and gave orders that flashed across half the globe somewhere out there a submarine sticks its nose up just so we can get a report the situation boards had showed few changes in the past two hours the missile sites in georgia and missouri were craters now and a curious pattern of meteoric death neither random nor any geometric figure jenny had ever seen had fallen on the south atlantic nothing had hit bellingham yet harpanet had been badly upset to learn that the friendly snout had been painted on the archangel dome if the digit ships were given leisure if michael fell they would punish that affront there was static in her phones try routing through florida trying sir and if that doesnt work gimlet we have nosebleed the computer console identified nosebleed ethan allen he must have gone deep admiral carrell said i thought wed lost him gimlet we have chickenpox another nuclear sub two possible links good enough try to get through carrell said michael this is gimlet oh ye thrones dominions and powers static burst in her headset she winced can you put it on the speaker the president asked yes sir gimlet this is michael hurrah michael this is gimlet your orders are unchanged continue your mission godspeed ed report please reporting were miles above africa and climbing present vel the voice faded come on general toland whispered garble garble but no serious damage casualties are light we have launched five gunships and one shuttle to assist in breaking through garble garble damn a formation of digit ships above africa at plus one poi garble garble its drive we believe the enemy mother ship running away garble garble they have to catch it the president said michael continue pursuit are in pursuit estimate we will be in effective rank within six to twelve hours we will have to fight our way past a formation of sixteen digit ships they have left to delay garble garble hoo boy general toland thought he was whispering the countdown timer showed hours minutes since michaels launch we have not been attacked for four hours the next attack may be worse no missiles so far weve used more missiles than i like but we still have plenty and the spurt bomb supply is garb blurbie garble garble the static increased link with nosebleed has been lost should we try for a new link jenny asked how long until we have direct contact about two hours relay through the east coast in half hour any orders for them mr president admiral carrell asked youre in charge admiral well wait hide the subs admiral carrell said all fishes this is gimlet run away bogeys ahead are at extreme missile range all right children quiet hour is over harry jumped awake he had slept harry found that amazing hed thought sleeping would be as difficult as pissing which had required two men and fifteen minutes each to open the pressure suits and close them again hed slept and he felt wonderful now what his forward view screens showed sixteen digit ships in a spreading ring their light swamped the stars hellglare green in their center was a violetwhite glare itll be like a single pass through a cuisinart but were gaining on big mama acceleration stand by wham wham wham three kicks in the arse one of the green suns faded then became a fireball how did we do that he asked aloud gamma rays could have set off fusion in the deuterium tiny pelz said thats a guess we still dont know just how their drive works one thing sure jeff franklin said hot gamma rays cant be doing their ships any good crews either if theyre anything like us bandit at one oclock high is changing color roger take him jason acceleration stand by wham good shooting jason daniels opened his faceplate did you get through to colorado springs i did my best no new orders they may be missing all the excitement more excitement coming up jason said he scratched his nose then closed the faceplate missiles dead ahead they showed as a swarm of fireflies bullets would be as dangerous and theyd be invisible harry winced at these velocities marshmallows would be dangerous they would strike like meteors rotation stand by steam jets hissed michael turned ponderously dont turn a cold shoulder show your armored ass franklin said and if we dont turn fast enough harry asked keep the frivolous chatter to a dull roar gillespie said aw shit harry turned his intercom switch to local so did jeff franklin kid looks embarrassed harry did an exaggerated shrug so that franklin would see it tv cameras looked up along the flanks of the brick toward digit ships spreading across the sky the bricks massive nose would reflect some of that green glare absorb some too some got through the forward shield couldnt hide them from all sixteen enemies but turned arse on to the enemy they couldnt accelerate michaels amidships guns were firing forward assisting in rotating the ship my guns i put them in clouds of shotgun pellets made of spent uranium were arraying themselves ahead of michael harry saw bright flashes among the missiles steam roared again michaels rotation ceased cameras on long booms looked out beyond the butt plate and the ring of digit ships the first of the missiles struck whatever they carried for a warhead it was puny compared to michaels own drive ten minutes then we turn again and accelerate like hell gillespie said amuse yourselves yeah sure stovepipes seven and eight shuttle two your turn stand by the gunships cast loose accelerating to the side shuttle two followed harry watched the flames dwindle then veer around more oncoming missiles and toward the digit ships its their last chance at us tiny pelz said theyll pour it on rotation stand by steam jets hissed hail mary full of grace franklin had forgotten the intercom was on dont blame him much this was the trickiest part as they passed through the ring of digit ships they would rotate to face away from the thickest cluster protecting themselves with the butt plate but exposing michaels comparatively weak sides to others the ship turned ponderously spin you bastard missiles exploded light washed two screens the ship kicked mildly wham wham wham pause wham snout missiles exploded under the butt plate now and in the hour of our death amen temperature rising starboard amidships gun turret four no longer reporting bandit nine oclock steam forming bow section three more missiles michael trembled to the shock waves you can do it baby you can do it a vastly larger shock wave kicked michael sideways somebody screamed half a dozen screens blinked white and went blank tiny pelz said oboy damage control report stand by max rohrs said tiny what the hell was that we got two two digit ships blanked out harry shouted fascinating i didnt shoot jason daniels said who got them were tumbling gillespie said ive got no attitude control damage control do something i know what happened pelz said i just cant see it somebody deploy a camera gamble go tiny talk hamilton gamble left his seat on the jump tiny pelz said i think weve lost one of the spurt bomb bays the snouts set off a nuclear missile close enough to pump some spurt bombs maybe the whole bay fired one tremendous blast of gamma lasers its not as bad as it sounds i hope weve had it the implications hit him were all there was aw shit kasanovsky get moving i want to know whats happened to our steam jets another suited figure left the bridge my turn soon harry played with his own tv screens switching to internal cameras nothing here go around the ship assume we lost the ventral spurt bomb bay move from there ha something had kicked an enormous dent in michaels port side forward of that the port pipe room was swirling gray chaos ham gamble here i see it look for yourself channel alfa six harry switched his tv monitor there the screen lit to show the sky digit ships were blurred green spotlights the stars didnt show at all the camera swung down spurt bomb bay was gone only its meltedlooking base still stood up from the shell the much larger tower that was thrust bomb bay had a chewed look as gamble swiveled the camera their view ran along the flank of the brick meteor holes pocked it the base was ripped a stream of fog jetted away max rohrs spoke quietly a litany of disasters port water tank gone ive got the port fission pile scrammed weve got no water for it anyway the whole portside attitude jet system is dead slow response to starboard control system gillespie said nothing from the stovepipes or the shuttle i think theyve had it overheat starboard amidships were still taking hits gillespie said max if you can get a wiggle on situation assessment coming up rohrs said his calmness was a rebuke okay i have the picture pelz said it could have been worse most of the energy must have gone forward better figure we killed all of the ships we deployed and the two snout ships that arent firing lasers anymore we got some spillover energy to the side anything coming apart if we shake and rattle do we break anything not by me rohrs said stand by ill try to stabilize jason get ready kill something acceleration and rotation stand by wait one bombs away shes yours wham wham wham quiet it sure sounds good in theory tiny pelz said what does franklin demanded firing bombs off center to compensate for rotation sure sounds good in theory the screens showed they were still rotating but more slowly michael was the center of a ring of dazzling green lights receding aft were through or close enough jason said their missiles cant hit us we cant hit them but this is the closest approach to those damn lasers the steam were losing the cooling effect may be all thats saving us if we dont get attitude control weve got a big bloody pinwheel acceleration stand by jason bombs away locked on shes yours wham try again jason roger wham shuttles three and four we may not make it we have to hit this mother with something youre on stand by roger max get me some attitude jets harry already had his faceplate closed max rohrs used a light pen to trace lines on the screen theres plenty of pressure in the starboard system and we have working attitude jets starboard ventral and here and here dorsal the pen flicked across a stylized view of michael the port jets look okay in tv pix but they wont hold pressure the electronics arent much good either no wonder half the portside pipes are gone what weve got to do is isolate the working chunk of the portside system then shunt steam in there from the starboard generators we dont have electronic control of those valves or if we do we dont have any feedback on what theyve done which is just as bad what we have to do is start at the breaks and move toward the jets patching as we go harry laughed his screen showed a threefoot pipe with a six foot section missing beyond it was a hole in the hull a neat oval with a rim that bulged outward stars showed through rohrs pointed at harrys display the merely difficult we do immediately the impossible we leave for dry dock youre supposed to use judgment but get the damn lines fixed patch anything you can patch and use the manual valves to shut off everything else lambe donaldson go through the starboard system and check it out get things set up to shunt steam across to the port system and stand by well need pressure to test reddington franklin here it comes start with the big hole in the port system and work your way up to the jets your goal is to make the port jets work with starboard steam got that harry righto all this so i could wear a pressure suit move chunkchunk roy culzer in shuttle four named atlantis in a more peaceful era felt the prongs unlock at the nose the main tank was moored to michael by the same matings that in gentler times would have gripped solid fuel boosters now only the aft matings were still attached and atlantiss nose pointed beyond the overhang of michaels roof jay hadley had the motors going blue flame played down the flank of the brick the aft prongs released and atlantis was free the sky was a hot green turning stand by the shuttle turned as it pulled away earth and michael were behind the violetwhite flame of the prime target ahead four five green spotlights sank below window view okay jay hadley said now theyre only heating the main tank well burn that fuel before the tank blows up for nearly eight hours michael had been in direct sunlight the pressure in the main tanks was already too high and rising have to live with it shuttle three challenger was already lost to sight roy caught sight of a gunships yellower flame just before it disappeared into a missile explosion maneuvering stand by roys sense of balance protested as jay turned the shuttle what have we got missiles weve got five miles per second on those snout ships the missiles only get one pass they cant hit us if we keep veering you hope semper fi mac let me know when you think you have a shot at something yeah sure the missiles were in the main compartment and the big bay doors werent open the ring of green lights dropped away aft go baby go roy prayed talking to the ship why not what else can i do maybe we should open the bay no point the dreadful green lights were fading our missiles cant reach them either save em for mommy dearest how long before were in range maybe an hour if we dont get hurt and they dont get more acceleration roy poked numbers into atlantiss computer looks to me like theyre pouring on all they have so are we roy yeah general gillespie said michael might not make it yeah i heard that leaves it up to us well theres challenger heard from big jim lately no big jim farr six four only he managed to lose two inches in the official records laurie culzer and jane farr and five kids were sharing a house in port angeles think hes had it joe i think we act like hes out which leaves us which leaves us maneuvering stand by the whole portside structure was hot xrays tiny pelz said what they dont go through they heat up efficient at it harry trailed air lines behind the tanks in his backpack held an hour of air but without cooling he wouldnt live an hour it was already uncomfortable his trailing air lines were picking up heat sweat pooled when he jumped it ran down his face his arms his legs when he was still it couldnt run ive closed seventeentango harry reported moving forward i dont see any breaks in this section stand by ill send over steam for a test roger harry put his helmet next to jeff franklins and turned off the intercom all we need more heat sure hope it holds naw look a thin plume poured out ahead live steam absolutely clear up to two feet from the break kill the shunt harry said were losing pressure belay that gillespie said reddington youre a wonder im getting some control youre also losing steam can you fix it sure if you take the pressure off give me ten minutes harry rohrs said yeah i knew he didnt mean it harry scout ahead whats it like on forward hot sure be useful to know max has anybody ever suggested you change deodorants im moving forward it wasnt easy getting past the plume of leaking steam harry took it fast then waited for jeff the ship surged then surged again gillespie sounded excited goddam were turning head for big mama coming around almost there jason ready acceleration stand by harry grabbed for a ladder wham wham harry slapped on a patch and braced against the bulkhead while jeff franklin ran the torch metal glowed where franklin worked he was almost done maneuvering stand by shit give us a minute harry shouted stand by steam leaked from the side that franklin hadnt finished michael turned harrys head swam maneuver done acceleration stand by jason locked on and tracking take that mommy dearest acceleration wham wham maneuvering how do you get a transfer out of this chickenshit outfit harry demanded well you have to fuck up fuck up thats my problem all this time i tried to fuck off maneuvering acceleration stand by target acquired wham the gauge on his wrist said shit fire why couldnt they give me a normal thermometer jeff whats degrees about fahrenheit no wonder im hot thats what my suit shows harry hmm thats not your suit temperature thats you inside that thing they rammed up my ass oneohfive jeff its dangerous but not fatal what we have to do is cool off sure where acceleration stand by wham incoming missiles dead ahead target acquired acceleration stand by wham this is turret five we have a target permission to fire let her fly wham maneuvering stand by steam poured out through the leak harry braced a pry bar against one bulkhead and wedged the other end against the patch plate hammer he felt it in his right hand he grabbed a handhold with his left then pounded on the pry bar i got that one hit it with the welder im going forward the next compartment held a storage area for welding equipment and cooling air outlets harry tested the air pressure goddam jeff cool air be right with you harry gratefully found a corner to wedge himself into presently jeff franklin joined him the ship continued to accelerate franklin talked to the control room we need some time were getting goofy with the heat take ten minutes itll have to do had franklin been acting goofy harry hadnt noticed but the cool felt wonderful as if his skin were drinking a good brand of beer the air jetted through his suit and he waved his arms and legs to let it through there were no digit ships now atlantiss screen showed only the prime target unmistakably the mother ship now short and wide as in the last transmissions from kosmograd and riding a spear of violetwhite light the drive flame was swinging around trying to lose us jay hadley gloated the shuttles thrust dropped suddenly roy started violently relax jay said chunkchunk the empty main tank was free attitude jets popped and atlantis eased back until the mother ship was behind the main tank they cant get loose now they cant turn fast enough were on intercept and in missile range lets see what happens are you going to open the bay not just yet were too fragile with the bay open you know damn well what theyll do when were in range theyre doing it now i saw missiles before i turned us yeah intercept roy couldnt make himself feel surprised hes going to ram he didnt even ask me the shuttle main tank was a greenedged black shadow growing brighter big mama had its own defenses the main tank must be boiling and suddenly the main tanks black shadow vanished in half a dozen simultaneous flares missiles were homing on the explosions of other missiles the shuttle turned and roy felt the solid thumps of fragments impacting the tile shielding there would be no reentry for atlantis jay reached down to move lever arms that protruded through the floor these were new they connected to petcocks in the lower level water that had been ice at takeoff was jetting from vents in the shuttles nose the cloud of debris ahead thickened with water vapor it might hide atlantis but there was no hiding big mama her drive flame must be visible across half the world jay was firing the emu motors the smaller jets that connected to the shuttles onboard tank still on intercept yeah opening the bay lets get closer before we loose the birds if you did everything right theyll think were dead jay laughed the gauge showed harrys internal temperature at degrees ive gained some not enough incoming hang on oh shit michael shuddered we took something portside forward gillespie said losing steam pressure shes getting sluggish doesnt want to maneuver somethings wrong portside forward harry yeah max im on the way jeff lets do it progress was slow as they moved forward the ship was hotter and there was more damage handholds were missing new holes punched through some punch michaels armor was in layers steel armor fiberglass matting more steel armor layer after layer of hard and nonresilient soft anything coming through that had been moving fast and hadnt melted harry felt a tug he looked behind his air lines were stretched taut end of the line max we cant get further jeff franklin reported you have to were losing pressure just forward of you losing pressure yeah the most powerful spacecraft ever built by man is going to fail for lack of steam okay harry said ill go have a look he disconnected the line and now he was on canned air big mama was close close the drive flame the dark cylinder at its tip the sudden green flare the firefly lights of missiles pouring from four points along her flank firing said roy ill wait good missiles one through five away getting target acquisition for the next group weve actually got a few minutes dont we say two minutes before the missiles get here missiles six through ten away the green light had dimmed big mamas lasers had found more interesting targets atlantiss own missiles but were heating up oh fuck it we wont be taking it long how you doing target acquired missiles eleven through fifteen away thats all of them turn us now motors popped on atlantis turned belly toward big mama roy opened the petcocks again a cloud of water vapor might slow a missile or confuse its poor brain something slammed them against their seats again reentry is going to be a problem jay said and laughed it isnt atmosphere youre the shuttle twisted an explosion against one wing jay brought them back with attitude jets thinking of entering i wish i had a view nothing showed beyond the window save stars and a hail of green the reentry shield was boiling under big mamas lasers are we still on target id hate to miss after all this big mamas a big target jay said there didnt seem to be a hell of a lot more to say the portside bow was chaos steam poured from broken pipe and streamed through the ripped hull shut the damn steam off harry shouted maneuvering stand by harry if we cut the steam on port side i wont be able to maneuver incoming stand by michael shuddered again max rohrs was holding his calm but it sounded like he was fighting to do it steam pressure falling well try to shunt to secondary water sources what good will that do if we cant get the leak shut off harry studied the situation the compartment ahead was filled with steam and wreckage he could feel its heat radiating through his faceplate if i move real fast i can just jeff im going forward and close that valve ninealfa for the record rohrs overrode franklins answer dont unless you can open ninebravo we need that steam path oh holy shit roger here i go he dove forward the handholds were hot through his gloves the ship maneuvered so that he wasnt quite in freefall but there wasnt real gravity either ragged metal ends reached out to scrape against the hard upper torso of his suit he reached the valve wheel max nothing i dont think he can hear you jeff franklin said harry do you need help not enough room in here for two tell max im opening ninebravo now the big valve wheel didnt want to turn there was nothing to brace his feet against and the valve wouldnt respond to onehanded operation got to move slow careful think it through he placed his feet as carefully as an alpiner on a granite wall finally he had both braced his left foot wedged into a wide crack in one bulkhead turn you mother got it now to close ninealfa he didnt dare look at the temperature gauge on his wrist the valve wheel was all the way forward beyond it was a smoothedged hole four feet around stars shone through that between him and the valve was a jet of steam jeff make them stop acceleration for a moment i have to jump okay command this is franklin reddington needs things stable for a minute static in harrys intercom then franklin you can have two minutes exactly four minutes from now roger if i can live four more minutes he could hear each heartbeat as a base drum in his head slow down calm relax relaxation made the pounding sound worse there were flashes out there outside shadows flickered through the hole in the hull jeri melissa they never found the bodies hell here i come stand by harry ten seconds okay now harry leaped across the gap steam played over him it was cooler on the other side the black outside seemed to suck heat away got the valve turning it its turning shit have to brace my feet harry can they maneuver now he sensed urgency in franklins voice all right ill relay warnings acceleration stand by wham left foot here right foot okay grip turn turn his left foot slipped sharp pain ran up his shin a small plume of steam came out at the ankle steam that hot in my suit he tried to brace his foot again the universe shrank to a sticking valve wheel behind him the steam plume was tiny nearly as small as the plume from his suit you got it harry get the hell out of there coming turn you bastard turn his foot hurt like hell forward was the black of space cool if i wedge in that hole i can get leverage he moved forward one quick look outside the mother ship was far ahead still too far for details but the drive flame was a spear not a dot she had turned sideways trying to dodge to dodge one of the shuttles harry could see the familiar triangular silhouette limned against the flame easing forward past the flame flame burst from near the center of the cylinder they rammed harry thought and they did it right big mamas drive flame veered and suddenly there was a brighter streak in the violetwhite yellow and orange and the wavering flame was veering back into line but down the violetwhite spear ran a stream of bonfirecolored flame jeff yeah harry get out of there in a minute jeff tell the boss shuttle four atlantis they rammed they hurt that mother they hurt her i can see it did something to the drive they hurt her harry are you all right get out of there yeah they rammed they damaged her they damaged the drive now well catch her something inside the drive is boiling away you can see it in the flame and the impact point its a pit and i bet i can see four layers deep big mama must be built like a heinlein universe ship for spin you know layers wrapped around a freefall axis we hurt her yeah tell gillespie damn it you tell him come on harry harry shined his light down the small jet from his left ankle was pink the gauges showed that he had five minutes of air it was cool out here most of him outside the hull his legs were inside it was hot in there go back in there five minutes it takes three or four to get through there and its hot maneuvering acceleration stand by wham in there with acceleration incoming harry move cant move jeff anyway im leaking harry ill come get you bullshit get your goddam hero medal rescuing somebody else harry incoming missiles harry oh shit maneuvering stand by more missiles coming i think theyll hit harry said tell gillespie we hurt them tell him impact and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven revelation sometimes jeri wilson thought she heard or felt shocks but mostly there was the steadily increasing acceleration that had topped out at around one earth gravity no one or no fi had been interested in the storeroom shed lost all track of time arvid we cant just sit here doing nothing what would you have us do jeri glared at him youre the damned expert but we ought to be doing something dmitri spoke sharply in russian our commander says you should make less noise arvid said thats another thing why is he in charge youre smarter than he is you know spaceships he doesnt she felt arvids hand on her shoulder his fingers gripped tightly you wanted to come with us and youll send me away but he wasnt threatening worse than threats reminds me of promises we could we could open air shafts find a way to vacuum threaten the women and children you are bloodthirsty arvid said no i hate it this isnt my game at all but we have to do something we wouldnt have to kill them just show we could between that attacking ship and whatever we can do maybe theyll surrender dmitri spoke in russian tell her yourself arvid said it wont work dmitri said why we cannot threaten all of the women and children dmitri said without atomic weapons we cannot threaten all those aboard this ship thus why would they surrender but we would not surrender dmitri said not even comrade rogachev so why should the invaders jeri huddled in the corner we wait dmitri said we will have one chance we must not throw that away what if it never comes she asked listlessly the ship rang like a great brass bell the wall slammed against them thuktun flishithy shuddered with the impact alice picked herself off the duct floor her whole body was bruised there were spots before her eyes a whistling shriek echoed through the ducts the gravity fell to near zero then began to build again what the hell was that the scream was dying or else she was going deaf she moved to the nearest grill a horror was out there an armed snout floating in the hall turning stunned alice didnt stop to think she twisted the wing nuts loose and wriggled through the horror still hadnt made a move to anchor himself alice kicked toward him the tiny impact of a human body didnt wake him she pulled the gun from its holster the stock was short and very wide trigger in the middle safety did it have to be cocked tentacles wrapped around her and pulled alice shrieked and pushed the barrel against flesh and pulled the trigger the gun went whipping down the hall the snout moved the other way turning slowly spraying a cloud of dark red blood alice leapt after the gun damn thing would have killed me if id had it against my shoulder brace it against a wall or something next time have to fire with my left hand too her right arm flopped limp it was just starting to hurt she didnt notice the slanting duct until the second snout came out the snout emerged like a bomb caught itself herself the harness was a females against the wall she saw the spinning gun coming at her and alice behind alice couldnt even flee the walls werent in reach yet paykurtank caught the gun tossed it behind her and reached forward in plenty of time to catch alice the constricting tentacles sent new agony through her arm and hand alice screamed and fainted the impact had knocked jeri dizzy it wasnt just dizziness she was almost floating jeri clutched wildly and found a handful of wall rug air was escaping somewhere thuktun flishithy screame like a dying dinosaur arvid had already anchored himself he gripped jeris hand nikolai shouted something in russian dmitri answered the americans are coming jeri said i agree dmitri said something has damaged this ship it can only be the american ship that comrade rogachev was permitted to see nikolai spoke rapidly again he is right arvid said dmitri he is correct da correct about what jeri demanded the ships drive has been damaged arvid said you can feel it the gravity is much lower now it fell then builded but it has not come back to its original strength let us suppose the drive damaged and the americans in pursuit the invaders will wish to repair their drive rogachev dmitri brandished his captured pistol and shouted what must have been orders da tovarishch jeri we must prevent those repairs nikolai will lead us to the engine room control center we will attempt to destroy that rogachev took out his own pistol and inspected it satisfied he thrust it into his belt nikolai was already in the air duct dmitri waved frantically arvid moved to the shaft jeri you will follow me arvid said let us go right jeri wilson famous amazon all hundred and twenty pounds of her the russians had pressure suits she did not maybe i ought to think this over fithp soldiers reeled across the bridge wes dawson flailed to save himself and wound up clutching a fis harness the fi responded by wrapping digits around him the grip constricted the fi said you saw the weapon was it an automatic device wes had seen it on half the screens and through the window too in that last minute before impact my fithp have come knocking he said i am defensemaster tantarentfid and i assert my right to know are your automatics so agile it escaped our guns dawson grinned into eyes the size of oranges it was an ordinary space shuttle men weve rammed you man they died are you all rogues why ask me ask your breaker the fi hurled him away he picked himself up and moved toward a wall reeling in the dwindling gravity seeking a handhold no warning this time we actually did them some damage the hive was broken and the bees were in turmoil one warrior had rolled shrieking across the room denting a monitor console with his body damaging himself more he was getting medical attention the other had dawson back in restraint herdmaster i have our thrust up to five eighths gravity but a breath of this will ruin the drive we must make repairs we have no more time than that tantarentfid spoke into his microphone and listened to replies herdmaster i can guarantee no more time after crossing from the homeworld it has come to this the alien vessel was aimed directly at them it flared continuously and with each flare gammaray lasers shone through hull and walls and flesh and bone tiny spacecraft had spread from the enemy and now they hurled missiles to trample him tinier missiles leaped from message bearer to intercept that ship comes closer dawson will they trample us as the shuttle did herdmaster my people will do what they can to make you extinct this is the cost of the foot that is no surprise he would say that in any case for strength in negotiation defensemaster lead me maintain maximum thrust for a moment tantarentfid hesitated as you will takpussehyamp lead me you will assist we must send messages to he struggled with the alien name to the united states dawson will assist humans in africa had given them six possible loci for surviving government of that fithp they would all be the target of tightbeams now i must know what to say the herdmaster changed channels he could have leaned out the corridor and spoken to takpussehyamp but he didnt want dawson to hear the rogue humans thoughts had begun to matter breakertwo do you now have a what you called i have prepared two versions of a negotiated loss of status herdmaster though im sorry to hear you ask here channel the herdmaster read i must that thing will catch us we might destroy it when it comes near but it will send fire and gamma rays regardless our mates and our children are at ransom here and what breakertwo suggests is acceptable the dissidents should be joyful maintain this channel he motioned to the warn who led the human forward wes dawson i wish to negotiate a loss of status i dont understand takpussehyamp the herdmaster wishes to offer conditional surrender the air went out of dawson in full thrust he might have collapsed he said speak more you shall have winterhome earth we shall have the solar system why do you offer this now you see the screens your ship approaches it can harm us i would avoid that harm but dawson your fithp have no other ship for if they had they would have sent it that ship cant destroy us it can only harm us kill females and children i want to avoid that i wish to think of this dawsons eyes strayed to the screens message bearer had been ripped the edges of the hole still glowed red and orange sunhot plasma must have roared down the corridors against the dark back of winterhome a light pulsed smaller flames came near and flared green the ship rang to the tune of another explosion missiles exploding against the hull made a muffled thump you could hardly hear but when a missile went off in the scar the shuttle had left it was different vibrations came from everywhere with a sound like that of a smashed banjo dawson you act now or not at all i wont send your message a communications console buzzed pastempehkeph gestured to the breaker to answer not now dawson this is what you offered fathistehtulk we will depart africa all of the traveler fithp and the humans who wish to join us we will follow the paths we both know reaping the riches of space trading your soil grown products for metals and dawson dare to interrupt fathistehtulk knew me i see that now i want the solar system if im crazy thats partly your doing you are mad indeed when we have destroyed the intruder we will visit winterhome with destruction that ship was built under the sign of peace never again will we honor that we will trample every place large or small that ever displayed that sign dawson said nothing as i thought takpussehyamp was finished with his call he looked smug it is his thuktun he deserves one last play breakertwo speak to this rogue takpussehyamp turned dawson we have captured your mate paykurtank the priests acolyte found her after she left an air duct my mate is on earth dawson said untrue we know she is your mate because we watched you mating in the ducts dawson flushed so we watched you mating in your rooms we do not speak to amuse ourselves dawson you pretend to be a rogue but you have a mate a fis mate is clearly responsible for him your pretense is done hell if wed known wait a minute you captured alice the herdmaster was in a towering fury i would kill you this instant dawson did you not represent your fithp in council will you transmit our terms and let your breakertwo your president dawson your president surely has the rig to hear such an offer dawson said nothing i have him you have a point dawson said but you had to capture alice she was loose theyre all loose arent they where we will leave your world to heal the herdmaster pressed he had not really believed this would work negotiated loss status indeed there will be none of us on earth but there will be humans among our fithp surely your flthp and ours can survive alongside one another he said not believing a word of it humans will travel as passengers in our ships from us you will eventually learn to build your own but the losing fithp become part of the winners it had never been different dawsons objection fell very wide of tradition let you leave huh and go to saturn and repair your ship and what then then i dont understand breakertwo takpussehyamp said we fail to taste your problem whats to stop you from coming back with another foot our surrender you braindamaged rogue are you telling me that a negotiated dawson fell silent now what stops him ah the redhaired female had reached the bridge the frail human was nested in paykurtanks digits shed been hurt she was hugging her right foreleg she writhed at the sight of her mate wes the russians are loose i killed a snout good alice were hurting them we really are the herdmaster wants me to transmit a conditional surrender trouble is we cant trust it alice looked from dawson to the array of screens a female we know too little will she be able to hold him calm what counsel will she give was it an error to bring her here the herdmaster listened as dawson explained to alice her alien face was unreadable but the herdmaster could guess at the bloodthirsty joy as she watched the sparkling intruder come near when dawson finished speaking she said theyll come back yeah herdmaster takpusseh have you been trying to tell me that a negotiated loss of status is the same as a surrender the herdmaster couldnt speak takpussehyamp said we give our surrender forever you know us that well i have not been offered a surrender dawson said what is it you want but the herdmaster knew and he was trumpeting in agony now wish you my chest under your foot you shall not have that and every fi in earshot was staring at him fight your ship he trumpeted this battle is not concluded we waste time kill that enemy signal the moon base trample that planet until its leaders roll on their backs dawson we do not kill without reason you have given us reason enough hey wait if we wait that ship will harm us when it is close enough we kill it then there will be nothing to discuss speak to your president or return to your cell your offer isnt good enough i have made my last offer choose if man and fi had anything in common then dawson was in agony the muscles of his face looked like digits in knots his teeth were bared they ground together the female ruined it wes look my god your predecessor but dawson and alice were gaping past the herdmasters shoulder the herdmaster turned four screens showed four views of the engine room the floor was awash in blood the air itself was pink with spray nine corpses lay chewed as if by predators eight fithp warriors and the legless soviet in his curious legless suit the remaining three humans were tearing the place apart wes was in agony it was coffeys department coffeys thuktun and the stud bull had him dead to rights there but coffey would take the offer coffey would give away the solar system or dawson was about to give away the earth could that weird device smash message bearer or was it only coming close enough to die would the fithp honor a conditional surrender we taught them conditional surrender have we also taught them to break their parole wes look not now dammit died in his throat hed never seen this room before but it had that look machinery took its orders from here screens dials keyboards with keys the size of a childs fist and flthp corpses and blood amazingly red hemoglobin for sure like some madman had bombed a red cross blood bank nikolai was dead suit and man shredded by the huge fithp bullets arvid was in a pressure suit his faceplate was open showing a cossacks grin that would have frightened children he had braced a fithp rifle against a console and was firing bullets into randi controls dmitri wandered about examining the paraphernalia that made the ship go shying minimally when arvid blasted something as if arvid were a child at play and dmitri the adult were trying to learn something he stopped examined a console pried the cover off with a piece of steel bar he began tearing at wiring arvids rifle ran empty arvid grimaced then smiled toothily into the camera jeri wilson studied the scene judiciously wes wondered if she was in shock she climbed onto a console to bring her face close to a camera she shouted soundlessly put the sound on the defensemaster commanded negative said the herdmaster dawson your response what was the herdmaster afraid of hearing afraid that dawson might hear it didnt matter wes grinned at the fi they were in the ducts werent they and theyll be there again wandering through your air supply theres a great gaping hole in thuktun flishithy isnt there maybe they can open more locks random death in the life support system the ship hummed like a smashed banjo twice in quick succesion the herdmaster said dawson we will leave africa we will leave your earth you will have your solar system we will go another star you cant with time and your aid of course we can we will repair message bearer and build a new siskyissputh you will assist when we depart your system you will have your own that word the siskyissputh is the device we used to cross from homeworld to saturn it takes energy from the main drive and uses that energy to push against interstellar matter the siskyissputh is the door not to your own planets but to the worlds of other stars dawson why did you think we discarded it dawson staring got his lips working too massive you could not have reached saturn no dawson we came knowing that you might be more powerful than the traveler fithp we came to conquer or to surrender if we came to surrender we had the siskyissputh to offer our new fithp we let the siskyissputh hurl itself at the stars so that you cannot examine it i had it wrong that never never crossed my mind but you have tapes of thuktunthp we have the podo thuktun itself rogue that is the siskyissputh and the podo thuktuns supports are explosive but if we are to leave your star we must have another siskyissputh and you must build it with us when we leave you will know how to make another dawson i know that you want more than the planets take our negotiated loss of status or you will never leave your star wes hes crazy well have it in ten years wes once we know something is possible like the atomic bomb as soon as they knew it was possible everyone started working on how to build one the screens flickered dmitri jerked backward one foot was missing there were holes in the walls the humans moved to one corner jeri wilson continued to shout soundlessly at the cameras irrelevant were all irrelevant the herdmaster said the predecessors developed the siskyissputh it took more than eightcubed years dawson humans are a herd under siege by their own rogues you will not survive sixtyfour years and we might yet win this battle alice was strangling his arm wes its the same thing all over again theyll come back i wanted to be president why alice if they win can they win her grip slowly relaxed i dont know i dont either i cant decide this give me your microphone ill speak to the president terms of surrender for a promise made is a debt unpaid robert w service the screens had not changed for more than an hour general toland set down his coffee cup how many snouts does it take to change a light bulb the president wrinkled his brow in puzzlement none theyve invented torches no i have something jenny said gimlet this is michael theyre alive down below all the crews were cheering michael this is gimlet no new orders report if you can gimlet this is michael reporting we have inflicted heavy damage on the invader mother ship we have taken severe damage we have fifty percent casualties they are definitely running away we continue in pursuit stand by for digital data a picture emerged on the screen below michael with his whole portside kicked in one spurt bomb rack had vanished and the portside propulsion tower was dented and holed holy shit general toland muttered no wonder ed sounds tired more data a blurred image of the enemy ship it looked scarred estimate one hour to interception gillespie said jenny is that you michael this is gimlet colonel crichton here jenny tell linda i love her jenny looked quickly to the screens below they flowed and changed as michaels computer dumped in data they dont have enough bombs left to kill their velocity they cant come home unless they win admiral is there anything i ought to say president coffey asked youre the politician mr president meaning that its more important to me than to general gillespie colonel tell him dammit cut me in sir michael stand by for executive one general this is david coffey ill give your message to your wife anything else for the record posthumous awards for civilians i recommend the medal of freedom dr arthur grace pelz mr samuel cohen mr harry reddington military personnel excuse me ill switch on automatic digital reporting mr president its getting a bit thick godspeed general michael out the screens below shifted a composite picture of michael dented and torn bombs exploded aft as the big ship accelerated another screen showed a tiny earth surrounded by colored dots with arrows protruding velocity vectors the navy would need to learn a whole new way of reading maps if this kind of thing ever became common the alien invader was a large red spear michael in blue pursued relentlessly both vectors pointed away from earth michaels vector was longer the dots would be touching within the hour digit ships were orange dots they swarmed close around the earth a few were farther out and tens of thousands of miles away their orange arrows pointing toward the battle admiral carrell studied the screen the digit ships are no threat itll be all over by the time they get there is he going to ram general toland asked he cant come home admiral carrell said carefully under the circumstances what would you do damn straight toland said can he do it carrell shrugged general i expect the engineering people will be working on that question it would be interesting to know what they think sir jenny touched more buttons jenny crichton knew that was ed gillespie her sisters husband with no more than two hours to live and nothing anyone could do about it colonel jennifer crichton called the engineers dreamer fithp here engineering theyre all busy reynolds voice said so they have me answering the phone your projection ill give you colonel matthews al they want a projection matthews here we dont have a projection admiral carrell broke in colonel would you care to explain that sir given the damage michael has sustained and the defense capabilities demonstrated by the enemy a majority of my analysts believe the most likely event is mutual destruction of michael and the enemy mother ship we cant assign a probability to that a large minority of our people believe the enemy will be severely damaged but michael will be destroyed the threat team is nearly unanimous the enemy will do almost anything to prevent severe damage to the mother ship what does that mean almost anything carrell demanded certainly an offer of surrender sincere sir my apologies you cant know theyll also go all out to protect the mother ship their warriors arent likely to be less courageous than ours theyll throw everything they have no surprise there general toland said thank you colonel ill ask you to use screen five to display your projections yes sir on the screen below michaels blue crept toward the enemy red sir were getting something gimlet this is harpoon were getting a tightbeam message on the same frequency the aliens used when they sent that message to the president its for the president they want to talk general toland said put them on david coffey ordered alert the threat team to listen to this admiral carrell said harpoon put them on stand by to transmit replies roger stand by mr president mr president this is wes dawson come in mr president president coffey this wes dawson am i on coffey demanded yes sir president coffey spoke into the microphone congressman dawson this is president david coffey can you hear me mr president this is dawson i hear you i have an offer of conditional surrender from the herdmaster jenny knew his voice it was wes and he was all right she could see carlotta dawson down on the floor below carlotta was grinning like an idiot surrender toland muttered we must have hurt them admiral carrell waved impatiently the president said what terms wes dawsons laugh sounded half mad it could have been simply static thats the stumbling point all right here are the terms we call off the attack the enemy the traveler herd will vacate earth immediately theyll vacate the solar system as soon as possible what well have to do to bring that about involves building them a dawson stopped then seemed to sputter a siskyissputh they threw their own siskyissputh away while rounding the sun so that we couldnt examine it its a modified bussard ramjet get a technical expert to explain that to you its the key to the stars and when weve built theirs well know how to build one for ourselves the herdmaster has offered these terms not the formal surrender of his herd i am not to have my foot on any fis chest this was made clear do you understand i understand have you a time period for the evacuation of earth no im not sure they can enforce it anyway the fithp can split into smaller herds and its possible the ones in africa wont leave dawson dawson come in dawson africa can take care of itself general toland said hell the snouts cant fight with nobody to drop meteors for them let the zulus have em no threat to us agreed admiral carrell said did they cut dawson off dawson here they didnt want me to say that they should have let me finish the ones in africa wont matter theyll be glad to call a truce they dont want kansas mr president i cannot tell you whats happening outside do you know wes were in communication with the archangel the commander is general gillespie they expect to destroy the enemy mother ship within two hours certainly we know whats happening the herdmaster wants me to repeat the offer you call off what did you call it archangel good name you call off ed gillespie and theyll use the digit ships to rescue michael and the smaller ships everyone who wants to leave africa will get a chance any that stay wont be a problem theyll tell us how to build an interstellar drive mr president theyre prepared to destroy all the plans for that drive theyve been planning this for years since before they ever reached the solar system they planned to surrender the interstellar drive if they couldnt defeat us should we take this offer the president asked im sorry president coffey i dont know enough and its not my choice they made a previous offer i decided not to transmit mr president theyll give you its about ten minutes they say theyre mobilizing to fight archangel i dont know what with they say that once they start doing that they will have no reason to surrender are they listening to me can they understand theyre listening some understand tell them they will have to wait while i get advice they understand that sir all right hang on they want you to have archangel stop shooting while you decide the reason they want to negotiate is to keep you from damaging thuktun flishithy because its carrying all their females and childr wes wes whats happened a strange voice cold sibilant spoke this is teacher takpussehyamp go seek your advice we will listen get michael admiral carrell ordered can he tell us enough president coffey wondered aloud whatever he knows well need to talk with him carrell michael this is gimlet michael this is gimlet go ahead gimlet jenny motioned to admiral carrell general were pretty certain our codes are good but youll excuse me if i use circumlocutions understood mama wants to kiss and make up we live in separate houses only you have to stop projecting dinnerware at her right now great white father needs a lawyer youre it ah roger tell big daddy we dont have lockjaw yet but you never know michael have you enough dinnerware we are running short of dinnerware the family car needs repair too can win the case but cannot stop to discuss alimony thank you michael carry on gimlet out admiral carrell nodded speaking mostly to himself as i thought if he stops now theyll outrun him michael fights on while we decide this send for hap aylesworth and get me the threat team the president said nat had been waiting for the phone to ring dreamer fithp nat reynolds here weve been listening mr reynolds your opinion what do we do about this offer accept or let archangel go for the throat bearing in mind that archangel might not make it the others were crowded close around him with harpanets huge head protruding between sets of shoulders they all looked like they were ready to jump down his throat nat said give us five minutes take four nat hung up ill take a poll keep it short sherry theyll honor a surrender take the offer bob bob burnham shook his massive white head its not a physics problem oh if we let them go they can go straight for the moon then they own us but whether theyll do it nat you never liked my aliens right curtis nuke em till they glow then shoot em in the dark sherry you can cool it joe joe ransom hesitated spoke in a rush i abstain its too even i wish bob anson were here we all do so we dont know discussion one minute each sherry its not complicated when they surrender they stay surrendered yeah but okay wade no theyll go back to saturn repair their ship and come back with a fucking moon we win now or we never do as for surrender bullshit sherry the surrender a fi honors is a foot on the chest and join the herd as a slave they havent offered surrender joe by damn they havent have they but theyve been giving conditional surrender in africa they understand the concept sure said curtis charnel house books understands contracts too but they dont honor them sherry if they dont offer a foot on the chest you cant argue that their reflexes are involved i havent heard you commit yourself nat right harpanet this is a peculiar case you joined the dreamer fithp before you ever heard of a conditional surrender not so i know of such a case in our history say on but keep it short the fi said there was a war others had been fought with nuclear weapons and so was this the south land mass fithp evolved a disease that would feed on the edible grasses of the east land mass they demonstrated this for the east land mass fithp and learned that they had evolved something similar we dont have time harpanet lead me the planet was harmed more harm would come maybe all fithp would follow the predecessors into death the herdmasters met and agreed to use the knowledge in the sky thuktun to build a spacecraft the high ranks of one flthp would travel to the nearest star which was known to house intelligence when thuktun flishithy was prepared the two fithp would gamble for who must leave was the agreement honored it was we are here do you know of any other such event ffuff within a flthp such adjustments are common between fithp very rare okay reynolds raised the phone mr president they barely heard the knock through the thick soundproof door jack clybourne opened it hap aylesworth fat bearded his hair a mess came in you wanted me sir right with you reynolds we cant agree its a good bet theyd keep their surrender theres even precedent we dont like the size of the pot i dont either thank you the president hung up hap i need advice have you been listening yes sir seconds flowed on the big digital timer six minutes jenny said i thought the threat team people would know coffey said but they dont general admiral you heard your advice the human race wont be safe until the invaders are disarmed general toland said the president jerked a thumb toward the big screens outside and if they defeat michael they could you know unlikely admiral carrell said i beg your pardon admiral theyre closing fast unless michael does something stupid theyre bound to ram i believe you can depend on general gillespie to detonate every bomb aboard at closest approach your advice admiral admiral carrell raised an eyebrow at the timer i think i would do nothing at all all their women and children they came from the stars they offer an interstellar drive we lose all that and keep the earth carrell said but at what price hap pass i know how to win elections this ones beyond me gimlet this is michael big mamas mad shes got all the children in the fight i mean shes really mad one of the screens below flashed then flashed again theyre really pounding each other general toland said go for it gillespie no president coffey said colonel get me general gillespie inform him that i have new orders then get wes dawson we can end this with honor mr president please general toland said sir the risk is just too damned high thor tell him ive heard your advice general i dont need it again colonel if you please jenny reached for the keys her hand moved slowly reluctantly visions of dolls and smashed children came unwanted and corpses heaped high in a topeka street human shapes merging as they decayed she stood no sir colonel i resign admiral carrel no mr president coffey turned to the door jack clybourne stood solidly against it mr clybourne you too jack said nothing i am the commander in chief hap tell them im not the commander in chief david colonel will you at least do me the courtesy of calling mrs coffey jenny looked to admiral carrell he shook his head sir there wouldnt be time to explain anything to her ill have you all shot possibly general toland said tomorrow but just now we have about three minutes damn you all those creatures will blow michael apart and then theyll own the earth no sir admiral carrell said it is you who risks the earth we risk only mankinds enemies coffey sat and buried his head in his hands after a moment admiral carrell lifted the microphone colonel get me mr dawson sir congressman dawson this is admiral carrell the president is not available what tell the enemy commander that his offer is rejected steel plates now covered the windows the sky was alive with green flares and retinaburnwhite explosions fithp in pressure suits crawled across the slagged hull towing equipment message bearer rang like a smashed banjo and the herdmaster trumpeted how are they doing this defensemaster the wound in sector five is turned full away from the intruder and has been since before you ordered it herdmaster the tiny ships circle and fire into the wound they are not using rockets and our lasers cannot find inert projectiles then kill me those flying guns takpussehyamp was there an answer from the president but he knew takpussehyamps digits were rigid across his head they still strangled the receiver with which he had been monitoring dawsons conversation dawson say goodbye herdmaster well find our own path to the stars and you wont be there waiting could you not persuade the presidents not available i know david coffey he must be dead or dying admiral carrell is in charge now the attackmaster he wants you extinct and he wouldnt listen to me if i pleaded im not even sure hes wrong wes did we win i think so hang on alice its not likely to be long now the herdmaster asked what would you have of me dawson two months in solitary confinement herdmaster but i dont think well have the time dawsons grip tightened on the wall rung as message bearer shuddered sideways despite the danger he was standing fully erect get me my mate the herdmaster ordered safe room two was jammed with females and children the noise was terrible to hear comforting adult voices bleating of terrified infants the herd is attacked his mate cried keph whats happening the children are going rogue keph i want to surrender there was an awful silence then the last voice pastempehkeph wanted to hear was speaking you would surrender the traveler fithp you fool rogue my mate would have had us safely circling saturn if you had not stripped him of his status i acknowledge this you in safe room two must speak for the rest will the females consent to surrender let me speak to the defensemaster tantarentfid clicked on pastempehkeph listened with half his attention damage weapons intruder closing at five makasrupkithp per breath targeted dead on able to turn faster than message bearer ever could if we vaporize the enemy the globules will condense and kill us if we kill all aboard the bomb will explode when it is close our only chance of escape is for the enemy to guide that ship away from us surrender said chowpeentulk roll on your back for my mates murderer surrender keph we are agreed the herdmaster stepped staggered into the corridor between crash pads dawson the ship is yours i want to see the other humans screens blurred then sharpened arvid rogachev and jeri wilson stood close together in the midst of carnage and wreckage dmitri lay in one corner give them weapons and escort them here i obey now turn off your drive blow up all missiles in flight dont send any more agreed we need your ship alive dawson make haste tell your herdmaster that ship must not strike us when i hear you give those orders tantarentfid destroy our missiles now continue to use laser to stop incoming weaponry begin damping the drive lead me the herdmaster could not have imagined how those words would hurt the eyes of his fithp were all around him pastempehkeph rolled on his back in the aisle herdmaster wes dawson said alice wes did we really win he held out his hand the frail redhead moved to join him dawson took her hand together they stepped forward and set their feet on the herdmasters advisors chest about the authors individually larry niven and jerry pournelle are two of todays most popular authors the awardwinning novel ringworld and
