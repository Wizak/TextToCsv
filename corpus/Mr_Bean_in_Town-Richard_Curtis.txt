took the coin out of the paper and put it on the top of the washing machine then he put the fivepence coin back into his jacket next he opened the washing machine a man came into the launderette with a bag of dirty clothes under his arm he was young and strong when he saw mr bean he smiled but it wasnt a nice smile he didnt say hello or good morning he pushed mr bean away from the washing machine what began mr bean then the young man pushed mr beans onepound coins on to the next machine mr bean was angry he turned round to speak angrily but then he saw the young man taking a white karate suit out of his bag a karate suit thought mr bean so he can fight perhaps i wont say anything the young man pushed his white karate suit into the washing machine then he put some money into the machine and sat down on a chair he took a magazine out of his bag and began to read mr bean started to put his clothes into his washing machine there were some pairs of underpants monday he said and he put one pair into the machine tuesday he put the next pair into the machine thursday friday saturday three pairs went into the machine mr bean stopped wednesday he thought where are wednesdays underpants oh its wednesday today and im wearing them what could he do he had to wash them so he had to take them off he looked round where can i go he thought there was a partition near the washing machines ill go behind that he thought he started to walk to the partition but the young man put his legs across the floor he wanted to make mr bean angry but mr bean remembered the karate suit the man could fight he walked round the young mans legs and said nothing he went behind the partition and carefully took off his brown trousers the young woman put some of her clothes into one of the very big washing machines the other clothes were on the top of a smaller machine near the partition she didnt watch her clothes very carefully she didnt see mr bean put a hand round the partition and she didnt see him put his brown trousers down with her clothes mr bean took off his underpants wednesdays underpants then he put his hand round the partition he took something but it wasnt his brown trousers it was a long brown skirt mr bean put on the skirt and came out from behind the partition he walked back to his washing machine the young woman took the brown trousers from the top of the smaller washing machine she didnt look at them she put them into the big machine next she shut the door of the machine and took a magazine then she sat down on a chair near the dryers and started to read she had her back to mr bean so she didnt see him wearing her skirt mr bean put his wednesday underpants into his washing machine then he closed the door and put in his three onepound coins he sat down on a chair and saw the skirt oh no he thought whats this a skirt where are my trousers the young man walked past and mr bean tried to hide the skirt with his hands i dont want him to see me in this skirt he thought what will he think the young man went across to a machine on the wall and bought a cup of conditioner mr bean got up and went back to the partition he looked at the washing machine next to it and remembered the young womans clothes she put my trousers in the big washing machine with her things he thought he went across to the big washing machine and tried to open it but he couldnt do it ill have to wait he thought and he walked back to his chair the young man put his cup of conditioner on the top of his washing machine then he looked at mr bean and saw the skirt he started to laugh mr bean looked away quickly he got his black bag and a pair of underpants fell out of it oh sundays underpants he said he tried to stop his washing machine and open the door but the machine didnt stop what can i do he thought he looked down at the skirt i know ill wear sundays underpants under this skirt thats a good idea he looked round then went across to the conditioner machine away from the other people carefully he started to put on sundays underpants he put his feet into them and suddenly he couldnt pull them up he couldnt move them there was a strange foot on them it was the young mans foot mr bean turned round and saw the young man laughing at him mr bean wanted to shout go away you stupid man but he was too afraid after a minute the young man laughed again and went back to his chair mr bean quickly pulled up sundays underpants he was angry i dont like people laughing at me he thought and he looked at the young man what can i do to him i cant fight him hes too strong then he had an idea there was a coffee machine next to the machine for conditioner mr bean went across to it and got a cup of black coffee he smiled and walked back to his washing machine with the coffee the young mans eyes were on his magazine he didnt look at mr bean or the washing machine now thought mr bean and he quickly changed the young mans cup of conditioner for his cup of black coffee then he carried the cup of conditioner to his chair and sat down he smiled that will teach him a lesson he thought after a minute the young man stood up and went to his machine he had to put the conditioner into it now he stood next to the machine and laughed at mr beans skirt so he didnt look at the cup when he put the conditioner into the top of his washing machine but of course it wasnt conditioner it was black coffee mr bean tried not to laugh the young man sat down in his chair again and looked across at his washing machine there was a window in the door and the young man could see his white karate suit going round and round in the water but the suit wasnt white now it was brown what he shouted he jumped up he ran across to the cup and looked inside it then he put it to his nose and smelled it coffee he shouted then he looked across at mr bean did you mr bean didnt answer but his face said who me he pretended to drink his cup of coffee but it wasnt coffee it was conditioner the young man went to find the launderette manager mr bean stopped drinking and said aaaagh the young man showed the brown karate suit to the launderette manager whats wrong sir said the manager this karate suit was white when i came in here said the young man now look at it what did you do to it said the manager me i didnt do anything to it said the young man angrily he pulled the manager across to his washing machine this is your machine is that right yyes said the manager the young man showed him the karate suit again this cost me two hundred pounds he said what are you going to do about it er will you come to my office please sir said the manager we can talk about it there mr bean sat opposite a large dryer his underpants and other things were in the machine they were clean now and nearly dry mr bean waited after a minute the dryer stopped he got up and opened the door then he started to take out his clothes a minute or two later the young woman came to the next dryer and started to take out her clothes they were dry too perhaps my trousers are in there thought mr bean the young woman took some clothes out of the machine and put them into a bag then she went back to the big washing machine for her other clothes mr bean moved quickly he started to look through her clothes for his trousers but he couldnt find them where are they he thought theyre here somewhere wait a minute perhaps she left them in the dryer so he looked inside it first he put his head into the machine i cant see anything he thought its too dark next he climbed into the machine the young woman was busy at the big washing machine she didnt see mr bean climb into the dryer then she took something out of the big washing machine her eyes opened wide whats this she thought a pair of trousers i havent got any brown trousers she threw them on to one of the other washing machines then she took her clothes across to the dryer mr bean was inside the dryer where are my trousers he thought suddenly the womans washing began to fly into the machine a skirt a dress and some shirts what began mr bean then the dryer door shut with a bang oh no thought mr bean he turned and climbed back to the door help he shouted through the window in the door theres somebody in here but the woman couldnt hear him she took a pound coin and put it into the dryer mr bean hit the window in the dryer door bang bang but nobody heard him i cant get out he shouted suddenly it was very hot inside the dryer there was a noise and the machine started the clothes began to go round and round and mr
