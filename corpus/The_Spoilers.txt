out over the harbor agleam with the lights of anchored ships then up at the crenelated mountains black against the sky he drank the cool air burdened with its taints of the sea while the blood of his boyhood leaped within him oh its fine fine he murmured and this is my country my country after all dex its in my veins this hunger for the north i grow i expand careful you dont bust warned dextry ive seen men get plumb drunk on mountain air dont expand too strong in one spot he went back abruptly to his pipe its villanous fumes promptly averting any danger of the airs too tonic quality gad what a smudge sniffed the younger man you ought to be in quarantine id ruther smell like a man than talk like a kid you desecrate the hour of meditation with rhapsodies on nature when your aesthetics aint honed up to the beauties of good tobacco the other laughed inflating his deep chest in the gloom he stretched his muscles restlessly as though an excess of vigor filled him they were lounging upon the dock while before them lay the santa maria ready for her midnight sailing behind slept unalaska quaint antique and russian rusting amid the fogs of bering sea where a week before mildeyed natives had dried their cod among the old bronze cannon now a frenzied horde of goldseekers paused in their rush to the new el dorado they had come like a locust cloud thousands strong settling on the edge of the smoky sea waiting the going of the ice that barred them from their golden fleece from nome the new where men found fortune in a night the mossy hills back of the village were ridged with graves of those who had died on the outtrip the fall before when a plague had gripped the land but what of that gold glittered in the sands so said the survivors therefore men came in armies glenister and dextry had left nome the autumn previous the young man raving with fever now they returned to their own land this air whets every animal instinct in me glenister broke out again away from the cities i

crazy i wish somebody would try to jump the midas wed enjoy the exercise the siren of the santa maria interrupted its hoarse warning throbbing up the mountain well have to get aboard said dextry shh whats that the other whispered at first the only sound they heard was a stir from the deck of the steamer then from the water below them came the rattle of rowlocks and a voice cautiously muffled stop stop there a skiff burst from the darkness grounding on the beach beneath a figure scrambled out and up the ladder leading to the wharf immediately a second boat plainly in pursuit of the first one struck on the beach behind it as the escaping figure mounted to their level the watchers perceived with amazement that it was a young woman breath sobbed from her lungs and stumbling she would have fallen but for glenister who ran forward and helped her to her feet dont let them get me she panted he turned to his partner in puzzled inquiry but found that the old man had crossed to the head of the landing ladder up which the pursuers were climbing just a minute you there back up or ill kick your face in dextrys voice was sharp and unexpected and in the darkness he loomed tall and menacing to those below get out of the way that womans a runaway came from the one highest on the ladder so i jedge she broke qu shut up broke in another do you want to advertise it get out of the way there ye damn fool climb up thorsen he spoke like a bucko mate and his words stirred the bile of dextry thorsen grasped the dock floor trying to climb up but the old miner stamped on his fingers and the sailor loosened his hold with a yell carrying the under men with him to the beach in his fall this way follow me shouted the mate making up the bank for the shore end of the wharf youd better pull your freight miss dextry remarked theyll be here in a minute yes yes let us go i must get aboard the santa maria shes leaving now come come glenister laughed as though there were a humorous touch in her remark but did not stir im gettin awful old an stiff to run said dextry removing his mackinaw but i allow i aint too old for a little diversion in the way of a roughhouse when it comes nosin around he moved lightly though the girl could see in the halfdarkness that his hair was silvery what do you mean she questioned sharply you hurry along miss well toy with em till youre aboard they stepped across to the dockhouse backing against it the girl followed again came the warning blast from the steamer and the voice of an officer clear away that stern line oh well be left she breathed and somehow it struck glenister that she feared this more than the men whose approaching feet he heard you can make it all right he urged her roughly youll get hurt if you stay here run along and dont mind us weve been thirty days on shipboard and were praying for something to happen his voice was boyishly glad as if he exulted in the fray that was to come and no sooner had he spoken than the sailors came out of the darkness upon them during the space of a few heartbeats there was only a tangle of whirling forms with the sound of fist on flesh then the blot split up and forms plunged outward falling heavily again the sailors rushed attempting to clinch they massed upon dextry only to grasp empty air for he shifted with remarkable agility striking bitterly as an old wolf snaps it was baffling work however for in the darkness his blows fell short or overreached glenister on the other hand stood carelessly beating the men off as they came to him he laughed gloatingly deep in his throat as though the encounter were merely some rough sport the girl shuddered for the desperate silence of the attacking men terrified her more than a din and yet she stayed crouched against the wall dextry swung at a dim target and missing it was whirled off his balance instantly his antagonist grappled with him and they fell to the floor while a third man shuffled about them the girl throttled a scream im goin to kick im bill the man panted hoarsely le me fix im he swung his heavy shoe and bill cursed with stirring eloquence ow youre kickin me ive got im safe enough tackle the big un bills ally then started towards the others his body bent his arms flexed yet hanging loosely he crouched beside the girl ignoring her while she heard the breath wheezing from his lungs then silently he leaped glenister had hurled a man from him then stepped back to avoid the others when he was seized from behind and felt the mans arms wrapped about his neck the sailors legs locked about his thighs now came the girls first knowledge of real fighting the two spun back and forth so closely entwined as to be indistinguishable the others holding off for what seemed many minutes they struggled the young man striving to reach his adversary till they crashed against the wall near her and she heard her champions breath coughing in his throat at the tightening grip of the sailor fright held her paralyzed for she had never seen men thus a moment and glenister would be down beneath their stamping feet they would kick his life out with their heavy shoes at thought of it the necessity of action smote her like a blow in the face her terror fell away her shaking muscles stiffened and before realizing what she did she had acted the seamans back was to her she reached out and gripped him by the hair while her fingers tense as talons sought his eyes then the first loud sound of the battle arose the man yelled in sudden terror and the others as suddenly fell back the next instant she felt a hand upon her shoulder and heard dextrys voice are ye hurt no come on then or well get left he spoke quietly though his breath was loud and glancing down she saw the huddled form of the sailor whom he had fought thats all right he aint hurt its a jap trick i learned hurry up they ran swiftly down the wharf followed by glenister and by the groans of the sailors in whom the lust for combat had been quenched as they scrambled up the santa marias gangplank a strip of water widened between the boat and the pier close shave that panted glenister feeling his throat gingerly but i wouldnt have missed it for a spotted pup ive been through biler explosions and snowslides not to mention a triflin jaildelivery but fer real sprightly diversions i dont recall nothin more pleasin than this dextrys enthusiasm was boylike what kind of men are you the girl laughed nervously but got no answer they led her to their deck cabin where they switched on the electric light blinking at each other and at their unknown guest they saw a graceful and altogether attractive figure in a trim short skirt and long tan boots but what glenister first saw was her eyes large and gray almost brown under the electric light they were active eyes he thought and they flashed swift comprehensive glances at the two men her hair had fallen loose and crinkled to her waist all agleam otherwise she showed no sign of her recent ordeal glenister had been prepared for the type of beauty that follows the frontier beauty that may stun but that has the polish and chill of a newground bowie instead this girl with the calm reposeful face struck a note almost painfully different from her surroundings suggesting countless pleasant things that had been strange to him for the past few years pure admiration alone was patent in the older mans gaze i make oration said he that youre the gamest little chap i ever fought over mexikin injun or white whats the trouble i suppose you think ive done something dreadful dont you she said but i havent i had to get away from the ohio tonight for certain reasons ill tell you all about it tomorrow i havent stolen anything nor poisoned the crew really i havent she smiled at them and glenister found it impossible not to smile with her though dismayed by her feeble explanation well ill wake up the steward and find a place for you to go he said at length youll have to double up with some of the women though its awfully crowded aboard she laid a detaining hand on his arm he thought he felt her tremble no no i dont want you to do that they mustnt see me tonight i know im acting strangely and all that but its happened so quickly i havent found myself yet ill tell you tomorrow though really dont let any one see me or it will spoil everything wait till tomorrow please she was very white and spoke with eager intensity help you why sure mike assured the impulsive dextry an see here miss you take your time on explanations we dont care a cuss what you done morals aint our long suit cause theres never a law of god or man runs north of fiftythree as the poetry man remarked an he couldnt have spoke truer if hed knowed what he was sayin everybody is privileged to look out his own game up here a square deal an no questions asked she looked somewhat doubtful at this till she caught the heat of glenisters gaze some boldness of his look brought home to her the actual situation and a stain rose in her cheek she noted him more carefully noted his heavy shoulders and ease of bearing an ease and looseness begotten of perfect muscular control strength was equally suggested in his face she thought for he carried a marked young countenance with thrusting chin aggressive thatching brows and mobile mouth that whispered all the changes from strength to abandon prominent was a look of reckless energy she considered him handsome in a heavy virile perhaps too purely physical fashion you want to stowaway he asked ive had a right smart experience in that line said dextry but i never done it by proxy whats your plan she will stay here tonight said glenister quickly you and i will go below nobody will see her i cant let you do that she objected isnt there some place where i can hide but they reassured her and left when they had gone she crouched trembling upon her seat for a long time gazing fixedly before her im afraid she whispered im afraid what am i getting into why do men look so at me im frightened oh im sorry i undertook it at last she rose wearily the close cabin oppressed her she felt the need of fresh air so turning out the lights she stepped forth into the night figures loomed near the rail and she slipped astern screening herself behind a lifeboat where the cool breeze fanned her face the forms she had seen approached speaking earnestly instead of passing they stopped abreast of her hidingplace then as they began to talk she saw that her retreat was cut off and that she must not stir what brings her here glenister was echoing a question of dextrys bah what brings them all what brought the duchess and cherry malotte and all the rest no no said the old man she aint that kind shes too fine too delicate too pretty thats just it too pretty too pretty to be alone or anything except what she is dextry growled sourly this country has plumb ruined you boy you think theyre all alike an i dont know but they are all but this girl seems like shes different somehow but i cant tell glenister spoke musingly i had an ancestor who buccaneered among the indies a long time ago so im told sometimes i think i have his disposition he comes and whispers things to me in the night oh he was a devil and ive got his blood in me untamed and hot i can hear him saying something now something about the spoils of war ha ha maybe hes right i fought for her tonight dex the way he used to fight for his sweethearts along the mexicos shes too beautiful to be good and theres never a law of god or man runs north of fiftythree they moved on his vibrant cynical laughter stabbing the girl till she leaned against the yawl for support she held herself together while the blood beat thickly in her ears then fled to the cabin hurling herself into her berth where she writhed silently beating the pillow with hands into which her nails had bitten staring the while into the darkness with dry and aching eyes chapter ii the stowaway she awoke to the throb of the engines and gazing cautiously through her stateroom window saw a glassy level sea with the sun brightly agleam on it so this was bering she had clothed it always with the mystery of her schooldays thinking of it as a weeping fogbound stretch of gray waters instead she saw a flat sunlit main with occasional seaparrots flapping their fat bodies out of the ships course a glistening head popped up from the waters abreast and she heard the cry of seal dressing the girl noted minutely the personal articles scattered about the cabin striving to derive therefrom some fresh hint of the characteristics of the owners first there was an elaborate copperbacked toiletset all richly ornamented and leatherbound the metal was magnificently handworked and bore glenisters initial it spoke of elegant extravagance and seemed oddly out of place in an arctic miners equipment as did also a small set of de maupassant next she picked up kiplings seven seas marked liberally and felt that she had struck a scent the roughness and brutality of the poems had always chilled her though she had felt vaguely their splendid pulse and swing this was the girls first venture from a sheltered life she had not rubbed elbows with the world enough to find that truth may be rough unshaven and garbed in homespun the book confirmed her analysis of the junior partner pendent from a hook was a worn and blackened holster from which peeped the butt of a large colts revolver showing evidence of many years service it spoke mutely of the whitehaired dextry who before her inspection was over knocked at the door and when she admitted him addressed her cautiously the boys down forrad teasin grub out of a flunky hell be up in a minute howd ye sleep very well thank you she lied but ive been thinking that i ought to explain myself to you now see here the old man interjected there aint no explanations needed till you feel like givin them up you was in trouble thats unfortunate we help you thats natural no questions asked thats alaska yes but i know you must think what bothers me the other continued irrelevantly is how in blazes were goin to keep you hid the stewards got to make up this room and somebodys bound to see us packin grub in i dont care who knows if they wont send me back they wouldnt do that would they she hung anxiously on his words send you back why dont you savvy that this boat is bound for nome there aint no turnin back on gold stampedes and this is the wildest rush the world ever saw the captain wouldnt turn back he couldnt his cargos too precious and the company pays five thousand a day for this ship no we aint puttin back to unload no stowaways at five thousand per besides we passengers wouldnt let him times too precious they were interrupted by the rattle of dishes outside and dextry was about to open the door when his hand wavered uncertainly above the knob for he heard the hearty greeting of the ships captain well well glenister wheres all the breakfast going oo whispered the old man thats cap stephens dextry isnt feeling quite up to form this morning replied glenister easily dont wonder why werent you aboard sooner last night i saw you most got left eh served you right if you had then his voice dropped to the confidential id advise you to cut out those women dont misunderstand me boy but theyre a bad lot on this boat i saw you come aboard take my word for it theyre a bad lot cut em out guess ill step inside and see whats up with dextry the girl shrank into her corner gazing apprehensively at the other listener well er he isnt up yet they heard glenister stammer better come around later nonsense its time he was dressed the masters voice was gruffly goodnatured hello dextry hey open up for inspection he rattled the door there was nothing to be done the old miner darted an inquiring glance at his companion then at her nod slipped the bolt and the captains blue bulk filled the room his grizzled closebearded face was genially wrinkled till he spied the erect gray figure in the corner when his cap came off involuntarily there his courtesy ended however and the smile died coldly from his face his eyes narrowed and the goodfellowship fell away leaving him the stiff and formal officer ah he said not feeling well eh i thought i had met all of our lady passengers introduce me dextry dextry squirmed under his cynicism well i ah didnt catch the name myself what oh there aint much to say this is the lady we brought aboard last night thats all who gave you permission nobody there wasnt time there wasnt time eh which one of you conceived the novel scheme of stowing away ladies in your cabin whose is she quick answer me indignation was vibrant in his voice oh the girl cried her eyes widening darkly she stood slim and pale and slightly trembling his words had cut her bitterly though through it all he had scrupulously avoided addressing her the captain turned to glenister who had entered and closed the door is this your work is she yours no he answered quietly while dextry chimed in better hear details captain before you make breaks like that we helped the lady sidestep some sailors last night and we most got left doing it it was up to her to make a quick getaway so we helped her aboard a poor story what was she running away from he still addressed the men ignoring her completely till with hoarse voice she broke in you mustnt talk about me that way i can answer your questions its true i ran away i had to the sailors came after me and fought with these men i had to get away quickly and your friends helped me on here from gentlemanly kindness because they saw me unprotected they are still protecting me i cant explain how important it is for me to reach nome on the first boat because it isnt my secret it was important enough to make me leave my uncle at seattle at an hours notice when we found there was no one else who could go thats all i can say i took my maid with me but the sailors caught her just as she was following me down the ships ladder she had my bag of clothes when they seized her i cast off the rope and rowed ashore as fast as i could but they lowered another boat and followed me the captain eyed her sharply and his grim lines softened a bit for she was cleancut and womanly and utterly out of place he took her in shrewdly detail by detail then spoke directly to her my dear young lady the other ships will get there just as quickly as ours maybe more quickly tomorrow we strike the icepack and then it is all a matter of luck yes but the ship i left wont get there at this the commander started and darting a great thickfingered hand at her spoke savagely whats that what ship which one did you come from answer me the ohio she replied with the effect of a handgrenade the master glared at her the ohio good god you dare to stand there and tell me that he turned and poured his rage upon the others she says the ohio dye hear youve ruined me ill put you in irons all of you the ohio what dye mean whats up whats up theres smallpox aboard the ohio this girl has broken quarantine the health inspectors bottled up the boat at six oclock last night thats why i pulled out of unalaska ahead of time to avoid any possible delay now well all be held up when we get to nome great heavens do you realize what this means bringing this hussy aboard his eyes burned and his voice shook while the two partners stared at each other in dismay too well they knew the result of a smallpox panic aboard this crowded troopship not only was every available cabin bulging with passengers but the lower decks were jammed with both humanity and live stock all in the most unsanitary conditions the craft built for three hundred passengers was carrying triple her capacity men and women were stowed away like cattle order and a halftolerable condition were maintained only by the efforts of the passengers themselves who held to the thought that imprisonment and inconvenience would last but a few days longer they had been aboard three weeks and every heart was aflame with the desire to reach nome to reach it ahead of the pressing horde behind what would be the temper of this goldfrenzied army if thrown into quarantine within sight of their goal the impatient hundreds would have to lie packed in their floating prison submitting to the foul disease long they must lie thus till a month should have passed after the disappearance of the last symptom if the disease recurred sporadically that might mean endless weeks of maddening idleness it might even be impossible to impose the necessary restraint there would be violence perhaps mutiny the fear of the sickness was nothing to dextry and glenister but of their mine they thought with terror what would happen in their absence where conditions were as unsettled as in this new land where titles were held only by physical possession of the premises during the long winter of their absence ice had held their treasure inviolate but with the warming summer the jewel they had fought for so wearily would lie naked and exposed to the first comer the midas lay in the valley of the richest creek where men had schemed and fought and slain for the right to inches it was the fruit of cheerless barren years of toil and if they could not guard it they knew the result the girl interrupted their distressing reflections dont blame these men sir she begged the captain i am the only one at fault oh i had to get away i have papers here that must be delivered quickly she laid a hand upon her bosom they couldnt be trusted to the unsettled mail service its almost life and death and i assure you there is no need of putting me in quarantine i havent the smallpox i wasnt even exposed to it theres nothing else to do said stephens ill isolate you in the deck smokingcabin god knows what these madmen on board will do when they hear about it though theyre apt to tear you to shreds theyre crazy glenister had been thinking rapidly if you do that youll have mutiny in an hour this isnt the crowd to stand that sort of thing bah let em try it ill put em down the officers square jaws clicked maybe so but what then we reach nome and the health inspector hears of smallpox suspects then were all quarantined for thirty days eight hundred of us well lie at egg island all summer while your company pays five thousand a day for this ship thats not all the firm is liable in damages for your carelessness in letting disease aboard my carelessness the old man ground his teeth yes thats what it amounts to youll ruin your owners all right youll tie up your ship and lose your job thats a cinch captain stephens wiped the moisture from his brow angrily my carelessness curse you you say it well dont you realize that i am criminally liable if i dont take every precaution he paused for a moment considering ill hand her over to the ships doctor see here now glenister urged well be in nome in a week before the young lady would have time to show symptoms of the disease even if she were going to have it and a thousand to one she hasnt been exposed and will never show a trace of it nobody knows shes aboard but we three nobody will see her get off shell stay in this cabin which will be just as effectual as though you isolated her in any other part of the boat it will avoid a panic youll save your ship and your company no one will be the wiser then if the girl comes down with smallpox after she gets ashore she can go to the pesthouse and not jeopardize the health of all the people aboard this ship you go up forrad to your bridge sir and forget that you stepped in to see old bill dextry this morning well take care of this matter all right it means as much to us as it does to you weve got to be on anvil creek before the ground thaws or well lose the midas if you make a fuss youll ruin us all for some moments they watched him breathlessly as he frowned in indecision then youll have to look out for the steward he said and the girl sank to a stool while two great tears rolled down her cheeks the captains eyes softened and his voice was gentle as he laid his hand on her head dont feel hurt over what i said miss you see appearances dont tell much hereabouts most of the pretty ones are no good theyve fooled me many a time and i made a mistake these men will help you through i cant then when you get to nome make your sweetheart marry you the day you land you are too far north to be alone he stepped out into the passage and closed the door carefully chapter iii in which glenister errs well bein as me an glenister is gougin into the bowels of anvil creek all last summer we dont really get the freshgrub habit fastened on us none you see the gamblers downtown cop out the few aigs an green vegetables that stray off the ships so they never get out as far as the creek none except maybe in the shape of anecdotes we dont get intimate with no nutriments except hogboosum an brown beans of which luxuries we have unstinted measure an bein as this is our third year in the country we hanker for bony fido grub somethin scanlous yes maam three years without a taste of fresh fruit nor meat nor nuthin except pork an beans why ive et bacon till my immortal soul has growed a rind when it comes time to close down the claim the boy is sick with the fever an the only ship in port is a point barrow whaler bound for seattle after i book our passage i find they have nothin aboard to eat except canned salmon it bein the end of a two years cruise so when i land in the states after seventeen days of a fish diet i am what you might call sated with canned grub and have added salmon to the list of things concernin which i am goin to economize soons ever i get the boy into a hospital i gallop up to the best restarawnt in town an prepare for the huge potlatch this here i determine is to be a gormandizin jag which shall live in histry an wharof in later years the natives of puget sound shall speak with bated breath first i call for five dollars worth of pork an beans an then a fullgrown platter of canned salmon when the waiter lays em out in front of me i look them vittles coldly in their disgustin visages an say in sarcastic accents set there damn you an watch me eat real grub which i proceed to do cleanin the menu from soda to hock when i have done my worst i pile bones an olive seeds an peelins all over them articles of nourishment stick toothpicks into em an havin offered em what other indignities occur to me i leave the place dextry and the girl were leaning over the sternrail chatting idly in the darkness it was the second night out and the ship lay dead in the icepack all about them was a flat floeclogged sea leprous and mottled in the deep twilight that midnight brought in this latitude they had threaded into the icefield as long as the light lasted following the lanes of blue water till they closed then drifting idly till others appeared worming out into leagues of open sea again creeping into the shifting labyrinth till darkness rendered progress perilous occasionally they had passed herds of walrus huddled sociably upon icepans their wet hides glistening in the sunlight the air had been clear and pleasant while away on all quarters they had seen the smoke of other ships toiling through the barrier the spring fleet was knocking at the door of the golden north chafing at her imprisonment the girl had asked the old man to take her out on deck under the shelter of darkness then she had led him to speak of his own past experiences and of glenisters which he had done freely she was frankly curious about them and she wondered at their apparent lack of interest in her own identity and her secret mission she even construed their silence as indifference not realizing that these northmen were offering her the truest evidence of camaraderie the frontier is capable of no finer compliment than this utter disregard of ones folded pages it betokens that highest faith in ones fellowman the belief that he should be measured by his present deeds not by his past it says translated this is gods free country where a man is a man nothing more our land is new and pure our faces are to the front if you have been square so much the better if not leave behind the taints of artificial things and start again on the level thats all it had happened therefore that since the men had asked her no questions she had allowed the hours to pass and still hesitated to explain further than she had explained to captain stephens it was much easier to let things continue as they were and there was after all so little that she was at liberty to tell them in the short time since meeting them the girl had grown to like dextry with his blunt chivalry and boyish whimsical philosophy but she avoided glenister feeling a shrinking hidden terror of him ever since her eavesdropping of the previous night at the memory of that scene she grew hot then cold hot with anger icy at the sinister power and sureness which had vibrated in his voice what kind of life was she entering where men spoke of strange women with this assurance and hinted thus of ownership that he was handsome and unconscious of it she acknowledged and had she met him in her accustomed circle of friends garbed in the conventionalities she would perhaps have thought of him as a striking man vigorous and intelligent but here he seemed naturally to take on the attributes of his surroundings acquiring a picturesque negligee of dress and morals and suggesting rugged elemental chilling potentialities while with him and he had sought her repeatedly that day she was uneasily aware of his strong personality tugging at her aware of the unbridled passionate flood of a nature unbrooking of delay and heedless of denial this it was that antagonized her and set her every mental sinew in rigid resistance during dextrys garrulous ramblings glenister emerged from the darkness and silently took his place beside her against the rail what portent do you see that makes you stare into the night so anxiously he inquired i am wishing for a sight of the midnight sun or the aurora borealis she replied too late for one an too fur south for the other dextry interposed well see the sun further north though have you ever heard the real origin of the northern lights the young man inquired naturally i never have she answered well here it is i have it from the lips of a great hunter of the tananas he told it to me when i was sick once in his cabin and inasmuch as he is a wise indian and has a reputation for truth i have no doubt that it is scrupulously correct in the very old days before the white man or corned beef had invaded this land the greatest tribe in all the north was the tananas the bravest hunter of these was itika the second chief he could follow a moose till it fell exhausted in the snow and he had many belts made from the claws of the brown bear which is deadly wicked and as every one knows inhabited by the spirits of yablamen or devils one winter a terrible famine settled over the tanana valley the moose departed from the gulches and the caribou melted from the hills like mist the dogs grew gaunt and howled all night the babies cried the women became holloweyed and peevish then it was that itika decided to go hunting over the sawtooth range which formed the edge of the world they tried to dissuade him saying it was certain death because a pack of monstrous white wolves taller than the moose and swifter than the eagle was known to range these mountains running madly in chase always on clear cold nights could be seen the flashing of the moonbeams from their gleaming hungry sides and although many hunters had crossed the passes in other years they never returned for the pack slew them nothing could deter itika however so he threaded his way up through the range and night coming burrowed into a drift to sleep in his caribouskin peering out into the darkness he saw the flashing lights a thousand times brighter than ever before the whole heavens were ablaze with shifting streamers that raced and writhed back and forth in wild revel listening he heard the hiss and whine of dry snow under the feet of the pack and a distant noise as of rushing winds although the air was deathly still with daylight he proceeded through the range till he came out above a magnificent valley descending the slope he entered a forest of towering spruce while on all sides the snow was trampled with tracks as wide as a snowshoe there came to him a noise which as he proceeded increased till it filled the woods it was a frightful din as though a thousand wolves were howling with the madness of the kill cautiously creeping nearer he found a monstrous white animal struggling beneath a spruce which had fallen upon it in such fashion as to pinion it securely all brave men are tenderhearted so itika set to work with his axe and cleared away the burden regardless of the peril to himself when he had released it the beast arose and instead of running away addressed him in the most polite and polished indian without a trace of accent you have saved my life now what can i do for you i want to hunt in this valley my people are starving said itika at which the wolf was greatly pleased and rounded up the rest of the pack to help in the kill always thereafter when itika came to the valley of the yukon the giant drove hunted with him to this day they run through the mountains on cold clear nights in a multitude while the light of the moon flickers from their white sides flashing up into the sky in weird fantastic figures some people call it northern lights but old isaac assured me earnestly toothlessly and with the light of ancient truth as i lay snowblind in his lodge that it is nothing more remarkable than the spirit of itika and the great white wolves what a queer legend she said there must be many of them in this country i feel that i am going to like the north perhaps you will glenister replied although it is not a womans land tell me what led you out here in the first place you are an eastern man you have had advantages education and yet you choose this you must love the north indeed i do it calls to a fellow in some strange way that a gentler country never could when once youve lived the long lazy june days that never end and heard geese honking under a warm sunlit midnight or when once youve hit the trail on a winter morning so sharp and clear that the air stings your lungs and the whole white silent world glistens like a jewel yes and when youve seen the dogs romping in harness till the sled runners ring and the distant mountainranges come out like beautiful carvings so close you can reach them well theres something in it that brings you back thats all no matter where youve lost yourself it means health and equality and unrestraint thats what i like best i dare say the utter unrestraint when i was a schoolboy i used to gaze at the map of alaska for hours id lose myself in it it wasnt anything but a big blank corner in the north then with a name and mountains and mystery the word yukon suggested to me everything unknown and weird hairy mastodons golden river bars savage indians with bone arrowheads and sealskin trousers when i left college i came as fast as ever i could the adventure i suppose the law was considered my destiny how the shades of old choate and webster and patrick henry must have wailed when i forswore it ill bet blackstone tore his whiskers i think you would have made a success said the girl but he laughed well anyhow i stepped out leaving the way to the united states supreme bench unobstructed and came north i found it was where i belonged i fitted in im not contented dont think that im ambitious but i prefer these surroundings to the others thats all im realizing my desires ive made a fortune now ill see what else the world has he suddenly turned to her see here he abruptly questioned whats your name she started and glanced towards where dextry had stood only to find that the old frontiersman had slipped away during the tale helen chester she replied helen chester he repeated musingly what a pretty name it seems almost a pity to change it to marry as you will i am not going to nome to get married he glanced at her quickly then you wont like this country you are two years too early you ought to wait till there are railroads and telephones and tables dhote and chaperons its a mans country yet i dont see why it isnt a womans country too surely we can take a part in taming it yonder on the oregon is a complete railroad which will be running from the coast to the mines in a few weeks another ship back there has the wire and poles and fixings for a telephone system which will go up in a night as to tables dhote i saw a real french count in seattle with a monocle hes bringing in a restaurant outfit imported snails and pate de joies gras all thats wanting is the chaperon in my flight from the ohio i left mine the sailors caught her you see i am not far ahead of schedule what part are you going to take in this taming process he asked she paused long before replying and when she did her answer sounded like a jest i herald the coming of the law she said the law bah red tape a dead language and a horde of shysters im afraid of law in this land were too new and too far away from things it puts too much power in too few hands heretofore we men up here have had recourse to our courage and our colts but well have to unbuckle them both when the law comes i like the court that hasnt any appeal he laid hand upon his hip the colts may go but the courage never will she broke in perhaps but ive heard rumors already of a plot to prostitute the law in unalaska a man warned dextry with terror in his eye to beware of it that beneath the cloak of justice was a drawn dagger whetted for us fellows who own the rich diggings i dont think theres any truth in it but you cant tell the law is the foundation there cant be any progress without it there is nothing here now but disorder there isnt half the disorder you think there is there werent any crimes in this country till the tenderfeet arrived we didnt know what a thief was if you came to a cabin you walked in without knocking the owner filled up the coffeepot and sliced into the bacon then when hed started your meal he shook hands and asked your name it was just the same whether his cache was full or whether hed packed his few pounds of food two hundred miles on his back that was hospitality to make your southern article look pretty small if there was no one at home you ate what you needed there was but one unpardonable breach of etiquette to fail to leave dry kindlings im afraid of the transitory stage were coming to that epoch of chaos between the death of the old and the birth of the new frankly i like the old way best i love the license of it i love to wrestle with nature to snatch and guard and fight for what i have ive been beyond the law for years and i want to stay there where life is just what it was intended to be a survival of the fittest his large hands as he gripped the bulwark were tense and corded while his rich voice issued softly from his chest with the hint of power unlimited behind it he stood over her tall virile and magnetic she saw now why he had so joyously hailed the fight of the previous night to one of his kind it was as salt air to the nostrils unconsciously she approached him drawn by the spell of his strength my pleasures are violent and my hate is mighty bitter in my mouth what i want i take thats been my way in the old life and im too selfish to give it up he was gazing out upon the dimly lucent miles of ice but now he turned towards her and doing so touched her warm hand next his on the rail she was staring up at him unaffectedly so close that the faint odor from her hair reached him her expression was simply one of wonder and curiosity at this type so different from any she had known but the mans eyes were hot and blinded with the sight of her and he felt only her beauty heightened in the dim light the brush of her garments and the small soft hand beneath his the thrill from the touch of it surged over him mastered him what i want i take he repeated and then suddenly he reached forth and taking her in his arms crushed her to him kissing her softly fiercely full upon the lips for an instant she lay gasping and stunned against his breast then she tore her fist free and with all her force struck him full in the face it was as though she beat upon a stone with one movement he forced her arm to her side smiling into her terrified eyes then holding her like iron he kissed her again and again upon the mouth the eyes the hair and released her i am going to love you helen said he and may god strike me dead if i ever stop hating you she cried her voice coming thick and hoarse with passion turning she walked proudly forward towards her cabin a trim straight haughty figure and he did not know that her knees were shaking and weak chapter iv the killing for four days the santa maria felt blindly through the white fields drifting north with the spring tide that sets through behring strait till on the morning of the fifth open water showed to the east creeping through she broke out into the last stage of the long race amid the cheers of her weary passengers and the dull jar of her engines made welcome music to the girl in the deck stateroom soon they picked up a mountainous coast which rose steadily into majestic barren ranges still white with the melting snows and at ten in the evening under a golden sunset amid screaming whistles they anchored in the roadstead of nome before the rumble of her chains had ceased or the echo from the fleets salute had died from the shoreward hills the ship was surrounded by a swarm of tiny craft clamoring about her iron sides while an officer in cap and gilt climbed the bridge and greeted captain stephens tugs with trailing lighters circled discreetly about awaiting the completion of certain formalities these over the uniformed gentleman dropped back into his skiff and rowed away a clean bill of health captain he shouted saluting the commander thank ye sir roared the sailor and with that the rowboats swarmed inward piratelike boarding the steamer from all quarters as the master turned he looked down from his bridge to the deck below full into the face of dextry who had been an intent witness of the meeting with unbending dignity captain stephens let his left eyelid droop slowly while a boyish grin spread widely over his face simultaneously orders rang sharp and fast from the bridge the crew broke into feverish life the creak of booms and the clank of donkeyhoists arose were here miss stowaway said glenister entering the girls cabin the inspector passed us and its time for you to see the magic city come its a wonderful sight this was the first time they had been alone since the scene on the afterdeck for besides ignoring glenister she had managed that he should not even see her except in dextrys presence although he had ever since been courteous and considerate she felt the leaping emotions that were hidden within him and longed to leave the ship to fly from the spell of his personality thoughts of him made her writhe and yet when he was near she could not hate him as she willed he overpowered her he would not be hated he paid no heed to her slights this very quality reminded her how willingly and unquestioningly he had fought off the sailors from the ohio at a word from her she knew he would do so again and more and it is hard to be bitter to one who would lay down his life for you even though he has offended particularly when he has the magnetism that sweeps you away from your moorings theres no danger of being seen he continued the crowds crazy and besides well go ashore right away you must be mad with the confinement its on my nerves too as they stepped outside the door of an adjacent cabin opened framing an angular sharpfeatured woman who catching sight of the girl emerging from glenisters stateroom paused with shrewdly narrowed eyes flashing quick malicious glances from one to the other they came later to remember with regret this chance encounter for it was fraught with grave results for them both good evening mr glenister the lady said with acid cordiality howdy mrs champian he moved away she followed a step staring at helen are you going ashore tonight or wait for morning dont know yet im sure then aside to the girl he muttered shake her shes spying on us who is she asked miss chester a moment later her husband manages one of the big companies shes an old cat gaining her first view of the land the girl cried out sharply they rode on an oily sea tinted like burnished copper while on all sides amid the faint rattle and rumble of machinery scores of ships were belching cargoes out upon living swarms of scows tugs sternwheelers and dories here and there eskimo oomiaks fat walrushide boats slid about like huge manylegged waterbugs an endless antlike stream of tenders piled high with freight plied to and from the shore a mile distant lay the city stretched like a white ribbon between the gold of the ocean sand and the dun of the mosscovered tundra it was like no other in the world at first glance it seemed all made of new white canvas in a week its population had swelled from three to thirty thousand it now wandered in a slender sinuous line along the coast for miles because only the beach afforded dry camping ground mounting to the bank behind one sank kneedeep in moss and water and treading twice in the same tracks found a bog of oozing icy mud therefore as the town doubled daily in size it grew endwise like a string of dominoes till the shore from cape nome to penny river was a long reach of white glinting in the low rays of the arctic sunset like foamy breakers on a tropic island thats anvil creek up yonder said glenister theres where the midas lies see he indicated a gap in the buttress of mountains rolling back from the coast its the greatest creek in the world youll see gold by the muleload and hillocks of nuggets oh im glad to get back this is life that stretch of beach is full of gold these hills are seamed with quartz the bedrock of that creek is yellow theres gold gold gold everywhere more than ever was in old solomons mines and theres mystery and peril and things unknown let us make haste said the girl i have something i must do tonight after that i can learn to know these things securing a small boat they were rowed ashores the partners plying their ferryman with eager questions having arrived five days before he was exploding with information and volunteered the fruits of his ripe experience till dextry stated that they were sourdoughs themselves and owned the midas whereupon miss chester marvelled at the awe which sat upon the man and the wondering stare with which he devoured the partners to her own utter exclusion sufferin cats look at the freight ejaculated dextry if a storm come up it would bust the community the beach they neared was walled and crowded to the hightide mark with ramparts of merchandise while every incoming craft deposited its quota upon whatever vacant foot was close at hand till bales boxes boilers and baggage of all kinds were confusedly intermixed in the narrow space singing longshoremen trundled burdens from the lighters and piled them on the heap while yelling cursing crowds fought over it all selecting sorting loading there was no room for more yet hourly they added to the mass teams splashed through the lapping surf or stuck in the deep sand between hillocks of goods all was noise profanity congestion and feverish hurry this burning haste rang in the voice of the multitude showed in its violence of gesture and redness of face permeated the atmosphere with a magnetic electrifying energy its somethin fierce ashore said the oarsman i been up fer three days an nights steady there aint no room nor time nor darkness to sleep in ham an eggs is a dollar an a half an whiskeys four bits a throw he wailed the last sadly as a complaint unspeakable any trouble doin inquired the old man you know it the other cried colloquially there was a massacree in the northern last night gamblin row yep tinhorn called missou done it sho said dextry i know him hes a bad actor all three men nodded sagely and the girl wished for further light but they volunteered no explanation leaving the skiff they plunged into turmoil dodging through the tangle they came out into fenced lots where tents stood wall to wall and every inch was occupied here and there was a vacant spot guarded jealously by its owner who gazed sourly upon all men with the forbidding eye of suspicion finding an eddy in the confusion the men stopped where do you want to go they asked miss chester there was no longer in glenisters glance that freedom with which he had come to regard the women of the north he had come to realize dully that here was a girl driven by some strong purpose into a position repellent to her in a man of his type her independence awoke only admiration and her coldness served but to inflame him the more delicacy in glenister was lost in a remarkable singleness of purpose he could laugh at her loathing smile under her abuse and remain utterly ignorant that anything more than his action in seizing her that night lay at the bottom of her dislike he did not dream that he possessed characteristics abhorrent to her and he felt a keen reluctance at parting she extended both hands i can never thank you enough for what you have done you two but i shall try goodbye dextry gazed doubtfully at his own hand rough and gnarly then taking hers as he would have handled a robins egg waggled it limply we aint goin to turn you adrift thisaway whatever your destination is well see you to it i can find my friends she assured him this is the wrong latitude in which to dispute a lady but knowin this camp from soup to nuts as i do i sugests a male escort very well i wish to find mr struve of dunham struve lawyers ill take you to their offices said glenister you see to the baggage dex meet me at the second class in half an hour and well run out to the midas they pushed through the tangle of tents past piles of lumber and emerged upon the main thoroughfare which ran parallel to the shore nome consisted of one narrow street twisted between solid rows of canvas and halferected frame buildings its every other door that of a saloon there were fairlooking blocks which aspired to the dizzy height of three stories some sheathed in corrugated iron others gleaming and galvanized lawyers signs doctors surveyors were in the upper windows the street was thronged with men from every land helen chester heard more dialects than she could count laplanders in quaint threecornered padded caps idled past men with the tan of the tropics rubbed elbows with yellowhaired norsemen and near her a carefully groomed frenchman with ridingbreeches and monocle was in pantomime with a skinclad eskimo to her left was the sparkling sea alive with ships of every class to her right towered timberless mountains unpeopled unexplored forbidding and desolate their hollows inlaid with snow on one hand were the life and the world she knew on the other silence mystery possible adventure the roadway where she stood was a crush of sundry vehicles from bicycles to doghauled watercarts and on all sides men were laboring busily the echo of hammers mingling with the cries of teamsters and the tinkle of music within the saloons and this is midnight exclaimed helen breathlessly do they ever rest there isnt time this is a gold stampede you havent caught the spirit of it yet they climbed the stairs in a huge ironsheeted building to the office of dunham anybody else here besides you asked her escort of the lawyer no im runnin the law business unassisted dont need any help dunhams in washnton d c the lan of the home the free of the brave what can i do for you he made to cross the threshold hospitably but tripped plunged forward and would have rolled down the stairs had not glenister gathered him up and borne him back into the office where he tossed him upon a bed in a rear room now what miss chester asked the young man returning isnt that dreadful she shuddered oh and i must see him tonight she stamped impatiently i must see him alone no you mustnt said glenister with equal decision in the first place he wouldnt know what you were talking about and in the second place i know struve hes too drunk to talk business and too sober to well to see you alone but i must see him she insisted its what brought me here you dont understand i understand more than he could hes in no condition to act on any important matter you come around tomorrow when hes sober it means so much breathed the girl the beast glenister noted that she had not wrung her hands nor even hinted at tears though plainly her disappointment and anxiety were consuming her well i suppose ill have to wait but i dont know where to go some hotel i suppose there arent any theyre building two but tonight you couldnt hire a room in nome for money i was about to say love or money have you no other friends here no women then you must let me find a place for you i have a friend whose wife will take you in she rebelled at this was she never to have done with this mans favors she thought of returning to the ship but dismissed that she undertook to decline his aid but he was halfway down the stairs and paid no attention to her beginning so she followed him it was then that helen chester witnessed her first tragedy of the frontier and through it came to know better the man whom she disliked and with whom she had been thrown so fatefully already she had thrilled at the spell of this country but she had not learned that strength and license carry blood and violence as corollaries emerging from the doorway at the foot of the stairs they drifted slowly along the walk watching the crowd besides the universal tension there were laughter and hope and exhilaration in the faces the enthusiasm of this boyish multitude warmed one the girl wished to get into this spirit to be one of them then suddenly from the babble at their elbows came a discordant note not long nor loud only a few words penetrating and harsh with the metallic quality lent by passion helen glanced over her shoulder to find that the smiles of the throng were gone and that its eyes were bent on some scene in the street with an eager interest she had never seen mirrored before simultaneously glenister spoke come away from here with the quickened eye of experience he foresaw trouble and tried to drag her on but she shook off his grasp impatiently and turning gazed absorbed at the spectacle which unfolded itself before her although not comprehending the play of events she felt vaguely the quick approach of some crisis yet was unprepared for the swiftness with which it came her eyes had leaped to the figures of two men in the street from whom the rest had separated like oil from water one was slim and well dressed the other bulky mackinawed and lowering of feature it was the smaller who spoke and for a moment she misjudged his bloodshot eyes and swaying carriage to be the result of alcohol until she saw that he was racked with fury make good i tell you quick give me that bill of sale you the unkempt man swung on his heel with a growl and walked away his course leading him towards glenister and the girl with two strides he was abreast of them then detecting the flashing movement of the other he whirled like a wild animal his voice had the snarl of a beast in it ye had to have it didnt ye well there the actions of both men were quick as light yet to the girls taut senses they seemed theatrical and deliberate into her mind was seared forever the memory of that second as though the shutter of a camera had snapped impressing upon her brain the scene sharp clearcut and vivid the shaggy back of the large man almost brushing her the ragedrunken white shirted man in the derby hat the crowd sweeping backward like rushes before a blast men with arms flexed and feet raised in flight the glaring yellow sign of the gold belt dance hall across the way these were stamped upon her retina and then she was jerked violently backward two strong arms crushed her down upon her knees against the wall and she was smothered in the arms of roy glenister my god dont move were in line he crouched over her his cheek against her hair his weight forcing her down into the smallest compass his arms about her his body forming a living shield against the flying bullets over them the big man stood and the sustained roar of his gun was deafening in an instant they heard the thud and felt the jar of lead in the thin boards against which they huddled again the report echoed above their heads and they saw the slender man in the street drop his weapon and spin half round as though hit with some heavy hand he uttered a cry and stooping for his gun plunged forward burying his face in the sand the man by glenisters side shouted curses thickly and walked towards his prostrate enemy firing at every step the wounded man rolled to his side and raising himself on his elbow shot twice so rapidly that the reports blended but without checking his antagonists approach four more times the relentless assailant fired deliberately his last missile sent as he stood over the body which twitched and shuddered at his feet its garments muddy and smeared then he turned and retraced his steps back within armslength of the two who pressed against the building he came and as he went by they saw his coarse and sullen features drawn and working pallidly while the breath whistled through his teeth he held his course to the door they had just quitted then as he turned he coughed bestially spitting out a mouthful of blood his knees wavered he vanished within the portals and in the sickly silence that fell they heard his hobnailed boots clumping slowly up the stairs noise awoke and rioted down the thoroughfare men rushed forth from every quarter and the ghastly object in the dirt was hidden by a seething mass of miners glenister raised the girl but her head rolled limply and she would have slipped to her knees again had he not placed his arm about her waist her eyes were staring and horrorfilled dont be frightened said he smiling at her reassuringly but his own lips shook and the sweat stood out like dew on him for they had both been close to death there came a surge and swirl through the crowd and dextry swooped upon them like a hawk be ye hurt holy mackinaw when i see em blaze away i yells at ye fit to bust my throat i shore thought you was gone although i cant say but this killin was a sight for sore eyes so neat an genteel still as a rule in these street brawls its the innocuous bystander that has flowers sent around to his house afterwards look at this said glenister breasthigh in the wall against which they had crouched not three feet apart were bullet holes thems the first two he unhitched dextry remarked jerking his head towards the object in the street must have been a new gun an pulled hard throwed him to the right see even to the girl it was patent that had she not been snatched as she was the bullet would have found her come away quick she panted and they led her into a nearby store where she sank upon a seat and trembled until dextry brought her a glass of whiskey here miss he said pretty tough go for a cheechako im afraid you aint gettin enamoured of this here country a whole lot for half an hour he talked to her in his whimsical way of foreign things till she was quieted then the partners arose to go although glenister had arranged for her to stop with the wife of the merchant for the rest of the night she would not i cant go to bed please dont leave me im too nervous ill go mad if you do the strain of the last week has been too much for me if i sleep ill see the faces of those men again dextry talked with his companion then made a purchase which he laid at the ladys feet heres a pair of halfgrown gum boots you put em on an come with us well take your mind off of things complete an as fer sweet dreams when you get back youll make the slumbers of the just seem as restless as a riot or the antics of a mountaingoat which nimbly leaps from crag to crag and well thats restless enough come on as the sun slanted up out of behring sea they marched back towards the hills their feet ankledeep in the soft fresh moss while the air tasted like a cool draught and a myriad of earthy odors rose up and encircled them snipe and reed birds were noisy in the hollows and from the misty tundra lakes came the honking of brant after their weary weeks on shipboard the dewy freshness livened them magically cleansing from their memories the recent tragedy so that the girl became herself again where are we going she asked at the end of an hour pausing for breath why to the midas of course they said and one of them vowed recklessly as he drank in the beauty of her clear eyes and the grace of her slender panting form that he would gladly give his share of all its riches to undo what he had done one night on the santa maria chapter v wherein a man appears in the lives of countries there are crises where for a breath destinies lie in the laps of the gods and are jumbled heads or tails thus are marked distinctive cycles like the seven ages of a man and though perhaps they are too subtle to be perceived at the time yet having swung past the shadowy milestones the epochs disclose themselves such a period in the progress of the far northwest was the nineteenth day of july although to those concerned in the building of this new empire the day appealed only as the date of the coming of the law all nome gathered on the sands as lighters brought ashore judge stillman and his following it was held fitting that the senator should be the ship to safeguard the dignity of the first court and to introduce justice into this land of the wild the interest awakened by his honor was augmented by the fact that he was met on the beach by a charming girl who flung herself upon him with evident delight thats his niece said some one she came up on the first boatnames chester swell looker eh another newcomer attracted even more notice than the limb of the law a gigantic wellgroomed man with keen closeset eyes and that indefinable easy movement and polished bearing that come from confidence health and travel unlike the others he did not dally on the beach nor display much interest in his surroundings but with purposeful frown strode through the press up into the heart of the city his companion was struves partner dunham a middleaged pompous man they went directly to the offices of dunham struve where they found the whitehaired junior partner mighty glad to meet you mr mcnamara said struve your name is a household word in my part of the country my people were mixed up in dakota politics somewhat so ive always had a great admiration for you and im glad youve come to alaska this is a big country and we need big men did you have any trouble dunham inquired when the three had adjourned to a private room trouble said struve ruefully well i wonder if i did miss chester brought me your instructions ok and i got busy right off but tell me this how did you get the girl to act as messenger there was no one else to send answered mcnamara dunham intended sailing on the first boat but he was detained in washington with me and the judge had to wait for us at seattle we were afraid to trust a stranger for fear he might get curious and examine the papers that would have meant he moved his hand eloquently struve nodded i see does she know what was in the documents decidedly not women and business dont mix i hope you didnt tell her anything no i havent had a chance she seemed to take a dislike to me for some reason i havent seen her since the day after she got here the judge told her it had something to do with preparing the way for his court said dunham and that if the papers were not delivered before he arrived it might cause a lot of trouble litigation riots bloodshed and all that he filled her up on generalities till the girl was frightened to death and thought the safety of her uncle and the whole country depended on her well continued struve its dead easy to hire men to jump claims and its dead easy to buy their rights afterwards particularly when they know they havent got any but what course do you follow when owners go gunning for you mcnamara laughed who did that a benevolent silverhaired old texan pirate by the name of dextry hes one half owner in the midas and the other half mountainlion as peaceable youd imagine as a benediction but with the temperament of a geronimo i sent galloway out to relocate the claim and he got his notices up in the night when they were asleep but at am he came flying back to my room and nearly hammered the door down ive seen fright in varied forms and phases but he had them all with some added starters hide me out quick he panted whats up i asked ive stirred up a breakfast of grizzly bear smallpox and sudden death and it dont set well on my stummick let me in i had to keep him hidden three days for this gentlemannered old cannibal roamed the streets with a cannon in his hand breathing fire and pestilence anybody else act up queried dunham no all the rest are swedes and they havent got the nerve to fight they couldnt lick a spoon if they tried these other men are different though there are two of them the old one and a young fellow im a little afraid to mix it up with them and if their claim wasnt the best in the district id say let it alone ill attend to that said mcnamara struve resumed yes gentlemen ive been working pretty hard and also pretty much in the dark so far im groping for light when miss chester brought in the papers i got busy instanter i clouded the title to the richest placers in the region but im blamed if i quite see the use of it wed be thrown out of any court in the land if we took them to law whats the game blackmail humph ejaculated mcnamara what do you take me for well it does seem small for alec mcnamara but i cant see what else youre up to within a week ill be running every good mine in the nome district mcnamaras voice was calm but decisive his glance keen and alert while about him clung such a breath of power and confidence that it compelled belief even in the face of this astounding speech in spite of himself wilton struve lawyer rake and gentlemanly adventurer felt his heart leap at what the others daring implied the proposition was utterly past belief and yet looking into the mans purposeful eyes he believed thats big awful big too big the younger man murmured why man it means youll handle fifty thousand dollars a day dunham shifted his feet in the silence and licked his dry lips of course its big but mr mcnamaras the biggest man that ever came to alaska he said and ive got the biggest scheme that ever came north backed by the biggest men in washington continued the politician look here he displayed a typewritten sheet bearing parallel lists of names and figures struve gasped incredulously those are my stockholders and that is their share in the venture oh yes were incorporated under the laws of arizona secret of course it would never do for the names to get out im showing you this only because i want you to be satisfied whos behind me lord im satisfied said struve laughing nervously dunham was with you when you figured the scheme out and he met some of your friends in washington and new york if he says its all right that settles it but say suppose anything went wrong with the company and it leaked out who those stockholders are theres no danger i have the books where they will be burned at the first sign wed have had our own land laws passed but for sturtevant of nevada damn him he blocked us in the senate however my plan is this he rapidly outlined his proposition to the listeners while a light of admiration grew and shone in the reckless face of struve by heavens youre a wonder he cried at the close and im with you body and soul its dangerous thats why i like it dangerous mcnamara shrugged his shoulders bah where is the danger weve got the law or rather we are the law now lets get to work it seemed that the boss of north dakota was no sluggard he discarded coat and waistcoat and tackled the documents which struve laid before him going through them like a whirlwind gradually he infected the others with his energy and soon behind the locked doors of dunham struve there were only haste and fever and plot and intrigue as helen chester led the judge towards the flamboyant threestoried hotel she prattled to him lightheartedly the fascination of a new land already held her fast and now she felt in addition security and relief glenister saw them from a distance and strode forward to greet them he beheld a man of perhaps threescore years benign of aspect save for the eyes which were neither clear nor steady but had the trick of looking past one glenister thought the mouth too rather weak and vacillating but the cleanshaven face was dignified by learning a acumen and was wrinkled in pleasant fashion my niece has just told me of your service to her the old gentleman began i am happy to know you sir besides being a brave knight and assisting ladies in distress mr glenister is a very great and wonderful man helen explained lightly he owns the midas indeed said the old man his shifting eyes now resting full on the other with a flash of unmistakable interest i hear that is a wonderful mine have you begun work yet no well commence sluicing day after tomorrow it has been a late spring the snow in the gulch was deep and the ground thaws slowly weve been building houses and doing dead work but weve got our men on the ground waiting i am greatly interested wont you walk with us to the hotel i want to hear more about these wonderful placers well they are great placers said the miner as the three walked on together nobody knows how great because weve only scratched at them yet in the first place the ground is so shallow and the gold is so easy to get that if nature didnt safeguard us in the winter wed never dare leave our claims for fear of snipers theyd run in and rob us how much will the anvil creek mines produce this summer asked the judge its hard to tell sir but we expect to average five thousand a day from the midas alone and there are other claims just as good your title is all clear i dare say eh absolutely except for one jumper and we dont take him seriously a fellow named galloway relocated us one night last month but he didnt allege any grounds for doing so and we could never find trace of him if we had our title would be as clean as snow again he said the last with a peculiar inflection you wouldnt use violence i trust sure why not it has worked all right heretofore but my dear sir those days are gone the law is here and it is the duty of every one to abide by it well perhaps it is but in this country we consider a mans mine as sacred as his family we didnt know what a lock and key were in the early times and we didnt have any troubles except famine and hardship its different now though why there have been more claims jumped around here this spring than in the whole length and history of the yukon they had reached the hotel and glenister paused turning to the girl as the judge entered when she started to follow he detained her i came down from the hills on purpose to see you it has been a long week dont talk that way she interrupted coldly i dont care to hear it see here what makes you shut me out and wrap yourself up in your haughtiness im sorry for what i did that night ive told you so repeatedly ive wrung my soul for that act till theres nothing left but repentance it is not that she said slowly i have been thinking it over during the past month and now that i have gained an insight into this life i see that it wasnt an unnatural thing for you to do its terrible to think of but its true i dont mean that it was pardonable she continued quickly for it wasnt and i hate you when i think about it but i suppose i put myself into a position to invite such actions no im sufficiently broadminded not to blame you unreasonably and i think i could like you in spite of it just for what you have done for me but that isnt all there is something deeper you saved my life and im grateful but you frighten me always it is the cruelty in your strength it is something away back in you lustful and ferocious and wild and crouching he smiled wryly it is my local color maybe absorbed from this country ill try to change though if you want me to ill let them rope and throw and brand me ill take on the graces of civilization and put away revenge and ambition and all the rest of it if it will make you like me any better why ill even promise not to violate the person of our claimjumper if i catch him and heaven knows that means that samson has parted with his locks i think i could like you if you did she said but you cant do it you are a savage there are no clubs nor marts where men foregather for business in the north nothing but the saloon and this is all and more than a club here men congregate to drink to gamble and to traffic it was late in the evening when glenister entered the northern and passed idly down the row of games pausing at the craptable where he rolled the dice when his turn came moving to the roulettewheel he lost a stack of whites but at the faro layout his luck was better and he won a gold coin on the highcard whereupon he promptly ordered a round of drinks for the men grouped about him a formality always precedent to overtures of general friendship as he paused glass in hand his eyes were drawn to a man who stood close by talking earnestly the aspect of the stranger challenged notice for he stood high above his companions with a peculiar grace of attitude in place of the awkwardness common in men of great stature among those who were listening intently to the mans carefully modulated tones glenister recognized mexico mullins the exgambler who had given dextry the warning at unalaska as he further studied the listening group a drunken man staggered uncertainly through the wide doors of the saloon and gaining sight of the tall stranger blinked then approached him speaking with a loud voice well if taint ole alec mcnamara how do ye ole pirate mcnamara nodded and turned his back coolly upon the newcomer dont turn your dorsal fin to me i wan to talk to ye mcnamara continued his calm discourse till he received a vicious whack on the shoulder then he turned for a moment to interrupt his assailants garrulous profanity dont bother me i am engaged ye won talk to me eh well im goin to talk to you see i guess youd listen if i told these people all i know about you turn around here his voice was menacing and attracted general notice observing this mcnamara addressed him his words dropping clear concise and cold dont talk to me you are a drunken nuisance go away before something happens to you again he turned away but the drunken man seized and whirled him about repeating his abuse encouraged by this apparent patience your pardon for an instant gentlemen mcnamara laid a large white and manicured hand upon the flannel sleeve of the miner and gently escorted him through the entrance to the sidewalk while the crowd smiled as they cleared the threshold however he clenched his fist without a word and raising it struck the sot fully and cruelly upon the jaw his victim fell silently the back of his head striking the boards with a hollow thump then without even observing how he lay mcnamara reentered the saloon and took up his conversation where he had been interrupted his voice was as evenly regulated as his movements betraying not a sign of anger excitement or bravado he lit a cigarette extracted a notebook and jotted down certain memoranda supplied him by mexico mullins all this time the body lay across the threshold without a sign of life the buzz of the roulettewheel was resumed and the crapdealer began his monotonous routine every eye was fixed on the nonchalant man at the bar but the unconscious creature outside the threshold lay unheeded for in these mens code it behooves the most humane to practise a certain aloofness in the matter of private brawls having completed his notes mcnamara shook hands gravely with his companions and strode out through the door past the bulk that sprawled across his path and without pause or glance disappeared a dozen willing though unsympathetic hands laid the drunkard on the roulettetable where the bartender poured pitcher upon pitcher of water over him he aint hurt none to speak of said a bystander then added with enthusiasm but say theres a man in this here camp chapter vi and a mine is jumped whos your new shift boss glenister inquired of his partner a few days later indicating a man in the cut below busied in setting a line of sluices thats old slapjack simms friend of mine from up dawson way glenister laughed immoderately for the object was unusually tall and loosejointed and wore a soiled suit of yellow mackinaw he had laid off his coat and now the baggy bilious trousers hung precariously from his angular shoulders by suspenders of alarming frailty his legs were lost in gum boots also loose and cavernous and his entire costume looked relaxed and flapping so that he gave the impression of being able to shake himself out of his raiment and to rise like a burlesque aphrodite his face was overgrown with a grizzled tangle that looked as though it had been trimmed with buttonhole scissors while above the brush heap grandly soared a shiny domelike head has he always been bald naw he aint bald at all he shaves his nob in the early days he wore a long flowin mane which was inhabited by crickets treetoads and such fauna it got to be a hobby with him finally so that he growed superstitious about goin uncurried and would back into a corner with both guns drawed if a barber came near him but once hank thats his real name undertook to fry some slapjacks and in givin the skillet a heave the dough lit among his forest primeval jest back of his ears soft side down hank polluted the gulch with langwidge which no man had ought to keep in himself without it was fumigated disreppitableness oozed out through him like sweat through an icepitcher an since then hes been known as slapjack simms an has kept his head shingled smooth as a gun barl hes a good miner though aint none better an square as a die sluicing had begun on the midas long sinuous lengths of canvas hose wound down the creek bottom from the dam like gigantic serpents while the roll of gravel through the flumes mingled musically with the rush of waters the tinkle of tools and the song of steel on rock there were four strings of boxes abreast and the heaving line of shovellers ate rapidly into the creek bed while teams with scrapers splashed through the tail races in an atmosphere of softened profanity in the big white tents which sat back from the bluffs fifty men of the night shift were asleep for there is no respite here no night no sunday no halt during the hundred days in which the northland lends herself to pillage the mine lay cradled between wonderful mossy willowmottled mountains while above and below the gulch was dotted with tents and huts and everywhere from basin to hill crest men dug and blasted punily patiently while their tracks grew daily plainer over the face of this inscrutable wilderness a great contentment filled the two partners as they looked on this scene to wrest from reluctant earth her richest treasures to add to the wealth of the world to create here was satisfaction we aint robbin no widders an orphans doin it neither dextry suddenly remarked expressing his partners feelings closely they looked at each other and smiled with that rare understanding that exceeds words descending into the cut the old man filled a goldpan with dirt taken from under the feet of the workers and washed it in a puddle while the other watched his dexterous whirling motions when he had finished they poked the stream of yellow grains into a pile then with heads together guessed its weight laughing again delightedly in perfect harmony and contentment ive been waitin a turrible time fer this day said the elder ive suffered the plagues of prospectin from the mexicos to the circle an yet i dont begretch it none now that ive struck pay while they spoke two miners struggled with a bowlder they had unearthed and having scraped and washed it carefully staggered back to place it on the cleaned bedrock behind one of them slipped and it crashed against a brace which held the sluices in place these boxes stand more than a mans height above the bedrock resting on supporting posts and running full of water should a sluice fall the rushing stream carries out the gold which has lodged in the riffles and floods the bedrock raising havoc too late the partners saw the string of boxes sway and bend at the joint then before they could reach the threatened spot to support it slapjack simms with a shriek plunged flapping down into the cut and seized the flume his great height stood him in good stead now for where the joint had opened water poured forth in a cataract he dived under the breach unhesitatingly and stooping lifted the line as near to its former level as possible holding the entire burden upon his naked pate he gesticulated wildly for help while over him poured the deluge of icy muddy water it entered his gaping waistband bulging out his yellow trousers till they were fat and full and the seams were bursting while his yawning boottops became as boiling springs meanwhile he chattered forth profanity in such volume that the ear ached under it as must have ached the heroic slapjack under the chill of the melting snow he was relieved quickly however and emerged triumphant though blue and puckered his wilderness of whiskers streaming like limber stalactites his boots loosely squishing while oaths still poured from him in such profusion that dextry whispered aint he a ringtailed wonder its plumb solemn an reverent the way he makes them untamed cusswords sit up an beg its a privilege to be present thats a gift that is youd better get some dry clothes they suggested and slapjack proceeded a few paces towards the tents hobbling as though treading on pounded glass ow w he yelled these blasted boots is full of gravel he seated himself and tugged at his foot till the boot came away with a sucking sound then instead of emptying the accumulation at random he poured the contents into dextrys empty goldpan rinsing it out carefully the other boot he emptied likewise they held a surprising amount of sediment because the stream that had emerged from the crack in the sluices had carried with it pebbles sand and all the concentration of the riffles at this point standing directly beneath the cataract most of it had dived fairly into his inviting waistband following down the lines of least resistance into his bootlegs and boiling out at the knees wash that he said youre apt to get a prospect with artful passes dextry settled it in the pan bottom and washed away the gravel leaving a yellow glittering pile which raised a yell from the men who had lingered curiously he pans forty dollars to the bootleg one shouted how much do you run to the foot slapjack hes a reglar freemilling ledge no he aint hes too thin hes nothing but a stringer but hell pay to work the old miner grinned toothlessly gentlemen there aint no better way to save fine gold than with undercurrents an blanket riffles ill have to wash these garments of mine an clean up the soapsuds cause theres a hundred dollars in golddust clingin to my person this minute he went dripping up the bank while the men returned to their work singing after lunch dextry saddled his bronco im goin to town for a pair of goldscales but ill be back by supper then well clean up between shifts shed ought to give us a thousand ounces the way that ground prospects he loped down the gulch while his partner returned to the pit the flashing shovel blades and the rumbling undertone of the big workings that so fascinated him it was perhaps four oclock when he was aroused from his labors by a shout from the bunktent where a group of horsemen had clustered as glenister drew near he saw among them wilton struve the lawyer and the big welldressed tenderfoot of the northern mcnamara the man of the heavy hand struve straightway engaged him say glenister weve come out to see about the title to this claim what about it well it was relocated about a month ago he paused yes what of that galloway has commenced suit the ground belongs to dextry and me we discovered it we opened it up weve complied with the law and were going to hold it glenister spoke with such conviction and heat as to nonplus struve but mcnamara who had sat his horse silently until now answered certainly sir if your title is good you will be protected but the law has arrived in alaska and weve got to let it take its course theres no need of violence none whatever but briefly the situation is this mr galloway has commenced action against you the court has enjoined you from working and has appointed me as receiver to operate the mine until the suit is settled its an extraordinary procedure of course but the conditions are extraordinary in this country the season is so short that it would be unjust to the rightful owner if the claim lay idle all summer so to avoid that ive been put in charge with instructions to operate it and preserve the proceeds subject to the courts order mr voorhees here is the united states marshal he will serve the papers glenister threw up his hand in a gesture of restraint hold on do you mean to tell me that any court would recognize such a claim as galloways the law recognizes everything if his grounds are no good so much the better for you you cant put in a receiver without notice to us why good lord we never heard of a suit being commenced weve never even been served with a summons and we havent had a chance to argue in our own defence i have just said that this is a remarkable state of affairs and unusual action had to be taken mcnamara replied but the young miner grew excited look here this gold wont get away its safe in the ground well knock off work and let the claim lie idle till the thing is settled you cant really expect us to surrender possession of our mine on the mere allegation of some unknown man thats ridiculous we wont do it why youll have to let us argue our case at least before you try to put us off voorhees shook his head well have to follow instructions the thing for you to do is to appear before the court tomorrow and have the receiver dismissed if your title is as good as you say it is you wont have any trouble youre not the only ones to suffer added mcnamara weve taken possession of all the mines below here he nodded down the gulch im an officer of the court and under bond how much five thousand dollars for each claim what why heavens man the poorest of these mines is producing that much every day while he spoke glenister was rapidly debating what course to follow the place to argue this thing is before judge stillman said struve but with little notion of the conflict going on within glenister the youth yearned to fight not with words nor quibbles nor legal phrases but with steel and blows and he felt that the impulse was as righteous as it was natural for he knew this process was unjust an outrage mexico mullinss warning recurred to him and yet he shifted slowly as he talked till his back was to the door of the big tent they were watching him carefully for all their apparent languor and looseness in saddle then as he started to leap within and rally his henchmen his mind went back to the words of judge stillman and his niece surely that old man was on the square he couldnt be otherwise with her beside him believing in him and a suspicion of deeper plots behind these actions was groundless so far all was legal he supposed with his scant knowledge of law though the methods seemed unreasonable the men might be doing what they thought to be right why be the first to resist the men on the mines below had not done so the title to this ground was capable of such easy proof that he and dex need have no uneasiness courts do not rob honest people nowadays he argued and moreover perhaps the girls words were true perhaps she would think more of him if he gave up the old fighting ways for her sake certainly armed resistance to her uncles first edict would not please her she had said he was too violent so he would show her he could lay his savagery aside she might smile on him approvingly and that was worth taking a chance for anyway it would mean but a few days delay in the mines run as he reasoned he heard a low voice speaking within the open door it was slapjack simms step aside lad ive got the big un covered glenister saw the men on horseback snatch at their holsters and just in time leaped at his foreman for the old man had moved out into the open a winchester at shoulder his cheek cuddling the stock his eyes cold and narrow the young man flung the barrel up and wrenched the weapon from his hands none of that hank he cried sharply ill say when to shoot he turned to look into the muzzles of guns held in the hands of every horseman every horseman save one for alec mcnamara sat unmoved his handsome features nonchalant and amused nodding approval it was at him that hanks weapon had been levelled this is bad enough at the best dont lets make it any worse said he slapjack inhaled deeply spat with disgust and looked over his boss incredulously well of all the different kinds of damn fools he snorted you are the kindest he marched past the marshal and his deputies down to the cut put on his coat and vanished down the trail towards town not deigning a backward glance either at the mine or at the man unfit to fight for chapter vii the bronco kids eavesdropping late in july it grows dark as midnight approaches so that the many lights from doorway and window seem less garish and strange than they do a month earlier in the northern there was good business doing the new bar fixtures which had cost a kings ransom or represented the one nights losings of a klondike millionaire shone rich dark and enticing while the cut glass sparkled with iridescent hues reflecting in a measure the prismatic moods the dancing spirits of the crowd that crushed past halting at the gambling games or patronizing the theatre in the rear the old bar furniture brought down by dog team from up river was established at the rear extremity of the long building just inside the entrance to the dancehall where patrons of the drama might with a modicum of delay and inconvenience quaff as deeply of the beaker as of the ballet now however the show had closed the hall had been cleared of chairs and canvas exposing a glassy tempting surface and the orchestra had moved to the stage they played a rollicking bloodstirring twostep while the floor swam with dancers at certain intervals the musicians worked feverishly up to a crashing crescendo supported by the voices of the dancers until all joined at the top note in a yell while the drummer fired a colt into a box of wet sawdust beside his chair all in time all in the swinging spirit of the tune the men who were mostly young danced like college boys while the women who were all young and good dancers floated through the measures with the ease of roseleaves on a summer stream faces were flushed eyes were bright and but rarely a voice sounded that was not glad most of the noise came from the men and although one caught here and there a hint of haggard lines about the girlish faces and glimpsed occasional eyes that did not smile yet as a whole the scene was one of genuine enjoyment suddenly the music ceased and the couples crowded to the bar the women took harmless drinks the men mostly whiskey rarely was the choice of potations criticised though occasionally some ruddy eschewer of sobriety insisted that his lady take the same avowing that hootch having been demonstrated beneficial in his case was good for her also invariably the lady accepted without dispute and invariably the man failed to note her glance at the bartender or the silent substitution by that capable person of gingerale for whiskey or of plain water for gin in turn the mixers collected one dollar from each man flipping to the girl a metal percentagecheck which she added to her store in the curtained boxes overhead men bought bottles with foil about the corks and then subterfuge on the ladys part was idle but on the other hand she was able to pocket for each bottle a check redeemable at five dollars a stranger straight from the east would have remarked first upon the good music next upon the good looks of the women and then upon the shabby clothes of the men for some of them were in mukluk others in sweaters with huge initials and winged emblems and all were collarless outside in the main gamblingroom there were but few women men crowded in dense masses about the faro layout the wheel craps the klondike game pangingi and the cardtables they talked of business of home of women bought and sold mines and bartered all things from hams to honor the groomed and clean the unkempt and filthy jostled shoulder to shoulder equally affected by the license of the goldfields and the exhilaration of the new the mystery of the north had touched them all the glad bright wine of adventure filled their veins and they spoke mightily of things they had resolved to do or recounted with simple diffidence the strange stories of their accomplishment the bronco kid familiar from atlin to nome as the best bank dealer on the yukon worked the shift from eight till two he was a slender man of thirty dexterous in movement slow to smile soft of voice and known as a living flame among women he had dealt the biggest games of the early days and had no enemies yet though many called him friend they wondered inwardly it was a strong play the kid had tonight for swede sam of dawson ventured many stacks of yellow chips and he was a quick aggressive gambler a jew sat at the king end with ten neatly creased onethousanddollar bills before him together with piles of smaller currency he adventured viciously and without system while outsiders to the number of four or five cut in sporadically with small bets the game was difficult to follow consequently the lookout from his raised dais was leaning forward chin in hand while the group was hedged about by eager onlookers faro is a closed book to most people for its intricacies are confusing lucky is he who has never persevered in solving its mysteries nor speculated upon the systems of beating it from those who have learned it the game demands practice dexterity and coolness the dealer must run the cards watch the many shifting bets handle the neatly piled checks figure lightninglike the profits and losses it was his unerring clock like regularity in this that had won the kid his reputation this night his powers were taxed he dealt silently scowlingly his long white fingers nervously caressing the cards this preoccupation prevented his noticing the rustle and stir of a newcomer who had crowded up behind him until he caught the wondering glances of those in front and saw that the israelite was staring past him his money forgotten his eyes beady and sharp his ratlike teeth showing in a grin of admiration swede sam glared from under his unkempt shock and felt uncertainly towards the open collar of his flannel shirt where a kerchief should have been the men who were standing gazed at the newcomer some with surprise others with a half smile of recognition bronco glanced quickly over his shoulder and as he did so the breath caught in his throat but for only an instant a girl stood so close beside him that the lace of her gown brushed his sleeve he was shuffling at the moment and dropped a card then nodded to her speaking quietly as he stooped to regain the pasteboard howdy cherry she did not answer only continued to look at the layout what a woman he thought she was not too tall with smoothly rounded bust and hips and long waist all well displayed by her perfectly fitting garments her face was oval the mouth rather large the eyes of dark darkblue prominently outlined under thin silken lids her dullgold hair was combed low over the ears and her smile showed rows of sparkling teeth before it dived into twin dimples strangest of all it was an innocent face the face and smile of a schoolgirl the kid finished his shuffling awkwardly and slid the cards into the box then the woman spoke let me have your place bronco the men gasped the jew snickered the lookout straightened in his chair better not its a hard game said the kid but her voice was imperious as she commanded him hurry up give me your place bronco arose whereupon she settled in his chair tucked in her skirts removed her gloves and twisted into place the diamonds on her hands what the devils this said the lookout roughly are you drunk bronco get out of that chair miss she turned to him slowly the innocence had fled from her features and the big eyes flashed warningly a change had coarsened her like a puff of air on a still pool then while she stared at him her lids drooped dangerously and her lip curled throw him out bronco she said and her tones held the hardness of a mistress to her slave thats all right the kid reassured the lookout shes a better dealer than i am this is cherry malotte without noticing the stares this evoked the girl commenced her hands beautifully soft and white flashed over the board she dealt rapidly unfalteringly with the finish of one bred to the cards handling chips and coppers with the peculiar mannerisms that spring from long practice it was seen that she never looked at her checkrack but when a bet required paying picked up a stack without turning her head and they saw further that she never reached twice nor took a large pile and sized it up against its mate removing the extra disks as is the custom when she stretched forth her hand she grasped the right number unerringly this is considered the acme of professional finish and the bronco kid smiled delightedly as he saw the wonder spread from the lookout to the spectators and heard the speech of the men who stood on chairs and tables for sight of the woman dealer for twenty minutes she continued until the place became congested and never once did the lookout detect an error while she was busy glenister entered the frontdoor and pushed his way back towards the theatre he was worried and distrait his manner perturbed and unnatural silently and without apparent notice he passed friends who greeted him what ails glenister tonight asked a bystander he acts funny aint you heard why the midas has been jumped hes in a bad way all broke up the girl suddenly ceased without finishing the deck and arose dont stop said the kid while a murmur of dismay came from the spectators she only shook her head and drew on her gloves with a show of ennui gliding through the crowd she threaded about aimlessly the recipient of many stares though but few greetings speaking with no one a certain dignity serving her as a barrier even here she stopped a waiter and questioned him hes upstairs in a gallery box alone yesm anyhow he was a minute ago unless some of the rustlers has broke in on him a moment later glenister watching the scene below was aroused from his gloomy absorption by the click of the box door and the rustle of silken skirts go out please he said without turning i dont want company hearing no answer he began again i came here to be alone but there he ceased for the girl had come forward and laid her two hot hands upon his cheeks boy she breathed and he arose swiftly cherry when did you come oh days ago she said impatiently from dawson they told me you had struck it i stood it as long as i could then i came to you now tell me about yourself let me see you first quick she pulled him towards the light and gazed upward devouring him hungrily with her great languorous eyes she held to his coat lapels standing close beside him her warm breath beating up into his face well she said kiss me he took her wrists in his and loosed her hold then looked down on her gravely and said no thats all over i told you so when i left dawson all over oh no it isnt boy you think so but it isnt it cant be i love you too much to let you go hush said he there are people in the next box i dont care let them hear she cried with feminine recklessness im proud of my love for you ill tell it to themto the whole world now see here little girl he said quietly we had a long talk in dawson and agreed that it was best to divide our ways i was mad over you once as a good many other men have been but i came to my senses nothing could ever result from it and i told you so yes yes i know i thought i could give you up but i didnt realize till you had gone how i wanted you oh its been a torture to me every day for the past two years there was no semblance now to the cold creature she had appeared upon entering the gamblinghall she spoke rapidly her whole body tense with emotion her voice shaken with passion ive seen men and men and men and theyve loved me but i never cared for anybody in the world till i saw you they ran after me but you were cold you made me come to you perhaps that was it anyhow i cant stand it ill give up everything ill do anything just to be where you are what do you think of a woman who will beg oh ive lost my pride im a fool a fool but i cant help it im sorry you feel this way said glenister it isnt my fault and it isnt of any use for an instant she stood quivering while the light died out of her face then with a characteristic change she smiled till the dimples laughed in her cheeks she sank upon a seat beside him and pulled together the curtains shutting out the sight below very well then she put his hand to her cheek and cuddled it im glad to see you just the same and you cant keep me from loving you with his other hand he smoothed her hair while unknown to him and beneath her lightness she shrank and quivered at his touch like a barbary steed under the whip things are very bad with me he said weve had our mine jumped bah you know what to do you arent a cripple youve got five fingers on your gun hand thats it they all tell me that all the oldtimers but i dont know what to do i thought i did but i dont the law has come into this country and ive tried to meet it halfway they jumped us and put in a receiver a big man by the name of mcnamara dex wasnt there and i let them do it when the old man learned of it he nearly went crazy we had our first quarrel he thought i was afraid not he said the girl i know him and he knows you that was a week ago weve hired the best lawyer in nome bill wheaton and weve tried to have the injunction removed weve offered bond in any sum but the judge refuses to accept it weve argued for leave to appeal but he wont give us the right the more i look into it the worse it seems for the court wasnt convened in accordance with law we werent notified to appear in our own behalf we werent allowed a chance to argue our own casenothing they simply slapped on a receiver and now they refuse to allow us redress from a legal standpoint its appalling im told but whats to be done whats the game thats the thing what are they up to im nearly out of my mind for its all my fault i didnt think it meant anything like this or id have made a fight for possession and stood them off at least as it is my partners sore and hes gone to drinking first time in twelve years he says i gave the claim away and now its up to me and the almighty to get it back if he gets full hell drive a fourhorse wagon into some church or go up and pick the judge to pieces with his fingers to see what makes him go round whatve they got against you and dextry some grudge she questioned no no were not the only ones in trouble theyve jumped the rest of the good mines and put this mcnamara in as receiver on all of them but thats small comfort the swedes are crazy theyve hired all the lawyers in town and are murdering more good american language than would fill bering strait dex is in favor of getting our friends together and throwing the receiver off he wants to kill somebody but we cant do that theyve got the soldiers to fall back on weve been warned that the troops are instructed to enforce the courts action i dont know what the plot is for i cant believe the old judge is crooked the girl wouldnt let him girl cherry malotte leaned forward where the light shone on the young mans worried face the girl what girl who is she her voice had lost its lazy caress her lips had thinned never was a womans face more eloquent mused glenister as he noted her every thought fled to this window to peer forth fearful lustful hateful as the case might be he had loved to play with her in the former days to work upon her passions and watch the changes to note her features mirror every varying emotion from tenderness to flippancy from anger to delight and at his bidding to see the pale cheeks glow with loves fire the eyes grow heavy the dainty lips invite kisses cherry was a perfect little spoiled animal he reflected and a very dangerous one what girl she questioned again and he knew beforehand the look that went with it the girl i intend to marry he said slowly looking her between the eyes he knew he was cruel he wanted to be it satisfied the clamor and turmoil within him while he also felt that the sooner she knew and the colder it left her the better he could not note the effect of the remark on her however for as he spoke the door of the box opened and the head of the bronco kid appeared then retired instantly with apologies wrong stall he said in his slow voice looking for another party nevertheless his eyes had covered every inch of them noted the drawn curtains and the breathless poise of the woman while his ears had caught part of glenisters speech you wont marry her said cherry quietly i dont know who she is but i wont let you marry her she rose and smoothed her skirts its time nice people were going now she said it with a sneer at herself take me out through this crowd im living quietly and i dont want these beasts to follow me as they emerged from the theatre the morning air was cool and quiet while the sun was just rising the bronco kid lighted a cigar as they passed nodding silently at their greeting his eyes followed them while his hands were so still that the match burned through to his fingers then when they had gone his teeth met and ground savagely through the tobacco so that the cigar fell while he muttered so thats the girl you intend to marry well see by god chapter viii dextry makes a call the water front had a strong attraction for helen chester and rarely did a fair day pass without finding her in some quiet spot from which she could watch the shifting life along its edge the ships at anchor and the varied incidents of the surf this morning she sat in a dory pulled high up on the beach bathed in the bright sunshine and staring at the rollers while lines of concentration wrinkled her brow the wind had blown for some days till the ocean beat heavily across the shallow bar and now as it became quieter longshoremen were launching their craft preparing to resume their traffic not until the previous day had the news of her friends misfortune come to her and although she had heard no hint of fraud she began to realize that they were involved in a serious tangle to the questions which she anxiously put to her uncle he had replied that their difficulty arose from a technicality in the mining laws which another man had been shrewd enough to profit by it was a complicated question he said and one requiring time to thrash out to an equitable settlement she had undertaken to remind him of the service these men had done her but with a smile he interrupted he could not allow such things to influence his judicial attitude and she must not endeavor to prejudice him in the discharge of his duty recognizing the justice of this she had desisted for many days the girl had caught scattered talk between the judge and mcnamara and between struve and his associates but it all seemed foreign and dry and beyond the fact that it bore on the litigation over the anvil creek mines she understood nothing and cared less particularly as a new interest had but recently come into her life an interest in the form of a man mcnamara he had begun with quiet halfconcealed admiration of her which had rapidly increased until his attentions had become of a singularly positive and resistless character judge stillman was openly delighted while the court of one like alec mcnamara could but flatter any girl in his presence helen felt herself rebelling at his suit yet as distance separated them she thought ever more kindly of it this state of mind contrasted oddly with her feelings towards the other man she had met for in this country there were but two when glenister was with her she saw his love lying nakedly in his eyes and it exercised some spell which drew her to him in spite of herself but when he had gone back came the distrust the terror of the brute she felt was there behind it all the one appealed to her while present the other pled strongest while away now she was attempting to analyze her feelings and face the future squarely for she realized that her affairs neared a crisis and this too not a month after meeting the men she wondered if she would come to love her uncles friend she did not know of the other she was sure she never could busied with these reflections she noticed the familiar figure of dextry wandering aimlessly he was not unkempt and yet his air gave her the impression of prolonged sleeplessness spying her he approached and seated himself in the sand against the boat while at her greeting he broke into talk as if he was needful only of her friendly presence to stir his confidential chords into active vibration were in turrible shape miss he said our claims jumped somebody run in and talked the boy out of it while i was gone and now we cant get em off hes been tryin this here new law game that youall brought in this summer ive been drunk thats what makes me look so ornery he said the last not in the spirit of apology for rarely does your frontiersman consider that his selfindulgences require palliation but rather after the manner of one purveying news of mild interest as he would inform you that his surcingle had broken or that he had witnessed a lynching what made them jump your claim i dont know i dont know nothin about it because as i remarked previous i aint follered the totterin footsteps of

i throwed sticks at the critter when he tried to unclimb the tree till finally the boss got back with his dogs they set up an awful holler when they see the bear first one theyd ever smelled i reckon

son an put a gold fillin in his leg yes sir most chewed it off hanglish let out a siberianwolf holler hisself an i had to step in with the hatchet and kill the brute though i was most dead from laughin thats how it is with me an glenister the old man concluded when he gets tired experimentin with this new law game of hisn ill step in an do business on a commonsense basis you talk as if you wouldnt get fair play said helen we wont said he with conviction i look on all lawyers with suspicion even to old baldface your uncle askin your pardon an gettin it bein as im a friend an he aint no real relation of yours anyhow no sir theyre all crooked dextry held the western distrust of the legal profession comprehensive unreasoning deep is the old man all the kin youve got he questioned when she refused to discuss the matter he is in a way i have a brother or i hope i have somewhere he ran away when we were both little tads and i havent seen him since i heard about him indirectly at skagway three years agoduring the big rush to the klondike but he has never been home when father died i went to live with uncle arthur some day perhaps ill find my brother hes cruel to hide from me this way for there are only we two left and ive loved him always she spoke sadly and her mood blended well with the gloom of her companion so they stared silently out over the heaving green waters its a good thing me an the kid had a little piece of money ahead dextry resumed later reverting to the thought that lay uppermost in his mind cause wed be up against it right if we hadnt the boy couldnt have amused himself none with these court proceedings because they come high i call em luxuries like brandied peaches an silk undershirts i dont trust these jim crow banks no more than i do lawyers neither no sirree i bought a iron safe an hauled it out to the mine she weighs eighteen hundred and we keep our money locked up there weve got a feller named johnson watchin it now steal it well hardly they cant bust her open without a stick of giant which would rouse everybody in five miles an they cant lug her off bodily shes too heavy no its safer there than any place i know of there aint no abscondin cashiers an all that tomorrer im goin back to live on the claim an watch this receiver man till the things settled when the girl arose to go he accompanied her up through the deep sand of the lanelike street to the main muddy thoroughfare of the camp as yet the planked and gravelled pavements which later threaded the town were unknown and the incessant traffic had worn the road into a quagmire of chocolatecolored slush almost axledeep with which the store fronts showwindows and awnings were plentifully shot and spattered from passing teams whenever a wagon approached pedestrians fled to the shelter of neighboring doorways watching a chance to dodge out again when vehicles passed from the comparative solidity of the main street out into the morasses that constituted the rest of the town they adventured perilously their horses plunging snorting terrified amid an atmosphere of profanity discouraged animals were down constantly and no footpassenger even with rubber boots ventured off the planks that led from house to house to avoid a splashing team dextry pulled his companion close in against the entrance to the northern saloon standing before her protectingly although it was late in the afternoon the bronco kid had just arisen and was now loafing preparatory to the active duties of his profession he was speaking with the proprietor when dextry and the girl sought shelter just without the open door so he caught a fair though fleeting glimpse of her as she flashed a curious look inside she had never been so close to a gamblinghall before and would have liked to peer in more carefully had she dared but her companion moved forward at the first look the bronco kid had broken off in his speech and stared at her as though at an apparition when she had vanished he spoke to reilly whos that reilly shrugged his shoulders then without further question the kid turned back towards the empty theatre and out of the back door he moved nonchalantly till he was outside then with the speed of a colt ran down the narrow planking between the buildings turned parallel to the front street leaped from board to board splashed through puddles of water till he reached the next alley stamping the mud from his shoes and pulling down his sombrero he sauntered out into the main thoroughfare dextry and his companion had crossed to the other side and were approaching so the gambler gained a fair view of them he searched every inch of the girls face and figure then as she made to turn her eyes in his direction he slouched away he followed however at a distance till he saw the man leave her then on up to the big hotel he shadowed her a halfhour later he was drinking in the golden gate barroom with an acquaintance who ministered to the mechanical details behind the hotel counter whos the girl i saw come in just now he inquired i guess you mean the judges niece both men spoke in the dead restrained tones that go with their callings whats her name chester i think why look good to you kid although the other neither spoke nor made sign the bartender construed his silence as acquiescence and continued with a conscious glance at his own reflection while he adjusted his diamond scarfpin well she can have me ive got it fixed to meet her bah i guess not said the kid suddenly with an inflection that startled the other from his preening then as he went out the man mused gee broncos got the worst eye in the camp makes me creep when he throws it on me with that muddy look he acted like he was jealous at noon the next day as he prepared to go to the claim dextrys partner burst in upon him glenister was dishevelled and his eyes shone with intense excitement what dyou think theyve done now he cried as greeting i dunno what is it theyve broken open the safe and taken our money what the old man in turn was on his feet the grudge which he had felt against glenister in the past few days forgotten in this common misfortune yes by heaven theyve swiped our money our tents tools teams books hose and all of our personal property everything they threw johnson off and took the whole works i never heard of such a thing i went out to the claim and they wouldnt let me go near the workings theyve got every mine on anvil creek guarded the same way and they arent going to let us come around even when they clean up they told me so this morning but look here demanded dextry sharply the money in that safe belongs to us thats money we brought in from the states the court aint got no right to it what kind of a damn law is that oh as to law they dont pay any attention to it any more said glenister bitterly i made a mistake in not killing the first man that set foot on the claim i was a sucker and now were up against a stiff game the swedes are in the same fix too this last order has left them groggy i dont understand it yet said dextry why its this way the judge has issued what he calls an order enlarging the powers of the receiver and it authorizes mcnamara to take possession of everything on the claims tents tools stores and personal property of all kinds it was issued last night without notice to our side so wheaton says and they served it this morning early i went out to see mcnamara and when i got there i found him in our private tent with the safe broken open what does this mean i said and then he showed me the new order im responsible to the court for every penny of this money said he and for every tool on the claim in view of that i cant allow you to go near the workings not go near the workings said i do you mean you wont let us see the cleanups from our own mine how do we know were getting a square deal if we dont see the gold weighed im an officer of the court and under bond said he and the smiling triumph in his eyes made me crazy youre a lying thief i said looking at him square and youre going too far you played me for a fool once and made it stick but it wont work twice he looked injured and aggrieved and called in voorhees the marshal i cant grasp the thing at all everybody seems to be against us the judge the marshal the prosecuting attorney everybody yet theyve done it all according to law they claim and have the soldiers to back them up its just as mexico mullins said dextry stormed theres a deal on of some kind im goin up to the hotel an call on the judge myself i aint never seen him nor this mcnamara either i allus want to look a man straight in the eyes once then i know what course to foller in my dealings youll find them both said glenister for mcnamara rode into town behind me the old prospector proceeded to the golden gate hotel and inquired for judge stillmans room a boy attempted to take his name but he seized him by the scruff of the neck and sat him in his seat proceeding unannounced to the suite to which he had been directed hearing voices he knocked and then without awaiting a summons walked in the room was fitted like an office with desk table typewriter and lawbooks other rooms opened from it on both sides two men were talking earnestly one grayhaired smoothshaven and clerical the other tall picturesque and masterful with his first glance the miner knew that before him were the two he had come to see and that in reality he had to deal with but one the big man who shot at him the level glances we are engaged said the judge very busily engaged sir will you call again in half an hour dextry looked him over carefully from head to foot then turned his back on him and regarded the other neither he nor mcnamara spoke but their eyes were busy and each instinctively knew that here was a foe what do you want mcnamara inquired finally i just dropped in to get acquainted my name is dextry joe dextry from everywhere west of the missouri an your name is mcnamara aint it this here i reckon is your little french poodle eh indicating stillman what do you mean said mcnamara while the judge murmured indignantly just what i say however that aint what i want to talk about i dont take no stock in such truck as judges an lawyers an orders of court they aint intended to be took serious theyre all right for children an easterners an non compos mentis people i spose but ive always been my own judge jury an hangman an i aim to continue workin my legislatif executif an judicial duties to the end of the string you look out my pardner is young an seems to like the idee of lettin somebody else run his business so im goin to give him rein and let him amuse himself for a while with your dinky little writs an receiverships but dont go too far you can rob the swedes cause swedes aint entitled to have no money an some other crook would get it if you didnt but dont play me an glenister fer scandinavians its a mistake were white men an im apt to come romancin up here with one of these an bust you so you wont hold together durin the ceremonies with his last words he made the slightest shifting movement only a lifting shrug of the shoulder yet in his palm lay a sixshooter he had slipped it from his trousers band with the ease of long practice and absolute surety judge stillman gasped and backed against the desk but mcnamara idly swung his leg as he sat sidewise on the table his only sign of interest was a quickening of the eyes a fact of which dextry made mental note yes said the miner disregarding the alarm of the lawyer you can wear this court in your vestpocket like a waterbury if you want to but if you dont let me alone ill uncoil its mainspring thats all he replaced his weapon and turning walked out the door chapter ix sluice robbers we must have money said glenister a few days later when mcnamara jumped our safe he put us down and out theres no use fighting in this court any longer for the judge wont let us work the ground ourselves even if we give bond and he wont grant an appeal he says his orders arent appealable we ought to send wheaton out to frisco and have him take the case to the higher courts maybe he can get a writ of supersedeas i dont recnize the name but if its as bad as it sounds its sure horrible aint there no cure for it it simply means that the upper court would take the case away from this one well lets send him out quick every day means ten thousand dollars to us it ll take him a month to make the round trip so i spose he ought to leave tomorrow on the roanoke yes but wheres the money to do it with mcnamara has ours my god what a mess were in what fools weve been dex theres a conspiracy here im beginning to see it now that its too late this man is looting our country under color of law and figures on gutting all the mines before we can throw him off thats his game hell work them as hard and as long as he can and heaven only knows what will become of the money he must have big men behind him in order to fix a united states judge this way maybe he has the frisco courts corrupted too if he has im goin to kill him said dextry ive worked like a dog all my life and now that ive struck pay i dont aim to lose it if bill wheaton cant win out accordin to law im goin to proceed accordin to justice during the past two days the partners had haunted the courtroom where their lawyer together with the counsel for the scandinavians had argued and pleaded trying every possible professional and unprofessional artifice in search of relief from the arbitrary rulings of the court while hourly they had become more strongly suspicious of some sinister plot some hidden powerful understanding back of the judge and the entire mechanism of justice they had fought with the fury of men who battle for life and had grown to hate the lines of stillmans vacillating face the bluster of the districtattorney and the smirking confidence of the clerks for it seemed that they all worked mechanically like toys at the dictates of alec mcnamara at last when they had ceased beaten and exhausted they were too confused with technical phrases to grasp anything except the fact that relief was denied them that their claims were to be worked by the receiver and as a crowning defeat they learned that the judge would move his court to st michaels and hear no cases until he returned a month later meanwhile mcnamara hired every idle man he could lay hand upon and ripped the placers open with double shifts every day a stream of yellow dust poured into the bank and was locked in his vaults while those mineowners who attempted to witness the cleanups were ejected from their claims the politician had worked with incredible swiftness and system and a fortnight after landing he had made good his boast to struve and was in charge of every good claim in the district the owners were ousted their appeals argued and denied and the court gone for thirty days leaving him a clear field for his operations he felt a contempt for most of his victims who were slowwitted swedes grasping neither the purport nor the magnitude of his operation and as to those litigants who were discerning enough to see its enormity he trusted to his organization to thwart them the two partners had come to feel that they were beating against a wall and had also come squarely to face the proposition that they were without funds wherewith to continue their battle it was maddening for them to think of the daily robbery that they suffered for the midas turned out many ounces of gold at every shift and more maddening to realize the receivers shrewdness in crippling them by his theft of the gold in their safe that had been his crowning stroke we must get money quick said glenister do you think we can borrow borrow sniffed dextry folks dont lend money in alaska they relapsed into a moody silence i met a feller this mornin thats workin on the midas the old man resumed he came in town fer a pair of gum boots an he says theyve run into awful rich ground so rich that they have to clean up every morning when the night shift goes off cause the riffles clog with gold think of it glenister growled if we had even a part of one of those cleanups we could send wheaton outside in the midst of his bitterness a thought struck him he made as though to speak then closed his mouth but his partners eyes were on him filled with a suppressed but growing fire dextry lowered his voice cautiously therell be twenty thousand dollars in them sluices tonight at midnight glenister stared back while his pulse pounded at something that lay in the others words it belongs to us the young man said there wouldnt be anything wrong about it would there dextry sneered wrong right them is fine an soundin titles in a mess like this what do they mean i tell you at midnight tonight alec mcnamara will have twenty thousand dollars of our money god what would happen if they caught us whispered the younger following out his thought theyd never let us get off the claim alive he couldnt find a better excuse to shoot us down and get rid of us if we came up before this judge for trial wed go to sitka for twenty years sure but its our only chance id ruther die on the midas in a fair fight than set here bitin my hangnails im growin old and i wont never make another strike as to bein caught thems our chances i wont be took alive i promise you that and before i go ill get my satisfy castin things up thats about all a man gets in this vale of tears jest satisfaction of one kind or another itll be a fight in the open under the stars with the clean wet moss to lie down on and not a scrappinmatch of freak phrases and lawbooks inside of a stinkin courtroom the cards is shuffled and in the box pardner and the game is started if were due to win well win if were due to lose well lose these things is all figgered out a thousand years back come on boy are you game am i game glenisters nostrils dilated and his voice rose a tone am i game im with you till the big cashin and lord have mercy on any man that blocks our game tonight well need another hand to help us said dextry who can we get at that moment as though in answer the door opened with the scant ceremony that friends of the frontier are wont to observe admitting the attenuated flapping domecrowned figure of slapjack simms and dextry fell upon him with the hunger of a wolf it was midnight and over the dark walls of the valley peered a multitude of stars while away on the southern horizon there glowed a subdued effulgence as though from hidden fires beneath the gold gods caldron or as though the phosphorescence of bering had spread upward into the skies although each night grew longer it was not yet necessary to light the men at work in the cuts there were perhaps two hours in which it was difficult to see at a distance but the dawn came early hence no provision had been made for torches five minutes before the hour the nightshift boss lowered the gates in the dam and as the rush from the sluices subsided his men quit work and climbed the bluff to the mess tent the dwellings of the midas as has already been explained sat back from the creek at a distance of a city block the workings being thus partially hidden under the brow of the steep bank it is customary to leave a watchman in the pit during the noon and midnight hours not only to see that strangers preserve a neutral attitude but also to watch the wastegates and water supply the night man of the midas had been warned of his responsibility and knowing that much gold lay in his keeping was disposed to gaze on the curiousminded with the sourness of suspicion therefore as a man leading a packhorse approached out of the gloom of the creektrail his eyes were on him from the moment he appeared the road wound along the gravel of the bars and passed in proximity to the flumes however the wayfarer paid no attention to them and the watchman detected an explanatory weariness in his slow gait some prospector getting in from a trip he thought the stranger stopped scratched a match and as he undertook to light his pipe the observer caught the mahogany shine of a negros face the match sputtered out and then came impatient blasphemy as he searched for another evenin sah youall oblige me with a match he addressed the watcher on the bank above and without waiting a reply began to climb upward no smoker on the trail will deny the luxury of a light to the most humble so as the negro gained his level the man reached forth to accommodate him without warning the black man leaped forward with the ferocity of an animal and struck the other a fearful blow the watchman sank with a faint startled cry and the african dragged him out of sight over the brow of the bank where he rapidly tied him hand and foot stuffing a gag into his mouth at the same moment two other figures rounded the bend below and approached they were mounted and leading a third saddlehorse as well as other packanimals reaching the workings they dismounted then began a strange procedure for one man clambered upon the sluices and with a pick ripped out the riffles this was a matter of only a few seconds then seizing a shovel he transferred the concentrates which lay in the bottom of the boxes into canvas sacks which his companion held as each bag was filled it was tied and dumped into the cut they treated but four boxes in this way leaving the lower twothirds of the flume untouched for anvil creek gold is coarse and the heart of the cleanup lies where it is thrown in gathering the sacks together they lashed them upon the packanimals then mounted the second string of sluices and began as before throughout it all they worked with feverish haste and in unbroken silence every moment flashing quick glances at the figure of the lookout who stood on the crest above half dimmed in the shadow of a willow clump judging by their rapidity and sureness they were expert miners from the tent came the voices of the night shift at table and the faint rattle of dishes while the canvas walls glowed from the lights within like great fireflies hidden in the grass the foreman finishing his meal appeared at the door of the mess tent and pausing to accustom his eyes to the gloom peered perfunctorily towards the creek the watchman detached himself from the shadow moving out into plain sight and the boss turned back the two men below were now working on the sluices which lay close under the bank and were thus hidden from the tent mcnamaras description of anvil creeks riches had fired helen chester with the desire to witness a cleanup so they had ridden out from town in time for supper at the claim she had not known whither he led her only understanding that provision for her entertainment would be made with the superintendents wife upon recognizing the midas she had endeavored to question him as to why her friends had been dispossessed and he had answered as it seemed straight and true the ground was in dispute he said another man claimed it and while the litigation pended he was in charge for the court to see that neither party received injury he spoke adroitly and it satisfied her to have the proposition resolved into such simplicity she had come prepared to spend the night and witness the early morning operation so the receiver made the most of his opportunity he showed her over the workings explaining the many things that were strange to her not only was he in himself a fascinating figure to any woman but wherever he went men regarded him deferentially and nothing affects a womans judgment more promptly than this obvious sign of power he spent the evening with her talking of his early days and the things he had done in the west his story matching the picturesqueness of her canvaswalled quarters with their rough furnishings of skins and blankets being a keen observer as well as a finished raconteur he had woven a spell of words about the girl leaving her in a state of tumult and indecision when at last towards midnight he retired to his own tent she knew to what end all this was working and yet knew not what her answer would be when the question came which lay behind it all at moments she felt the wonderful attraction of the man and still there was some distrust of him which she could not fathom again her thoughts reverted to glenister the impetuous and she compared the two so similar in some ways so utterly opposed in others it was when she heard the night shift at their meal that she threw a silken shawl about her head stepped into the cool night and picked her way down towards the roar of the creek a breath of air and then to bed she thought she saw the tall figure of the watchman and made for him he seemed oddly interested in her approach watching her very closely almost as though alarmed it was doubtless because there were so few women out here or possibly on account of the lateness of the hour away with conventions this was the land of instinct and impulse she would talk to him the man drew his hat more closely about his face and moved off as she came up glenister had been in her thoughts a moment since and she now noted that here was another with the same great square shoulders and erect head then she saw with a start that this one was a negro he carried a winchester and seemed to watch her carefully yet with indecision to express her interest and to break the silence she questioned him but at the sound of her voice he stepped towards her and spoke roughly what then he paused and stammered in a strangely altered and unnatural voice yassm im the watchman she noted two other darkies at work below and was vaguely surprised not so much at their presence as at the manner in which they moved for they seemed under stress of some great haste running hither and yon she saw horses standing in the trail and sensed something indefinably odd and alarming in the air turning to the man she opened her mouth to speak when from the rank grass under her feet came a noise which set her atingle and at which her suspicions leaped full to the solution it was the groan of a man again he gave voice to his pain and she knew that she stood face to face with something sinister tales of sluice robbers had come to her and rumors of the daring raids into which men were lured by the yellow sheen and yet this was incredible a hundred men lay within sound of her voice she could hear their laughter one was whistling a popular refrain a quartermile away on every hand were other camps a scream from her would bring them all nonsense this was no sluice robbery and then the man in the bushes below moaned for the third time what is that she said without reply the negro lowered the muzzle of his rifle till it covered her breast and at the same time she heard the double click of the hammer keep still and dont move he warned were desperate and we cant take any chances miss oh you are stealing the gold she was wildly frightened yet stood still while the lookout anxiously divided his attention between her and the tents above until his companions signalled him that they were through and the horses were loaded then he spoke i dont know what to do with you but i guess ill tie you up what she said im going to tie and gag you so you cant holler oh dont you dare she cried fiercely ill stand right here till youve gone and i wont scream i promise she looked up at him appealingly at which he dipped his head so that she caught only a glimpse of his face and then backed away all right dont try it because ill be hidden in those bushes yonder at the bend and ill keep you covered till the others are gone he leaped down the bank ran to the cavalcade mounted quickly and the three lashed their horses into a run disappearing up the trail around the sharp curve she heard the blows of their quirts as they whipped the packhorses they were long out of sight before the girl moved or made sound although she knew that none of the three had paused at the bend she only stood and gazed for as they galloped off she had heard the scrap of a broken sentence it was but one excited word sounding through the rattle of hoofs her own name helen and yet because of it she did not voice the alarm but rather began to piece together bit by bit the strange points of this adventure she recalled the outlines of her captor with a wrinkle of perplexity her fright disappeared entirely giving place to intense excitement no no it cant be and yet i wonder if it is she cried oh i wonder if it could be she opened her lips to cry aloud then hesitated she started towards the tents then paused and for many moments after the hoofbeats had died out she stayed undecided surely she wished to give the signal to force the fierce pursuit what meant this robbery this defiance of the law of her uncles edicts and of mcnamara they were common thieves criminals outlaws these men deserving punishment and yet she recalled a darker night when she herself had sobbed and quivered with the terrors of pursuit and two men had shielded her with their bodies she turned and sped towards the tents bursting in through the canvas door instantly every man rose to his feet at sight of her pallid face her flashing eyes and rumpled hair sluice robbers she cried breathlessly quick a holdup the watchman is hurt a roar shook the night air and the men poured out past her while the day shift came tumbling forth from every quarter in various stages of undress where who did it where did they go mcnamara appeared among them fierce and commanding seeming to grasp the situation intuitively without explanation from her come on men well run em down get out the horses quick he was mounted even as he spoke and others joined him then turning he waved his long arm up the valley towards the mountains divide into squads of five and cover the hills run down to discovery one of you and telephone to town for voorhees and a posse as they made ready to ride away the girl cried stop not that way they went down the gulch three negroes she pointed out of the valley towards the dim glow on the southern horizon and the cavalcade rode away into the gloom chapter x the wit of an adventuress up creek the three negroes fled past other camps to where the stream branched here they took to the right and urged their horses along a forsaken trail to the headwaters of the little tributary and over the low saddle they had endeavored to reach unfrequented paths as soon as possible in order that they might pass unnoticed before quitting the valley they halted their heaving horses and selecting a stagnant pool scoured the grease paint from their features as best they could their ears were strained for sounds of pursuit but as the moments passed and none came the tension eased somewhat and they conversed guardedly as the morning light spread they crossed the mosscapped summit of the range but paused again and removing two saddles hid them among the rocks slapjack left the others here and rode southward down the dry creek trail towards town while the partners shifted part of the weight from the overloaded packmules to the remaining saddleanimals and continued eastward along the barren comb of hills on foot leading the five horses it dont seem like well get away this easy said dextry scanning the back trail if we do ill be tempted to foller the business reglar this grease paint on my face makes me smell like a minstrel man i bet well get some bully press notices tomorrow i wonder what helen was doing there glenister answered irrelevantly for he had been more shaken by his encounter with her than at his part in the rest or the enterprise and his mind which should have been busied with the flight held nothing but pictures of her as she stood in the half darkness under the fear of his winchester what if she ever learned who that black ruffian was he quailed at the thought say dex i am going to marry that girl i dunno if you be or not said dextry better watch mcnamara what the younger man stopped and stared what do you mean go on dont stop the horses i aint blind i kin put two an two together youll never put those two together nonsense why the mans a rascal i wouldnt let him have her besides it couldnt be shell find him out i love her so much that oh my feelings are too big to talk about he moved his hands eloquently you cant understand umm i spose not grunted dextry but his eyes were level and held the light of the past he may be a rascal the old man continued after a little ill put in with you on that but hes a handsome devil and as for manners he makes you look like a logger hes a brave man too them three qualities are trumpcards and warranted to take most any queen in the human deck red white or yellow if he dares growled glenister while his thick brows came forward and ugly lines hardened in his face in the gray of the early morning they descended the foothills into the wide valley of the nome river and filed out across the rolling country to the river bluffs where cleverly concealed among the willows was a rocker this they set up then proceeded to wash the dirt from the sacks carefully yet with the utmost speed for there was serious danger of discovery it was wonderful this treasure of the richest ground since the days of and the men worked with shining eyes and hands atremble the gold was coarse and many ragged yellow lumps too large to pass through the screen rolled in the hopper while the aprons bellied with its weight in the pans which they had provided there grew a gleaming heap of wet raw gold shortly by divergent routes the partners rode unnoticed into town and into the excitement of the holdup news while the tardy still lingered over their breakfasts far out in the roadstead lay the roanoke black smoke pouring from her stack a tug was returning from its last trip to her glenister forced his lathered horse down to the beach and questioned the longshoremen who hung about no its too late to get aboard the last tender is on its way back they informed him if you want to go to the outside youll have to wait for the fleet that only means another week and there she blows now a ribbon of white mingled with the velvet from the steamers funnel and there came a slow throbbing farewell blast glenisters jaw clicked and squared quick you men he cried to the sailors i want the lightest dory on the beach and the strongest oarsmen in the crowd ill be back in five minutes theres a hundred dollars in it for you if we catch that ship he whirled and spurred up through the mud of the streets bill wheaton was snoring luxuriously when wrenched from his bed by a dishevelled man who shook him into wakefulness and into a portion of his clothes with a storm of excited instructions the lawyer had neither time nor opportunity for expostulation for glenister snatched a valise and swept into it a litter of documents from the table hurry up man he yelled as the lawyer dived frantically about his office in a rabbitlike hunt for items my heavens are you dead wake up the ships leaving with sleep still in his eyes wheaton was dragged down the street to the beach where a knot had assembled to witness the race as they tumbled into the skiff willing hands ran it out into the surf on the crest of a roller a few lifting heaves and they were over the bar with the men at the oars bending the white ash at every swing i guess i didnt forget anything gasped wheaton as he put on his coat i got ready yesterday but i couldnt find you last night so i thought the deal was off glenister stripped off his coat and facing the bow pushed upon the oars at every stroke thus adding his strength to that of the oarsmen they crept rapidly out from the beach eating up the two miles that lay towards the ship he urged the men with all his power till the sweat soaked through their clothes and under their clinging shirts the muscles stood out like iron they had covered half the distance when wheaton uttered a cry and glenister desisted from his work with a curse the roanoke was moving slowly the rowers rested but the young man shouted at them to begin again and seizing a boathook stuck it into the arms of his coat he waved this on high while the men redoubled their efforts for many moments they hung in suspense watching the black hull as it gathered speed and then as they were about to cease their effort a puff of steam burst from its whistle and the next moment a short toot of recognition reached them glenister wiped the moisture from his brow and grinned at wheaton a quarter of an hour later as they lay heaving below the ships steel sides he thrust a heavy buckskin sack into the lawyers hand theres money to win the fight bill i dont know how much but its enough god bless you hurry back a sailor cast them a whirling rope up which wheaton clambered then tying the gripsack to its end they sent it after important the young man yelled at the officer on the bridge government business he heard a muffled clang in the engineroom the thrash of the propellers followed and the big ship glided past as glenister dragged himself up the beach upon landing helen chester called to him and made room for him beside her it had never been necessary to call him to her side before and equally unfamiliar was the abashment or perhaps physical weariness that led the young man to sink back in the warm sand with a sigh of relief she noted that for the first time the audacity was gone from his eyes i watched your race she began it was very exciting and i cheered for you he smiled quietly what made you keep on after the ship started i should have given up and cried i never give up anything that i want he said have you never been forced to then it is because you are a man women have to sacrifice a great deal helen expected him to continue to the effect that he would never give her up it was in accordance with his earlier presumption but he was silent and she was not sure that she liked him as well thus as when he overwhelmed her with the boldness of his suit for glenister it was delightful after the perils of the night to rest in the calm of her presence and to feel dumbly that she was near she saw him secretly caress a fold of her dress if only she had not the memory of that one night on the ship still he is trying to make amends in the best way he can she thought though of course no woman could care for a man who would do such a thing yet she thrilled at the thought of how he had thrust his body between her and danger how but for his quick insistent action she would have failed in escaping from the pest ship failed in her mission and met death on the night of her landing she owed him much did you hear what happened to the good ship ohio she asked no ive been too busy to inquire i was told the health officers quarantined her when she arrived thats all she was sent to egg island with every one aboard she has been there more than a month now and may not get away this summer what a disappointment for the poor devils on her yes and only for what you did i should be one of them helen remarked i didnt do much he said the fighting part is easy its not half so hard as to give up your property and lie still while did you do that because i asked you to because i asked you to put aside the old ways a wave of compassion swept over her certainly he answered it didnt come easy but oh i thank you said she i know it is all for the best uncle arthur wouldnt do anything wrong and mr mcnamara is an honorable man he turned towards her to speak but refrained he could not tell her what he felt certain of she believed in her own blood and in her uncles friends and it was not for him to speak of mcnamara the rules of the game sealed his lips she was thinking again if only you had not acted as you did she longed to help him now in his trouble as he had helped her but what could she do the law was such a confusing intricate perplexing thing i spent last night at the midas she told him and rode back early this morning that was a daring holdup wasnt it what holdup why havent you heard the news no he answered steadily i just got up your claim was robbed three men overcame the watchman at midnight and cleaned the boxes his simulation of excited astonishment was perfect and he rained a shower of questions upon her she noted with approval that he did not look her in the eye however he was not an accomplished liar now mcnamara had a countenance of iron unconsciously she made comparison and the young man at her side did not lose thereby yes i saw it all she concluded after recounting the details the negro wanted to bind me so that i couldnt give the alarm but his chivalry prevented he was a most gallant darky what did you do when they left why i kept my word and waited until they were out of sight then i roused the camp and set mr mcnamara and his men right after them down the gulch down the gulch spoke glenister off his guard yes of course did you think they went upstream she was looking squarely at him now and he dropped his eyes no the posse started in that direction but i put them right there was an odd light in her glance and he felt the blood drumming in his ears she sent them downstream so that was why there had been no pursuit then she must suspect she must know everything glenister was stunned again his love for the girl surged tumultuously within him and demanded expression but miss chester no longer feeling sure that she had the situation in hand had already started to return to the hotel i saw the men distinctly she told him before they separated and i could identify them all at his own house glenister found dextry removing the stains of the nights adventure miss chester recognized us last night he announced how do you know she told me so just now and whats more she sent mcnamara and his crowd down the creek instead of up thats why we got away so easily well well aint she a brick shes even with us now bytheway i wonder how much we cleaned up anyhow lets weigh it going to the bed dextry turned back the blankets exposing four mooseskin sacks wet and heavy where he had thrown them there must have been twenty thousand dollars with what i gave wheaton said glenister at that moment without warning the door was flung open and as the young man jerked the blankets into place he whirled snatched the sixshooter that dextry had discarded and covered the entrance dont shoot boy cried the newcomer breathlessly my but youre nervous glenister dropped his gun it was cherry malotte and from her heaving breast and the flying colors in her cheeks the men saw she had been running she did not give them time to question but closed and locked the door while the words came tumbling from her theyre on to you boys youd better duck out quick theyre on their way up here now what who quick i heard mcnamara and voorhees the marshal talking somebody has spotted you for the holdups theyre on their way now i tell you i sneaked out by the back way and came here through the mud say but im a sight she stamped her trimly booted feet and flirted her skirt i dont savvy what you mean said dextry glancing at his partner warningly we aint done nothin well its all right then i took a long chance so you could make a getaway if you wanted to because theyve got warrants for you for that sluice robbery last night here they are now she darted to the window the men peering over her shoulder coming up the narrow walk they saw voorhees mcnamara and three others the house stood somewhat isolated and well back on the tundra so that any one approaching it by the planking had an unobstructed view of the premises escape was impossible for the back door led out into the ankledeep puddles of the open prairie and it was now apparent that a sixth man had made a circuit and was approaching from the rear my god theyll search the place said dextry and the men looked grimly in each others faces then in a flash glenister stripped back the blankets and seized the pokes leaping into the back room in another instant he returned with them and faced desperately the candid bareness of the little room that they lived and slept in nothing could be hidden it was folly to think of it there was a loft overhead he remembered hopefully then realized that the pursuers would search there first of all i told you he was a hard fighter said dextry as the quick footsteps grew louder he aint no fool neither stead of our bein caught in the mountains i reckon well shoot it out here we should have cached that gold somewhere he spun the cylinder of his blackened colt while his face grew hard and vulturelike meanwhile cherry malotte watched the hunted look in glenisters face grow wilder and then stiffen into the stubbornness of a man at bay the posse was at the door now knocking the three inside stood rigid and strained then glenister tossed his burden on the bed go into the back room cherry theres going to be trouble whos there inquired dextry through the door to gain time suddenly without a word the girl glided to the hotblast heater now cold and empty which stood in a corner of the room these stoves used widely in the north are vertical iron cylinders into which coal is poured from above she lifted the lid and peered in to find it a quarter full of dead ashes then turned with shining eyes and parted lips to glenister he caught the hint and in an instant the four sacks were dropped softly into the feathery bottom and the ashes raked over the daring manoeuvre was almost as quick as the flash of womans wit that prompted it and was carried through while the answer to dextrys question was still unspoken then glenister opened the door carelessly and admitted the group of men weve got a searchwarrant to look through your house said voorhees what are you looking for golddust from anvil creek all right search away they rapidly scoured the premises covering every inch paying no heed to the girl who watched them with indifferent eyes nor to the old man who glared at their every movement glenister was carelessly sarcastic although he kept his right arm free while beneath his sangfroid was a thoroughly trained alertness mcnamara directed the search with a manner wholly lacking in his former mock courtesy it was as though he had been soured by the gall of defeat the mask had fallen off now and his character showed insistent overbearing cruel towards the partners he preserved a contemptuous silence the invaders ransacked thoroughly while a dozen times the hearts of cherry malotte and her two companions stopped then lunged onward as mcnamara or voorhees approached then passed the stove at last voorhees lifted the lid and peered into its dark interior at the same instant the girl cried out sharply flinging herself from her position while the marshal jerked his head back in time to see her dash upon dextry dont dont she cried her appeal to the old man keep cool youll be sorry dex theyre almost through the officer had not seen any movement on dextrys part but doubtless her quick eye had detected signs of violence mcnamara emerged glowering from the back room at that moment let them hunt the girl was saying while dextry stared dazedly over her head they wont find anything keep cool and dont act rash voorheess duties sat uncomfortably upon him at the best and looking at the smouldering eyes of the two men he became averse to further search in a powdery household whose members itched to shoot him in the back it isnt here he reported but the politician only scowled then spoke for the first time directly to the partners ive got warrants for both of you and im tempted to take you in but i wont im not through yet not by any means ill get you get you both he turned out of the door followed by the marshal who called off his guards and the group filed back along the walk say youre a jewel cherry youve saved us twice you caught voorhees just in time my heart hit my palate when he looked into that stove but the next instant i wanted to laugh at dextrys expression impulsively glenister laid his hands upon her shoulders at his look and touch her throat swelled her bosom heaved and the silken lids fluttered until she seemed choked by a very flood of sweet womanliness she blushed like a little maid and laughed a timid broken laugh then pulling herself together the merry careless tone came into her voice and her cheeks grew cool and clear you wouldnt trust me at first eh some day youll find that your old friends are the best after all and as she left them she added mockingly say youre a pair of shine desperadoes you need a governess chapter xi wherein a writ and a riot fail a raw gray day with a driving drizzle from seaward and a leaden rack of clouds drifting low matched the sullen fitful mood of glenister during the last month he had chafed and fretted like an animal in leash for word of wheaton this uncertainty this impotent waiting with folded hands was maddening to one of his spirit he could apply himself to no fixed duty for the sense of his wrong preyed on him fiercely and he found himself haunting the vicinity of the midas gazing at it from afar grasping hungrily for such scraps of news as chanced to reach him mcnamara allowed access to none but his minions so the partners knew but vaguely of what happened on their property even though under fiction of law it was being worked for their protection no steps regarding a speedy hearing of the case were allowed and the collusion between judge stillman and the receiver had become so generally recognized that there were uneasy mutterings and threats in many quarters yet although the politician had by now virtually absorbed all the richest properties in the district and worked them through his hirelings the people of nome as a whole did not grasp the full turpitude of the scheme nor the systems perfect working strange to say dextry the fireeater had assumed an oriental patience quite foreign to his peppery disposition and spent much of his time in the hills prospecting on this day as the clouds broke about noon close down on the angry horizon a drift of smoke appeared shortly resolving itself into a steamer she lay to in the offing and through his glasses glenister saw that it was the roanoke as the hours passed and no boat put off he tried to hire a crew but the longshoremen spat wisely and shook their heads as they watched the surf theres the devil of an undertow settin along this beach they told him and the waters too cold to drownd in comfortable so he laid firm hands upon his impatience every day meant many dollars to the watcher and yet it seemed that nature was resolute in thwarting him for that night the wind freshened and daylight saw the ship hugging the lee of sledge island miles to the westward while the surf white as boiling milk boomed and thundered against the shore word had gone through the street that bill wheaton was aboard with a writ or a subpoena or an alibi or whatever was necessary to put the kibosh on mcnamara so public excitement grew mcnamara hoarded his gold in the alaska bank and it was taken for granted that there would lie the scene of the struggle no one supposed for an instant that the usurper would part with the treasure peaceably on the third morning the ship lay abreast of the town again and a lifeboat was seen to make off from her whereupon the idle population streamed towards the beach shell make it to the surf all right but then watch out wed better make ready to haul em out said another its mighty dangerous and sure enough as the skiff came rushing in through the breakers she was caught she had made it past the first line soaring over the bar on a foamy rollercrest like a stormdriven gull winging in towards the land the wiry figure of bill wheaton crouched in the stern while two sailors fought with their oars as they gathered for their rush through the last zone of froth a great comber rose out of the sea behind them rearing high above their heads the crowd at the surfs edge shouted the boat wavered sucked back into the oceans angry maw and with a crash the deluge engulfed them there remained nothing but a swirling flood through which the lifeboat emerged bottom up amid a tangle of oars gratings and gear men rushed into the water and the next roller pounded them back upon the marblehard sand there came the sound of splitting wood and then a group swarmed in waistdeep and bore out a dripping figure it was a hempenheaded seaman who shook the water from his mane and grinned when his breath had come a step farther down the beach the bystanders seized a limp form which the tide rolled to them it was the second sailor his scalp split from a blow of the gunwale nowhere was wheaton glenister had plunged to the rescue first a heavingline about his middle and although buffeted about he had reached the wreck only to miss sight of the lawyer utterly he had time for but a glance when he was drawn outward by the undertow till the line at his waist grew taut then the water surged over him and he was hurled high up on the beach again he staggered dizzily back to the struggle when suddenly a wave lifted the capsized cutter and righted it and out from beneath shot the form of wheaton grimly clutching the liferopes they brought him in choking and breathless i got it he said slapping his streaming breast its all right glenister i knew what delay meant so i took a long chance with the surf the terrific ordeal he had undergone had blanched him to the lips his legs wabbled uncertainly and he would have fallen but for the young man who thrust an arm about his waist and led him up into the town i went before the circuit court of appeals in frisco he explained later and they issued orders allowing an appeal from this court and gave me a writ of supersedeas directed against old judge stillman that takes the litigation out of his hands altogether and directs mcnamara to turn over the midas and all the gold hes got what do you think of that i did better than i expected glenister wrung his hand silently while a great satisfaction came upon him at last this waiting was over and his peaceful yielding to injustice had borne fruit had proven the better course after all as the girl had prophesied he could go to her now with clean hands the mine was his again he would lay it at her feet telling her once more of his love and the change it was working in him he would make her see it make her see that beneath the harshness his years in the wild had given him his love for her was gentle and true and all absorbing he would bid her be patient till she saw he had mastered himself till he could come with his soul in harness i am glad i didnt fight when they jumped us he said now well get our property back and all the money they took out that is if mcnamara hasnt salted it yes all thats necessary is to file the documents then serve the judge and mcnamara youll be back on anvil creek tomorrow having placed their documents on record at the courthouse the two men continued to mcnamaras office he met them with courtesy i heard you had a narrow escape this morning mr wheaton too bad what can i do for you the lawyer rapidly outlined his position and stated in conclusion i filed certified copies of these orders with the clerk of the court ten minutes ago and now i make formal demand upon you to turn over the midas to messrs glenister and dextry and also to return all the golddust in your safedeposit boxes in accordance with this writ he handed his documents to mcnamara who tossed them on his desk without examination well said the politician quietly i wont do it had he been slapped in the face the attorney would not have been more astonished why you i wont do it i said mcnamara repeated sharply dont think for a minute that i havent gone into this fight armed for everything writs of supersedeas bah he snapped his fingers well see whether youll obey or not said wheaton and when he and glenister were outside he continued lets get to the judge quick as they neared the golden gate hotel they spied mcnamara entering it was evident that he had slipped from the rear door of his office and beaten them to the judicial ear i dont like that said glenister hes up to something so it appeared for they were fifteen minutes in gaining access to the magistrate and then found mcnamara with him both men were astounded at the change in stillmans appearance during the last month his weak face had shrunk and altered until vacillation was betrayed in every line and he had acquired the habit of furtively watching mcnamaras slightest movement it seemed that the part he played sat heavily upon him the judge examined the papers perfunctorily and although his air was deliberate his fingers made clumsy work of it at last he said i regret that i am forced to doubt the authenticity of these documents my heavens man wheaton cried theyre certified copies of orders from your superior court they grant the appeal that you have denied us and take the case out of your hands altogether yes and they order this man to surrender the mine and everything connected with it now sir we want you to enforce these orders stillman glanced at the silent man in the window and replied you will of course proceed regularly and make application in court in the proper way but i tell you now that i wont do anything in the matter wheaton stared at him fixedly until the old man snapped out you say they are certified copies how do i know they are the signatures may all be false maybe you signed them yourself the lawyer grew very white at this and stammered until glenister drew him out of the room come come he said well carry this thing through in open court maybe his nerve will go back on him then mcnamara has him hypnotized but he wont dare refuse to obey the orders of the circuit court of appeals he wont eh well what do you think hes doing right now said wheaton i must think this is the boldest game i ever played in they told me things while i was in frisco which i couldnt believe but i guess theyre true judges dont disobey the orders of their courts of appeal unless there is power back of them they proceeded to the attorneys office but had not been there long before slapjack simms burst in upon them hell to pay he panted mcnamaras taking your dust out of the bank whats that they cried i goes into the bank just now for an assay on some quartz samples the assayer is busy and i walk back into his room and while im there in trots mcnamara in a hurry he dont see me as im inside the private office and i overhear him tell them to get his dust out of the vault quick weve got to stop that said glenister if he takes ours hell take the swedes too simms you run up to the pioneer company and tell them about it if he gets that gold out of there nobody knows whatll become of it come on bill he snatched his hat and ran out of the room followed by the others that the loosejointed slapjack did his work with expedition was evidenced by the fact that the swedes were close upon their heels as the two entered the bank others had followed sensing something unusual and the space within the doors filled rapidly at the disturbance the clerks suspended their work the barred doors of the safedeposit vault clanged to and the cashier laid hand upon the navy colts at his elbow whats the matter he cried we want alec mcnamara said glenister the manager of the bank appeared and glenister spoke to him through the heavy wire netting is mcnamara in there no one had ever known morehouse to lie yes sir he spoke hesitatingly in a voice full of the slow music of virginia he is in here what of it we hear hes trying to move that dust of ours and we wont stand for it tell him to come out and not hide in there like a dog at these words the politician appeared beside the southerner and the two conversed softly an instant while the impatience of the crowd grew to anger some one cried lets go in and drag him out and the rumble at this was not pleasant morehouse raised his hand gentlemen mr mcnamara says he doesnt intend to take any of the gold away then hes taken it already no he hasnt the receivers course had been quickly chosen at the interruption it was not wise to anger these men too much although he had planned to get the money into his own possession he now thought it best to leave it here for the present he could come back at any time when they were off guard and get it beyond the door against which he stood lay three hundred thousand dollars weighed sacked sealed and ready to move out of the custody of this virginian whose confidence he had tried so fruitlessly to gain as mcnamara looked into the angry eyes of the leanfaced men beyond the grating he felt that the game was growing close and his blood tingled at the thought he had not planned on a resistance so strong and swift but he would meet it he knew that they hungered for his destruction and that glenister was their leader he saw further that the mans hatred now stared at him openly for the first time he knew that back of it was something more than love for the dull metal over which they wrangled and then a thought came to him some of your work eh glenister he mocked were you afraid to come alone or did you wait till you saw me with a lady at the same instant he opened a door behind him revealing helen chester youd better not walk out with me miss chester this man might well youre safer here you know youll pardon me for leaving you he hoped he could incite the young man to some rash act or word in the presence of the girl and counted on the conspicuous heroism of his own position facing the mob singlehanded one against fifty come out said his enemy hoarsely upon whom the insult and the sight of the girl in the receivers company had acted powerfully of course ill come out but i dont want this young lady to suffer any violence from your friends said mcnamara i am not armed but i have the right to leave here unmolested the right of an american citizen with that he raised his arms above his head out of my way he cried morehouse opened the gate and mcnamara strode through the mob it is a peculiar thing that although under fury of passion a man may fire even upon the back of a defenceless foe yet no one can offer violence to a man whose arms are raised on high and in whose glance is the level light of fearlessness moreover it is safer to face a crowd thus than a single adversary mcnamara had seen this psychological trick tried before and now took advantage of it to walk through the press slowly eye to eye he did it theatrically for the benefit of the girl and as he foresaw the men fell away before him all but glenister who blocked him gun in hand it was plain that the persecuted miner was beside himself with passion mcnamara came within an armslength before pausing then he stopped and the two stared malignantly at each other while the girl behind the railing heard her heart pounding in the stillness glenister raised his hand uncertainly then let it fall he shook his head and stepped aside so that the other brushed past and out into the street wheaton addressed the banker mr morehouse weve got orders and writs of one kind or another from the circuit court of appeals at frisco directing that this money be turned over to us he shoved the papers towards the other were not in a mood to trifle that gold belongs to us and we want it morehouse looked carefully at the papers i cant help you he said these documents are not directed to me theyre issued to mr mcnamara and judge stillman if the circuit court of appeals commands me to deliver it to you ill do it but otherwise ill have to keep this dust here till its drawn out by order of the court that gave it to me thats the way it was put in here and thats the way itll be taken out we want it now well i cant let my sympathies influence me then well take it out anyway cried glenister weve had the worst of it everywhere else and were sick of it come on men stand back all of you cried morehouse dont lay a hand on that gate boys pick your men he called this last to his clerks at the same instant whipping from behind the counter a carbine which he cocked the assayer brought into view a shotgun while the cashier and clerks armed themselves it was evident that the deposits of the alaska bank were abundantly safeguarded i dont aim to have any trouble with youall continued the southerner but that money stays here till its drawn out right the crowd paused at this show of resistance but glenister railed at them come on come on whats the matter with you and from the light in his eye it was evident that he would not be balked helen felt that a crisis was come and braced herself these men were in deadly earnest the whitehaired banker his pale helpers and those grim quiet ones outside there stood brawny sunbrowned men with set jaws and frowning faces and yellowhaired scandinavians in whose blue eyes danced the flame of battle these had been baffled at every turn goaded by repeated failure and now stood shoulder to shoulder in their resistance to a cruel law suddenly helen heard a command from the street and the quick tramp of men while over the heads before her she saw the glint of rifle barrels a file of soldiers with fixed bayonets thrust themselves roughly through the crowd at the entrance clear the room commanded the officer what does this mean shouted wheaton it means that judge stillman has called upon the military to guard this gold thats all come now move quick the men hesitated then sullenly obeyed for resistance to the blue of uncle sam comes only at the cost of much consideration theyre robbing us with our own soldiers said wheaton when they were outside ay said glenister darkly weve tried the law but theyre forcing us back to first principles theres going to be murder here chapter xii counterplots glenister had said that the judge would not dare to disobey the mandates of the circuit court of appeals but he was wrong application was made for orders directing the enforcement of the writs steps which would have restored possession of the midas to its owners as well as possession of the treasure in bank but stillman refused to grant them wheaton called a meeting of the swedes and their attorneys advising a junction of forces dextry who had returned from the mountains was present when they had finished their discussion he said it seems like i can always fight better when i know what the other fellers game is im going to spy on that outfit weve had detectives at work for weeks said the lawyer for the scandinavians but they cant find out anything we dont know already dextry said no more but that night found him busied in the building adjoining the one wherein mcnamara had his office he had rented a back room on the top floor and with the help of his partner sawed through the ceiling into the loft and found his way thence to the roof through a hatchway fortunately there was but little space between the two buildings and furthermore each boasted the square fronts common in miningcamps which projected high enough to prevent observation from across the way thus he was enabled without discovery to gain the roof adjoining and to cut through into the loft he crept cautiously in through the opening and out upon a floor of joists sealed on the lower side then lit a candle and locating mcnamaras office cut a peephole so that by lying flat on the timbers he could command a considerable portion of the room beneath here early the following morning he camped with the patience of an indian emerging in the still of that night stiff hungry and atrociously cross meanwhile there had been another meeting of the mineowners and it had been decided to send wheaton properly armed with affidavits and transcripts of certain court records back to san francisco on the return trip of the santa maria which had arrived in port he was to institute proceedings for contempt of court and it was hoped that by extraordinary effort he could gain quick action at daybreak dextry returned to his post and it was midnight before he crawled from his hidingplace to see the lawyer and glenister they have had a spy on you all day wheaton he began and they know youre going out to the states youll be arrested tomorrow morning before breakfast arrested what for i dont just remember what the crime is bigamy or mayhem or attainder of treason or something anyway theyll get you in jail and thats all they want they think youre the only lawyer thats wise enough to cause trouble and the only one they cant bribe lord what ll i do theyll watch every lighter that leaves the beach and if they dont catch me that way theyll search the ship ive thought it all out said the old man to whom obstruction acted as a stimulant yes but how leave it to me get your things together and be ready to duck in two hours i tell you theyll search the santa maria from stem to stern protested the lawyer but dextry had gone better do as he says his schemes are good ones recommended glenister and accordingly the lawyer made preparation in the mean time the old prospector had begun at the end of front street to make a systematic search of the gamblinghouses although it was very late they were running noisily and at last he found the man he wanted playing black jack the smell of tar in his clothes the lilt of the sea in his boisterous laughter dextry drew him aside mac theres only two things about you thats any good your silence and your seamanship otherwise youre a disreppitable drunken insect the sailor grinned what is it you want now if its concerning money or business or the growedup side of life run along and dont disturb the carousals of a sailorman if its a fight lemme get my hat i want you to wake up your fireman and have steam on the tug in an hour then wait for me below the bridge youre chartered for twentyfour hours and remember not a word im on compared to me the spinks of egyp is as talkative as a phonograph the old man next turned his steps to the northern theatre the performance was still in progress and he located the man he was hunting without difficulty ascending the stairs he knocked at the door of one of the boxes and called for captain stephens im glad i found you cap said he it saved me a trip out to your ship in the dark whats the matter dextry drew him to an isolated corner me an my partner want to send a man to the states with you all right well er heres the point hesitated the miner who rebelled at asking favors hes our law sharp an the mcnamara outfit is tryin to put the steel on him i dont understand why theyve swore out a warrant an aim to guard the shore tomorrow we want you to mr dextry im not looking for trouble i get enough in my own business but see here argued the other weve got to send him out so he can make a powwow to the big legal smoke in frisco weve been colddecked with a bum judge theyve got us into a corner an over the ropes im sorry i cant help you dextry but i got mixed up in one of your scrapes and thats plenty this aint no stowaway theres no danger to you began dextry but the officer interrupted him theres no need of arguing i wont do it oh you wont eh said the old man beginning to lose his temper well you listen to me for a minute everybody in camp knows that me an the kid is on the square an that were gettin the hunk passed to us now this lawyer party must get away tonight or these grafters will hitch the horses to him on some phony charge so he cant get to the upper court it ll be him to the birdcage for ninety days hes goin to the states though an hes goin in your wagon im talkin to you man to

job now heres my scheme he outlined his directions to the sailor who had fallen silent during the warning when he had done stephens said i never had a man talk to me like that before sir never youve taken advantage of me and under the circumstances i cant refuse ill do this thing not because of your threat but because i heard about your trouble over the midas and because i cant help admiring your blamed insolence he went back into his stall dextry returned to wheatons office as he neared it he passed a lounging figure in an adjacent doorway the place is watched he announced as he entered have you got a back door good leave your light burning and well go out that way they slipped quietly into an inky tortuous passage which led back towards second street floundering through alleys and over garbage heaps by circuitous routes they reached the bridge where in the swift stream beneath they saw the lights from macs tug steam was up and when the captain had let them aboard dextry gave him instructions to which he nodded acquiescence they bade the lawyer adieu and the little craft slipped its moorings danced down the current across the bar and was swallowed up in the darkness to seaward ill put out wheatons light so theyll think hes gone to bed yes and at daylight ill take your place in mcnamaras loft said glenister there will be doings tomorrow when they dont find him they returned by the way they had come to the lawyers room extinguished his light went to their own cabin and to bed at dawn glenister arose and sought his place above mcnamaras office to lie stretched at length on a single plank with eye glued to a crack is not a comfortable position and the watcher thought the hours of the next day would never end as they dragged wearily past his bones began to ache beyond endurance yet owing to the flimsy structure of the building he dared not move while the room below was tenanted in fact he would not have stirred had he dared so intense was his interest in the scenes being enacted beneath him first had come the marshal who imported his failure to find wheaton he left his room some time last night my men followed him in and saw a light in his window until two oclock this morning at seven oclock we broke in and he was gone he must have got wind of our plan send deputies aboard the santa maria search her from keel to topmast and have them watch the beach close or hell put off in a small boat you look over the passengers that go aboard yourself dont trust any of your men for that because he may try to slip through disguised hes liable to make up like a woman you understand theres only one ship in port and he mustnt get away he wont said voorhees with conviction and the listener overhead smiled grimly to himself for at that moment twenty miles offshore lay macs little tug hove to in the track of the outgoing steamship and in her tiny cabin sat bill wheaton eating breakfast as the morning wore by with no news of the lawyer mcnamaras uneasiness grew at noon the marshal returned with a report that the passengers were all aboard and the ship about to clear by heavens hes slipped through you stormed the politician no he hasnt he may be hidden aboard somewhere among the coalbunkers but i think hes still ashore and aiming to make a quick run just before she sails he hasnt left the beach since daylight thats sure im going out to the ship now with four men and search her again if we dont bring him off you can bet hes lying out somewhere in town and well get him later ive stationed men along the shore for two miles i wont have him get away if he should reach frisco tell your men ill give five hundred dollars to the one that finds him three hours later voorhees returned she sailed without him the politician cursed i dont believe it he tricked you i know he did glenister grinned into a halfeaten sandwich then turned upon his back and lay thus on the plank identifying the speakers below by their voices he kept his post all day later in the evening he heard struve enter the man had been drinking so he got away eh he began i was afraid he would smart fellow that wheaton he didnt get away said mcnamara hes in town yet just let me land him in jail on some excuse ill hold him till snow flies struve sank into a chair and lit a cigarette with wavering hand thiss a hell of a game aint it mac dyou spose well win the man overhead pricked up his ears win arent we winning what do you call this i only hope we can lay hands on wheaton he knows things a little knowledge is a dangerous thing but more is worse lord if only i had a man for judge in place of stillman i dont know why i brought him thats right too weak he hasnt got the backbone of an angleworm he aint half the man that his niece is theres a girl for you say whatd we do without her eh shes a pippin glenister felt a sudden tightening of every muscle what right had that mans liquorsodden lips to speak so of her shes a brave little woman all right just look how she worked glenister and his fool partner it took nerve to bring in those instructions of yours alone and if it hadnt been for her wed never have won like this it makes me laugh to think of those two men stowing her away in their stateroom while they slept between decks with the sheep and her with the papers in her bosom all the time then when we got ready to do business why she up and talks them into giving us possession of their mine without a fight thats what i call reciprocating a mans affection glenisters nails cut into his flesh while his face went livid at the words he could not grasp it at once it made him sick physically sick and for many moments he strove blindly to beat back the hideous suspicion the horror that the lawyer had aroused his was not a doubting disposition and to him the girl had seemed as one pure mysterious apart angelically incapable of deceit he had loved her feeling that some day she would return his affection without fail in her great unclouded eyes he had found no lurkingplace for doubledealing now god it couldnt be that all the time she had known he had lost a part of the lawyers speech but peered through his observationhole again mcnamara was at the window gazing out into the dark street his back towards the lawyer who lolled in the chair babbling garrulously of the girl glenister ground his teeth a frenzy possessed him to loose his anger to rip through the frail ceiling with naked hands and fall vindictively upon the two men she looked good to me the first time i saw her continued struve he paused and when he spoke again a change had coarsened his features say im crazy about her mac i tell you im crazy and she likes me i know she does or anyway she would do you mean that youre in love with her asked the man at the window without shifting his position it seemed that utter indifference was in his question although where the light shone on his hands tightclinched behind his back they were bloodless love her well that depends ha you know how it is he chuckled coarsely his face was gross and bestial ive got the judge where i want him and ill have her his miserable words died with a gurgle for mcnamara had silently leaped and throttled him where he sat pinning him to the wall glenister saw the big politician shift his fingers slightly on struves throat and then drop his left hand to his side holding his victim writhing and helpless with his right despite the mans frantic struggles mcnamaras head was thrust forward from his shoulders peering into the lawyers face strove tore ineffectually at the iron arm which was squeezing his life out while for endless minutes the other leaned his weight against him his idle hand behind his back his legs braced like stone columns as he watched his victims struggles abate struve fought and wrenched while his breath caught in his throat with horrid sickening sounds but gradually his eyes rolled farther and farther back till they stared out of his blackened visage straight up towards the ceiling towards the hole through which glenister peered his struggles lessened his chin sagged and his tongue protruded then he sat loose and still the politician flung him out into the room so that he fell limply upon his face then stood watching him finally mcnamara passed out of the watchers vision returning with a waterbucket with his foot he rolled the unconscious wretch upon his back then drenched him replacing the pail he seated himself lit a cigar and watched the return of life into his victim he made no move even to drag him from the pool in which he lay struve groaned and shuddered twisted to his side and at last sat up weakly in his eyes there was now a great terror while in place of his drunkenness was only fear and faintness abject fear of the great bulk that sat and smoked and stared at him so fishily he felt uncertainly of his throat and groaned again why did you do that he whispered but the other made no sign he tried to rise but his knees relaxed he staggered and fell at last he gained his feet and made for the door then when his hand was on the knob mcnamara spoke through his teeth without removing his cigar dont ever talk about her again she is going to marry me when he was alone he looked curiously up at the ceiling over his head the rats are thick in this shack he mused seems to me i heard a whole swarm of them a few moments later a figure crept through the hole in the roof of the house next door and thence down into the street a block ahead was the slowmoving form of attorney struve had a stranger met them both he would not have known which of the two had felt at his throat the clutch of a strangler for each was drawn and haggard and swayed as he went glenister unconsciously turned towards his cabin but at leaving the lighted streets the thought of its darkness and silence made him shudder not now he could not bear that stillness and the company of his thoughts he dared not be alone dextry would be downtown undoubtedly and he too must get into the light and turmoil he licked his lips and found that they were cracked and dry at rare intervals during the past years he had staggered in from a long march where for hours he had waged a bitter war with cold and hunger his limbs clumsy with fatigue his garments wet and stiff his mind slack and sullen at such extreme seasons he had felt a consuming thirst a thirst which burned and scorched until his very bones cried out feverishly not a thirst for water nor a thirst which eaten snow could quench but a savage yearning of his whole exhausted system for some stimulant for some coursing fiery fluid that would burn and strangle a thirst for whiskey for brandy remembering these occasional ferocious desires he had become charitable to such unfortunates as were too weak to withstand similar temptations now with a shock he caught himself in the grip of a thirst as insistent as though the cold bore down and the weariness of endless heavy miles wrapped him about it was no foolish wish to drown his thoughts nor to banish the grief that preyed upon him but only thirst thirst a crying trembling physical lust to quench the fires that burned inside he remembered that it had been more than a year since he had tasted whiskey now the fever of the past few hours had parched his every tissue as he elbowed in through the crowd at the northern those next him made room at the bar for they recognized the hunger that peers thus from mens faces their manner recalled glenister to his senses and he wrenched himself away this was not some solitary snowbanked roadhouse he would not stand and soak himself shoulder to shoulder with stevedores and longshoremen this was something to be done in secret he had no pride in it the man on his right raised a glass and the young man strangled a madness to tear it from his hands instead he hurried back to the theatre and up to a box where he drew the curtains whiskey he said thickly to the waiter bring it to me fast dont you hear whiskey across the theatre cherry malotte had seen him enter and jerk the curtains together she arose and went to him entering without ceremony whats the matter boy she questioned ah i am glad you came talk to me thank you for your few wellchosen remarks she laughed why dont you ask me to spring some good original jokes you look like the finish to a sixday goasyou please whats up she talked to him for a moment until the waiter entered then when she saw what he bore she snatched the glass from the tray and poured the whiskey on the floor glenister was on his feet and had her by the wrist what do you mean he said roughly its whiskey boy she cried and you dont drink of course its whiskey bring me another he shouted at the attendant whats the matter cherry insisted i never saw you act so you know you dont drink i wont let you its booze booze i tell you fit for fools and brawlers dont drink it roy are you in trouble i say im thirsty and i will have it how do you know what it is to smoulder inside and feel your veins burn dry its something about that girl the woman said with quiet conviction shes doublecrossed you well so she has but what of it im thirsty shes going to marry mcnamara ive been a fool he ground his teeth and reached for the drink with which the boy had returned mcnamara is a crook but hes a man and he never drank a drop in his life the girl said it casually evenly but the other stopped the glass halfway to his lips well what of it goon youre good at w c t u talk virtue becomes you she flushed but continued it simply occurred to me that if you arent strong enough to handle your own throat youre not strong enough to beat a man who has mastered his glenister looked at the whiskey a moment then set it back on the tray bring two lemonades he said and with a laugh which was half a sob cherry malotte leaned forward and kissed him youre too good a man to drink now tell me all about it oh its too long ive just learned that the girl is in hand and glove with the judge and mcnamara thats all shes an advance agent their lookout she brought in their instructions to struve and persuaded dex and me to let them jump our claim she got us to trust in the law and in her uncle yes she hypnotized my property out of me and gave it to her lover this ward politician oh shes smooth with all her innocence why when she smiles she makes you glad and good and warm and her eyes are as honest and clear as a mountain pool but shes wrong shes wrong and great god how i love her he dropped his face into his hands when she had pled with him for himself a moment before cherry malotte was genuine and girlish but now as he spoke thus of the other woman a change came over her which he was too disturbed to note she took on the subtleness that masked her as a rule and her eyes were not pleasant i could have told you all that and more more what more he questioned do you remember when i warned you and dextry that they were coming to search your cabin for the gold well that girl put them on to you i found it out afterwards she keeps the keys to mcnamaras safety vault where your dust lies and shes the one who handles the judge it isnt mcnamara at all the woman lied easily fluently and the man believed her do you remember when they broke into your safe and took that money yes well what made them think you had ten thousand in there i dont know i do dextry told her glenister arose thats all i want to hear now im going crazy my mind aches for ive never had a fight like this before and it hurts you see ive been an animal all these years when i wanted to drink i drank and what i wanted i got because ive been strong enough to take it this is new to me im going downstairs now and try to think of something else then im going home when he had gone she pulled back the curtains and leaning her chin in her hands with elbows on the ledge gazed down upon the crowd the show was over and the dance had begun but she did not see it for she was thinking rapidly with the eagerness of one who sees the end of a long and weary search she did not notice the bronco kid beckoning to her nor the man with him so the gambler brought his friend along and invaded her box he introduced the man as mr champian do you feel like dancing the newcomer inquired no id rather look on i feel sociable youre a society man mr champian dont you know anything of interest scandal or the like cant say that i do my wife attends to all that for the family but i know theres lots of it its funny to me the airs some of these people assume up here just as though we werent all equal north of fiftythree i never heard the like anything new and exciting inquired bronco mildly interested the last i heard was about the judges niece miss chester cherry malotte turned abruptly while the kid slowly lowered the front legs of his chair to the floor what was it she inquired why it seems she compromised herself pretty badly with this fellow glenister coming up on the steamer last spring mighty brazen according to my wife mrs champian was on the same ship and says she was horribly shocked ah glenister had told her only half the tale thought the girl the truth was baring itself at that moment champian thought she looked the typical creature of the dancehalls the crafty jealous malevolent adventuress and the hussy masquerades as a lady she sneered she is a lady said the kid he sat bolt upright and rigid and the knuckles of his clinched hands were very white in the shadow they did not note that his dark face was ghastly nor did he say more except to bid champian goodbye when he left later on after the door had closed however the kid arose and stretched his muscles not languidly but as though to take out the cramp of long tension he wet his lips and his mouth was so dry that the sound caused the girl to look up what are you grinning at then as the light struck his face she started my how you look what ails you are you sick no one from dawson down had seen the bronco kid as he looked tonight no im not sick he answered in a cracked voice then the girl laughed harshly do you love that girl too why shes got every man in town crazy she wrung her hands which is a bad sign in a capable person and as glenister crossed the floor below in her sight she said ahhi could kill him for that so could i said the kid and left her without adieu chapter xiii in which a man is possessed of a devil for a long time cherry malotte sat quietly thinking removed by her mental stress to such an infinite distance from the music and turmoil beneath that she was conscious of it only as a formless clamor she had tipped a chair back against the door wedging it beneath the knob so that she might be saved from interruption then flung herself into another seat and stared unseeingly as she sat thus and thought and schemed harsh and hateful lines seemed to eat into her face now and then she moaned impatiently as though fearing lest the strategy she was plotting might prove futile then she would rise and pace her narrow quarters she was unconscious of time and had spent perhaps two hours thus when amid the buzz of talk in the next compartment she heard a name which caused her to start listen then drop her preoccupation like a mantle a man was speaking of glenister excitement thrilled his voice i never saw anything like it since mcmasters night in virginia city thirteen years ago hes right well perhaps so the other replied doubtfully but i dont care to back you i never staked a man in my life then lend me the money ill pay it back in an hour but for heavens sake be quick i tell you hes as right as a golden guinea its the lucky night of his life why he turned over the black jack game in four bets in fifteen minutes more we cant get close enough to a table to send in our money with a messengerboyevery sport in camp will be here ill stake you to fifty the second man replied in a tone that showed a trace of his companions excitement so glenister was gambling the girl learned and with such luck as to break the black jack game and excite the greed of every gambler in camp news of his winnings had gone out into the street and the sporting men were coming to share his fortune to fatten like vultures on the adversity of their fellows those who had no money to stake were borrowing like the man next door she left her retreat and descending the stairs was greeted by a strange sight the dancehall was empty of all but the musicians who blew and fiddled lustily in vain endeavor to draw from the rapidly swelling crowd that thronged the gamblingroom and stretched to the door the press was thickest about a table midway down the hall cherry could see nothing of what went on there for men and women stood ten deep about it and others perched on chairs and tables along the walls a roar arose suddenly followed by utter silence then came the clink and rattle of silver a moment and the crowd resumed its laughter and talk all down boys sounded the level voice of the dealer the field or the favorite hes made eighteen straight passes get your money on the line there ensued another breathless instant wherein she heard the thud of dice then followed the shout of triumph that told what the spots revealed the dealer payed off glenister reared himself head and shoulders above the others and pushed out through the ring to the roulettewheel the rest followed behind the circular table they had quitted the dealer was putting away his dice and there was not a coin in his rack mexico mullins approached cherry and she questioned him he just broke the crap game mullins told her nineteen passes without losing the bones how much did he win oh he didnt win much himself but its the people betting with him that does the damage theyre gamblers most of them and they play the limit he took out the black jack bankroll first then cleaned the tub by that time the tin horns began to come in its the greatest run i ever see did you get in now dont you know that i never play anything but bank if he lasts long enough to reach the faro layout ill get mine the excitement of the crowd began to infect the girl even though she looked on from the outside the exultant voices the sudden hush the tensity of nerve it all betokened set her athrill a stranger left the throng and rushed to the spot where cherry and mexico stood talking he was small and sandy with shifting glance and chinless jaw his eyes glittered his teeth shone ratlike through his dry lips and his voice was shrill he darted towards them like some furtive frightened little animal unnaturally excited i guess that isnt so bad for three bets he shook a sheaf of banknotes at them why dont you stick inquired mullins i am too wise ha i know when to quit he cant win steady he dont play any system then he has a good chance said the girl there he goes now the little man cried as the uproar arose i told you hed lose at the voice of the multitude he wavered as though affected by some powerful magnet but he won again said mexico no did he lord i quit too soon he scampered back into the other room only to return hesitating his money tightly clutched do you spose its safe i never saw a man bet so reckless i guess id better quit eh he noted the sneer on the womans face and without waiting a reply dashed off again they saw him clamorously fight his way in towards a post at the roulettetable let me through ive got money and i want to play it pah said mullins disgustedly hes one of them vermont desperadoes that never laid a bet till he was thirty if glenister loses hell hate him for life there are plenty of his sort here the girl remarked his soul would fit in a fleatrack she spied the bronco kid sauntering back towards her and joined him he leaned against the wall watching the gossamer thread of smoke twist upward from his cigarette seemingly oblivious to the surroundings and showing no hint of the emotion he had displayed two hours before this is a big killing isnt it said the girl the gambler nodded murmuring indifferently why arent you dealing bank isnt this your shift i quit last night just in time to miss this affair lucky for you yes i own the place now bought it yesterday good heavens then its your money hes winning sure at the rate of a thousand a minute she glanced at the long trail of devastated tables behind glenister and his followers at that instant the sound told that the miner had won again and it dawned upon cherry that the gambler beside her stood too quietly that his hand and voice were too steady his glance too cold to be natural the next moment approved her instinct the musicians grown tired of their endeavors to lure back the dancers determined to join the excitement and ceased playing the leader laid down his violin the pianist trailed up the keyboard with a departing twitter and quit his stool they all crossed the hall headed for the crowd some of them making ready to bet as they approached the bronco kid his lips thinned and slid apart slightly while out of his heavylidded eyes there flared unreasoning rage stepping forward he seized the foremost man and spun him about violently where are you going why nobody wants to dance so we thought wed go out front for a bit get back damn you it was his first chance to vent the passion within him a glance at his maddened features was sufficient for the musicians and they did not delay by the time they had resumed their duties however the curtains of composure had closed upon the kid masking his emotion again but from her brief glimpse cherry malotte knew that this man was not of ice as some supposed he turned to her and said do you mean what you said upstairs i dont understand you said you could kill glenister i could dont you love i hate him she interrupted hoarsely he gave her a mirthless smile and spying the crapdealer leaving his bankrupt table called him over and said toby i want you to drive the hearse when glenister begins to play faro ill deal understand sure going to give him a little work eh i never dealt a crooked card in this camp exclaimed the kid but ill lay that man tonight or ill kill him ill use a sandtell see and i want to explain my signals to you if you miss the signs youll queer us both and put the house on the blink he rapidly rehearsed his signals in a jargon which to a layman would have been unintelligible illustrating them by certain almost imperceptible shiftings of the fingers or changes in the position of his hand so slight as to thwart discovery through it all the girl stood by and followed his every word and motion with eager attention she needed no explanation of the terms they used she knew them all knew that the hearsedriver was the man who kept the cases knew all the code of the inside life to her it was all as an open page and she memorized more quickly than did toby the signs by which the bronco kid proposed to signal what card he had smuggled from the box or held back in faro it is customary for the casekeeper to sit on the opposite side of the table from the dealer with a device before him resembling an abacus or chinese addingmachine when a card is removed from the farobox by the dealer the hearsedriver moves a button opposite a corresponding card on his little machine in order that the players at a glance may tell what spots have been played or are still in the box his duties though simple are important for should he make an error and should the position of his counters not tally with the cards in the box on the last turn all bets on the table are declared void when honestly dealt faro is the fairest of all gambling games but it is intricate and may hide much knavery when the game is crooked it is fatal for out of the ingenuity of generations of card sharks there have been evolved a multitude of devices with which to fleece the unsuspecting these are so carefully masked that none but the initiated may know them while the freemasonry of the craft is strong and discovery unusual instead of using a familiar arrangement like the needletell wherein an invisible needle pricks the dealers thumb thus signalling the presence of certain cards the bronco kid had determined to use the sandtell in other words he would employ a straight box but a deck of cards certain ones of which had been roughened or sandpapered slightly so that by pressing more heavily on the top or exposed card the one beneath would stick to its neighbor above and thus enable him to deal two with one motion if the occasion demanded this roughness would likewise enable him to detect the hidden presence of a marked card by the faintest scratching sound when he dealt in this manipulation it would be necessary also to shave the edges of some of the pasteboards a trifle so that when the deck was forced firmly against one side of the box there would be exposed a fraction of the small figure in the lefthand corner of the concealed cards long practice in the art of jugglery lends such proficiency as to baffle discovery and rob the game of its uncertainty as surely as the player is robbed of his money it is of course vital that the confederate casekeeper be able to interpret the dealers signs perfectly in order to move the sliding ebony disks to correspond else trouble will accrue at the completion of the hand when the cases come out wrong having completed his instructions the proprietor went forward and cherry wormed her way towards the roulettewheel she wished to watch glenister but could not get near him because of the crowd the men would not make room for her every eye was glued upon the table as though salvation lurked in its rows of red and black they were packed behind it until the croupier had barely room to spin the ball and although he forced them back they pressed forward again inch by inch drawn by the song of the ivory drunk with its worship maddened by the breath of chance cherry gathered that glenister was still winning for a glimpse of the wheelrack between the shoulders of those ahead showed that the checks were nearly out of it plainly it was but a question of minutes so she backed out and took her station beside the farotable where the bronco kid was dealing his face wore its colorless mask of indifference his long white hands moved slowly with the certainty that betokened absolute mastery of his art he was waiting the excrap dealer was keeping cases the group left the roulettetable in a few moments and surrounded her glenister among the others he was not the man she knew in place of the dreary hopelessness with which he had left her his face was flushed and reckless his collar was open showing the base of his great corded neck while the lust of the game had coarsened him till he was again the violent untamed primitive man of the frontier his selfrestraint and dignity were gone he had tried the new ways and they were not for him he slipped back and the past swallowed him after leaving cherry he had sought some mental relief by idly risking the silver in his pocket he had let the coins lie and double then double again and again he had been indifferent whether he won or lost so assumed a reckless disregard for the laws of probability thinking that he would shortly lose the money he had won and then go home he did not want it when his luck remained the same he raised the stakes but it did not change he could not lose before he realized it other men were betting with him animated purely by greed and craze of the sport first one then another joined till game after game was closed and each moment the crowd had grown in size and enthusiasm so that its fever crept into him imperceptibly at first but ever increasing till the mania mastered him he paid no attention to cherry as he took his seat he had eyes for nothing but the layout she clenched her hands and prayed for his ruin whats your limit kid he inquired one hundred and two the kid answered which in the vernacular means that any sum up to be laid on one card save only on the last turn when the amount is lessened by half without more ado they commenced the kid handled his cards smoothly surely paying and taking bets with machinelike calm the onlookers ceased talking and prepared to watch for now came the crucial test of the evening faro is to other games as war is to jackstraws for a time glenister won steadily till there came a moment when many stacks of chips lay on the deuce cherry saw the kid flash to the casekeeper and the next moment he had pulled two the deuce lost it was his first substantial gain and the players paid no attention at the end of half an hour the winnings were slightly in favor of the house then glenister said this is too slow i want action all right smiled the proprietor well double the limit thus it became possible to wager on a card and the kid began really to play glenister now lost steadily not in large amounts but with tantalizing regularity cherry had never seen cards played like this the gambler was a revelation to her his work was wonderful ill luck seemed to fan the crowds eagerness while to add to its impatience the cases came wrong twice in succession so that those who would have bet heavily upon the last turn had their money given back cherry saw the confusion of the hearsedriver even quicker than did bronco toby was growing rattled the dealers work was too fast for him and yet he could offer no signal of distress for fear of annihilation at the hands of those crowded close to his shoulder in the same way the owner of the game could make no objection to his helpers incompetence for fear that some bystander would volunteer to fill the mans part there were many present capable of the trick he could only glare balefully across the table at his unfortunate confederate they had not gone far on the next game before cherrys quick eye detected a sign which the man misinterpreted she addressed him quietly youd better brush up your plumes in spite of his anger the bronco kid smiled humor in him was strangely withered and distorted yet here was a thrust he would always remember and recount with glee in years to come he feared there were other farodealers present who might understand the hint but there was none save mexico mullins whose face was a study mirth seemed to be strangling him a moment later the girl spoke to the casekeeper again let me take your place your reins are unbuckled toby glanced inquiringly at the kid who caught cherrys reassuring look and nodded so he arose and the girl slid into the vacant chair this woman would make no errors the dealer knew that her keen wits were sharpened by hate it showed in her face if glenister escaped destruction tonight it would be because human means could not accomplish his downfall in the mind of the new casekeeper there was but one thought roy must be broken humiliation disgrace ruin ridicule were to be his if he should be downed discredited and discouraged then perhaps he would turn to her as he had in the bygone days he was slipping away from her this was her last chance she began her duties easily and her alertness stimulated bronco till his senses too grew sharper his observation more acute and lightninglike glenister swore beneath his breath that the cards were bewitched he was like a drunken man now as truly intoxicated as though the fumes of wine had befogged his brain he swayed in his seat the veins of his neck thickened and throbbed his features were congested after a while he spoke i want a bigger limit is this some boys game throw her open the gambler shot a triumphant glance at the girl and acquiesced all right the limit is the blue sky pile your checks to the roofpole he began to shuffle within the crowded circle the air was hot and fetid with the breath of men the sweat trickled down glenisters brown skin dripping from his jaw unnoticed he arose and ripped off his coat while those standing behind shifted and scuffed their feet impatiently besides roy there were but three men playing they were the ones who had won heaviest at first now that luck was against them they were loath to quit cherry was annoyed by stertorous breathing at her shoulder and glanced back to find the little man who had been so excited earlier in the evening his mouth was agape his eyes wide the muscles about his lips twitching he had lost back long since the hundreds he had won and more besides she searched the figures walling her about and saw no women they had been crowded out long since it seemed as though the table formed the bottom of a sloping pit of human faces eager tense staring it was well she was here she thought else this task might fail she would help to blast glenister desolate him humiliate him ah but wouldnt she roy bet on the popular card on the third turn he lost he bet next and lost he set out a stack of and lost for the third time fortune had turned her face he ground his teeth and doubled until the stakes grew enormous while the dealer dealt monotonously the spots flashed and disappeared taking with them wager after wager glenister became conscious of a raging red fury which he had hard shift to master it was not his money what if he did lose he would stay until he won he would win this luck would not could not last and yet with diabolic persistence he continued to choose the losing cards the other men fared better till be yielded to their judgment when the dealer took their money also strange to say the fickle goddess had really shifted her banner at last and the bronco kid was dealing straight faro now he was too good a player to force a winning hand and glenisters illfortune became as phenomenal as his winning had been the girl who figured in this drama was keyed to the highest tension her eyes now on her counters now searching the profile of her victim glenister continued to lose and lose and lose while the girl gloated over his swiftcoming ruin when at long intervals he won a bet she shrank and shivered for fear he might escape if only he would risk it all everything he had he would have to come to her then the end was closer than she realized the throng hung breathless upon each move of the players while there was no sound but the noise of shifting chips and the distant jangle of the orchestra the lookout sat far forward upon his perch his hands upon his knees his eyes frozen to the board a dead cigar clenched between his teeth crowded upon his platform were miners tense and motionless as statues when a man spoke or coughed a score of eyes stared at him accusingly then dropped to the table again glenister took from his clothes a bundle of banknotes so thick that it required his two hands to compass it onlookers saw that the bills were mainly yellow no one spoke while he counted them rapidly glanced at the dealer who nodded then slid them forward till they rested on the king he placed a copper on the pile a great sigh of indrawn breaths swept through the crowd the north had never known a bet like this it meant a fortune here was a tale for ones grandchildren that a man should win opulence in an evening then lose it in one deal this final bet represented more than many of them had ever seen a one time before its fate lay on a single card cherry malottes fingers were like ice and shook till the buttons of her casekeeper rattled her heart raced till she could not breathe while something rose up and choked her if glenister won this bet he would quit she felt it if he lost ah what could the kid there feel the man who was playing for a paltry vengeance compared to her whose hope of happiness of love of life hinged on this wager evidently the bronco kid knew what card lay next below for he offered her no sign and as glenister leaned back he slowly and firmly pushed the top card out of the box although this was the biggest turn of his life he betrayed no tremor his gesture displayed the nine of diamonds and the crowd breathed heavily the king had not won would it lose every gaze was welded to the tiny nickelled box if the facecard lay next beneath the ninespot the heaviest wager in alaska would have been lost if it still remained hidden on the next turn the money would be safe for a moment slowly the white hand of the dealer moved back his middle finger touched the nine of diamonds it slid smoothly out of the box and there in its place frowned the king of clubs at last the silence was broken men spoke some laughed but in their laughter was no mirth it was more like the sound of choking they stamped their feet to relieve the grip of strained muscles the dealer reached forth and slid the stack of bills into the drawer at his waist without counting the casekeeper passed a shaking hand over her face and when it came away she saw blood on her fingers where she had sunk her teeth into her lower lip glenister did not rise he sat heavybrowed and sullen his jaw thrust forward his hair low upon his forehead his eyes bloodshot and dead ill sit the hand out if youll let me bet the finger said he certainly replied the dealer when a man requests this privilege it means that he will call the amount of his wager without producing the visible stakes and the dealer may accept or refuse according to his judgment of the bettors responsibility it is safe for no man shirks a gambling debt in the north and thousands may go with a nod of the head though never a cent be on the board there were still a few cards in the box and the dealer turned them paying the three men who played glenister took no part but sat bulked over his end of the table glowering from beneath his shock of hair cherry was deathly tired the strain of the last hour had been so intense that she could barely sit in her seat yet she was determined to finish the hand as bronco paused before the last turn many of the bystanders made bets they were the caseplayers who risked money only on the final pair thus avoiding the chance of two cards of like denomination coming together in which event splits it is called the dealer takes half the money the stakes were laid at last and the deal about to start when glenister spoke wait whats this place worth bronco what do you mean you own this outfit he waved his hand about the room well what does it stand you the gambler hesitated an instant while the crowd pricked up its ears and the girl turned wondering troubled eyes upon the miner what would he do now counting bank rolls fixtures and all about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars why ill pick the ace to lose my onehalf interest in the midas against your whole damned layout there was an absolute hush while the realization of this offer smote the onlookers it took time to realize it this man was insane there were three cards to choose from one would win one would lose and one would have no action of all those present only cherry malotte divined even vaguely the real reason which prompted the man to do this it was not gameness nor altogether a brutish stubbornness which would not let him quit it was something deeper he was desolate and his heart was gone helen was lost to him worse yet was unworthy and she was all he cared for what did he want of the midas with its lawsuits its intrigues and its trickery he was sick of it all of the whole game and wanted to get away if he won very well if he lost the land of the aurora would know him no more when he put his proposition the bronco kid dropped his eyes as though debating the girl saw that he studied the cards in his box intently and that his fingers caressed the top one ever so softly during the instant the eyes of the rest were on glenister the dealer looked up at last and cherry saw the gleam of triumph in his eye he could not mask it from her though his answering words were hesitating she knew by the look that glenister was a pauper come on insisted roy hoarsely turn the cards youre on the girl felt that she was fainting she wanted to scream the triumph of this moment stifled her or was it triumph after all she heard the breath of the little man behind her rattle as though he were being throttled and saw the lookout pass a shaking hand to his chin then wet his parched lips she saw the man she had helped to ruin bend forward his lean face strained and hard an odd look of pain and weariness in his eyes she never forgot that look the crowd was frozen in various attitudes of eagerness although it had not yet recovered from the suspense of the last great wager it knew the midas and what it meant here lay half of it hidden beneath a tawdry square of pasteboard with maddening deliberation the kid dealt the top card beneath it was the trey of spades glenister said no word nor made a move some one coughed and it sounded like a gunshot slowly the dealers fingers retraced their way he hesitated purposely and leered at the girl then the threespot disappeared and beneath it lay the ace as the king had lain on that other wager it spelled utter ruin to glenister he raised his eyes blindly and then the deathlike silence of the room was shattered by a sudden crash cherry malotte had closed her checkrack violently at the same instant crying shrill and clear that bet is off the cases are wrong glenister half rose overturning his chair the kid lunged forward across the table and his wonderful hands tense and talonlike thrust themselves forward as though reaching for the riches she had snatched away they worked and writhed and trembled as though in dumb fury the nails sinking into the oilcloth tablecover his face grew livid and cruel while his eyes blazed at her till she shrank from him affrightedly bracing herself away from the table with rigid arms reason came slowly back to glenister and understanding with it he seemed to awake from a nightmare he could read all too plainly the gamblers look of baffled hate as the man sprawled on the table his arms spread wide his eyes glaring at the cowering woman who shrank before him like a rabbit before a snake she tried to speak but choked then the dealer came to himself and cried harshly through his teeth one word christ he raised his fist and struck the table so violently that chips and coppers leaped and rolled and cherry closed her eyes to lose sight of his awful grimace glenister looked down on him and said i think i understand but the money was yours anyhow so i dont mind his meaning was plain the kid suddenly jerked open the drawer before him but glenister clenched his right hand and leaned forward the miner could have killed him with a blow for the gambler was seated and at his mercy the kid checked himself while his face began to twitch as though the nerves underlying it had broken bondage and were dancing in a wild ungovernable orgy you have taught me a lesson was all that glenister said and with that he pushed through the crowd and out into the cool night air overhead the arctic stars winked at him and the sea smells struck him clean and fresh as he went homeward he heard the distant fullthroated plaint of a wolfdog it held the mystery and sadness of the north he paused arid baring his thick matted head stood for a long time gathering himself together standing so he made certain covenants with himself and vowed solemnly never to touch another card at the same moment cherry malotte came hurrying to her cottage door fleeing as though from pursuit or from some hateful haunted spot she paused before entering and flung her arms outward into the dark in a wide gesture of despair why did i do it oh why did i do it i cant understand myself chapter xiv a midnight messenger my dear helen dont you realize that my official position carries with it a certain social obligation which it is our duty to discharge i suppose so uncle arthur but i would much rather stay at home tut tut go and have a good time dancing doesnt appeal to me any more i left that sort of thing back home now if you would only come along no im too busy i must work tonight and im not in a mood for such things anyhow youre not well his niece said i have noticed it for weeks is it hard work or are you truly ill youre nervous you dont eat youre growing positively gaunt why youre getting wrinkles like an old man she rose from her seat at the breakfasttable and went to him smoothing his silvered head with affection he took her cool hand and pressed it to his cheek while the worry that haunted him habitually of late gave way to a smile its work little girl hard and thankless work thats all this country is intended for young men and im too far along his eyes grew grave again and he squeezed her fingers nervously as though at the thought its a terrible country this i i wish we had never seen it dont say that helen cried spiritedly why its glorious think of the honor youre a united states judge and the first one to come here youre making history youre building a state people will read about you she stooped and kissed him but he seemed to flinch beneath her caress of course ill go if you think id better she said though im not fond of alaskan society some of the women are nice but the others she shrugged her dainty shoulders they talk scandal all the time one would think that a great clean fresh vigorous country like this would broaden the women as it broadens the men but it doesnt ill tell mcnamara to call for you at nine oclock said the judge as he arose so later in the day she prepared her long unused finery to such good purpose that when her escort called for her that evening he believed her the loveliest of women upon their arrival at the hotel he regarded her with a fresh access of pride for the function proved to bear little resemblance to a miningcamp party the women wore handsome gowns and every man was in evening dress the wide hall ran the length of the hotel and was flanked with boxes while its floor was like polished glass and its walls effectively decorated oh how lovely exclaimed helen as she first caught sight of it its just like home ive seen quickrising cities before he said but nothing like this still if these northerners can build a railroad in a month and a city in a summer why shouldnt they have symphony orchestras and louis quinze ballrooms i know youre a splendid dancer she said you shall be my judge and jury ill sign this card as often as i dare without the certainty of violence at the hands of these young men and the rest of the time ill smoke in the lobby i dont care to dance with any one but you after the first waltz he left her surrounded by partners and made his way out of the ballroom this was his first relaxation since landing in the north it was well not to become a dull boy he mused and as he chewed his cigar he pictured with an odd thrill quite unusual with him that slender grayeyed girl with her coiled mass of hair her ivory shoulders and merry smile he saw her float past to the measure of a twostep and caught himself resenting the thought of another mans enjoyment of the girls charms even for an instant hold on alec he muttered youre too old a bird to lose your head however he was waiting for her before the time for their next dance she seemed to have lost a part of her gayety whats the matter arent you enjoying yourself oh yes she returned brightly im having a delightful time when he came for his third dance she was more distraite than ever as he led her to a seat they passed a group of women among whom were mrs champian and others whom he knew to be wives of men prominent in the town he had seen some of them at tea in judge stillmans house and therefore was astonished when they returned his greeting but ignored helen she shrank slightly and he realized that there was something wrong he could not guess what affairs of men he could cope with but the subtleties of women were out of his realm what ails those people have they offended you i dont know what it is i have spoken to them but they cut me cut you he exclaimed yes her voice trembled but she held her head high it seems as though all the women in nome were here and in league to ignore me it dazes me i do not understand has anybody said anything to you he inquired fiercely any man i mean no no the men are kind its the women come well go home indeed we will not she said proudly i shall stay and face it out i have done nothing to run away from and i intend to find out what is the matter when he had surrendered her at the beginning of the next dance mcnamara sought for some acquaintance whom he might question most of the men in nome either hated or feared him but he espied one that he thought suited his purpose and led him into a corner i want you to answer a question no beating about the bush understand im blunt and i want you to be all right your wife has been entertained at miss chesters house ive seen her there tonight she refuses to speak to the girl she cut her dead and i want to know what its about how should i know if you dont know ill ask you to find out the other shook his head amusedly at which mcnamara flared up i say you will and youll make your wife apologize before she leaves this hall too or youll answer to me man to man i wont stand to have a girl like miss chester colddecked by a bunch of miningcamp swells and that goes as it lies in his excitement mcnamara reverted to his western idiom the other did not reply at once for it is embarrassing to deal with a person who disregards the conventions utterly and at the same time has the inclination and force to compel obedience the bosss reputation had gone abroad well er i know about it in a general way but of course i dont go much on such things youd better let it drop go on there has been a lot of talk among the ladies about well er the fact is its that young glenister mrs champian had the next stateroom to them er him i should say on the way up from the states and she saw things now as far as im concerned a girl can do what she pleases but mrs champian has her own ideas of propriety from what my wife could learn theres some truth in the story too so you cant blame her with a word mcnamara could have explained the gossip and made this man put his wife right forcing through her an elucidation of the silly affair in such a way as to spare helens feelings and cover the busytongued magpies with confusion yet he hesitated it is a wise skipper who trims his sails to every breeze he thanked his informant and left him entering the lobby he saw the girl hurrying towards him take me away quick i want to go home youve changed your mind yes let us go she panted and when they were outside she walked so rapidly that he had difficulty in keeping pace with her she was silent and he knew better than to question but when they arrived at her house he entered took off his overcoat and turned up the light in the tiny parlor she flung her wraps over a chair storming back and forth like a little fury her eyes were starry with tears of anger her face was flushed her hands worked nervously he leaned against the mantel watching her through his cigar smoke you neednt tell me he said at length i know all about it i am glad you do i never could repeat what they said oh it was brutal her voice caught and she bit her lip what made me ask them why didnt i keep still after you left i went to those women and faced them oh but they were brutal yet why should i care she stamped her slippered foot i shall have to kill that man some day he said flecking his cigar ashes into the grate what man she stood still and looked at him glenister of course if i had thought the story would ever reach you id have shut him up long ago it didnt come from him she cried hot with indignation hes a gentleman its that cat mrs champian he shrugged his shoulders the slightest bit but it was eloquent and she noted it oh i dont mean that he did it intentionally hes too decent a chap for that but anybodys tongue will wag to a beautiful girl my lady malotte is a jealous trick malotte who is she helen questioned curiously he seemed surprised i thought every one knew who she is its just as well that you dont i am sure mr glenister would not talk of me there was a pause who is miss malotte he studied for a moment while she watched him what a splendid figure he made in his evening clothes the cosey room with its shaded lights enhanced his size and strength and rugged outlines in his eyes was that admiration which women live for he lifted his bold handsome face and met her gaze i had rather leave that for you to find out for im not much at scandal i have something more important to tell you its the most important thing i have ever said to you helen it was the first time he had used that name and she began to tremble while her eyes sought the door in a panic she had expected this moment and yet was not ready not tonight dont say it now she managed to articulate yes this is a good time if you cant answer ill come back tomorrow i want you to be my wife i want to give you everything the world offers and i want to make you happy girl therell be no gossip hereafter ill shield you from everything unpleasant and if there is anything you want in life ill lay it at your feet i can do it he lifted his massive arms and in the set of his strong square face was the promise that she should have whatever she craved if mortal man could give it to her love protection position adoration she stammered uncertainly till the humiliation and chagrin she had suffered this night swept over her again this town this crude halfborn miningcamp had turned against her misjudged her cruelly the women were envious clacking scandalmongers all of them who would ostracize her and make her life in the northland a misery make her an outcast with nothing to sustain her but her own solitary pride she could picture her future clearly pitilessly and see herself standing alone vilified harassed in a thousand cutting ways yet unable to run away or to explain she would have to stay and face it for her life was bound up here during the next few years or so or as long as her uncle remained a judge this man would free her he loved her he offered her everything he was bigger than all the rest combined they were his playthings and they knew it she was not sure that she loved him but his magnetism was overpowering and her admiration intense no other man she had ever known compared with him except glenister bah the beast he had insulted her at first he wronged her now will you be my wife helen the man repeated softly she dropped her head and he strode forward to take her in his arms then stopped listening some one ran up on the porch and hammered loudly at the door mcnamara scowled walked into the hall and flung the portal open disclosing struve hello mcnamara been looking all over for you theres the deuce to pay helen sighed with relief and gathered up her cloak while the hum of their voices reached her indistinctly she was given plenty of time to regain her composure before they appeared when they did the politician spoke sourly ive been called to the mines and i must go at once you bet it may be too late now the news came an hour ago but i couldnt find you said struve your horse is saddled at the office better not wait to change your clothes you say voorhees has gone with twenty deputies eh thats good you stay here and find out all you can i telephoned out to the creek for the boys to arm themselves and throw out pickets if you hurry you can get there in time its only midnight now what is the trouble miss chester inquired anxiously theres a plot on to attack the mines tonight answered the lawyer the other side are trying to seize them and theres apt to be a fight you mustnt go out there she cried aghast there will be bloodshed thats just why i must go said mcnamara ill come back in the morning though and id like to see you alone goodnight there was a strange new light in his eyes as he left her for one unversed in womans ways he played the game surprisingly well and as he hurried towards his office he smiled grimly into the darkness shell answer me tomorrow thank you mr glenister he said to himself helen questioned struve at length but gained nothing more than that secretservice men had been at work for weeks and had today unearthed the fact that vigilantes had been formed they had heard enough to make them think the mines would be jumped again tonight and so had given the alarm have you hired spies she asked incredulously sure we had to the other people shadowed us and its come to a point where its life or death to one side or the other i told mcnamara wed have bloodshed before we were through when he first outlined the scheme i mean when the trouble began she wrung her hands thats what uncle feared before we left seattle thats why i took the risks i did in bringing you those papers i thought you got them in time to avoid all this struve laughed a bit eying her curiously does uncle arthur know about this she continued no we dont let him know anything more than necessary hes not a strong man yes yes hes not well again the lawyer smiled who is behind this vigilante movement we think it is glenister and his new mexican bandit partner at least they got the crowd together she was silent for a time i suppose they really think they own those mines undoubtedly but they dont do they somehow this question had recurred to her insistently of late for things were constantly happening which showed there was more back of this great fierce struggle than she knew it was impossible that injustice had been done the mineowners and yet scattered talk reached her which was puzzling when she strove to follow it up her acquaintances adroitly changed the subject she was baffled on every side the three local newspapers upheld the court she read them carefully and was more at sea than ever there was a disturbing undercurrent of alarm and unrest that caused her to feel insecure as though standing on hollow ground yes this whole disturbance is caused by those two only for them wed be all right who is miss malotte he answered promptly the handsomest woman in the north and the most dangerous in what way who is she its hard to say who or what she is shes different from other women she came to dawson in the early days just came we didnt know how whence or why and we never found out we woke up one morning and there she was by night we were all jealous and in a week we were most of us drivelling idiots it might have been the mystery or perhaps the competition that was the day when a dancehall girl could make a homestake in a winter or marry a millionaire in a month but she never bothered she toiled not neither did she spin on the waxed floors yet solomon in all his glory would have looked like a tramp beside her you say she is dangerous well there was the young nobleman in the winter of dane i think fine family and all that big yellowhaired boy he wanted to marry her but a farodealer shot him then there was rock of the mounted police the finest officer in the service he was cashiered she knew he was going to pot for her but she didnt seem to care and there were others yet with it all she is the most generous person and the most tenderhearted why she has fed every stew bum on the yukon and there isnt a busted prospector in the country who wouldnt swear by her for she has grubstaked dozens of them i was horribly in love with her myself yes shes dangerous all right to everybody but glenister what do you mean she had been across the yukon to nurse a man with scurvy and coming back she was caught in the spring breakup i wasnt there but it seems this glenister got her ashore somehow when nobody else would tackle the job they were carried five miles downstream in the icepack before he succeeded what happened then she fell in love with him of course and he worshipped her as madly as all the rest of you i suppose she said scornfully thats the peculiar part she hypnotized him at first but he ran away and i didnt hear of him again till i came to nome she followed him finally and last week evened up her score she paid him back for saving her i havent heard about it he detailed the story of the gambling episode at the northern saloon and concluded id like to have seen that turn for they say the excitement was terrific she was keeping cases and at the finish slammed her casekeeper shut and declared the bet off because she had made a mistake of course they couldnt dispute her and she stuck to it one of the bystanders told me she lied though so in addition to his other vices mr glenister is a reckless gambler is he said helen with heat i am proud to be indebted to such a character truly this country breeds wonderful species theres where youre wrong struve chuckled hes never been known to bet before oh im tired of these contradictions she cried angrily saloons gamblinghalls scandals adventuresses ugh i hate it i hate it why did i ever come here those things are a part of every new country they were about all we had till this year but it is women like you that we fellows need miss helen you can help us a lot she did not like the way he was looking at her and remembered that her uncle was upstairs and asleep i must ask you to excuse me now for its late and i am very tired the clock showed halfpast twelve so after letting him out she extinguished the light and dragged herself wearily up to her room she removed her outer garments and threw over her bare shoulders a negligee of many flounces and bewildering clinging looseness as she took down her heavy braids the story of cherry malotte returned to her tormentingly so glenister had saved her life also at risk of his own what a very gallant cavalier he was to be sure he should bear a coat of arms a dragon an armed knight and a fainting maiden i succor ladies in distress handsome ones should be the motto on his shield the handsomest woman in the north struve had said she raised her eyes to the glass and made a mouth at the petulant tired reflection there she pictured glenister leaping from floe to floe with the hungry river surging and snapping at his feet while the cheers of the crowd on shore gave heart to the girl crouching out there she could see him snatch her up and fight his way back to safety over the plunging icecakes with death dragging at his heels what a strong embrace he had at this she blushed and realized with a shock that while she was mooning that very man might be fighting hand to hand in the darkness of a mountaingorge with the man she was going to marry a moment later some one mounted the front steps below and knocked sharply truly this was a night of alarms would people never cease coming she was worn out but at the thought of the tragedy abroad and the sick old man sleeping near by she lit a candle and slipped downstairs to avoid disturbing him doubtless it was some message from mcnamara she thought as she unchained the door as she opened it she fell back amazed while it swung wide and the candle flame flickered and sputtered in the night air roy glenister stood there grim and determined his soft white stetson pulled low his trousers tucked into tan halfboots in his hand a winchester rifle beneath his corduroy coat she saw a loose cartridgebelt yellow with shells and the nickelled flash of a revolver without invitation he strode across the threshold closing the door behind him miss chester you and the judge must dress quickly and come with me i dont understand the vigilantes are on their way here to hang him come with me to my house where i can protect you she laid a trembling hand on her bosom and the color died out of her face then at a slight noise above they both looked up to see judge stillman leaning far over the banister he had wrapped himself in a dressinggown and now gripped the rail convulsively while his features were blanched to the color of putty and his eyes were wide with terror though puffed and swollen from sleep his lips moved in a vain endeavor to speak chapter xv vigilantes on the morning after the episode in the northern glenister awoke under a weight of discouragement and desolation the past twentyfour hours with their manifold experiences seemed distant and unreal at breakfast he was ashamed to tell dextry of the gambling debauch for he had dealt treacherously with the old man in risking half of the mine even though they had agreed that either might do as he chose with his interest regardless of the other it all seemed like a nightmare those tense moments when he lay above the receivers office and felt his belief in the one woman slipping away the frenzied thirst which cherry malotte had checked the senseless unreasoning lust for play that possessed him later this lapse was the last stand of his old untamed instincts the embers of revolt in him were dead he felt that he would never again lose mastery of himself that his passions would never best him hereafter dextry spoke we had a meeting of the stranglers last night he always spoke of the vigilantes in that way because of his early western training what was done they decided to act quick and do any odd jobs of lynchin claimjumpin or such as needs doin theres a lot of law sharps and storekeepers in the bunch who figure mcnamaras gang will wipe them off the map next it was bound to come to this they talked of ejectin the receivers men and puttin all us fellers back on our mines good how many can we count on to help us about sixty weve kept the number down and only taken men with so much property that theyll have to keep their mouths shut i wish we might engineer some kind of an encounter with the court crowd and create such an uproar that it would reach washington everything else has failed and our last chance seems to be for the government to step in that is unless bill wheaton can do something with the california courts i dont count on him mcnamara dont care for california courts no more n he would for a boy with a peashooter hes got too much pull at headquarters if the stranglers dont do no good wed better go in an clean out the bunch like we was killin snakes if that fails im goin out to the states an be a doctor a doctor what for i read somewhere that in the united states every year there is forty million gallons of whiskey used for medical purposes glenister laughed speaking of whiskey dex i notice that youve been drinking pretty hard of late that is hard for you the old man shook his head youre mistaken it aint hard for me well hard or easy youd better cut it out it was some time later that one of the detectives employed by the swedes met glenister on front street and by an almost imperceptible sign signified his desire to speak with him when they were alone he said youre being shadowed ive known that for a long time the districtattorney has put on some new men ive fixed the woman who rooms next to him and through her ive got a line on some of them but i havent spotted them all theyre bad ones upriver men mostly remnants of soapy smiths skagway gang they wont stop at anything thank you ill keep my eyes open a few nights after glenister had reason to recall the words of the sleuth and to realize that the game was growing close and desperate to reach his cabin which sat on the outskirts of the town he ordinarily followed one of the plank walks which wound through the confusion of tents warehouses and cottages lying back of the two principal streets along the water front this part of the city was not laid out in rectangular blocks for in the early rush the firstcomers had seized whatever pieces of ground they found vacant and erected thereon some kind of buildings to make good their titles there resulted a formless jumble of huts cabins and sheds penetrated by no cross streets and quite unlighted at night one leaving the illuminated portion of the town found this darkness intensified glenister knew his course so well that he could have walked it blindfolded nearing a corner of the warehouse this evening he remembered that the planking at this point was torn up so to avoid the mud he leaped lightly across simultaneously with his jump he detected a movement in the shadows that banked the wall at his elbow and saw the flaming spurt of a revolvershot the man had crouched behind the building and was so close that it seemed impossible to miss glenister fell heavily upon his side and the thought flashed over him mcnamaras thugs have shot me his assailant leaped out from his hidingplace and ran down the walk the sound of his quick soft footfalls thudding faintly out into the silence the young man felt no pain however so scrambled to his feet felt himself over with care and then swore roundly he was untouched the other had missed him cleanly the report coming while he was in the act of leaping had startled him so that he had lost his balance slipped upon the wet boards and fallen his assailant was lost in the darkness before he could rise pursuit was out of the question so he continued homeward considerably shaken and related the incident to dextry you think it was some of mcnamaras work eh dextry inquired when he had finished of course didnt the detective warn me today dextry shook his head it dont seem like the game is that far along yet the time is coming when well go to the mat with them people but theyve got the aige on us now so what could they gain by putting you away i dont believe its them but whoever it is youd better be careful or youll be got suppose we come home together after this roy suggested and they arranged to do so realizing that danger lurked in the dark corners and that it was in some such lonely spot that the deed would be tried again they experienced no trouble for a time though on nearing their cabin one night the younger man fancied that he saw a shadow glide away from its vicinity and out into the blackness of the tundra as though some one had stood at his very door waiting for him then became frightened at the two figures approaching dextry had not observed it however and glenister was not positive himself but it served to give him the uncanny feeling that some determined unscrupulous force was bent on his destruction he determined to go nowhere unarmed a few evenings later he went home early and was busied in writing when dextry came in about ten oclock the old miner hung up his coat before speaking lit a cigarette inhaled deeply then amid mouthfuls of smoke began i had my own toes over the edge tonight i was mistook for you which compliment i dont aim to have repeated glenister questioned him eagerly were about the same height an these hats of ours are alike just as i come by that lumberpile down yonder a man hopped out an throwed a gat under my nose he was quicker than light and near blowed my skelp into the next block before he saw who i was then he dropped his weepon and said my mistake go on i accepted his apology could you see who he was sure guess i cant it was the bronco kid lord ejaculated glenister do you think hes after me he aint after nobody else an take my word for it its got nothin to do with mcnamara nor that gamblin row hes too game for that theres some other reason this was the first mention dextry had made of the night at the northern i dont know why he should have it in for me i never did him any favors glenister remarked cynically well you watch out anyhow id sooner face mcnamara an all the crooks he can hire than that gambler during the next few days roy undertook to meet the proprietor of the northern face to face but the kid had vanished completely from his haunts he was not in his gamblinghall at night nor on the street by day the young man was still looking for him on the evening of the dance at the hotel when he chanced to meet one of the vigilantes who inquired of him arent you late for the meeting what meeting after seeing that they were alone the other stated theres an assembly tonight at eleven oclock something important i think i supposed of course you knew about it its strange i wasnt notified said roy its probably an oversight ill go along with you together they crossed the river to the less frequented part of town and knocked at the door of a large unlighted warehouse flanked by a high board fence the building faced the street but was enclosed on the other three sides by this tenfoot wall inside of which were stored large quantities of coal and lumber after some delay they were admitted and passing down through the dimlit highbanked lanes of merchandise came to the rear room where they were admitted again this compartment had been fitted up for the warm storage of perishable goods during the cold weather and being without windows made an ideal place for clandestine gatherings glenister was astonished to find every man of the organization present including dextry whom he supposed to have gone home an hour since evidently a discussion had been in progress for a chairman was presiding and the boxes kegs and bales of goods had been shoved back against the walls for seats on these were ranged the threescore men of the stranglers their serious faces lighted imperfectly by scattered lanterns a certain constraint seized them upon glenisters entrance the chairman was embarrassed it was but momentary however glenister himself felt that tragedy was in the air for it showed in the mens attitudes and spoke eloquently from their strained faces he was about to question the man next to him when the presiding officer continued we will assemble here quietly with our arms at one oclock and let me caution you again not to talk or do anything to scare the birds away glenister arose i came late mr chairman so i missed hearing your plan i gather that youre out for business however and i want to be in it may i ask what is on foot certainly things have reached such a pass that moderate means are useless we have decided to act and act quickly we have exhausted every legal resource and now were going to stamp out this gang of robbers in our own way we will get together in an hour divide into three groups of twenty men each with a leader then go to the houses of mcnamara stillman and voorhees take them prisoners and he waved his hand in a large gesture glenister made no answer for a moment while the crowd watched him intently you have discussed this fully he asked we have it has been voted on and were unanimous my friends when i stepped into this room just now i felt that i wasnt wanted why i dont know because i have had more to do with organizing this movement than any of you and because i have suffered just as much as the rest i want to know if i was omitted from this meeting intentionally this is an embarrassing position to put me in said the chairman gravely but i shall answer as spokesman for these men if they wish yes go ahead said those around the room we dont question your loyalty mr glenister but we didnt ask you to this meeting because we know your attitude perhaps id better say sentiment regarding judge stillmans niece er family it has come to us from various sources that you have been affected to the prejudice of your own and your partners interest now there isnt going to be any sentiment in the affairs of the vigilantes we are going to do justice and we thought the simplest way was to ignore you in this matter and spare all discussion and hard feeling in every quarter its a lie shouted the young man hoarsely a damned lie you wouldnt let me in for fear id kick eh well you were right i will kick youve hinted about my feelings for miss chester let me tell you that she is engaged to marry mcnamara and that shes nothing to me now then let me tell you further that you wont break into her house and hang her uncle even if he is a reprobate no sir this isnt the time for violence of that sortwell win without it if we cant lets fight like men and not hunt in a pack like wolves if you want to do something put us back on our mines and help us hold them but for gods sake dont descend to assassination and the tactics of the mafia we knew you would make that kind of a talk said the speaker while the rest murmured grudgingly one of them spoke up weve talked this over in cold blood glenister and its a question of their lives or our liberty the law dont enter into it thats right echoed another at his elbow we cant seize the claims because mcnamaras got soldiers to back him up theyd shoot us down you ought to be the last one to object he saw that dispute was futile determination was stamped on their faces too plainly for mistake and his argument had no more effect on them than had the pale rays of the lantern beside him yet he continued i dont deny that mcnamara deserves lynching but stillman doesnt hes a weak old man some one laughed derisively and theres a woman in the house hes all she has in the world to depend upon and you would have to kill her to get at him if you must follow this course take the others but leave him alone they only shook their heads while several pushed by him even as he spoke were going to distribute our favors equal said a man as he left they were actuated by what they called justice and he could not sway them the life and welfare of the north were in their hands as they thought and there was not one to hesitate glenister implored the chairman but the man answered him its too late for further discussion and let me remind you of your promise youre bound by every obligation that exists for an honorable man oh dont think that ill give the snap away said the other but i warn you again not to enter stillmans house he followed out into the night to find that dextry had disappeared evidently wishing to avoid argument roy had seen signs of unrest beneath the prospectors restraint during the past few days and indications of a fierce hunger to vent his spleen on the men who had robbed him of his most sacred rights he was of an intolerant vindictive nature that would go to any length for vengeance retribution was part of his creed on his way home the young man looked at his watch to find that he had but an hour to determine his course instinct prompted him to join his friends and to even the score with the men who had injured him so bitterly for measured by standards of the frontier they were pirates with their lives forfeit yet he could not countenance this step if only the vigilantes would be content with making an example but he knew they would not the blood hunger of a mob is easy to whet and hard to hold mcnamara would resist as would voorhees and the districtattorney then there would be bloodshed riot chaos the soldiers would be called out and martial law declared the streets would become skirmishgrounds the vigilantes would rout them without question for every citizen of the north would rally to their aid and such men could not be stopped the judge would go down with the rest of the ring and what would happen to her he took down his winchester oiled and cleaned it then buckled on a belt of cartridges still he wrestled with himself he felt that he was being ground between his loyalty to the vigilantes and his own conscience the girl was one of the gang he reasoned she had schemed with them to betray him through his love and she was pledged to the one man in the world whom he hated with fanatical fury why should he think of her in this hour six months back he would have looked with jealous eyes upon the right to lead the vigilantes but this change that had mastered him what was it not cowardice nor caution no yet being intangible it was none the less marked as his friends had shown him an hour since he slipped out into the night the mob might do as it pleased elsewhere but no man should enter her house he found a light shining from her parlor window and noting the shade up a few inches stole close peering through he discovered struve and helen talking he slunk back into the shadows and remained hidden for a considerable time after the lawyer left for the dancers were returning from the hotel and passed close by when the last group had chattered away down the street he returned to the front of the house and mounting the steps knocked sharply as helen appeared at the door he stepped inside and closed it after him the girls hair lay upon her neck and shoulders in tumbled brown masses while her breast heaved tumultuously at the sudden grim sight of him she stepped back against the wall her wondrous deep gray eyes wide and troubled the blush of modesty struggling with the pallor of dismay the picture pained him like a knifethrust this girl was for his bitterest enemy no hope of her was for him he forgot for a moment that she was false and plotting then recalling it spoke as roughly as he might and stated his errand then the old man had appeared on the stairs above speechless with fright at what he overheard it was evident that his nerves so sorely strained by the events of the past week were now snapped utterly a human soul naked and panicstricken is no pleasant sight so glenister dropped his eyes and addressed the girl again dont take anything with you just dress and come with me the creature on the stairs above stammered and stuttered inquiringly what outrage is this mr glenister the people of nome are up in arms and ive come to save you dont stop to argue he spoke impatiently is this some rruse to get me into your power uncle arthur exclaimed the girl sharply her eyes met glenisters and begged him to take no offence i dont understand this atrocity they must be mad wailed the judge you run over to the jail mr glenister and tell voorhees to hurry guards here to protect me helen phone to the military post and give the alarm tell them the soldiers must come at once hold on said glenister theres no use of doing that the wires are cut and i wont notify voorhees he can take care of himself i came to help you and if you want to escape youll stop talking and hurry up i dont know what to do said stillman torn by terror and indecision you wouldnt hurt an old man would you wait ill be down in a minute he scrambled up the stairs tripping on his robe seemingly forgetting his niece till she called up to him sharply stop uncle arthur you mustnt run away she stood erect and determined you wouldnt do that would you this is our house you represent the law and the dignity of the government you mustnt fear a mob of ruffians we will stay here and meet them of course good lord said glenister thats madness these men arent ruffians they are the best citizens of nome you dont realize that this is alaska and that they have sworn to wipe out mcnamaras gang come along thank you for your good intentions she said but we have done nothing to run away from we will get ready to meet these cowards you had better go or they will find you here she moved up the stairs and taking the judge by the arm led him with her of a sudden she had assumed control of the situation unfalteringly and both men felt the impossibility of thwarting her pausing at the top she turned and looked down we are grateful for your efforts just the same goodnight oh im not going said the young man if you stick ill do the same he made the rounds of the firstfloor rooms locking doors and windows as a place of defence it was hopeless and he saw that he would have to make his stand upstairs when sufficient time had elapsed he called up to helen may i come yes she replied so he ascended to find stillman in the hall half clothed and cowering while by the light from the front chamber he saw her finishing her toilet wont you come with me its our last chance she only shook her head well then put out the light ill stand at that front window and when my eyes get used to the darkness ill be able to see them before they reach the gate she did as directed taking her place beside him at the opening while the judge crept in and sat upon the bed his heavy breathing the only sound in the room the two young people stood so close beside each other that the sweet scent of her person awoke in him an almost irresistible longing he forgot her treachery again forgot that she was anothers forgot all save that he loved her truly and purely with a love which was like an agony to him her shoulder brushed his arm he heard the soft rustling of her garment at her breast as she breathed some one passed in the street and she laid a hand upon him fearfully it was very cold very tiny and very soft but he made no move to take it the moments dragged along still tense interminable occasionally she leaned towards him and he stooped to catch her whispered words at such times her breath beat warm against his cheek and he closed his teeth stubbornly out in the night a wolfdog saddened the air then came the sound of others wrangling and snarling in a nearby corral this is a chickless land and no cockcrow breaks the midnight peace the suspense enhanced the judges perturbation till his chattering teeth sounded like castanets now and then he groaned the watchers had lost track of time when their strained eyes detected dark blots materializing out of the shadows there they come whispered glenister forcing her back from the aperture but she would not be denied and returned to his side as the foremost figures reached the gate roy leaned forth and spoke not loudly but in tones that sliced through the silence sharp clean and without warning halt dont come inside the fence there was an instants confusion then before the men beneath had time to answer or take action he continued this is roy glenister talking i told you not to molest these people and i warn you again were ready for you the leader spoke youre a traitor glenister he winced perhaps i am you betrayed me first though and traitor or not you cant come into this house there was a murmur at this and some one said miss chester is safe all we want is the judge we wont hang him not if hell wear this suit we brought along he neednt be afraid tar is good for the skin oh my god groaned the limb of the law suddenly a man came running down the planked pavement and into the group mcnamaras gone and sos the marshal and the rest he panted there was a moments silence and then the leader growled to his men scatter out and rush the house boys he raised his voice to the man in the window this is your work you damned turncoat his followers melted away to right and left vaulted the fence and dodged into the shelter of the walls the click click of glenisters winchester sounded through the room while the sweat stood out on him he wondered if he could do this deed if he could really fire on these people he wondered if his muscles would not wither and paralyze before they obeyed his command helen crowded past him and leaning half out of the opening called loudly her voice ringing clear and true wait wait a moment i have something to say mr glenister didnt warn them they thought you were going to attack the mines and so they rode out there before midnight i am telling you the truth really they left hours ago it was the first sign she had made and they recognized her to a man there were uncertain mutterings below till a new man raised his voice both roy and helen recognised dextry boys weve overplayed we dont want these people mcnamaras our meat old baldface up yonder has to do what hes told and im agin this twentytoone midnight work im goin home there were some whisperings then the original spokesman called for judge stillman the old man tottered to the window a palsied terrorstricken object the girl was glad he could not be seen from below we wont hurt you this time judge but youve gone far enough well give you another chance then if you dont make good well stretch you to a lamppost take this as a warning i sshall do my ddduty said the judge the men disappeared into the darkness and when they had gone glenister closed the window pulled down the shades and lighted a lamp he knew by how narrow a margin a tragedy had been averted if he had fired on these men his shot would have kindled a feud which would have consumed every vestige of the court crowd and himself among them he would have fallen under a false banner and his life would not have reached to the next sunset perhaps it was forfeit now he could not tell the vigilantes would probably look upon his part as traitorous and at the very least he had cut himself off from their support the only support the northland offered him henceforth he was a renegade a pariah hated alike by both factions he purposely avoided sight of stillman and turned his back when the judge extended his hand with expressions of gratitude his work was done and he wished to leave this house helen followed him down to the door and as he opened it laid her hand upon his sleeve words are feeble things and i can never make amends for all youve done for us for us cried roy with a break in his voice do you think i sacrificed my honor betrayed my friends killed my last hope ostracized myself for us this is the last time ill trouble you perhaps the last time ill see you no matter what else youve done however youve taught me a lesson and i thank you for it i have found myself at last im not an eskimo any longerim a man youve always been that she said i dont understand as much about this affair as i want to and it seems to me that no one will explain it im very stupid i guess but wont you come back tomorrow and tell it to me no he said roughly youre not of my people mcnamara and his are no friends of mine and im no friend of theirs he was half down the steps before she said softly goodnight and god bless you friend she returned to the judge who was in a pitiable state and for a long time she labored to soothe him as though he were a child she undertook to question him about the things which lay uppermost in her mind and which this night had half revealed but he became fretful and irritated at the mention of mines and mining she sat beside his bed till he dozed off puzzling to discover what lay behind the hints she had heard till her brain and body matched in absolute weariness the reflex of the days excitement sapped her strength till she could barely creep to her own couch where she rolled and sighed too tired to sleep at once she awoke finally with one last nervous flicker before complete oblivion took her a sentence was on her mind it almost seemed as though she had spoken it aloud the handsomest woman in the northbut glenister ran away chapter xvi in which the truth begins to bare itself it was nearly noon of the next day when helen awoke to find that mcnamara had ridden in from the creek and stopped for breakfast with the judge he had asked for her but on hearing the tale of the nights adventure would not allow her to be disturbed later he and the judge had gone away together although her judgment approved the step she had contemplated the night before still the girl now felt a strange reluctance to meet mcnamara it is true that she knew no ill of him except that implied in the accusations of certain embittered men and she was aware that every strong and aggressive character makes enemies in direct proportionate the qualities which lend him greatness nevertheless she was aware of an inner conflict that she had not foreseen this man who so confidently believed that she would marry him did not dominate her consciousness she had ridden much of late taking long solitary gallops beside the shimmering sea that she loved so well or up the winding valleys into the foothills where echoed the roar of swift waters or glinted the flash of shovel blades this morning her horse was lame so she determined to walk in her early rambles she had looked timidly askance at the rough men she met till she discovered their genuine respect and courtesy the most unkempt among them were often collegebred although for that matter the roughest of the miners showed abundant consideration for a woman so she was glad to allow the men to talk to her with the fine freedom inspired by the new country and its wide spaces the wilderness breeds a chivalry all its own thus there seemed to be no danger abroad though they had told the girl of mad dogs which roamed the city explaining that the hot weather affects powerfully the thickcoated shaggy malamoots this is the land of the dog and whereas in winter his lot is to labor and shiver and starve in summer he loafs fights grows fat and runs mad with the heat helen walked far and returning chose an unfamiliar course through the outskirts of the town to avoid meeting any of the women she knew because of that vivid memory of the night before as she walked swiftly along she thought that she heard faint cries far behind her looking up she noted that it was a lonely barren quarter and that the only figure in sight was a woman some distance away a few paces farther on the shouts recurred more plainly this time and a gunshot sounded glancing back she saw several men running one bearing a smoking revolver and heard nearer still the snarling hubbub of fighting dogs in a flash the girls curiosity became horror for as she watched one of the dogs made a sudden dash through the now subdued group of animals and ran swiftly along the planking on which she stood it was a handsome specimen of the eskimo malamoot tall gray and coated like a wolf with the speed strength and cunning of its cousin its head hung low and swung from side to side as it trotted the motion flecking foam and slaver the creature had scattered the pack and now swift menacing relentless was coming towards helen there was no shelter near no fence no house save the distant one towards which the other woman was making her way the men too far away to protect her shouted hoarse warnings helen did not scream nor hesitate she turned and ran terrorstricken towards the distant cottage she was blind with fright and felt an utter certainty that the dog would attack her before she could reach safety yes there was the quick patter of his pads close up behind her her knees weakened the sheltering door was yet some yards away but a horse tethered near the walk reared and snorted as the flying pair drew near the mad creature swerved leaped at the horses legs and snapped in fury badly frightened at this attack the horse lunged at his halter broke it and galloped away but the delay had served for helen weak and faint to reach the door she wrenched at the knob it was locked as she turned hopelessly away she saw that the other woman was directly behind her and was in her turn awaiting the mad animals onslaught but calmly a tiny revolver in her hand shoot screamed helen why dont you shoot the little gun spoke and the dog spun around snarling and yelping the woman fired several times more before it lay still and then remarked calmly as she broke the weapon and ejected the shells the calibre is too small to be good for much helen sank down upon the steps how well you shoot she gasped her eyes were on the gray bundle whose death agonies had thrust it almost to her feet the men had run up and were talking excitedly but after a word with them the woman turned to helen you must come in for a moment and recover yourself she said and led her inside it was a cosey room in which the girl found herself more than that luxurious there was a piano with scattered music and many of the pretty feminine things that helen had not seen since leaving home the hostess had stepped behind some curtains for an instant and was talking to her from the next room that is the third mad dog i have seen this month hydrophobia is becoming a habit in this neighborhood she returned bearing a tiny silver tray with decanter and glasses youre all unstrung but this brandy will help you if you dont object to a swallow of it then come right in here and lie down for a moment and youll be all right she spoke with such genuine kindness and sympathy that helen flashed a grateful glance at her she was tall slender and with a peculiar undulating suggestion in her movements as though she had been bred to the clinging folds of silken garments helen watched the charm of her smile the friendly solicitude of her expression and felt her heart warm towards this one kind woman in nome youre very good she answered but im all right now i was badly frightened it was wonderful your saving me she followed the others graceful motion as she placed her burden on the table and in doing so gazed squarely at a photograph of roy glenister oh helen exclaimed then paused as it flashed over her who this girl was she looked at her quickly yes probably men would consider the woman beautiful with that smile the revelation came with a shock and she arose trying to mask her confusion thank you so much for your kindness im quite myself now and i must go her change of face could not escape the quick perceptions of one schooled by experience in the slights of her sex times without number cherry malotte had marked that subtle scornful change in other women and reviled herself for heeding it but in some way this girls manner hurt her worst of all she betrayed no sign however save a widening of the eyes and a certain fixity of smile as she answered i wish you would stay until you are rested miss she paused with outstretched hand chester my name is helen chester im judge stillmans niece hurried the other in embarrassment cherry malotte withdrew her proffered hand and her face grew hard and hateful oh so you are miss chester and i saved you she laughed harshly helen strove for calmness im sorry you feel that way she said coolly i appreciate your service to me she moved towards the door wait a moment i want to talk to you then as helen paid no heed the woman burst out bitterly oh dont be afraid i know you are committing an unpardonable sin by talking to me but no one will see you and in your code the crime lies in being discovered therefore youre quite safe thats what makes me an outcast i was found out i want you to know however that bad as i am im better than you for im loyal to those that like me and i dont betray my friends i dont pretend to understand you said helen coldly oh yes you do dont assume such innocence of course its your role but you cant play it with me she stepped in front of her visitor placing her back against the door while her face was bitter and mocking the little service i did you just now entitles me to a privilege i suppose and im going to take advantage of it to tell you how badly your mask fits dreadfully rude of me isnt it youre in with a fine lot of crooks and i admire the way youve done your share of the dirty work but when you assume these scandalized supervirtuous airs it offends me let me out ive done bad things cherry continued unheedingly but i was forced into them usually and i never deliberately tried to wreck a mans life just for his money what do you mean by saying that i have betrayed my friends and wrecked anybodys life helen demanded hotly bah i had you sized up at the start but roy couldnt see it then struve told me what i hadnt guessed a bottle of wine a woman and that fool will tell all he knows its a great game mcnamaras playing and he did well to get you in on it for youre clever your nerve is good and your makeup is great for the part i ought to know for ive turned a few tricks myself youll pardon this little burst of feeling professional pique im jealous of your ability thats all however now that you realize were in the same class dont look down on me hereafter she opened the door and bowed her guest out with elaborate mockery helen was too bewildered and humiliated to make much out of this vicious and incoherent attack except the fact that cherry malotte accused her of a part in this conspiracy which every one seemed to believe existed here again was that hint of corruption which she encountered on all sides this might be merely a womans jealousyand yet she said struve had told her all about it that a bottle of wine and a pretty face would make the lawyer disclose everything she could believe it from what she knew and had heard of him the feeling that she was groping in the dark that she was wrapped in a mysterious woof of secrecy came over her again as it had so often of late if struve talked to that other woman why wouldnt he talk to her she paused changing her direction towards front street revolving rapidly in her mind as she went her course of action cherry malotte believed her to be an actress very well she would prove her judgment right she found struve busy in his private office but he leaped to his feet on her entrance and came forward offering her a chair goodmorning miss helen you have a fine color considering the night you passed the judge told me all about the affair and let me state that youre the pluckiest girl i know she smiled grimly at the thought of what made her cheeks glow and languidly loosened the buttons of her jacket i suppose youre very busy you lawyer man she inquired yes but not too busy to attend to anything you want oh i didnt come on business she said lightly i was out walking and merely sauntered in well i appreciate that all the more he said in an altered tone twisting his chair about im more than delighted she judged she was getting on well from the way his professionalism had dropped off yes i get tired of talking to uncle and mr mcnamara they treat me as though i were a little girl when do you take the fatal step what step do you mean your marriage when does it occur you neednt hesitate he added mcnamara told we about it a month ago he felt his throat gingerly at the thought but his eyes brightened when she answered lightly i think you are mistaken he must have been joking for some time she led him on adroitly talking of many things in a way to make him wonder at her new and flippant humor he had never dreamed she could be like this so tantalizingly close to familiarity and yet so maddeningly aloof and distant he grew bolder in his speech how are things going with us she questioned as his warmth grew pronounced uncle wont talk and mr mcnamara is as closemouthed as can be lately he looked at her quickly in what respect she summoned up her courage and walked past the ragged edge of uncertainty now dont you try to keep me in short dresses too its getting wearisome ive done my part and i want to know what the rest of you are doing she was prepared for any answer what do you want to know he asked cautiously everything dont you think i can hear what people are saying oh thats it well dont you pay any attention to what people say she recognized her mistake and continued hurriedly why shouldnt i arent we all in this together i object to being used and then discarded i think im entitled to know how the scheme is working dont you think i can keep my mouth shut of course he laughed trying to change the subject of their talk but she arose and leaned against the desk near him vowing that she would not leave the office without piercing some part of this mystery his manner strengthened her suspicion that there was something behind it all this dissipated brilliant creature knew the situation thoroughly and yet though swayed by her efforts he remained chained by caution she leaned forward and smiled at him youre just like the others arent you you wont give me any satisfaction at all give give give said struve cynically thats always the womans cry give me this give me that selfish sex why dont you offer something in return men are traders women usurers you are curious hence miserable i can help you therefore i should do it for a smile you ask me to break my promises and risk my honor on your caprice well thats womanlike and ill do it ill put myself in your power but i wont do it gratis no well trade it isnt curiosity she denied indignantly it is my due no youve heard the common talk and grown suspicious thats all you think i know something that will throw a new light or a new shadow on everything you have in the world and youre worked up to such a condition that you cant take your own peoples word and on the other hand you cant go to strangers so you come to me suppose i told you i had the papers you brought to me last spring in that safe and that they told the whole story whether your uncle is unimpeachable or whether he deserved hanging by that mob what would you do eh what would you give to see them well theyre there and ready to speak for themselves if youre a woman you wont rest till youve seen them will you trade yes yes give them to me she cried eagerly at which a wave of crimson rushed up to his eyes and he rose abruptly from his chair he made towards her but she retreated to the wall pale and wideeyed cant you see she flung at him that i must know he paused of course i can but i want a kiss to bind the bargain to apply on account he reached for her hand with his own hot one but she pushed him away and slipped past him towards the door suit yourself said he but if im not mistaken youll never rest till youve seen those papers ive studied you and ill place a bet that you cant marry mcnamara nor look your uncle in the eye till you know the truth you might do either if you knew them to be crooks but you couldnt if you only suspected it thats the woman when you get ready come back ill show you proof because i dont claim to be anything but what i am wilton struve bargainer of some mean ability when they come to inscribe my headstone i hope they can carve thereon with truth he got value received youre a panther she said loathingly graceful and elegant brute that he laughed affectionate and full of play but with sharp teeth and sharper claws to follow out the idea which pleases me i believe the creature owes no loyalty to its fellows and hunts alone now when youve followed this conspiracy out and placed the blame where it belongs wont you come and tell me about it that door leads into an outer hall which opens into the street no one will see you come or go as she hurried away she wondered dazedly why she had stayed to listen so long what a monster he was his meaning was plain had always been so from the first day he laid eyes upon her and he was utterly conscienceless she had known all this and yet in her proud youthful confidence and in her need every hour more desperate and urgent to know the truth she had dared risk herself with him withal the man was shrewd and observant and had divined her mental condition with remarkable sagacity she had failed with him but the girl now knew that she could never rest till she found an answer to her questions she must kill this suspicion that ate into her so she thought tenderly of her uncles goodness to her clung with despairing faith to the last of her kin the blood ties of the chesters were close and she felt in dire need of that lost brother who was somewhere in this mysterious land need of some one in whom ran the strain that bound her to the weak old man up yonder there was mcnamara but how could he help her how much did she know of him this man who was now within the darkest shadow of her new suspicions feeling almost intolerably friendless and alone weakened both by her recent fright and by her encounter with struve helen considered as calmly as her emotions would allow and decided that this was no day in which pride should figure there were facts which it was imperative she should know and immediately therefore a few minutes later she knocked at the door of cherry malotte when the girl appeared helen was astonished to see that she had been crying tears burn hottest and leave plainest trace in eyes where they come most seldom the younger girl could not guess the tumult of emotion the other had undergone during her absence the utter depths of selfabasement she had fathomed for the sight of helen and her fresh young beauty had roused in the adventuress a very tempest of bitterness and jealousy whether helen chester were guilty or innocent how could glenister hesitate between them cherry had asked herself now she stared at her visitor inhospitably and without sign will you let me come in helen asked her i have something to say to you when they were inside cherry malotte stood and gazed at her visitor with inscrutable eyes and stony face it isnt easy for me to come back helen began but i felt that i had to if you can help me i hope you will you said that you knew a great wrong was being done i have suspected it but i didnt know and ive been afraid to doubt my own people you said i had a part in it that id betrayed my friends wait a moment she hurried on at the others cynical smile wont you tell me what you know and what you think my part has been ive heard and seen things that make me think oh they make me afraid to think and yet i cant find the truth you see in a struggle like this people will make all sorts of allegations but do they know have they any proof that my uncle has done wrong is that all no you said struve told you the whole scheme i went to him and tried to cajole the story out of him but she shivered at the memory what success did you have inquired the listener oddly curious for all her cold dislike dont ask me i hate to think of it cherry laughed cruelly so failing there you came back to me back for another favor from the waif well miss helen chester i dont believe a word youve said and ill tell you nothing go back to the uncle and the rawboned lover who sent you and inform them that ill speak when the time comes they think i know too much do they so theyve sent you to spy well ill make a compact you play your game and ill play mine leave glenister alone and ill not tell on mcnamara is it a bargain no no no cant you see thats not it all i want is the truth of this thing then go back to struve and get it hell tell you i wont drive your bargain with him youre able youve fooled better men now see what you can do with him helen left realizing the futility of further effort though she felt that this woman did not really doubt her but was scourged by jealousy till she deliberately chose this attitude reaching her own house she wrote two brief notes and called in her jap boy from the kitchen fred i want you to hunt up mr glenister and give him this note if you cant find him then look for his partner and give the other to him fred vanished to return in an hour with the letter for dextry still in his hand i don catch dis feller he explained young mans say he gone come back mebbe one two leven days did you deliver the one to mr glenister yes maam was there an answer yes maam well give it to me the note read dear miss chester a discussion of a matter so familiar to us both as the anvil creek controversy would be useless if your inclination is due to the incidents of last night pray dont trouble yourself we dont want your pity i am your servant roy glenister as she read the note judge stillman entered and it seemed to the girl that he had aged a year for every hour in the last twelve or else the yellow afternoon light limned the sagging hollows and haggard lines of his face most pitilessly he showed in voice and manner the nervous burden under which he labored alec has told me about your engagement and it lifts a terrible load from me im mighty glad youre going to marry him hes a wonderful man and hes the only one who can save us what do you mean by that what are we in danger of she inquired avoiding discussion of mcnamaras announcement why that mob of course theyll come back they said so but alec can handle the commanding officer at the post and thanks to him well have soldiers guarding the house hereafter why they wont hurt us tut tut i know what im talking about were in worse danger now than ever and if we dont break up those vigilantes therell be bloodshed thats what theyre a menace and theyre trying to force me off the bench so they can take the law into their own hands again thats what i want to see you about theyre planning to kill alec and me so he says and weve got to act quick to prevent murder now this young glenister is one of them and he knows who the rest are do you think you could get him to talk i dont think i quite understand you said the girl through whitening lips oh yes you do i want the names of the ringleaders so that i can jail them you can worm it out of that fellow if you try helen looked at the old man in a horror that at first was dumb you ask this of me she demanded hoarsely at last nonsense he said irritably this isnt any time for silly scruples its life or death for me maybe and for alec too he said the last craftily but she stormed at him its infamous youre asking me to betray the very man who saved us not twelve hours ago he risked his life for us it isnt treachery at all its protection if we dont get them theyll get us i wouldnt punish that young fellow but i want the others come now youve got to do it but she said no firmly and quietly went to her own room where behind the locked door she sat for a long time staring with unseeing eyes her hands tight clenched in her lap at last she whispered im afraid its true im afraid its true she remained hidden during the dinnerhour and pleaded a headache when mcnamara called in the early evening although she had not seen him since he left her the night before bearing her tacit promise to wed him yet how could she meet him now with the conviction growing on her hourly that he was a masterrogue she wrestled with the thought that he and her uncle her own uncle who stood in the place of a father were conspirators and yet at memory of the judges coldblooded request that she should turn traitress her whole being was revolted if he could ask a thing like that what other heartless selfish act might he not be capable of all the long solitary evening she kept her room but at last feeling faint slipped downstairs in search of fred for she had eaten nothing since her late breakfast voices reached her from the parlor and as she came to the last step she froze there in an attitude of listening the first sentence she heard through the closedrawn curtains banished all qualms at eavesdropping she stood for many breathless minutes drinking in the plot that came to her plainly from within then turned gathered up her skirts and tiptoed back to her room here she made haste madly tearing off her house clothes and donning others she pressed her face to the window and noted that the night was like a closehung velvet pall without a star in sight nevertheless she wound a heavy veil about her hat and face before she extinguished the light and stepped into the hall hearing mcnamaras goodnight at the frontdoor she retreated again while her uncle slowly mounted the stairs and paused before her chamber he called her name softly but when she did not answer continued on to his own room when he was safely within she descended quietly went out and locked the frontdoor behind her placing the key in her bosom she hurried now feeling her way through the thick gloom in a panic while in her mind was but one frightened thought ill be too late ill be too late chapter xvii the drip of water in the dark even after helen had been out for some time she could barely see sufficiently to avoid collisions the air weighted by a lowhung roof of clouds was surcharged with the electric suspense of an impending storm and seemed to sigh and tremble at the hint of power in leash it was that pause before the conflict wherein the night laid finger upon its lips as the girl neared glenisters cabin she was disappointed at seeing no light there she stumbled towards the door only to utter a halfstrangled cry as two men stepped out of the gloom and seized her roughly something cold and hard was thrust violently against her cheek forcing her head back and bruising her she struggled and cried out hold on its a woman ejaculated the man who had pinioned her arms loosing his hold till only a hand remained on her shoulder the other lowered the weapon he had jammed to her face and peered closely why miss chester he said what are you doing here you came near getting hurt i am bound for the wilsons but i must have lost my way in the darkness i think you have cut my face she controlled her fright firmly thats too bad one said we mistook you for and the other broke in sharply youd better run along were waiting for some one helen hastened back by the route she had come knowing that there was still time and that as yet her uncles emissaries had not laid hands upon glenister she had overheard the judge and mcnamara plotting to drag the town with a force of deputies seizing not only her two friends but every man suspected of being a vigilante the victims were to be jailed without bond without reason without justice while the mechanism of the court was to be juggled in order to hold them until fall if necessary they had said that the officers were already busy so haste was a crying thing she sped down the dark streets towards the house of cherry malotte but found no light nor answer to her knock she was distracted now and knew not where to seek next among the thousand spots which might hide the man she wanted what chance had she against the posse sweeping the town from end to end there was only one he might be at the northern theatre even so she could not reach him for she dared not go there herself she thought of fred her jap boy but there was no time wasted moments meant failure roy had once told her that he never gave up what he undertook very well she would show that even a girl may possess determination this was no time for modesty or shrinking indecision so she pulled the veil more closely about her face and took her good name into her hands she made rapidly towards the lighted streets which cast a skyward glare and from which through the breathless calm arose the sound of carousal swiftly she threaded the narrow alleys in search of the theatres rear entrance for she dared not approach from the front in this way she came into a part of the camp which had lain hidden from her until now and of the existence of which she had never dreamed the vices of a city however horrible are at least draped scantily by the mantle of convention but in a great miningcamp they stand naked and without concealment here there were rows upon rows of criblike houses clustered over tortuous illlighted lanes like blowflies swarming to an unclean feast from within came the noise of ribaldry and debauch shrill laughter mingled with coarse maudlin songs till the clinging night reeked with abominable revelry the girl saw painted creatures of every nationality leaning from windows or beckoning from doorways while drunken men collided with her barred her course challenged her and again and again she was forced to slip from their embraces at last the high bulk of the theatre building loomed a short distance ahead panting and frightened she tried the door with weak hands to find it locked from behind it rose the blare of brass and the sound of singing she accosted a man who approached her through the narrow alley but he had cruised from the charted course in search of adventure and was not minded to go in quest of doormen rather he chose to sing a chantey to the bibulous measures of which he invited her to dance with him so she slipped away till he had teetered past he was some longshoreman in that particular epoch of his inebriety where life had no burden save the dissipation of wages returning she pounded on the door possessed of the sense that the man she sought was here till at last it was flung open framing the silhouette of a shirtsleeved thickset youth who shouted what n ell do you want to butt in for while the shows on go round front she caught a glimpse of disordered scenery and before he could slam the door in her face thrust a silver dollar into his hand at the same time wedging herself into the opening he pocketed the coin and the door clicked to behind her well speak up the acts closin evidently he was the directing genius of the performance for at that moment the chorus broke into full cry and he said hurriedly wait a minute there goes the finally and dashed away to tend his drops and switches when the curtain was down and the principals had sought their dressingrooms he returned do you know mr glenister she asked sure i seen him tonight come here he led her towards the footlights and pulling back the edge of the curtain allowed her to peep past him out into the dancehall she had never pictured a place like this and in spite of her agitation was astonished at its gaudy elegance the gallery was formed of a continuous row of compartments with curtained fronts in which men and women were talking drinking singing the seats on the lower floor were disappearing and the canvas cover was rolling back showing the polished hardwood underneath while out through the wide foldingdoors that led to the main gamblingroom she heard a brasslunged man calling the commencement of the dance couples glided into motion while she watched i dont see him said her guide you better walk out front and help yourself he indicated the stairs which led up to the galleried boxes and the steps leading down on to the main floor but she handed him another coin begging him to find glenister and bring him to her hurry hurry she implored the stagemanager gazed at her curiously remarking my you spend your money like it had been left to you youre a regular piecheck for me come around any time she withdrew to a dark corner and waited interminably till her messenger appeared at the head of the gallery stairs and beckoned to her as she drew near he said i told him there was a thousanddollar filly flaggin him from the stage door but hes got a grouch an wont stir hes in number seven she hesitated at which he said go on youre in right then continued reassuringly say pal if hes your whitehaired lad you neednt start no roughhouse cause he dont flirt wit these dames none whatever naw take it from me she entered the door her counsellor indicated to find roy lounging back watching the dancers he turned inquiringly then as she raised her veil leaped to his feet and jerked the curtains to helen what are you doing here you must go away quickly she gasped theyre trying to arrest you they who arrest me for what voorhees and his men for riot or something about last night nonsense he said i had no part in it you know that yes yes but youre a vigilante and theyre after you and all your friends your house is guarded and the town is alive with deputies theyve planned to jail you on some pretext or other and hold you indefinitely please go before its too late how do you know this he asked gravely i overheard them plotting who uncle arthur and mr mcnamara she faced him squarely as she said it and therefore saw the light flame up in his eyes as he cried and you came here to save me came here at the risk of your good name of course i would have done the same for dextry the gladness died away leaving him listless well let them come im done i guess i heard from wheaton tonight hes down and out too some trouble with the frisco courts about jurisdiction over these cases i dont know that its worth while to fight any longer listen she said you must go i am sure there is a terrible wrong being done and you and i must stop it i have seen the truth at last and youre in the right please hide for a time at least very well if you have taken sides with us theres some hope left thank you for the risk you ran in warning me she had moved to the front of the compartment and was peering forth between the draperies when she stifled a cry too late too late there they are dont part the curtains theyll see you pushing through the gamblinghall were voorhees and four others seemingly in quest of some one run down the back stairs she breathed and pushed him through the door he caught and held her hand with a last word of gratitude then he was gone she drew down her veil and was about to follow when the door opened and he reappeared no use he remarked quietly there are three more waiting at the foot he looked out to find that the officers had searched the crowd and were turning towards the front stairs thus cutting off his retreat there were but two ways down from the gallery and no outside windows from which to leap as they had made no armed display the presence of the officers had not interrupted the dance glenister drew his revolver while into his eyes came the dancing glitter that helen had seen before cold as the glint of winter sunlight no not that for gods sake she shuddered clasping his arm i must for your sake or theyll find you here and thats worse than ruin ill fight it out in the corridors so that you can escape in the confusion wait till the firing stops and the crowd gathers his hand was on the knob when she tore it loose whispering hoarsely theyll kill you wait theres a better way jump she dragged him to the front of the box and pulled aside the curtains it isnt high and they wont see you till its too late then you can run through the crowd he grasped her idea and slipping his weapon back into its holster laid hold of the ledge before him and lowered himself down over the dancers he swung out unhesitatingly and almost before he had been observed had dropped into their midst the gallery was but twice the height of a mans head from the floor so he landed on his feet and had drawn his colts even while the men at the stairs were shouting at him to halt at sight of the naked weapons there was confusion wherein the commands of the deputies mingled with the shrieks of the women the crash of overturned chairs and the sound of tramping feet as the crowd divided before glenister and swept back against the wall in the same ominous way that a crowd in the street had once divided on the morning of helens arrival the trombone player who had sunk low in his chair with closed eyes looked out suddenly at the disturbance and his alarm was blown through the horn in a startled squawk a large woman whimpered dont shoot and thrust her palms to her ears closing her eyes tightly glenister covered the deputies from whose vicinity the bystanders surged as though from the presence of lepers hands up he cried sharply and they froze into motionless attitudes one poised on the lowest step of the stairs the other a pace forward voorhees appeared at the head of the flight and rushed down a few steps only to come abruptly into range and to assume a like rigidity for the young mans aim shifted to him i have a warrant for you the officer cried his voice loud in the hush keep it said glenister showing his teeth in a smile in which there was no mirth he backed diagonally across the hall his bootheels clicking in the silence his eyes shifting rapidly up and down the stairs where the danger lay from her station helen could see the whole tableau all but the men on the stairs where her vision was cut off she saw the dance girls crouched behind their partners or leaning far out from the wall with parted lips the men eager yet fearful the bartender with a halfpolished glass poised high then a quick movement across the hall suddenly diverted her absorbed attention she saw a man rip aside the drapery of the box opposite and lean so far out that he seemed in peril of falling he undertook to sight a weapon at glenister who was just passing from his view at her first glance helen gasped her heart gave one fierce lunge and she cried out the distance across the pit was so short that she saw his every line and lineament clearly it was the brother she had sought these years and years before she knew or could check it the blood call leaped forth drury she cried aloud at which he whipped his head about while amazement and some other emotion she could not gauge spread slowly over his features for a long moment he stared at her without movement or sign while the drama beneath went on then he drew back into his retreat with the dazed look of one doubting his senses yet fearful of putting them to the test for her part she saw nothing except her brother vanishing slowly into the shadows as though stricken at her glance the curtains closing before his livid face and then pandemonium broke loose at her feet glenister holding his enemies at bay had retreated to the double doors leading to the theatre his coup had been executed so quickly and with such lack of turmoil that the throng outside knew nothing of it till they saw a man walk backward through the door as he did so he reached forth and slammed the wide wings shut before his face then turned and dashed into the press inside the dancehall loud sounds arose as the officers clattered down the stairs and made after their quarry they tore the barrier apart in time to see far down the saloon an eddying swirl as though some great fish were lashing through the lilypads of a pond and then the swinging doors closed behind glenister helen made her way from the theatre as she had come unobserved and unobserving but she walked in a dream emotions had chased each other too closely tonight to be distinguishable so she went mechanically through the narrow alley to front street and thence to her home glenister meanwhile had been swallowed up by the darkness the night enfolding him without sign or trace as he ran he considered what course to follow whether to carry the call to his comrades in town or to make for the creek and dextry the vigilantes might still distrust him and yet he owed them warning mcnamaras men were moving so swiftly that action must be speedy to forestall them another hour and the net would be closed while it seemed that whichever course he chose they would snare one or the other either the friends who remained in town or dex and slapjack out in the hills with daylight those two would return and walk unheeding into the trap while if he bore the word to them first then the vigilantes would be jailed before dawn as he drew near cherry malottes house he saw a light through the drawn curtains a heavy raindrop plashed upon his face another followed and then he heard the patter of falling water increasing swiftly before he could gain the door the storm had broken it swept up the street with tropical violence while a breath sighed out of the night lifting the litter from underfoot and pelting him with flying particles over the roofs the wind rushed with the rising moan of a hurricane while the night grew suddenly noisy ahead of the tempest he entered the door without knocking to find the girl removing her coat her face gladdened at sight of him but he checked her with quick and cautious words his speech almost drowned by the roar outside are you alone she nodded and he slipped the bolt behind him saying the marshals are after me we just had a run in at the northern and im on the go no nothing serious yet but they want the vigilantes and i must get them word will you help me he rapidly recounted the row of the last ten minutes while she nodded her quick understanding youre safe here for a little while she told him for the storm will check them if they should come theres a back door leading out from the kitchen and a side entrance yonder in my room youll find a french window they cant corner you very well slapjack and dex are out at the shaft house you know that quartz claim on the mountain above the midas he hesitated will you lend me your saddlehorse its a black night and i may kill him what about these men in town ill warn them first then hit for the hills she shook her head you cant do it you cant get out there before daylight if you wait to rouse these people and mcnamara has probably telephoned the mines to send a party up to the quartz claim after dex he knows where the old man is as well as you do and theyll raid him before dawn im afraid so but its all i can offer will you give me the horse no hes only a pony and youd founder him in the tundra the mud is kneedeep ill go myself good heavens girl in such a night why its worth your life listen to it the creeks will be up and youll have to swim no i cant let you hes a good little horse and hell take me through then coming close she continued oh boy cant you see that i want to help cant you see that i id die for you if it would do any good he gazed gravely into her wide blue eyes and said awkwardly yes i know im sorry things are as they are but you wouldnt have me lie to you little woman no youre the only true man i ever knew i guess thats why i love you and i do love you oh so much i want to be good and worthy to love you too she laid her face against his arm and caressed him with clinging tenderness while the wind yelled loudly about the eaves and the windows drummed beneath the rain his heavy brows knit themselves together as she whispered i love you i love you i love you with such an agony of longing in her voice that her soft accents were sharply distinguishable above the turmoil the growing wildness seemed a part of the womans passion which whipped and harried her like a willow in a blast things are fearfully jumbled he said finally and this is a bad time to talk about them i wish they might be different no other girl would do what you have offered tonight then why do you think of that woman she broke in fiercely shes bad and false she betrayed you once shes in the play now youve told me so yourself why dont you be a man and forget her i cant he said simply youre wrong though when you think shes bad i found tonight that shes good and brave and honest the part she played was played innocently im sure of that in spite of the fact that shell marry mcnamara it was she who overheard them plotting and risked her reputation to warn me cherrys face whitened while the shadowy eagerness that had rested there died utterly she came into that dive alone she did that he nodded at which she stood thinking for some time then continued youre honest with me roy and ill be the same with you im tired of deceit tired of everything i tried to make you think she was bad but in my own heart i knew differently all the time she came here today and humbled herself to get the truth humbled herself to me and i sent her away she suspected but she didnt know and when she asked for information i insulted her thats the kind of a creature i am i sent her back to struve who offered to tell her the whole story what does that renegade want cant you guess why id rather the young man ground his teeth but cherry hastened you neednt worry she wont see him again she loathes the ground he walks on and yet hes no worse than that other scoundrel come girl we have work to do we must act and act quickly he gave her his message to dextry then she went to her room and slipped into a ridinghabit when she came out he asked where is your raincoat youll be drenched in no time i cant ride with it ill be thrown anyway and i dont want to be all bound up water wont hurt me she thrust her tiny revolver into her dress but he took it and upon examination shook his head if you need a gun youll need a good one he removed the belt from his own waist and buckled his colts about her but you she objected ill get another in ten minutes then as they were leaving he said one other request cherry ill be in hiding for a time and i must get word to miss chester to keep watch of her uncle for the big fight is on at last and the boys will hang him sure if they catch him i owe her this last warning will you send it to her ill do it for your sake not for her no no i dont mean that ill do the right thing all round leave it here and ill see that she gets it tomorrow and roy be careful of yourself her eyes were starry and in their depths lurked neither selfishness nor jealousy now only that mysterious glory of a woman who makes sacrifice together they scurried back to the stable and yet in that short distance she would have been swept from her feet had he not seized her they blew in through the barn door streaming and soaked by the blinding sheets that drove scythelike ahead of the wind he struck a light and the pony whinnied at recognition of his mistress she stroked the little fellows muzzle while glenister cinched on her saddle then when she was at last mounted she leaned forward will you kiss me once roy for the last time he took her rainwet face between his hands and kissed her upon the lips as he would have saluted a little maid as he did so unseen by both of them a face was pressed for an instant against the pane of glass in the stable wall youre a brave girl and may god bless you he said extinguishing the light he flung the door wide and she rode out into the storm locking the portal he plunged back towards the house to write his hurried note for there was much to do and scant time for its accomplishment despite the helping hand of the hurricane he heard the voice of bering as it thundered on the golden sands and knew that the first great storm of the fall had come henceforth he saw that the violence of men would rival the rising elements for the deeds of this night would stir their passions as aeolus was rousing the hate of the sea he neglected to bolt the house door as he entered but flung off his dripping coat and seizing pad and pencil scrawled his message the wind screamed about the cabin the lamp flared smokily and glenister felt a draught suck past him as though from an open door at his back as he wrote i cant do anything more the end has come and it has brought the hatred and bloodshed that i have been trying to prevent i played the game according to your rules but they forced me back to first principles in spite of myself and now i dont know what the finish will be tomorrow will tell take care of your uncle and if you should wish to communicate with me go to cherry malotte she is a friend to both of us always your servant roy glenister as he sealed this he paused while he felt the hair on his neck rise and bristle and a chill race up his spine his heart fluttered then pounded onward till the blood thumped audibly at his eardrums and he found himself swaying in rhythm to its beat the muscles of his back cringed and rippled at the proximity of some hovering peril and yet an irresistible feeling forbade him to turn a sound came from close behind his chair the drip drip drip of water it was not from the eaves nor yet from a faulty shingle his back was to the kitchen door through which he had come and although there were no mirrors before him he felt a menacing presence as surely as though it had touched him his ears were tuned to the finest pinpricks of sound so that he heard the faint sighing squish of a sodden shoe upon which a weight had shifted still something chained him to his seat it was as though his soul laid a restraining hand upon his body waiting for the instant he let his hand seek his hip carelessly but remembered where his gun was mechanically he addressed the note in shaking characters while behind him sounded the constant drip drip drip that he knew came from saturated garments for a long moment he sat till he heard the stealthy click of a gunlock muffled by finger pressure then he set his face and slowly turned to find the bronco kid standing behind him as though risen from the sea his light clothes wet and clinging his feet centred in a spreading puddle the dim light showed the convulsive fury of his features above the levelled weapon whose hammer was curled back like the head of a striking adder his eyes gleaming with frenzy glenisters mouth was powder dry but his mind was leaping riotously like dust before a gale for he divined himself to be in the deadliest peril of his life when he spoke the calmness of his voice surprised himself whats the matter bronco the kid made no reply and roy repeated what do you want thats a hell of a question the gambler said hoarsely i want you of course and ive got you hold up i am unarmed this is your third try and i want to know whats back of it damn the talk cried the farodealer moving closer till the light shone on his features which commenced to twitch he raised the revolver he had half lowered theres reason enough and you know it glenister looked him fairly between the eyes gripping himself with firm hands to stop the tremor he felt in his bones you cant kill me he said i am too good a man to murder you might shoot a crook but you cant kill a brave man when hes unarmed youre no assassin he remained rigid in his chair however moving nothing but his lips meeting the others look unflinchingly the kid hesitated an instant while his eyes which had been fixed with the glare of hatred wavered a moment betraying the faintest sign of indecision glenister cried out exultantly ha i knew it your neck cords quiver the gambler grimaced i cant do it if i could id have shot you before you turned but youll have to fight you dog get up and draw roy refused i gave cherry my gun yes and more too the man gritted i saw it all even yet glenister had made no slightest move realizing that a feathers weight might snap the gamblers nervous tension and bring the involuntary twitch that would put him out swifter than a whip is cracked i have tried it before but murder isnt my game the kids eye caught the glint of cherrys revolver where she had discarded it theres a gun get it its no good youd carry the six bullets and never feel them i dont know what this is all about but ill fight you whenever im heeled right oh you blackhearted hound snarled the kid i want to shoot but im afraid i used to be a gentleman and i havent lost it all i guess but i wont wait the next time ill down you on sight so youd better get ironed in a hurry he backed out of the room into the semidarkness of the kitchen watching with lynxlike closeness the man who sat so quietly under the shaded light he felt behind him for the outer doorknob and turned it to let in a white sheet of rain then vanished like a storm wraith leaving a parchedlipped man and a zigzag trail of water which gleamed in the lamplight like a pool of blood chapter xviii wherein a trap is baited glenister did not wait long after his visitors departure but extinguished the light locked the door and began the further adventures of this night the storm welcomed him with suffocating violence sucking the very breath from his lips while the rain beat through till his flesh was cold and aching he thought with a pang of the girl facing this tempest going out to meet the thousand perils of the night and it remained for him to bear his part as she bore hers smilingly the last hour had added another and mysterious danger to his full measure could the kid be jealous of cherry surely not then what else the tornado had driven his trailers to cover evidently for the streets were given over to its violence and roy encountered no hostile sign as he was buffeted from house to house he adventured cautiously and yet with haste finding certain homes where the marshals had been before him peopled now only by frightened wives and children a scattered few of the vigilantes had been taken thus while the warring elements had prevented their families from spreading the alarm or venturing out for succor those whom he was able to warn dressed hurriedly took their rifles and went out into the drifting night leaving empty cabins and weeping women the great fight was on towards daylight the remnants of the vigilantes straggled into the big blank warehouse on the sandspit and there beneath the smoking glare of lanterns cursed the name of mcnamara as dawn grayed the ragged eastern skyline dextry and slapjack blew in through the spindrift bringing word from cherry and lifting a load from glenisters mind theres a game girl said the old miner as he wrung out his clothes she was half gone when she got to us and now shes waiting for the storm to break so that she can come back its clearing up to the east slapjack chattered dyou know im gettin so rheumatic that icewater dont feel comfortable to me no more uriatic acid in the blood said dextry whats our next move he asked of his partner when do we hang this politician seems like weve got enough ablebodied pianomovers here to tie a can onto the whole outfit push the town site of nome off the map and start afresh i think we had better lie low and watch developments the other cautioned theres no telling what may turn up during the day thats right stranglers is like spirits they work best in the dark as the day grew the storm died leaving ramparts of clouds hanging sullenly above the oceans rim while those skilled in weather prophecy foretold the coming of the equinoctial in mcnamaras office there was great stir and the coming of many men the boss sat in his chair smoking countless cigars his big face set in grim lines his hard eyes peering through the pall of blue at those he questioned he worked the wires of his machine until his dolls doubled and danced and twisted at his touch after a gusty interview he had dismissed voorhees with a merciless tonguelashing raging bitterly at the mans failure youre not fit to herd sheep thirty men out all night and what do you get a dozen mulletheaded miners you bag the mudhens and the big game runs to cover i wanted glenister but you let him slip through your fingers now its war what a mess youve made if i had even one helper with a brain the size of a flaxseed this game would be a gift but youve bungled every move from the start bah put a spy in the bullpen with those prisoners and make them talk offer them anything for information now get out he called for a certain deputy and questioned him regarding the nights quest remarking finally theres treachery somewhere those men were warned nobody came near glenisters house except miss chester the man replied what the judges niece we caught her by mistake in the dark later one of the men who had been with voorhees at the northern asked to see the receiver and told him the chief wont believe that i saw miss chester in the dancehall last night but she was there with glenister she must have put him wise to our game or he wouldnt have known we were after him his hearer made no comment but when alone rose and paced the floor with heavy tread while his face grew savage and brutal so thats the game eh its man to man from now on very well glenister ill have your life for that and then youll pay miss helen he considered carefully a plot for a plot if he could not swap intrigue with these miners and beat them badly he deserved to lose now that the girl gave herself to their cause he would use her again and see how well she answered public opinion would not stand too great a strain and although he had acted within his rights last night he dared not go much further diplomacy therefore must serve he must force his enemies beyond the law and into his trap she had passed the word once she would do so again he hurried to stillmans house and stormed into the presence of the judge he told the story so artfully that the judges astonished unbelief yielded to rage and cowardice and he sent for his niece she came down white and silent having heard the loud voices the old man berated her with shrewish fury while mcnamara stood silent the girl listened with entire selfcontrol until her uncle made a reference to glenister that she found intolerable hush i will not listen she cried passionately i warned him because you would have sacrificed him after he had saved our lives that is all he is an honest man and i am grateful to him that is the only foundation for your insult mcnamara with apparent candor broke in you thought you were doing right of course but your action will have terrible consequences now well have riot bloodshed and heaven knows what it was to save all this that i wanted to break up their organization a weeks imprisonment would have done it but now theyre armed and belligerent and well have a battle tonight no no she cried there mustnt be any violence there is no use trying to check them they are rushing to their own destruction i have learned that they plan to attack the midas tonight and ill have fifty soldiers waiting for them there it is a shame for they are decent fellows blinded by ignorance and misled by that young miner this will be the blackest night the north has ever seen with this mcnamara left the house and went in search of voorhees remarking to himself now miss helen send your warning the sooner the better if i know those vigilantes it will set them crazy and yet not crazy enough to attack the midas they will strike for me and when they hit my poor unguarded office theyll think hell has moved north mr marshal said he to his tool i want you to gather forty men quietly and to arm them with winchesters they must be fellows who wont faint at blood you know the kind assemble them at my office after dark one at a time by the back way it must be done with absolute secrecy now see if you can do this one thing and not get balled up if you fail ill make you answer to me why dont you get the troops ventured voorhees if theres one thing i want to avoid its soldiers either here or at the mines when they step in we step out and im not ready for that just yet the receiver smiled sinisterly helen meanwhile had fled to her room and there received glenisters note through cherry malottes messenger it rekindled her worst fears and bore out mcnamaras prophecy the more she read of it the more certain she grew that the crisis was only a question of hours and that with darkness tragedy would walk the streets of nome the thought of the wrong already done was lost in the lonely girls terror of the crime about to happen for it seemed to her she had been the instrument to set these forces in motion that she had loosed this swiftspeeding avalanche of greed hatred and brutality and when the crash should come the girl shuddered it must not be she would shriek a warning from the housetops even at cost of her uncle of mcnamara and of herself and yet she had no proof that a crime existed although it all lay clear in her own mind the certainty of it arose only from her intuition if only she were able to take a hand if only she were not a woman then cherry malottes words anent struve recurred to her a bottle of wine and a womans face they brought back the lawyers assurance that those documents she had safeguarded all through the long springtime journey really contained the proof if they did then they held the power to check this impending conflict her uncle and the boss would not dare continue if threatened with exposure and prosecution the more she thought of it the more urgent seemed the necessity to prevent the battle of tonight there was a chance here at least and the only one adding to her mental torment was the constant vision of that face in the curtains at the northern it was her brother yet what mystery shrouded this affair also what kept him from her what caused him to slink away like a thief discovered she grew dizzy and hysterical struve turned in his chair as the door to his private office opened then leaped to his feet at sight of the grayeyed girl standing there i came for the papers she said i knew you would the blood went out of his cheeks then surged back up to his eyes its a bargain then she nodded give them to me first he laughed unpleasantly what do you take me for ill keep my part of the bargain if youll keep yours but this is no place nor time theres riot in the air and im busy preparing for tonight come back tomorrow when its all over but it was the terror of tonights doings that led her into his power ill never come back she said it is my whim to know today yes at once he meditated for a time then today it shall be ill shirk the fight ill sacrifice what shreds of duty have clung to me because the fever for you is in my bones and it seems to me id do murder for it thats the kind of a man i am and i have no pride in myself because of it but ive always been that way well ride to the sign of the sled its a romantic little roadhouse ten miles from here perched high above the snake river trail well take dinner there together but the papers ill have them with me well start in an hour in an hour she echoed lifelessly and left him he chuckled grimly and seized the telephone central call the sled roadhouse seven rings on the snake river branch hello that you shortz this is struve anybody at the house good turn them away if they come and say that youre closed none of your business ill be out about dark so have dinner for two spread yourself and keep the place clear goodbye strengthened by glenisters note helen went straight to the other woman and this time was not kept waiting nor greeted with sneers but found cherry cloaked in a shy dignity which she clasped tightly about herself under her visitors incoherence she lost her diffidence however and when helen had finished remarked with decision dont go with him hes a bad man but i must the blood of those men will be on me if i dont stop this tragedy if those papers tell the tale i think they do i can call off my uncle and make mcnamara give back the mines you said struve told you the whole scheme did you see the proof no i have only his word but he spoke of those documents repeatedly saying they contained his instructions to tie up the mines in order to give a foothold for the lawsuits he bragged that the rest of the gang were in his power and that he could land them in the penitentiary for conspiracy thats all its the only chance said helen they are sending soldiers to the midas to lie in ambush and you must warn the vigilantes cherry paled at this and ejaculated good lord roy said hed lead an attack tonight the two stared at each other if i succeed with struve i can stop it all all of this injustice and crime everything do you realize what youre risking cherry demanded that man is an animal youll have to kill him to save yourself and hell never give up those proofs yes he will said helen fiercely and i defy him to harm me the sign of the sled is a public roadhouse with a landlord a telephone and other guests will you warn mr glenister about the troops i will and bless you for a brave girl wait a moment cherry took from the dresser her tiny revolver dont hesitate to use this i want you to know also that im sorry for what i said yesterday as she hurried away helen realized with a shock the change that the past few months had wrought in her in truth it was as glenister had said his northland worked strangely with its denizens what of that shrinking girl who had stepped out of the sheltered life strong only in her untried honesty to become a hunted harried thing juggling with honor and reputation in her heart a halfformed fear that she might kill a man this night to gain her end the elements were moulding her with irresistible hands roys contact with the primitive had not roughened him more quickly than had hers she met her appointment with struve and they rode away together he talkative and elated she silent and icy late in the afternoon the cloud banks to the eastward assumed alarming proportions they brought with them an early nightfall and when they broke let forth a tempest which rivalled that of the previous night during the first of it armed men came sifting into mcnamaras office from the rear and were hidden throughout the building whenever he descried a peculiarly desperate ruffian the boss called him aside for private instruction and gave minute description of a wideshouldered erect youth in white hat and halfboots gradually he set his trap with the men voorhees had raked from the slums and when it was done smiled to himself as he thought it over he ceased to regret the miscarriage of last nights plan for it had served to goad his enemies to the point he desired to the point where they would rush to their own undoing he thought with satisfaction of the role he would play in the united states press when the sensational news of this nights adventure came out a court official who dared to do his duty despite a lawless mob a receiver who turned a midnight attack into a rout and shambles that is what they would say what if he did exceed his authority thereafter what if there were a scandal who would question as to soldiers no decidedly no he wished no help of soldiers at this time the sight of a ship in the offing towards dark caused him some uneasiness for notwithstanding the assurance that the course of justice in the san francisco courts had been clogged he knew bill wheaton to be a resourceful lawyer and a determined man therefore it relieved him to note the rising gale which precluded the possibility of interference from that source let them come tomorrow if they would by that time some of the mines would be ownerless and his position strengthened a hundredfold he telephoned the mines to throw out guards although he reasoned that none but madmen would think of striking there in the face of the warning which he knew must have been transmitted through helen putting on his raincoat he sought stillman bring your niece over to my place tonight theres trouble in the air and im prepared for it she hasnt returned from her ride yet im afraid shes caught in the storm the judge gazed anxiously into the darkness during all the long day the vigilantes lay in hiding impatient at their idleness and wondering at the lack of effort made towards their discovery not dreaming that mcnamara had more cleverly hidden plans behind when cherrys note of warning came they gathered in the back room and gave voice to their opinions theres only one way to clear the atmosphere said the chairman you bet chorussed the others theyve garrisoned the mines so lets go through the town and make a clean job of it lets hang the whole outfit to one post this met with general approval glenister alone demurring said he i have reasoned it out differently and i want you to hear me through before deciding last night i got word from wheaton that the california courts are against us he attributes it to influence but whatever the reason we are cut off from all legal help either in this court or on appeal now suppose we lynch these officials tonight what do we gain martial law in two hours our mines tied up for another year and who knows what else maybe a corrupter court next season suppose on the other hand we fail and somehow i feel that we will for that boss is no fool what then those of us who dont find the morgue will end in jail you say we cant meet the soldiers i say we can and must we must carry this row to them we must jump it past the courts of alaska past the courts of california and up to the white house where theres one honest man at least we must do something to wake up the men in washington we must get out of politics for mcnamara can beat us there although hes a strong man he cant corrupt the president we have one shot left and it must reach the potomac when uncle sam takes a hand well get a square deal so i say let us strike at the midas tonight and take her if we can some of us will go down but what of it following this harangue he outlined a plan which in its unique daring took away their breaths and as he filled in detail after detail they brightened with excitement and that love of the long chance which makes gamblers of those who thread the silent valleys or tread the edge of things his boldness stirred them and enthusiasm did the rest all i want for myself he said is the chance to run the big risk its mine by right dextry spoke breathlessly to slapjack in the pause which ensued aint he a heller well go you the miners chimed to a man and the chairman added lets have glenister lead this forlorn hope i am willing to stand or fall on his judgment they acquiesced without a dissenting voice and with the firm hands of a natural leader the young man took control lets hurry up said one its a long mush and the mud is kneedeep no walking for us said roy well go by train by train how can we get a train steal it he answered at which dextry grinned delightedly at his loosejointed companion and slapjack showed his toothless gums in answer saying he sure is a few more words and glenister accompanied by these two slipped out into the whirling storm and a halfhour later the rest followed one by one the vigilantes left the blackness blotting them up an armslength from the door till at last the big bleak warehouse echoed hollowly to the voice of the wind and water over in the eastern end of town behind dark windows upon which the sheeted rain beat furiously other armed men lay patiently waiting waiting some word from the bulky shadow which stood with folded arms close against a square of gray while over their heads a wretched old man paced back and forth wringing his hands pausing at every turn to peer out into the night and to mumble the name of his sisters child chapter xix dynamite early in the evening cherry malotte opened her door to find the bronco kid on her step he entered and threw off his rubber coat knowing him well she waited for his disclosure of his errand his sallow skin was without trace of color his eyes were strangely tired deep lines had gathered about his lips while his hands kept up constant little nervous explorations as though for days and nights he had not slept and now hovered on the verge of some hysteria he gave her the impression of a smouldering mine with the fire eating close up to the powder she judged that his body had been racked by every passion till now it hung jaded and weary yielding only to the spur of his restless revengeful spirit after a few objectless remarks he began abruptly do you love roy glenister his voice like his manner was jealously eager and he watched her carefully as she replied without quibble or deceit yes kid and i always shall he is the only true man i have ever known and im not ashamed of my feelings for a long time he studied her and then broke into rapid speech allowing her no time for interruption ive held back and held back because im no talker i cant be in my business but this is my last chance and i want to put myself right with you ive loved you ever since the dawson days not in the way youd expect from a man of my sort perhaps but with the kind of love that a woman wants i never showed my hand for what was the use that man outheld me id have quit faro years back only i wouldnt leave this country as long as you were a part of it and up here im only a gambler fit for nothing else id made up my mind to let you have him till something happened a couple of months ago but now it cant go through ill have to down him it isnt concerning you im not a welcher no its a thing i cant talk about a thing thats made me into a wolf made me skulk and walk the alleys like a dago its put murder into my heart ive tried to assassinate him i tried it here last night but i was a gentleman once till the cards came he knows the answer now though and hes ready for me so one of us will go out like a candle when we meet i felt that i had to tell you before i cut him down or before he got me youre talking like a madman kid she replied and you mustnt turn against him now he has troubles enough i never knew you cared for me what a tangle it is to be sure you love me i love him he loves that girl and she loves a crook isnt that tragedy enough without your adding to it you come at a bad time too for im half insane theres something dreadful in the air tonight ill have to kill him the man muttered doggedly and plead or reason as she would she could get nothing from him except those words till at last she turned upon him fiercely you say you love me very well lets see if you do i know the kind of a man you are and i know what this feud will mean to him coming just at this time put it aside and ill marry you the gambler rose slowly to his feet you do love him dont you she bowed her face and he winced but continued i wouldnt make you my wife that way i didnt mean it that way at this she laughed bitterly oh i see of course not how foolish of me to expect it of a man like you i understand what you mean now and the bargain will stand just the same if that is what you came for i wanted to leave this life and be good to go away and start over and play the game square but i see its no use ill pay i know how relentless you are and the price is low enough you can have me and that marriage talk ill not speak of again ill stay what i am for his sake stop cried the kid youre wrong im not that kind of a sport his voice broke suddenly its vehemence shaking his slim body oh cherry i love you the way a man ought to love a woman its one of the two good things left in me and i want to take you away from here where we can both hide from the past where we can start new as you say you would marry me she asked in an hour and give my hearts blood for the privilege but i cant stop this thing not even if your own dear life hung upon it i must kill that man she approached him and laid her arms about his neck every line of her body pleading but he refused steadfastly while the sweat stood out upon his brow she begged theyre all against him kid hes fighting a hopeless fight he laid all he had at that girls feet and ill do the same for you the man growled savagely he got his reward he took all she had dont be a fool i guess i know youre a farodealer but you havent any right to talk like that about a good woman even to a bad one like me into his dark eyes slowly crept a hungry look and she felt him begin to tremble the least bit he undertook to speak paused wet his lips then carefully chose these words do you mean that he did not that she is a good girl absolutely he sat down weakly and passed a shaking hand over his face which had begun to twitch and jerk again as it had on that night when his vengeance was thwarted i may as well tell you that i know shes more than that shes honest and highprincipled i dont know why im saying this but it was on my mind and i was half distracted when you came shes in danger tonight though at this minute i dont dare to think of what may have happened for shes risked everything to make reparation to roy and his friends what shes gone to the sign of the sled alone with struve struve shouted the gambler leaping to his feet alone with struve on a night like this he shook her fiercely crying what for tell me quick she recounted the reasons for helens adventure while the mans face became terrible oh kid i am to blame for letting her go why did i do it im afraid afraid the sign of the sled belongs to struve and the fellow who runs it is a rogue the bronco looked at the clock his eyes bloodshot and dull like those of a goaded flymaddened bull its eight oclock now ten miles two hours too late what ails you she questioned baffled by his strange demeanor you called me the one woman just now and yet he swung towards her heavily shes my sister your sister oh i im glad im glad but dont stand there like a wooden man for youve work to do wake up cant you hear shes in peril her words whipped him out of his stupor so that he drew himself somewhat under control get into your coat hurry hurry my pony will take you there she snatched his garment from the chair and held it for him while the life ran back into his veins together they dashed out into the storm as she and roy had done and as he flung the saddle on the buckskin she said i understand it all now you heard the talk about her and glenister but its wrong i lied and schemed and intrigued against her but its over now i guess theres a little streak of good in me somewhere after all he spoke to her from the saddle its more than a streak cherry and youre my kind of people she smiled wanly back at him under the lanternlight thats lefthanded kid i dont want to be your kind i want to be his kind or your sisters kind upon leaving the rendezvous glenister and his two friends slunk through the night avoiding the life and lights of the town while the wind surged out of the voids to seaward driving its wet burden through their flapping slickers pelting their faces as though enraged at its failure to wash away the purposes written there their course brought them to a cabin at the western outskirts of the city where they paused long enough to adjust something beneath the brims of their hats past them ran the iron rails of the narrowgauged road which led out across the quaking tundra to the mountains and the mines upon this slender trail of steel there rolled one small ungainly teapot of an engine which daily creaked and clanked back and forth at a snails pace screaming and wailing its complaint of the two highloaded flatcars behind the ties beneath it were spiked to planks laid lengthwise over the semiliquid roadbed in places sagging beneath the surface till the humpbacked shortwaisted locomotive yawed and reeled and squealed like a drunken fishwife at night it panted wearily into the board station and there sighed and coughed and hissed away its fatigue as the coals died and the breath relaxed in its lungs early to bed and early to rise was perforce the motto of its grimy crew who lived near by tonight they were just retiring when stayed by a summons at their door the engineer opened it to admit what appeared to his astonished eyes to be a krupp cannon propelled by a man in yellowoiled clothes and white cotton mask this weapon assumed the proportions of a great oneeyed monster which stared with baleful fixity at his vitals giving him a cold and empty feeling away back beyond this cyclops of the sightless orb were two other strangers likewise equipped the fireman arose from his chair dropping an empty shoe with a thump but being of the west without cavil or waste of wind he stretched his hands above his head balancing on one foot to keep his unshod member from the damp floor he had unbuckled his belt and now loosened by the movement his overalls seemed bent on sinking floorward in an ecstasy of abashment at the intrusion whereupon with convulsive grip he hugged them to their duty one hand and foot still elevated as though in the grand hailingsign of some secret order the other man was new to the ways of the north so backed to the limit of his quarters laid both hands protectingly upon his middle and doubled up remarking fervidly dont point that damn thing at my stomach ha ha laughed the fireman with unnatural loudness have your joke boys this aint no joke said the foremost figure its breath bellying out the mask at its mouth sure it is insisted the shoeless one must be we aint got anything worth stealing get into your clothes and come along we wont hurt you the two obeyed and were taken to the sleeping engine and there instructed to produce a full head of steam in thirty minutes or suffer a premature taking off and a prompt elision from the realms of applied mechanics as stimulus to their efforts two of the men stood over them till the engine began to sob and sigh reluctantly through the gloom that curtained the cab they saw other dim forms materializing and climbing silently on to the cars behind then as the steamgauge touched the mark the word was given and the train rumbled out from its shelter its shrill plaint at curb and crossing whipped away and drowned in the storm slapjack remained in the cab gun in lap while dextry climbed back to glenister he found the young man in good spirits despite the discomfort of his exposed position and striving to light his pipe behind the shelter of his coat is the dynamite aboard the old man questioned sure enough to ballast a battleship as the train crept out of the camp and across the river bridge its only light or glimmer the sparks that were snatched and harried by the blast the partners seated themselves on the powder cases and conversed guardedly while about them sounded the low murmur of the men who risked their all upon this cry to duty who staked their lives and futures upon this hazard of the hills because they thought it right weve made a good fight whether we win or lose tonight said dextry roy replied my fight is made and won what does that mean my hardest battle had nothing to do with the midas or the mines of anvil i fought and conquered myself awful wet night for philosophy the first remarked its apt to sour on you like milk in a thunderstorm spose you put overalls an gum boots on some of them boston ideas an lead em out where i can look em over an find out what theyre up to i mean that i was a savage till i met helen chester and she made a man of me it took sixty days but i think she did a good job i love the wild things just as much as ever but ive learned that there are duties a fellow owes to himself and to other people if hell only stop and think them out ive found out too that the right thing is usually the hardest to do oh ive improved a lot gee but youre popular with yourself i dont see as it helps your looks any youre as homely as ever an what good does it do you after all shell marry that big guy i know thats what rankles for hes no more worthy of her than i am shell do whats right however you may depend upon that and perhaps shell change him the way she did me why she worked a miracle in my attitude towards life my manner oh your manners are good enough as they lay interrupted the other you never did eat with your knife i dont believe in harakiri glenister laughed no when it comes to intimacies with decorum youre right on the job along with any of them easterners i watched you close at them frisco hotels last winter and say you know as much as a horse why you was wise to them tablewares and pickleforks equal to a headwaiter and it give me confidence just to be with you i remember putting milk and sugar in my consomme the first time it was pale and in a cup and looked like tea but not you no sir you savvied plenty and squeezed a lemon into yours to clean your fingers i reckon roy slapped his partners wet back for he was buoyant and elated the sense of nearing danger pulsed through him like wine that wasnt just what i meant but it goes say if we win back our mine well hit for new york next eh no i dont aim to mingle with no higher civilization than i got in frisco i use that word higher like it was applied to meat not that i wouldnt seem apropos im stylish enough for fifth avenue or anywheres but i like the west speakin of modes an styles when i get all lit up in that gray woosted suit of mine i guess i make the jaded sightseers set up an take notice eh somethin doin every minute in the cranin of necks what nothin gaudy but the acme of neatness an form as the feller said who sold it to me their common peril brought the friends together again into that close bond which had been theirs without interruption until this recent change in the younger had led him to choose paths at variance with the old mans ideas and now they spoke heart to heart in the halfserious halfjesting ways of old while beneath each whimsical irony was that mutual love and understanding which had consecrated their partnership arriving at the end of the road the vigilantes debouched and went into the darkness of the canon behind their leader to whom the trails were familiar he bade them pause finally and gave his last instructions they are on the alert so you want to be careful divide into two parties and close in from both sides creeping as near to the pickets as possible without discovery remember to wait for the last blast when it comes cut loose and charge like sioux dont shoot to kill at first for theyre only soldiers and under orders but if they stand well every man must do his work dextry appealed to the dim figures forming the circle i leave it to you gents if it aint better for me to go inside than for the boy ive had more experience with giant powder an im so blamed used up an near gone it wouldnt hurt if they did get me while hes right in his prime glenister stopped him i wont yield the privilege come now to your places men they melted away to each side while the old prospector paused to wring his partners hand id ruther it was me lad but if they get you god help em he stumbled after the departing shadows leaving roy alone with his naked fingers glenister ripped open the powder cases and secreted the contents upon his person each cartridge held dynamite enough to devastate a village and he loaded them inside his pockets inside his shirt and everywhere that he had room till he was burdened and cased in an armor onehundredth part of which could have blown him from the face of the earth so utterly as to leave no trace except perhaps a pit ripped out of the mountainside he looked to his fuses and saw that they were wrapped in oiled paper then placed them in his hat having finished he set out walking with difficulty under the weight he carried that his choice of location had been well made was evidenced by the fact that the ground beneath his feet sloped away to a basin out of which bubbled a spring it furnished the drinking supply of the midas and he knew every inch of the crevice it had worn down the mountain so felt his way cautiously along at the bottom of the hill where it ran out upon the level it had worn a considerable ditch through the soil and into this he crawled on hands and knees his bulging clothes handicapped him so that his gait was slow and awkward while the rain had swelled the streamlet till it trickled over his calves and up to his wrists chilling him so that his muscles cramped and his very bones cried out with it the sharp schist cut into his palms till they were shredded and bleeding while his knees found every jagged bit of bedrock over which he dragged himself he could not see an armslength ahead without rising and having removed his slicker for greater freedom of movement the rain beat upon his back till he was soaked and sodden and felt streamlets cleaving downward between his ribs now and again he squatted upon his haunches straining his eyes to either side the banks were barely high enough to shield him at last he came to a bridge of planks spanning the ditch and was about to rear himself for another look when he suddenly flattened into the stream bed half damming the waters with his body it was for this he had so carefully wrapped his fuses a man passed over him so close above that he might have touched him the sentry paused a few paces beyond and accosted another then retraced his steps over the bridge evidently this was the picketline so roy wormed his way forward till he saw the blacker blackness of the mine buildings then drew himself dripping out from the bank he had run the gauntlet safely since evicting the owners the receiver had erected substantial houses in place of the tents he had found on the mine they were of frame and corrugatediron sheathed within and suited to withstand a moderate exposure the partners had witnessed the operation from a distance but knew nothing about the buildings from close examination a thrill of affection for this place wanned the young man he loved this old mine it had realized the dream of his boyhood and had answered the hope he had clung to during his long fight against the northland it had come to him when he was disheartened bringing cheer and happiness and had yielded itself like a bride now it seemed a crime to ravage it he crept towards the nearest wall and listened within was the sound of voices though the windows were dark showing that the inhabitants were on the alert beneath the foundations he made mysterious preparations then sought out the office building and cookhouse doing likewise he found that back of the seeming repose of the midas there was a strained expectancy although suspense had lengthened the time out of all calculation he judged he had been gone from his companions at least an hour and that they must be in place by now if they were not if anything failed at this eleventh hour well those were the fortunes of war in every enterprise however carefully planned there comes a time when chance must take its turn he made his way inside the blacksmithshop and fumbled for a match just as he was about to strike it he heard the swish of oiled clothes passing and waited for some time then igniting his punk and hiding it under his coat he opened the door to listen the wind had died down now and the rain sang musically upon the metal roofs he ran swiftly from house to house and when he had done at the apices of the triangle he had traced three glowing coals were sputtering the final bolt was launched at last he stepped down into the ditch and drew his while to his tautened senses it seemed that the very hills leaned forth in breathless pause that the rain had ceased and the whole night hushed its thousand voices he found his lower jaw set so stiffly that the muscles ached levelling his weapon at the eaves of the bunkhouse he pulled trigger rapidly the bang bang bang six times repeated sounding dull and dead beneath the blanket of mist that overhung a shout sounded behind him and then the shriek of a winchester ball close over his head he turned in time to see another shot stream out of the darkness where a sentry was firing at the flash of his gun then bent himself double and plunged down the ditch with the first impact overhead the men poured forth from their quarters armed and bristling to be greeted by a volley of gunshots the thud of bullets and the dwindling whine of spent lead they leaped from shelter to find themselves girt with a fitful hoop of fire for the stranglers had spread in the arc of a circle and now emptied their rifles towards the centre the defenders however maintained surprising order considering the suddenness of their attack and ran to join the sentries whose positions could be determined by the nearer flashes the voice of a man in authority shouted loud commands no demonstration came from the outer voids nothing but the wicked streaks that stabbed the darkness then suddenly behind mcnamaras men the night glared luridly as though a great furnacedoor had opened and then clanged shut while with it came a hoarse thudding roar that silenced the rifle play they saw the cookhouse disrupt itself and disintegrate into a thousand flying timbers and twisted sheets of tin which soared upward and outward over their heads and into the night as the rocking hills ceased echoing the sound of the vigilantes rifles recurred like the cracking of dry sticks then everywhere about the defenders the earth was lashed by falling debris while the iron roofs rang at the fusillade the blast had come at their very elbows and they were too dazed and shaken by it to grasp its significance then before they could realize what it boded the depths lit up again till the raindrops were outlined distinct and glistening like a gossamer veil of silver while the office building to their left was ripped and rended and the adjoining walls leaped out into sudden relief their shattered windows looking like ghostly sightless eyes the curtain of darkness closed heavier than velvet and the men cowered in their tracks shielding themselves behind the nearest objects or behind one anothers bodies waiting for the sky to vomit over them its rain of missiles their backs were to the vigilantes now their faces to the centre many had dropped their rifles the thunder of hoofs and the scream of terrified horses came from the stables the cry of a maddened beast is weird and calculated to curdle the blood at best but with it arose a human voice shrieking from pain and fear of death a wrenched and doubled mass of zinc had hurtled out of the heavens and struck some one down the choking hoarseness of the mans appeal told the story and those about him broke into flight to escape what might follow to escape this danger they could not see but which swooped out of the blackness above and against which there was no defence they fled only to witness another and greater light behind them by which they saw themselves running falling grovelling this time they were hurled from their balance by a concussion which dwarfed the two preceding ones some few stood still staring at the rolling smokebank as it was revealed by the explosion their eyes gleaming white while others buried their faces in their hollowed arms as if to shut out the hellish glare or to shield themselves from a blow out in the heart of the chaos rang a voice loud and clear beware the next blast at the same instant the girdle of sharpshooters rose up smiting the air with their cries and charged in like madmen through the rain of detritus they fired as they came but it was unnecessary for there was no longer a fight it was a rout the defenders feeling they had escaped destruction only by a happy chance in leaving the bunkhouse the instant they did were not minded to tarry here where the heavens fell upon their heads to augment their consternation the horses had broken from their stalls and were plunging through the confusion fear swept over the men blind unreasoning contagious and they rushed out into the night colliding with their enemies overrunning them in the panic to quit this spot some dashed off the bluff and fell among the pits and sluices others ran up the mountainside and cowered in the brush like quail as the stranglers assembled their prisoners near the ruins they heard wounded men moaning in the darkness so lit torches and searched out the stricken ones glenister came running through the smoke pall revolver in hand crying has any one seen mcnamara no one had and when they were later assembled to take stock of their injuries he was greeted by dextrys gleeful announcement thats the deuce of a fight we aint got so much as a cold sore among us we have captured fourteen another announced and there may be more out yonder in the brush glenister noted with growing surprise that not one of the prisoners lined up beneath the glaring torches wore the army blue they were miners all or thugs and ruffians gathered from the camp where he wondered were the soldiers didnt you have troops from the barracks to help you he asked not a troop we havent seen a soldier since we went to work at this the young leader became alarmed had this whole attack miscarried had this been no clash with the united states forces after all if so the news would never reach washington and instead of accomplishing his end he and his friends had thrust themselves into the realms of outlawry where the soldiers could be employed against them with impunity where prices would rest upon their heads innocent blood had been shed court property destroyed mcnamara had them where he wanted them at last they were at bay the unwounded prisoners were taken to the boundaries of the midas and released with such warnings as the imagination of dextry could conjure up then glenister assembled his men speaking to them plainly boys this is no victory in fact were worse off than we were before and our biggest fight is coming theres a chance to get away now before daylight and before were recognized but if were seen here at sunup well have to stay and fight soldiers will be sent against us but if we hold out and the struggle is fierce enough it may reach to washington this will be a different kind of fighting now though it will be warfare pure and simple how many of you will stick all of us said they in unison and accordingly preparations for a siege were begun barricades were built ruins removed buildings transformed into blockhouses and all through the turbulent night the tired men labored till ready to drop led always by the young giant who seemed without fatigue it was perhaps four hours after midnight when a man sought him out somebodys callin you on the assay office telephone says its life or death glenister hurried to the building which had escaped the shock of the explosions and taking down the receiver was answered by cherry malotte thank god youre safe she began the men have just come in and the whole town is awake over the riot they say youve killed ten people in the fight is it true he explained to her briefly that all was well but she broke in wait wait mcnamara has called for troops and youll all be shot oh what a terrible night it has been i havent been to bed im going mad now listen carefully yesterday helen went with struve to the sign of the sled and she hasnt come back the man at the end of the wire cried out at this then choked back his words to hear what followed his free hand began making strange futile motions as though he traced patterns in the air i cant raise the roadhouse on the wire and something dreadful has happened i know what made her go he shouted to save you came cherrys faint reply if you love her ride fast to the sign of the sled or youll be too late the bronco kid has gone there at that name roy crashed the instrument to its hook and burst out of the shanty calling loudly to his men whats up where are you going to the sign of the sled he panted weve stood by you glenister and you cant quit us like this said one angrily the trail to town is good and well take it if you do roy saw they feared he was deserting feared that he had heard some alarming rumor of which they did not know well let the mine go boys for i cant ask you to do what i refuse to do myself and

fighting here i dont ask you to stay till i come back it wouldnt be square and youd better go while you have a chance as for me i gave up the old claim once i can do it again he swung himself to the horses back settled into the saddle and rode out through the lane of belted men chapter xx in which three go to the sign of the sled and but two return as helen and her companion ascended the mountain scarred and swept by the tempest of the previous night they heard far below the swollen torrent brawling in its bowlderridden bed while behind them the angry ocean spread southward to a bloodred horizon ahead the bleak mountains brooded over forbidding valleys to the west a suffused sun glared sullenly painting the highpiled clouds with the gorgeous hues of a stormy sunset to helen the wild scene seemed dyed with the colors of flame and blood and steel that rain raised the deuce with the trails said struve as they picked their way past an unsightly slip whence a part of the overhanging mountain loosened by the deluge had slid into the gulch another storm like that would wash out these roads completely even in the daylight it was no easy task to avoid these danger spots for the horses floundered on the muddy soil vaguely the girl wondered how she would find her way back in the darkness as she had planned she said little as they approached the roadhouse for the thoughts within her brain had begun to clamor too wildly but struve more arrogant than ever before more terrifyingly sure of himself was loudly garrulous as they drew nearer and nearer the dread that possessed the girl became of paralyzing intensity if she should fail but she vowed she would not could not fail they rounded a bend and saw the sign of the sled cradled below them where the trail dipped to a stream which tumbled from the comb above into the river twisting like a silver thread through the distant valley a peeled flagpole topped by a spruce bough stood in front of the tavern while over the door hung a sled suspended from a beam the house itself was a quaint structure rambling and amorphous from whose sod roof sprang blooming flowers and whose highbanked walls were pierced here and there with sleepy windows it had been built by a homesick foreigner of unknown nationality whom the army of mushers who paid for his clean and orderly hospitality had dubbed duly and as a matter of course a swede when travel had changed to the river trail leaving the house lonesome and high as though left by a receding wave struve had taken it over on a debt and now ran it for the convenience of a slender traffic mainly stampeders who chose the higher route towards the interior his hireling spent the idle hours in prospecting a hungry quartz lead and in doing assessment work on nearby claims shortz took the horses and answered his employers questions curtly flashing a curious look at helen under other conditions the girl would have been delighted with the place for this was the quaintest spot she had found in the north country the main room held bar and goldscales a rude table and a huge iron heater while its walls and ceiling were sheeted with white cloth so cunningly stitched and tacked that it seemed a cavern hollowed from chalk it was filled with trophies of the hills stuffed birds and animals skins and antlers from which depended in careless confusion dog harness snowshoes guns and articles of clothing a door to the left led into the bunkroom where travellers had been wont to sleep in tiers three deep to the rear was a kitchen and cache to the right a compartment which struve called the art gallery here free reign had been allowed the original owners artistic fancies and he had covered the place with pictures clipped from gazettes of questionable repute till it was a bewildering arrangement of pink ladies in tights pugilists in scanty trunks prize bulldogs and other less moral characters of the sporting world this is probably the worst company you were ever in struve observed to helen with a forced attempt at lightness are there no guests here she asked him her anxiety very near the surface travel is light at this time of the year theyll come in later perhaps a fire was burning in this pink room where the landlord had begun spreading the table for two and its warmth was grateful to the girl her companion thoroughly at his ease stretched himself on a furcovered couch and smoked let me see the papers now mr struve she began but he put her off no not now business must wait on our dinner dont spoil our little party for theres time enough and to spare she arose and went to the window unable to sit still looking down the narrow gulch she saw that the mountains beyond were indistinct for it was growing dark rapidly dense clouds had rolled up from the east a raindrop struck the glass before her eyes then another and another and the hills grew misty behind the coming shower a traveller with a pack on his back hurried around the corner of the building and past her to the door at his knock struve who had been watching helen through halfshut eyes arose and went into the other room thank heaven some one has come she thought the voices were deadened to a hum by the sod walls till that of the stranger raised itself in such indignant protest that she distinguished his words oh ive got money to pay my way im no deadhead shortz mumbled something back i dont care if you are closed im tired and theres a storm coming this time she heard the landlords refusal and the miners angry profanity a moment later she saw the traveller plodding up the trail towards town what does that mean she inquired as the lawyer reentered oh that fellow is a tough and shortz wouldnt let him in hes careful whom he entertains there are so many bad men roaming the hills the german came in shortly to light the lamp and although she asked no further questions helens uneasiness increased she half listened to the stories with which struve tried to entertain her and ate little of the excellent meal that was shortly served to them struve meanwhile ate and drank almost greedily and the shadowy sinister evening crept along a strange cowardice had suddenly overtaken the girl and if at this late hour she could have withdrawn she would have done so gladly and gone forth to meet the violence of the tempest but she had gone too far for retreat and realizing that for the present apparent compliance was her wisest resource she sat quiet answering the man with cool words while his eyes grew brighter his skin more flushed his speech more rapid he talked incessantly and with feverish gayety smoking numberless cigarettes and apparently unconscious of the flight of time at last he broke off suddenly and consulted his watch while helen remembered that she had not heard shortz in the kitchen for a long time suddenly struve smiled on her peculiarly with confident cunning as he leered at her over the disorder between them he took from his pocket a flat bundle which he tossed to her now for the bargain eh ask the man to remove these dishes she said as she undid the parcel with clumsy fingers i sent him away two hours ago said struve arising as if to come to her she shrank back but he only leaned across gathered up the four corners of the tablecloth and twisting them together carried the whole thing out the dishes crashing and jangling as he threw his burden recklessly into the kitchen then he returned and stood with his back to the stove staring at her while she perused the contents of the papers which were more voluminous than she had supposed for a long time the girl pored over the documents the purport of the papers was only too obvious and as she read the proof of her uncles guilt stood out clear and damning there was no possibility of mistake the whole wretched plot stood out plain its darkest infamies revealed in spite of the cruelty of her disillusionment helen was nevertheless exalted with the fierce ecstasy of power with the knowledge that justice would at last be rendered it would be her triumph and her expiation that she who had been the unwitting tool of this miserable clique would be the one through whom restitution was made she arose with her eyes gleaming and her lips set it is here of course it is enough to convict us all it means the penitentiary for your precious uncle and your lover he stretched his chin upward at the mention as though to free his throat from an invisible clutch yes your lover particularly for hes the real one thats why i brought you here hell marry you but ill be the best man the timbre of his voice was unpleasant come let us go she said go he chuckled mirthlessly thats a fine example of unconscious humor what do you mean well first no human being could find his way down to the coast in this tempest second but bytheway let me explain something in those papers while i think of it he spoke casually and stepped forward reaching for the package which she was about to give up when something prompted her to snatch it behind her back and it was well she did for his hand was but a few inches away he was no match for her quickness however and she glided around the table thrusting the papers into the front of her dress the sudden contact with cherrys revolver gave her a certain comfort she spoke now with determination i intend to leave here at once will you bring my horse very well i shall do it myself she turned but his indolence vanished like a flash and springing in front of the door he barred her way hold on my lady you ought to understand without my saying any more why did i bring you here why did i plan this little party why did i send that man away just to give you the proof of my complicity in a crime i suppose well hardly you wont leave here tonight and when you do you wont carry those papers my own safety depends on that and i am selfish so dont get me started listen they caught the wail of the night crying as though hungry for sacrifice no youll stay here and he broke off abruptly for helen had stepped to the telephone and taken down the receiver he leaped snatched it from her and then tearing the instrument loose from the wall raised it above his head dashed it upon the floor and sprang towards her but she wrenched herself free and fled across the room the mans white hair was wildly tumbled his face was purple and his neck and throat showed swollen throbbing veins he stood still however and his lips cracked into his everpresent cautious smile now dont lets fight about this its no use for ive played to win you have your proof now ill have my price or else ill take it think over which it will be while i lock up far down the mountainside a man was urging a broken pony recklessly along the trail the beast was blown and spent its knees weak and bending yet the rider forced it as though behind him yelled a thousand devils spurring headlong through gully and ford up steep slopes and down invisible ravines sometimes the animal stumbled and fell with its master sometimes they arose together but the man was heedless of all except his haste insensible to the rain which smote him blindingly and to the wind which seized him savagely upon the ridges or gasped at him in the gullies with exhausted malice at last he gained the plateau and saw the roadhouse light beneath so drove his heels into the flanks of the windbroken creature which lunged forward gamely he felt the pony rear and drop away beneath him pawing and scrambling and instinctively kicked his feet free from the stirrups striving to throw himself out of the saddle and clear of the thrashing hoofs it seemed that he turned over in the air before something smote him and he lay still his gaunt dark face upturned to the rain while about him the storm screamed exultantly the moment struve disappeared into the outer room helen darted to the window it was merely a single sash nailed fast and immovable but seizing one of the little stools beside the stove she thrust it through the glass letting in a smother of wind and water before she could escape struve bounded into the room his face livid with anger his voice hoarse and furious but as he began to denounce her he paused in amazement for the girl had drawn cherrys weapon and levelled it at him she was very pale and her breast heaved as from a swift run while her wondrous gray eyes were lit with a light no man had ever seen there before glowing like two jewels whose hearts contained the pentup passion of centuries she had altered as though under the deft hand of a mastersculptor her nostrils growing thin and arched her lips tight pressed and pitiless her head poised proudly the rain drove in through the shattered window over and past her while the cheap red curtain lashed and whipped her as though in gleeful applause her bitter abhorrence of the man made her voice sound strangely unnatural as she commanded dont dare to stop me she moved towards the door motioning him to retreat before her and he obeyed recognizing the danger of her coolness she did not note the calculating treachery of his glance however nor fathom the purposes he had in mind out on the rainswept mountain the prostrate rider had regained his senses and now was crawling painfully towards the roadhouse seen through the dark he would have resembled some misshapen creeping monster for he dragged himself reptilelike close to the ground but as he came closer the man heard a cry which the wind seemed guarding from his ear and hearing it he rose and rushed blindly forward staggering like a wounded beast helen watched her captive closely as he backed through the door before her for she dared not lose sight of him until free the middle room was lighted by a glass lamp on the bar and its rays showed that the frontdoor was secured by a large iron bolt she thanked heaven there was no lock and key struve had retreated until his back was to the counter offering no word making no move but the darting brightness of his eyes showed that he was alert and planning but when the door behind helen urged by the wind through the broken casement banged to the man made his first lightninglike sign he dashed the lamp to the floor where it burst like an eggshell and darkness leaped into the room as an animal pounces had she been calmer or had time for an instants thought helen would have hastened back to the light but she was midway to her liberty and actuated by the sole desire to break out into the open air so plunged forward without warning she was hurled from her feet by a body which came out of the darkness upon her she fired the little gun but struves arms closed about her the weapon was wrenched from her hand and she found herself fighting against him breast to breast with the fury of desperation his wineburdened breath beat into her face and she felt herself bound to him as though by hoops while the touch of his cheek against hers turned her into a terrified insensate animal which fought with every ounce of its strength and every nerve of its body she screamed once but it was not like the cry of a woman then the struggle went on in silence and utter blackness strove holding her like a gorilla till she grew faint and her head began to whirl while darting lights drove past her eyes and there was the roar of a cataract in her ears she was a strong girl and her ripe young body untried until this moment answered in every fibre so that she wrestled with almost a mans strength and he had hard shift to hold her but so violent an encounter could not last helen felt herself drifting free from the earth and losing grip of all things tangible when at last they tripped and fell against the inner door this gave way and at the same moment the mans strength departed as though it were a thing of darkness and dared not face the light that streamed over them she tore herself from his clutch and staggered into the supperroom her loosened hair falling in a gleaming torrent about her shoulders while he arose from his knees and came towards her again gasping ill show you whos master here then he ceased abruptly cringingly and threw up an arm before his face as if to ward off a blow framed in the window was the pallid visage of a man the air rocked the lamp flared and struve whirled completely around falling back against the wall his eyes filled with horror and shifted down where his hand had clutched at his breast plucking at one spot as if tearing a barb from his bosom he jerked his head towards the door at his elbow in quest of a retreat a shudder ran over him his knees buckled and he plunged forward upon his face his arm still doubled under him it had happened like a flash of light and although helen felt rather than heard the shot and saw her assailant fall she did not realize the meaning of it till a drift of powder smoke assailed her nostrils even so she experienced no shock nor horror of the sight on the contrary a savage joy at the spectacle seized her and she stood still leaning slightly forward staring at it almost gloatingly stood so till she heard her name called helen little sister and turning saw her brother in the window that which he witnessed in her face he had seen before in the faces of men locked close with a hateful death and from whom all but the most elemental passions had departed but he had never seen a woman bear the marks till now no artifice nor falsity was there nothing but the crudest intensest feeling which many people live and die without knowing there are few who come to know the great primitive passionate longings but in this black night fighting in defence of her most sacred self this girls nature had been stripped to its purely savage elements as glenister had predicted helen at last had felt and yielded to irresistibly powerful impulse glancing backward at the creature sprawled by the door helen went to her brother put her arms about his neck and kissed him hes dead the kid asked her she nodded and tried to speak but began to shiver and sob instead unlock the door he begged her im hurt and i must get in when the kid had hobbled into the room she pressed him to her and stroked his matted head regardless of his muddy soaking garments i must look at him he may not be badly hurt said the kid dont touch him she followed nevertheless and stood near by while her brother examined his victim struve was breathing and discovering this the others lifted him with difficulty to the couch something cracked in here ribs i guess the kid remarked gasping and feeling his own side he was weak and pale and the girl led him into the bunkroom where he could lie down only his wonderful determination had sustained him thus far and now the knowledge of his helplessness served to prevent helens collapse the kid would not hear of her going for help till the storm abated or daylight came insisting that the trails were too treacherous and that no time could be saved by doing so thus they waited for the dawn at last they heard the wounded man faintly calling he spoke to helen hoarsely there was no malice only fear in his tones i said this was my madness and i got what i deserved but im going to die o god im going to die and im afraid he moaned till the bronco kid hobbled in glaring with unquenched hatred yes youre going to die and i did it be game cant you i shant let her go for help until daylight helen forced her brother back to his couch and returned to help the wounded man who grew incoherent and began to babble a little later when the kid seemed stronger and his head clearer helen ventured to tell him of their uncles villany and of the proof she held with her hope of restoring justice she told him of the attack planned that very night and of the danger which threatened the miners he questioned her closely and realizing the bearing of her story crept to the door casting the wind like a hound well have to risk it said he the wind is almost gone and its not long till daylight she pleaded to go alone but he was firm ill never leave you again and moreover i know the lower trail quite well well go down the gulch to the valley and reach town that way its farther but its not so dangerous you cant ride she insisted i can if youll tie me into the saddle come get the horses it was still pitchy dark and the rain was pouring but the wind only sighed weakly as though tired by its violence when she helped the bronco into his saddle the effort wrenched a groan from him but he insisted upon her tying his feet beneath the horses belly saying that the trail was rough and he could take no chance of falling again so having performed the last services she might for struve she mounted her own animal and allowed it to pick its way down the steep descent behind her brother who swayed and lurched drunkenly in his seat gripping the horn before him with both hands they had been gone perhaps a halfhour when another horse plunged furiously out of the darkness and halted before the roadhouse door its rider mudstained and dishevelled flung himself in mad haste to the ground and bolted in through the door he saw the signs of confusion in the outer room chairs upset and broken the table wedged against the stove and before the counter a shattered lamp in a pool of oil he called loudly but receiving no answer snatched a light which he found burning and ran to the door at his left nothing greeted him but the empty tiers of bunks turning he crossed to the other side and burst through another lamp was lighted beside the couch where struve lay breathing heavily his lids half closed over his staring eyes roy noted the pool of blood at his feet and the broken window then setting down his lamp he leaned over the man and spoke to him when he received no answer he spoke again loudly then in a frenzy glenister shook the wounded man cruelly so that he cried out in terror im dying oh im dying roy raised the sick man up and thrust his own face before his eyes this is glenister ive come for helen where is she a spark of recognition flickered into the dull stare youre too late im dying and im afraid his questioner shook struve again where is she he repeated time after time till by very force of his own insistence he compelled realization in the sufferer the kid took her away the kid shot me and then his voice rose till it flooded the room with terror the kid shot me and im dying he coughed blood to his lips at which roy laid him back and stood up so there was no mistake after all and he had arrived too late this was the kids revenge this was how he struck lacking courage to face a mans level eyes he possessed the foulness to prey upon a woman roy felt a weakening physical sickness sweep over him till his eye fell upon a sodden garment which helen had removed from her brothers shoulders and replaced with a dry one he snatched it from the floor and in a sudden fury felt it come apart in his hands like wet tissuepaper he found himself out in the rain scanning the trampled soil by light of his lamp and discerned tracks which the drizzle had not yet erased he reasoned mechanically that the two riders could have no great start of him so strode out beyond the house to see if they had gone farther into the hills there were no tracks here therefore they must have doubled back towards town it did not occur to him that they might have left the beaten path and followed down the little creek to the river but replacing the light where he had found it he remounted and lashed his horse into a stiff canter up towards the divide that lay between him and the city the story was growing plainer to him though as yet he could not piece it all together its possibilities stabbed him with such horror that he cried out aloud and beat his steed into faster time with both hands and feet to think of those two ruffians fighting over this girl as though she were the spoils of pillage he must overtake the kid he would the possibility that he might not threw him into such ungovernable mental chaos that he was forced to calm himself men went mad that way he could not think of it that gasping creature in the roadhouse spoke all too well of the broncos determination and yet who of those who had known the kid in the past would dream that his vileness was so utter as this away to the right hidden among the shadowed hills his friends rested themselves for the coming battle waiting impatiently his return and timing it to the rising sun down in the valley to his left were the two he followed while he obsessed and unreasoning now cursing like a madman now grim and silent spurred southward towards town and into the ranks of his enemies chapter xxi the hammerlock day was breaking as glenister came down the mountain with the first light he halted to scan the trail and having no means of knowing that the fresh tracks he found were not those of the two riders he followed he urged his lathered horse ahead till he became suddenly conscious that he was very tired and had not slept for two days and nights the recollection did not reassure the young man for his body was a weapon which must not fail in the slightest measure now that there was work to do even the unwelcome speculation upon his physical handicap offered relief however from the agony which fed upon him whenever he thought of helen in the gamblers hands meanwhile the horse groaning at his masters violence plunged onward towards the roofs of nome now growing gray in the first dawn it seemed years since roy had seen the sunlight for this night burdened with suspense had been endlessly long his body was faint beneath the strain and yet he rode on and on tired dogged stony his eyes set towards the sea his mind a storm of formless whirling thoughts beneath which was an undeviating implacable determination he knew now that he had sacrificed all hope of the midas and likewise the hope of helen was gone in fact he began to realize dimly that from the beginning he had never had the possibility of winning her that she had never been destined for him and that his love for her had been sent as a light by which he was to find himself he had failed everywhere he had become an outlaw he had fought and gone down certain only of his rectitude and the mastery of his unruly spirit now the hour had come when he would perform his last mission deriving therefrom that satisfaction which the gods could not deny he would have his vengeance the scheme took form without conscious effort on his part and embraced two things the death of the gambler and a meeting with mcnamara of the former he had no more doubt than that the sun rising there would sink in the west so well confirmed was this belief that the details did not engage his thought but on the result of the other encounter he speculated with some interest from the first mcnamara had been a riddle to him and mystery breeds curiosity his blind instinctive hatred of the man had assumed the proportions of a mania but as to what the outcome would be when they met face to face fate alone could tell anyway mcnamara should never have helen roy believed his mission covered that point as well as her deliverance from the bronco kid when he had finished he would pay the price if he had the luck to escape he would go back to his hills and his solitude if he did not his future would be in the hands of his enemies he entered the silent streets unobserved for the mists were heavy and low smoke columns arose vertically in the still air the rain had ceased having beaten down the waves which rumbled against the beach filling the streets with their subdued thunder a ship anchored in the offing had run in from the lee of sledge island with the first lull while midway to the shore a tender was rising and falling its oars flashing like the silvered feelers of a sea insect crawling upon the surface of the ocean he rode down front street heedless of danger heedless of the comment his appearance might create and unseen entered his enemys stronghold he passed a gamblinghall through the windows of which came a sickly yellow gleam a man came out unsteadily and stared at the horseman then passed on glenisters plan was to go straight to the northern and from there to track down its owner relentlessly but in order to reach the place his course led him past the office of dunham struve this brought back to his mind the man dying out there ten miles at his back the scantiest humanity demanded that assistance be sent at once yet he dared not give word openly thus betraying his presence for it was necessary that he maintain his liberty during the next hour at all hazards he suddenly thought of an expedient and reined in his horse which stopped with widespread legs and dejected head while he dismounted and climbed the stairs to leave a note upon the door some one would see the message shortly and recognize its urgency in dressing for the battle at the midas on the previous night he had replaced his leather boots with mukluks which are waterproof light and pliable footgear made from the skin of seal and walrus he was thus able to move as noiselessly as though in moccasins finding neither pencil nor paper in his pocket he tried the outer door of the office to find it unlocked he stepped inside and listened then moved towards a table on which were writing materials but in doing so heard a rustle in struves private office evidently his soft soles had not disturbed the man inside roy was about to tiptoe out as he had come when the hidden man cleared his throat it is in these involuntary sounds that the voice retains its natural quality more distinctly even than in speaking a strange eagerness grew in glenisters face and he approached the partition stealthily it was of wood and glass the panes clouded and opaque to a height of some six feet but stepping upon a chair he peered into the room beyond a man knelt in a litter of papers before the open safe its drawers and compartments removed and their contents scattered the watcher lowered himself drew his gun and laid soft hand upon the doorknob turning the latch with firm fingers his vengeance had come to meet him after lying in wait during the long night certain that the vigilantes would spring his trap mcnamara was astounded at news of the battle at the midas and of glenisters success he stormed and cursed his men as cowards the judge became greatly exercised over this new development which coupled with his night of long anxiety reduced him to a pitiful hysteria theyll blow us up next great heavens dynamite oh that is barbarous for heavens sake get the soldiers out alec ay we can use them now thereupon mcnamara roused the commanding officer at the post and requested him to accoutre a troop and have them ready to march at daylight then bestirred the judge to start the wheels of his court and invoke this military aid in regular fashion make it all a matter of record he said we want to keep our skirts clear from now on but the townspeople are against us quavered stillman theyll tear us to pieces let em try once i get my hand on the ringleader the rest may riot and be damned although he had made less display than had the judge the receiver was no less deeply worried about helen of whom no news came his jealousy fanned to red heat by the discovery of her earlier defection was enhanced fourfold by the thought of this last adventure something told him there was treachery afoot and when she did not return at dawn he began to fear that she had cast in her lot with the rioters this aroused a perfect delirium of doubt and anger till he reasoned further that struve having gone with her must also be a traitor he recognized the menace in this fact knowing the mans venality so began to reckon carefully its significance what could struve do what proof had he mcnamara started and seizing his hat hurried straight to the lawyers office and let himself in with the key he carried it was light enough for him to decipher the characters on the safe lock as he turned the combination so he set to work scanning the endless bundles within hoping that after all the man had taken with him no incriminating evidence once the searcher paused at some fancied sound but when nothing came of it drew his revolver and laid it before him just inside the safe door and close beneath his hand continuing to run through the documents while his uneasiness increased he had been engaged so for some time when he heard the faintest creak at his back too slight to alarm and just sufficient to break his tension and cause him to jerk his head about framed in the open door stood roy glenister watching him mcnamaras astonishment was so genuine that he leaped to his feet faced about and prompted by a secretive instinct swung to the safe door as though to guard its contents he had acted upon the impulse before realizing that his weapon was inside and that now although the door was not locked it would require that one dangerous yes fatal second to open it the two men stared at each other for a time silent and malignant their glances meeting like blades in the older mans face a look of defiance in the youngers a dogged and grimpurposed enmity mcnamaras first perturbation left him calm alert dangerous whereas the continued contemplation of his enemy worked in glenister to destroy his composure and his purpose blazed forth unhidden he stood there unkempt and soiled the clean sweep of jaw and throat overgrown with a three days black stubble his hair wet and matted his whole left side foul with clay where he had fallen in the darkness a muddy red streak spread downward from a cut above his temple beneath his eyes were sagging folds while the flicker at his mouth corners betrayed the high nervous pitch to which he was keyed i have come for the last act mcnamara now well have it out man to man the politician shrugged his shoulders you have the drop on me i am unarmed at which the miners face lighted fiercely and he chuckled ah thats almost too good to be true i have dreamed about such a thing and i have been hungry to feel your throat since the first time i saw you its grown on me till shooting wouldnt satisfy me ever had the feeling well im going to choke the life out of you with my bare hands mcnamara squared himself i wouldnt advise you to try it i have lived longer than you and i was never beaten but i know the feeling you speak about i have it now his eyes roved rapidly up and down the others form noting the lean thighs and closedrawn belt which lent the appearance of spareness belied only by the neck and shoulders he had beaten better men and he reasoned that if it came to a physical test in these cramped quarters his own great weight would more than offset any superior agility the miner might possess the longer he looked the more he yielded to his hatred of the man before him and the more cruelly he longed to satisfy it take off your coat said glenister now turn around all right i just wanted to see if you were lying about your gun ill kill you cried mcnamara glenister laid his sixshooter upon the safe and slipped off his own wet garment the difference was more marked now and the advantage more strongly with the receiver though they had avoided allusion to it each knew that this fight had nothing to do with the midas and each realized whence sprang their fierce enmity and it was meet that they should come together thus it had been the one certain and logical event which they had felt inevitably approaching from long back and it was fitting moreover that they should fight alone and unwitnessed armed only with the weapons of the wilderness for they were both of the far free lands were both of the fighters type and had both warred for the first great prize they met ferociously mcnamara aimed a fearful blow but glenister met him squarely beating him off cleverly stepping in and out his arms swinging loosely from his shoulders like whalebone withes tipped with lead he moved lightly his footing made doubly secure by reason of his softsoled mukluks recognizing his opponents greater weight he undertook merely to stop the headlong rushes and remain out of reach as long as possible he struck the politician fairly in the mouth so that the mans head snapped back and his fists went wild then before the arms could grasp him the miner had broken ground and whipped another blow across but mcnamara was a boxer himself so covered and blocked it the politician spat through his mashed lips and rushed again sweeping his opponent from his feet again glenisters fist shot forward like a lump of granite but the other came on head down and the blow finished too high landing on the big mans brow a sudden darting agony paralyzed roys hand and he realized that he had broken the metacarpal bones and that henceforth it would be useless before he could recover mcnamara had passed under his extended arm and seized him by the middle then thrusting his left leg back of roys he whirled him from his balance flinging him clear and with resistless force it seemed that a fatal fall must follow but the youth squirmed catlike in the air landing with set muscles which rebounded like rubber even so the receiver was upon him before he could rise reaching for the young mans throat with his heavy hands roy recognized the fatal strangle hold and seizing his enemys wrists endeavored to tear them apart but his left hand was useless so with a mighty wrench he freed himself and locked in each others arms the men strained and swayed about the office till their neck veins were bursting their muscles paralyzed men may fight duels calmly may shoot or parry or thrust with cold deliberation but when there comes the jar of body to body the sweaty contact of skin to skin the play of iron muscles the painful gasp of exhaustion then the mind goes skittering back into its dark recesses while every venomous passion leaps forth from its hidingplace and joins in the horrid war they tripped across the floor crashing into the partition which split showering them with glass they fell and rolled in it then by consent wrenched themselves apart and rose eye to eye their jaws hanging their lungs wheezing their faces trickling blood and sweat roys left hand pained him excruciatingly while mcnamaras macerated lips had turned outward in a hideous pout they crouched so for an instant cruel bestial then clinched again the officefittings were wrecked utterly and the room became a litter of ruins the mens garments fell away till their breasts were bare and their arms swelled white and knotted through the rags they knew no pain their bodies were insensate mechanisms gradually the older mans face was beaten into a shapeless mass by the others cunning blows while glenisters every bone was wrenched and twisted under his enemys terrible onslaughts the miners chief effort it is true was to keep his feet and to break the mans embraces never had he encountered one whom he could not beat by sheer strength till he met this great snarling creature who worried him hither and yon as though he were a child time and again roy beat upon the mans face with the blows of a sledge no rules governed this solitary combat the men were deaf to all but the roaring in their ears blinded to all but hate insensible to everything but the blood mania their trampling feet caused the building to rumble and shake as though some monster were running amuck meanwhile a bareheaded man rushed out of the store beneath bumping into a pedestrian who had paused on the sidewalk and together they scurried up the stairs the dory which roy had seen at sea had shot the breakers and now its three passengers were tracking through the wet sand towards front street bill wheaton in the lead he was followed by two rawboned men who travelled without baggage the city was awakening with the sun which reared a copper rim out of the sea judge stillman and voorhees came down from the hotel and paused to gaze through the mists at a caravan of mule teams which trotted into the other end of the street with jingle and clank the wagons were blue with soldiers the early golden rays slanting from their krags and they were bound for the midas out of the fogs which clung so thickly to the tundra there came two other horses distorted and unreal on one a girl on the other a figure of pain and tragedy a grotesque creature that swayed stiffly to the motion of its steed its face writhed into lines of suffering its hands clutching cantle and horn it was as though fate with invisible touch were setting her stage for the last act of this play assembling the principals close to the golden sands where first they had made entrance the man and the girl came face to face with the judge and marshal who cried out upon seeing them but as they reined in out from the stairs beside them a man shot amid clatter and uproar give me a hand quick he shouted to them whats up inquired the marshal its murder mcnamara and glenister he dashed back up the steps behind voorhees the judge following while muffled cries came from above the gambler turned towards the three men who were hurrying from the beach and recognizing wheaton called to him untie my feet cut the ropes quick whats the trouble the lawyer asked but on hearing glenisters name bounded after the judge leaving one of his companions to free the rider they could hear the fight now and all crowded towards the door helen with her brother in spite of his warning to stay behind she never remembered how she climbed those stairs for she was borne along by that hypnotic power which drags one to behold a catastrophe in spite of his will reaching the room she stood appalled for the group she had joined watched two raging things that rushed at each other with inhuman cries ragged bleeding fighting on a carpet of debris every loose and breakable thing had been ground to splinters as though by iron slugs in a whirling cylinder to this day from dawson to the straits from unga to the arctics men tell of the combat wherever they foregather at flaring campfires or in dingy bunkhouses and although some scout the tale there are others who saw it and can swear to its truth these say that the encounter was like the battle of bull moose in the rutting season though more terrible averring that two men like these had never been known in the land since the days of vitus bering and his crew for their rancor had swollen till at feel of each others flesh they ran mad and felt superhuman strength it is true at any rate that neither was conscious of the filling room nor the cries of the crowd even when the marshal forced himself through the wedged door and fell upon the nearest which was glenister he came at an instant when the two had paused at armslength glaring with ragedrunken eyes gasping the labored breath back into their lungs with a fling of his long arms the young man hurled the intruder aside so violently that his head struck the iron safe and he collapsed insensible then without apparent notice of the interruption the fight went on it was seen during this respite that mcnamaras mouth was running water as though he were deathly sick while every retch brought forth a groan helen heard herself crying stop them stop them but no one seemed capable of interference she heard her brother muttering and his breath coming heavily like that of the fighters his body swaying in time to theirs the judge was ashy imbecile helpless mcnamaras distress was patent to his antagonist who advanced upon him with the hunger of promised victory but the young mans muscles obeyed his commands sluggishly his ribs seemed broken his back was weak and on the inner side of his legs the flesh was quivering as they came together the boss reached up his right hand and caught the miner by the face burying thumb and fingers crab like into his cheeks forcing his slack jaws apart thrusting his head backward while he centred every ounce of his strength in the effort to maim roy felt the flesh giving way and flung himself backward to break the hold whereupon the other summoned his wasting energy and plunged towards the safe where lay the revolver instinct warned glenister of treachery told him that the man had sought this last resource to save himself and as he saw him turn his back and reach for the weapon the youth leaped like a panther seizing him about the waist grasping mcnamaras wrist with his right hand for the first time during the combat they were not face to face and on the instant roy realized the advantage given him through the others perfidy realized the wrestlers hold that was his and knew that the moment of victory was come the telling takes much time but so quickly had these things happened that the footsteps of the soldiers had not yet reached the door when the men were locked beside the safe of what happened next many garbled accounts have gone forth for of all those present none but the bronco kid knew its significance and ever recounted the truth concerning it some claim that the younger man was seized with a fear of death which multiplied his enormous strength others that the power died in his adversary as reward for his treason but it was not so no sooner had roy encompassed mcnamaras waist from the rear than he slid his damaged hand up past the others chest and around the back of his neck thus bringing his own left arm close under his enemys left armpit wedging the receivers head forward while with his other hand he grasped the politicians right wrist close to the revolver thus holding him in a grasp which could not be broken now came the test the two bodies set themselves rocklike and rigid there was no lunging about calling up the final atom of his strength glenister bore backward with his right arm and it became a contest for the weapon which clutched in the two hands swayed back and forth or darted up and down the fury of resistance causing it to trace formless patterns in the air with its muzzle mcnamara shook himself but he was close against the safe and could not escape his head bowed forward by the lock of the miners left arm and so he strained till the breath clogged in his throat despite the grievous toil his right hand moved back slightly his feet shifted a bit while the blood seemed bursting from his eyes but he found that the long fingers encircling his wrist were like gyves weighted with the strength of the hills and the irresistible vigor of youth which knew no defeat slowly inch by inch the great mans arm was dragged back down past his side while the strangling labor of his breath showed at what awful cost the muzzle of the gun described a semicircle and the knotted hands began to travel towards the left more rapidly now across his broad back still he struggled and wrenched but uselessly he strove to fire the weapon but his fingers were woven about it so that the hammer would not work then the miner began forcing upward the white skin beneath the mens strips of clothing was stretched over great knots and ridges which sunk and swelled and quivered helen watching in silent terror felt her brother sinking his fingers into her shoulder and heard him panting his face ablaze with excitement while she became conscious that he had repeated time and again its the hammerlock the hammerlock by now mcnamaras arm was bent and cramped upon his back and then they saw glenisters shoulder dip his elbow come closer to his side and his body heave in one final terrific effort as though pushing a heavy weight in the silence something snapped like a stick there came a deafening report and the scream of a strong man overcome with agony mcnamara went to his knees and sagged forward on to his face as though every bone in his huge bulk had turned to water while his master reeled back against the opposite wall his heels dragging in the litter bringing up with outflung arms as though fearful of falling swaying blind exhausted his face blackened by the explosion of the revolver yet grim with the light of victory judge stillman shouted hysterically arrest that man quick dont let him go it was the miners first realization that others were there raising his head he stared at the faces close against the partition then groaned the words i beat the traitor and and i broke him with my hands chapter xxii the promise of dreams soldiers seized the young man who made no offer at resistance and the room became a noisy riot crowds surged up from below clamoring questioning till some one at the head of the stairs shouted down theyve got roy glenister hes killed mcnamara at which a murmur arose that threatened to become a cheer then one of the receivers faction called lets hang him he killed ten of our men last night helen winced but stillman roused to a sort of malevolent courage quieted the angry voices officer hold these people back ill attend to this man the laws in my hands and ill make him answer mcnamara reared himself groaning from the floor his right arm swinging from the shoulder strangely loose and distorted with palm twisted outward while his battered face was hideous with pain and defeat he growled broken maledictions at his enemy roy meanwhile said nothing for as the savage lust died in him he realized that the whirling faces before him were the faces of his enemies that the bronco kid was still at large and that his vengeance was but half completed his knees were bending his limbs were like leaden bars his chest a furnace of coals as he reeled down the lane of human forms supported by his guards he came abreast of the girl and her companion and paused clearing his vision slowly ah there you are he said thickly to the gambler and began to wrestle with his captors baring his teeth in a grimace of painful effort but they held him as easily as though he were a child and drew him forward his body sagging limply his face turned back over his shoulder they had him near the door when wheaton barred their way crying hold up a minute its all right roy ay bill its all right we did our best but we were done by a damned blackguard now hell send me up but i dont care i broke him with my naked hands didnt i mcnamara he mocked unsteadily at the boss who cursed aloud in return glowering like an evil mask while stillman ran up dishevelled and shrilly irascible take him away i tell you take him to jail but wheaton held his place while the room centred its eyes upon him scenting some unexpected denouement he saw it and in concession to a natural vanity and dramatic instinct he threw back his head and stuffed his hands into his coatpockets while the crowd waited he grinned insolently at the judge and the receiver this will be a day of defeats and disappointments to you my friends that boy wont go to jail because you will wear the shackles yourselves oh you played a shrewd game you two with your senators your politics and your pulls but its our turn now and well make you dance for the mines you gutted and the robberies youve done and the men youve ruined thank heaven theres one honest court and i happened to find it he turned to the strangers who had accompanied him from the ship crying serve those warrants and they stepped forward the uproar of the past few minutes had brought men running from every direction till finding no room on the stairs they had massed in the street below while the word flew from lip to lip concerning this closing scene of their drama the battle at the midas the great fight upstairs and the arrest by the frisco deputies like sindbads genie a wondrous tale took shape from the rumors men shouldered one another eagerly for a glimpse of the actors and when the press streamed out greeted it with volleys of questions they saw the unconscious marshal borne forth followed by the old judge now a palsied wretch slinking beside his captor a very shell of a man at whom they jeered when mcnamara lurched into view an image of defeat and chagrin their voices rose menacingly the pack was turning and he knew it but though racked and crippled he bent upon them a visage so full of defiance and contemptuous malignity that they hushed themselves and their final picture of him was that of a big man downed but unbeaten to the last they began to cry for glenister so that when he loomed in the doorway a ragged heroic figure his heavy shock low over his eyes his unshaven face aggressive even in its weariness his corded arms and chest bare beneath the fluttering streamers the street broke into wild cheering here was a man of their own a son of the northland who labored and loved and fought in a way they understood and he had come into his due but roy dumb and listless staggered up the street refusing the help of every man except wheaton he heard his companion talking but grasped only that the attorney gloated and gloried we have whipped them boy we have whipped them at their own game arrested in their very dooryards cited for contempt of court thats what they are they disobeyed those other writs and so i got them i broke his arm muttered the miner yes i saw you do it ugh it was an awful thing i couldnt prove conspiracy but theyll go to jail for a little while just the same and we have broken the ring it snapped at the shoulder the other continued dully just like a shovel handle i felt it but he tried to kill me and i had to do it the attorney took roy to his cabin and dressed his wounds talking incessantly the while but the boy was like a sleepwalker displaying no elation no excitement no joy of victory at last wheaton broke out cheer up why man you act like a loser dont you realize that weve won dont you understand that the midas is yours and the whole world with it won echoed the miner what do you know about it bill the midas the world what good are they youre wrong ive lost yes ive lost everything she taught me and by some damned trick of fate she was there to see me do it now go away i want to sleep he sank upon the bed with its tangle of blankets and was unconscious before the lawyer had covered him over there he lay like a dead man till late in the afternoon when dextry and slapjack came in from the hills answering wheatons call and fell upon him hungrily they shook roy into consciousness with joyous riot pommelling him with affectionate roughness till he rose and joined with them stiffly he bathed and rubbed the soreness from his muscles emerging physically fit they made him recount his adventures to the tiniest detail following his description of the fight with absorbed interest till dextry broke into mournful complaint id have give my half of the midas to see you bust him lord id have screeched with soopreme delight at that why didnt you gouge his eyes out when you had him crippled questioned slapjack vindictively id a done it dextry continued they tell me that when he was arrested he swore in eighteen different languages each one more refreshinly repulsive an vigrous than the precedin oh i have sure missed aplenty today particlar because my own diction is gettin run down an skimmilky of late showin sad lack of new idees which i might have assimlated somethin robustly original an expressive if id been here no sir a nosebag full of nuggets wouldnt have kept me away how did it sound when she busted insisted the morbid simms but glenister refused to discuss his combat come on slap said the old prospector lets go downtown im so het up i cant set still an besides mebbe we can get the story the way it really happened from somebody who aint bound an gagged an chloroformed by such unbecomin modesties roy dont never go into vawdyville with them personal episodes because they read about as thrillin as a cookbook why say ive had the story of that fight from four different fellers already none of which was within four blocks of the scrimmage an theyre all diffrent an all better n your account now that glenisters mind had recovered some of its poise he realized what he had done i was a beast an animal he groaned and that after all my striving i wanted to leave that part behind i wanted to be worthy of her love and trust even though i never won it but at the first test i am found lacking i have lost her confidence yes and what is worse infinitely worse i have lost my own shes always seen me at my worst he went on but im not that kind at bottom not that kind i want to do whats right and if i have another chance i will i know i will ive been tried too hard thats all some one knocked and he opened the door to admit the bronco kid and helen wait a minute old man said the kid im here as a friend the gambler handled himself with difficulty offering in explanation im all sewed up in bandages of one kind or another he ought to be in bed now but he wouldnt let me come alone and i could not wait the girl supplemented while her eyes avoided glenisters in strange hesitation he wouldnt let you i dont understand im her brother announced the bronco kid ive known it for a long time but i i well you understand i couldnt let her know all i can say is ive gambled square till the night i played you and i was as mad as a dervish then blaming you for the talk id heard last night i learned by chance about struve and helen and got to the roadhouse in time to save her im sorry i didnt kill him his long white fingers writhed about the arm of his chair at the memory isnt he dead glenister inquired no the doctors have brought him in and hell get well hes like half the men in alaska here because the sheriffs back home couldnt shoot straight theres something else im not a good talker but give me time and ill manage it so youll understand i tried to keep helen from coming on this errand but she said it was the square thing and she knows better than i its about those papers she brought in last spring she was afraid you might consider her a party to the deal but you dont do you he glared belligerently and roy replied with fervor certainly not go on well she learned the other day that those documents told the whole story and contained enough proof to break up this conspiracy and convict the judge and mcnamara and all the rest but struve kept the bundle in his safe and wouldnt give it up without a price thats why she went away with him she thought it was right and thats all but it seems wheaton had succeeded in another way now im coming to the point the judge and mcnamara are arrested for contempt of court and theyre as good as convicted you have recovered your mine and these men are disgraced they will go to jail yes for six months perhaps broke in the other hotly but what does that amount to there never was a bolder crime consummated nor one more cruelly unjust they robbed a realm and pillaged its people they defiled a court and made justice a wanton they jailed good men and sent others to ruin and for this they are to suffer how by a paltry fine or a short imprisonment perhaps by an ephemeral disgrace and the loss of their stolen goods contempt of court is the accusation but you might as well convict a murderer for breach of the peace weve thrown them off its true and they wont trouble us again but theyll never have to answer for their real infamy that will go unpunished while their lawyers quibble over technicalities and rules of court i guess its true that there isnt any law of god or man north of fiftythree but if there is justice south of that mark those people will answer for conspiracy and go to the penitentiary you make it hard for me to say what i want to i am almost sorry we came for i am not cunning with words and i dont know that youll understand said the bronco kid gravely we looked at it this way you have had your victory you have beaten your enemies against odds you have recovered your mine and they are disgraced to men like them that last will outlive and outweigh all the rest but the judge is our uncle and our blood runs in his veins he took helen when she was a baby and was a father to her in his selfish way loving her as best he knew how and she loves him i dont quite understand you said roy and then helen spoke for the first time eagerly taking a packet from her bosom as she began this will tell the whole wretched story mr glenister and show the plot in all its vileness its hard for me to betray my uncle but this proof is yours by right to use as you see fit and i cant keep it do you mean that this evidence will show all that and youre going to give it to me because you think it is your duty it belongs to you i have no choice but what i came for was to plead and to ask a little mercy for my uncle who is an old old man and very weak this will kill him he saw that her eyes were swimming while the little chin quivered ever so slightly and her pale cheeks were flushed there rose in him the old wild desire to take her in his arms a yearning to pillow her head on his shoulder and kiss away the tears to smooth with tender caress the wavy hair and bury his face deep in it till he grew drunk with the madness of her but he knew at last for whom she really pleaded so he was to forswear this vengeance which was no vengeance after all but in verity a just punishment they asked him a man a mans man a northman to do this and for what for no reward but on the contrary to insure himself lasting bitterness he strove to look at the proposition calmly clearly but it was difficult if only by freeing this other villain as well as her uncle he would do a good to her then he would not hesitate love was not the only thing he marvelled at his own attitude this could not be his old self debating thus he had asked for another chance to show that he was not the old roy glenister well it had come and he was ready roy dared not look at helen any more for this was the hardest moment he had ever lived you ask this for your uncle but what of of the other fellow you must know that if one goes free so will they both they cant be separated its almost too much to ask the kid took up uncertainly but dont you think the work is done i cant help but admire mcnamara and neither can you hes been too good an enemy to you for that and and he loves helen i know i know said glenister hastily at the same time stopping an unintelligible protest from the girl youve said enough he straightened his slightly stooping shoulders and looked at the unopened package wearily then slipped the rubber band from it and separating the contents tore them up one by one tore them into fine bits without hurry or ostentation and tossed the fragments away while the woman began to sob softly the sound of her relief alone disturbing the silence and so he gave her his enemy making his offer gamely according to his code youre right the work is done and now im very tired they left him standing there the glory of the dying day illumining his lean brown features the vision of a great loneliness in his weary eyes he did not rouse himself till the sky before him was only a curtain of steel pencilled with streaks of soot that lay close down above the darker sea then he sighed and said aloud so this is the end and i gave him to her with these hands he held them out before him curiously becoming conscious for the first time that the left one was swollen and discolored and fearfully painful he noted it with impersonal interest realizing its need of medical attention so left the cabin and walked down into the city he encountered dextry and simms on the way and they went with him both flowing with the gossip of the camp lord but youre the talk of the town they began the curio hunters have commenced to pull struves office apart for souvenirs and the swedes want to run you for congress as soon as ever we get admitted as a state they say that at collaranelbow holts you could lick any of them eastern senators and thereby rastle out a lot of good legislation for us cripples up here speakin of laws goes to show me that this here country is gettin too blamed civilized for a white man said simms pessimistically and now that this fight is ended up it dont look like there would be anything doin fit to claim the interest of a growedup person for a long while im goin west west why you can throw a stone into bering strait from here said roy smiling oh well the worlds round theres a schooner outfittin for sibeery two years cruise me an dex is figgerin on gettin out towards the frontier fer a spell sure said dextry im beginnin to feel all cramped up hereabouts owin to these fillymonarch orchestras an french restarawnts and such discrepancies of scenery theyre puttin a pavement on front street and theres a shoeshinin parlor opened up why id like to get where i could stretch an holler without disturbin the pensiveness of some dude in a dress suit better come along roy we can sell out the midas ill think it over said the young man the night was bright with a full moon when they left the doctors office roy in no mood for the exuberance of his companions parted from them but had not gone far before he met cherry malotte his head was low and he did not see her till she spoke well boy so its over at last her words chimed so perfectly with his thoughts that he replied yes its all over little girl you dont need my congratulations you know me too well for that how does it feel to be a winner i dont know ive lost lost what everything except the goldmine everything except i see you mean that she that you have asked her and she wont he never knew the cost at which she held her voice so steady more than that its so new that it hurts yet and it will continue to hurt for a long time i suppose but tomorrow i am going back to my hills and my valleys back to the midas and my work and try to begin all over for a time ive wandered in strange paths seeking new gods as it were but the dazzle has died out of my eyes and i can see true again she isnt for me although i shall always love her im sorry i cant forget easily as some do its hard to look ahead and take an interest in things but what about you where shall you go i dont know it doesnt really matter now the dusk hid her white set face and she spoke monotonously i am going to see the bronco kid he sent for me hes ill hes not a bad sort said roy and i suppose hell make a new start too perhaps said she gazing far out over the gloomy ocean it all depends after a moment she added what a pity that we cant all sponge off the slate and begin afresh and forget its part of the game said he i dont know why its so but it is ill see you sometimes wont i no boy i think not i believe i understand he murmured and perhaps its better so he took her two soft hands in his one good right and kissed them god bless you and keep you dear brave little cherry she stood straight and still as he melted into the shadows and only the moonlight heard her pitiful sob and her hopeless whisper goodbye my boy my boy he wandered down beside the sea for his battle was not yet won and until he was surer of himself he could not endure the ribaldry and rejoicing of his fellows a welcome lay waiting for him in every public place but no one there could know the mockery of it no one could gauge the desolation that was his the sand wet packed and hard as a pavement gave no sound to his careless steps and thus it was that he came silently upon the one woman as she stood beside the silver surf had he seen her first he would have slunk past in the landward shadows but recognizing his tall form she called and he came while it seemed that his lungs grew suddenly constricted as though bound about with steel hoops the very pleasure of her sight pained him he advanced eagerly and yet with hesitation standing stiffly aloof while his heart fluttered and his tongue grew dumb at last she saw his bandages and her manner changed abruptly coming closer she touched them with caressing fingers its nothing nothing at all he said while his voice jumped out of all control when are you going away i do not know not for some time he had supposed she would go tomorrow with her uncle and the other to be with them through their travail with warm impetuosity she began it was a noble thing you did today oh i am glad and proud i prefer you to think of me in that way rather than as the wild beast you saw this morning for i was mad perfectly mad with hatred and revenge and every wild impulse that comes to a defeated man you see i had played and lost played and lost again and again till there was nothing left what mischance brought you there it was a terribly brutal thing but you cant understand but i can understand i do i know all about it now i know the wild rage of desperation i know the exultation of victory i know what hate and fear are now you told me once that the wilderness had made you a savage and i laughed at it just as i did when you said that my contact with big things would teach me the truth that were all alike and that those motives are in us all i see now that you were right and i was very simple i learned a great deal last night i have learned much also said he i wish you might teach me more i i dont think i could teach you any more she hesitated he moved as though to speak but held back and tore his eyes away from her well she inquired gazing at him covertly once a long time ago i read a lovers petition and ever since knowing you i have made the constant prayer that i might be given the purity to be worthy the good in you and that you might be granted the patience to reach the good in me but its no use but at least im glad we have met on common ground as it were and that you understand in a measure the prayer could not be answered but through it i have found myself and i have known you that last is worth more than a kings ransom to me it is a holy thing which i shall reverence always and when you go you will leave me lonely except for its remembrance but i am not going she said that is unless something in her voice swept his gaze back from the shimmering causeway that rippled seaward to the rising moon it brought the breath into his throat and he shook as though seized by a great fear unless what unless you want me to oh god dont play with me he flung out his hand as though to stop her while his voice died out to a supplicating hoarseness i cant stand that dont you see wont you see she asked i was waiting here for the courage to go to you since you have made it so very hard for me my pagan with which she came close to him looking upward into his face smiling a little shrinking a little yielding yet withholding while the moonlight made of her eyes two bottomless boundless pools dark with love and brimming with the promise of his dreams the end
