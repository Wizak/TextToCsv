adventure i mimer the master at santen in the lowlands there once lived a young prince named siegfried his father siegmund was king of the rich country through which the lazy rhine winds its way just before reaching the great north sea and he was known both far and near for his good deeds and his prudent thrift and siegfrieds mother the gentle sigelind was loved by all for her goodness of heart and her kindly charity to the poor neither king nor queen left aught undone that might make the young prince happy or fit him for lifes usefulness wise men were brought from faroff lands to be his teachers and every day something was added to his store of knowledge or his stock of happiness and very skilful did he become in warlike games and in manly feats of strength no other youth could throw the spear with so great force or shoot the arrow with surer aim no other youth could run more swiftly or ride with more becoming ease his gentle mother took delight in adding to the beauty of his matchless form by clothing him in costly garments decked with the rarest jewels the old the young the rich the poor the high the low all praised the fearless siegfried and all vied in friendly strife to win his favor one would have thought that the life of the young prince could never be aught but a holiday and that the birds would sing and the flowers would bloom and the sun would shine forever for his sake but the business of mans life is not mere pastime and none knew this truth better than the wise old king siegmund all work is noble said he to siegfried and he who yearns to win fame must not shun toil even princes should know how to earn a livelihood by the labor of their hands and so while siegfried was still a young lad his father sent him to live with a smith called mimer whose smithy was among the hills not far from the great forest for in those early times the work of the smith was looked upon as the most worthy of all trades a trade which the gods themselves were not ashamed to follow and this smith mimer was a wonderful master the wisest and most cunning that the world had ever seen men said that he was akin to the dwarffolk who had ruled the earth in the early days and who were learned in every lore and skilled in every craft and they said that he was so exceeding old that no one could remember the day when he came to dwell in the land of siegmunds fathers and some said too that he was the keeper of a wonderful well or flowing spring the waters of which imparted wisdom and farseeing knowledge to all who drank of them to mimers school then where he would be taught to work skilfully and to think wisely siegfried was sent to be in all respects like the other pupils there a coarse blue blouse and heavy leggings and a leathern apron took the place of the costly clothing which he had worn in his fathers dwelling his feet were incased in awkward wooden shoes and his head was covered with a wolfskin cap the dainty bed with its downy pillows wherein every night his mother had been wont with gentle care to see him safely covered was given up for a rude heap of straw in a corner of the smithy and the rich food to which he had been used gave place to the coarsest and humblest fare but the lad did not complain the days which he passed in the smithy were mirthful and happy and the sound of his hammer rang cheerfully and the sparks from his forge flew briskly from morning till night and a wonderful smith he became no one could do more work than he and none wrought with greater skill the heaviest chains and the strongest bolts for prison or for treasurehouse were but as toys in his stout hands so easily and quickly did he beat them into shape and he was alike cunning in work of the most delicate and brittle kind ornaments of gold and silver studded with the rarest jewels were fashioned into beautiful forms by his deft fingers and among all of mimers apprentices none learned the masters lore so readily nor gained the masters favor more one morning the master mimer came to the smithy with a troubled look upon his face it was clear that something had gone amiss and what it was the apprentices soon learned from the smith himself never until lately had any one questioned mimers right to be called the foremost smith in all the world but now a rival had come forward an unknown upstart one amilias in burgundyland had made a suit of armor which he boasted no stroke of sword could dint and no blow of spear could scratch and he had sent a challenge to all other smiths both in the rhine country and elsewhere to equal that piece of workmanship or else acknowledge themselves his underlings and vassals for many days had mimer himself toiled alone and vainly trying to forge a sword whose edge the boasted armor of amilias could not foil and now in despair he came to ask the help of his pupils and apprentices who among you is skilful enough to forge such a sword he asked one after another the pupils shook their heads and veliant the foreman of the apprentices said i have heard much about that wonderful armor and its extreme hardness and i doubt if any skill can make a sword with edge so sharp and true as to cut into it the best that can be done is to try to make another warcoat whose temper shall equal that of amiliass armor then the lad siegfried quickly said i will make such a sword as you want a blade that no warcoat can foil give me but leave to try the other pupils laughed in scorn but mimer checked them you hear how this boy can talk we will see what he can do he is the kings son and we know that he has uncommon talent he shall make the sword but if upon trial it fail i will make him rue the day then siegfried went to his task and for seven days and seven nights the sparks never stopped flying from his forge and the ringing of his anvil and the hissing of the hot metal as he tempered it were heard continuously on the eighth day the sword was fashioned and siegfried brought it to mimer the smith felt the razoredge of the bright weapon and said this seems indeed a fair fireedge let us make a trial of its keenness then a thread of wool as light as thistledown was thrown upon water and as it floated there mimer struck it with the sword the glittering blade cleft the slender thread in twain and the pieces floated undisturbed upon the surface of the liquid well done cried the delighted smith never have i seen a keener edge if its temper is as true as its sharpness would lead us to believe it will indeed serve me well but siegfried took the sword again and broke it into many pieces and for three days he welded it in a whitehot fire and tempered it with milk and oatmeal then in sight of mimer and the sneering apprentices he cast a light ball of finespun wool upon the flowing water of the brook and it was caught in the swift eddies of the stream and whirled about until it met the bared blade of the sword which was held in mimers hands and it was parted as easily and clean as the rippling water and not the smallest thread was moved out of its place then back to the smithy siegfried went again and his forge glowed with a brighter fire and his hammer rang upon the anvil with a cheerier sound than ever before but he suffered none to come near and no one ever knew what witchery he used but some of his fellowpupils afterwards told how in the dusky twilight they had seen a oneeyed man longbearded and clad in a cloudgray kirtle and wearing a skyblue hood talking with siegfried at the smithy door and they said that the strangers face was at once pleasant and fearful to look upon and that his one eye shone in the gloaming like the evening star and that when he had placed in siegfrieds hands bright shards like pieces of a broken sword he faded suddenly from their sight and was seen no more for seven weeks the lad wrought day and night at his forge and then pale and haggard but with a pleased smile upon his face he stood before mimer with the gleaming sword in his hands it is finished he said behold the glittering terror the blade balmung let us try its edge and prove its temper once again that so we may know whether you can place your trust in it and mimer looked long at the ruddy hilts of the weapon and at the mystic runes that were scored upon its sides and at the keen edge which gleamed like a ray of sunlight in the gathering gloom of the evening but no word came from his lips and his eyes were dim and dazed and he seemed as one lost in thoughts of days long past and gone siegfried raised the blade high over his head and the gleaming edge flashed hither and thither like the lightnings play when thor rides over the stormclouds then suddenly it fell upon the masters anvil and the great block of iron was cleft in two but the bright blade was no whit dulled by the stroke and the line of light which marked the edge was brighter than before then to the flowing brook they went and a great pack of wool the fleeces of ten sheep was brought and thrown upon the swirling water as the stream bore the bundle downwards mimer held the sword in its way and the whole was divided as easily and as clean as the woollen ball or the slender woollen thread had been cleft before now indeed cried mimer i no longer fear to meet that upstart amilias if his warcoat can withstand the stroke of such a sword as balmung then i shall not be ashamed to be his underling but if this good blade is what it seems to be it will not fail me and i mimer the old shall still be called the wisest and greatest of smiths and he sent word at once to amilias in burgundyland to meet him on a day and settle forever the question as to which of the two should be the master and which the underling and heralds proclaimed it in every town and dwelling when the time which had been set drew near mimer bearing the sword balmung and followed by all his pupils and apprentices wended his way towards the place of meeting through the forest they went and then along the banks of the sluggish river for many a league to the height of land which marked the line between king siegmunds country and the country of the burgundians it was in this place midway between the shops of mimer and amilias that the great trial of metal and of skill was to be made and here were already gathered great numbers of people from the lowlands and from burgundy anxiously waiting for the coming of the champions on the one side were the wise old siegmund and his gentle queen and their train of knights and courtiers and fair ladies on the other side were the three burgundian kings gunther gernot and giselher and a mighty retinue of warriors led by grim old hagen the uncle of the kings and the wariest chief in all rhineland when every thing was in readiness for the contest amilias clad in his boasted warcoat went up to the top of the hill and sat upon a great rock and waited for mimers coming as he sat there he looked to the people below like some great castletower for he was almost a giant in size and his coat of mail so skilfully wrought was so huge that twenty men of common mould might have found shelter or hidden themselves within it as the smith mimer so dwarfish in stature toiled up the steep hillside amilias smiled to see him for he felt no fear of the slender gleaming blade that was to try the metal of his warcoat and already a shout of expectant triumph went up from the throats of the burgundian hosts so sure were they of their champions success but mimers friends waited in breathless silence hoping and yet fearing only king siegmund whispered to his queen and said knowledge is stronger than brute force the smallest dwarf who has drunk from the well of the knowing one may safely meet the stoutest giant in battle when mimer reached the top of the hill amilias folded his huge arms and smiled again for he felt that this contest was mere play for him and that mimer was already as good as beaten and his thrall the smith paused a moment to take breath and as he stood by the side of his foe he looked to those below like a mere black speck close beside a steelgray castletower are you ready asked the smith ready answered amilias strike mimer raised the beaming blade in the air and for a moment the lightning seemed to play around his head the muscles on his short brawny arms stood out like great ropes and then balmung descending cleft the air from right to left the waiting lookerson in the plain below thought to hear the noise of clashing steel but they listened in vain for no sound came to their ears save a sharp hiss like that which redhot iron gives when plunged into a tank of cold water the huge amilias sat unmoved with his arms still folded upon his breast but the smile had faded from his face how do you feel now asked mimer in a halfmocking tone rather strangely as if cold iron had touched me faintly answered the upstart shake thyself cried mimer amilias did so and lo he fell in two halves for the sword had cut sheer through the vaunted warcoat and cleft in twain the great body incased within down tumbled the giant head and the still folded arms and they rolled with thundering noise to the foot of the hill and fell with a fearful splash into the deep waters of the river and there fathoms down they may even now be seen when the water is clear lying like great gray rocks among the sand and gravel below the rest of the body with the armor which incased it still sat upright in its place and to this day travellers sailing down the river are shown on moonlit evenings the luckless armor of amilias on the high hilltop in the dim uncertain light one easily fancies it to be the ivy covered ruins of some old castle of feudal times the master mimer sheathed his sword and walked slowly down the hillside to the plain where his friends welcomed him with glad cheers and shouts of joy but the burgundians baffled and feeling vexed turned silently homeward nor cast a single look back to the scene of their disappointment and their illfated champions defeat and siegfried went again with the master and his fellows to the smoky smithy to his roaring bellows and ringing anvil and to his coarse fare and rude hard bed and to a life of labor and while all men praised mimer and his knowing skill and the fiery edge of the sunbeam blade no one knew that it was the boy siegfried who had wrought that piece of workmanship but after a while it was whispered around that not mimer but one of his pupils had forged the sword and when the master was asked what truth there was in this story his eyes twinkled and the corners of his mouth twitched strangely and he made no answer but veliant the foreman of the smithy and the greatest of boasters said it was i who forged the fireedge of the blade balmung and although none denied the truth of what he said but few who knew what sort of a man he was believed his story and this is the reason my children that in the ancient songs and stories which tell of this wondrous sword it is said by most that mimer and by a few that veliant forged its blade but i prefer to believe that it was made by siegfried the hero who afterwards wielded it in so many adventures be this as it may however blind hate and jealousy were from this time uppermost in the coarse and selfish mind of veliant and he sought how he might drive the lad away from the smithy in disgrace this boy has done what no one else could do said he he may yet do greater deeds and set himself up as the master smith of the world and then we shall all have to humble ourselves before him as his underlings and thralls and he nursed this thought and brooded over the hatred which he felt towards the blameless boy but he did not dare to harm him for fear of their master mimer and siegfried busied himself at his forge where the sparks flew as briskly and as merrily as ever before and his bellows roared from early morning till late at evening nor did the foremans unkindness trouble him for a moment for he knew that the masters heart was warm towards him oftentimes when the days work was done siegfried sat with mimer by the glowing light of the furnacefire and listened to the sweet tales which the master told of the deeds of the early days when the world was young and the dwarffolk and the giants had a name and a place upon earth and one night as they thus sat the master talked of odin the allfather and of the gods who dwell with him in asgard and of the puny menfolk whom they protect and befriend until his words grew full of bitterness and his soul of a fierce longing for something he dared not name and the lads heart was stirred with a strange uneasiness and he said tell me i pray dear master something about my own kin my fathers fathers those mighty kings who i have heard said were the bravest and best of men then the smith seemed pleased again and his eyes grew brighter and lost their faraway look and a smile played among the wrinkles of his swarthy face as he told a tale of old king volsung and of the deeds of the volsung kings long years ago before the evil days had dawned king volsung ruled over all the land which lies between the sea and the country of the goths the days were golden and the good frey dropped peace and plenty everywhere and men went in and out and feared no wrong king volsung had a dwelling in the midst of fertile fields and fruitful gardens fairer than any dream was that dwelling the roof was thatched with gold and red turrets and towers rose above the great feasthall was long and high and its walls were hung with sunbright shields and the doornails were of silver in the middle of the hall stood the pride of the volsungs a tree whose blossoms filled the air with fragrance and whose green branches thrusting themselves through the ceiling covered the roof with fair foliage it was odins tree and king volsung had planted it there with his own hands on a day in winter king volsung held a great feast in his hall in honor of siggeir the king of the goths who was his guest and the fires blazed bright in the broad chimneys and music and mirth went round but in the midst of the merrymaking the guests were startled by a sudden peal of thunder which seemed to come from the cloudless sky and which made the shields upon the walls rattle and ring in wonder they looked around a strange man stood in the doorway and laughed but said not a word and they noticed that he wore no shoes upon his feet but that a cloudgray cloak was thrown over his shoulders and a blue hood was drawn down over his head his face was halfhidden by a heavy beard and he had but one eye which twinkled and glowed like a burning coal and all the guests sat moveless in their seats so awed were they in the presence of him who stood at the door for they knew that he was none other than odin the allfather the king of gods and men he spoke not a word but straight into the hall he strode and he paused not until he stood beneath the blossoming branches of the tree then forth from beneath his cloudgray cloak he drew a gleaming sword and struck the blade deep into the wood so deep that nothing but the hilt was left in sight and turning to the awestruck guests he said a blade of mighty worth have i hidden in this tree never have the earthfolk wrought better steel nor has any man ever wielded a more trusty sword whoever there is among you brave enough and strong enough to draw it forth from the wood he shall have it as a gift from odin then slowly to the door he strode again and no one saw him any more and after he had gone the volsungs and their guests sat a long time silent fearing to stir lest the vision should prove a dream but at last the old king arose and cried come guests and kinsmen and set your hands to the ruddy hilt odins gift stays waiting for its fated owner let us see which one of you is the favored of the allfather first siggeir the king of the goths and his earls the volsungs guests tried their hands but the blade stuck fast and the stoutest man among them failed to move it then king volsung laughing seized the hilt and drew with all his strength but the sword held still in the wood of odins tree and one by one the nine sons of volsung tugged and strained in vain and each was greeted with shouts and laughter as ashamed and beaten he wended to his seat again then at last sigmund the youngest son stood up and laid his hand upon the ruddy hilt scarce thinking to try what all had failed to do when lo the blade came out of the tree as if therein it had all along lain loose and sigmund raised it high over his head and shook it and the bright flame that leaped from its edge lit up the hall like the lightnings gleaming and the volsungs and their guests rent the air with cheers and shouts of gladness for no one among all the men of the midworld was more worthy of odins gift than young sigmund the brave but the rest of mimers story would be too long to tell you now for he and his young apprentice sat for hours by the dying coals and talked of siegfrieds kinfolk the volsung kings of old and he told how siggeir the goth king was wedded to signy the fair the only daughter of volsung and the pride of the old kings heart and how he carried her with him to his home in the land of the goths and how he coveted sigmunds sword and plotted to gain it by guile and how through presence of friendship he invited the volsung kings to visit him in gothland as the guests of himself and signy and how he betrayed and slew them save sigmund alone who escaped and for long years lived an outlaw in the land of his treacherous foe and then he told how sigmund afterwards came back to his own country of the volsungs and how his people welcomed him and he became a mighty king such as the world had never known before and how when he had grown old and full of years and honors he went out with his earls and fightingmen to battle against the hosts of king lyngi the mighty and how in the midst of the fight when his sword had hewn down numbers of the foe and the end of the strife and victory seemed near an old man one eyed and bearded and wearing a cloudgray cloak stood up before him in the din and his sword was broken in pieces and he fell dead on the heap of the slain and when mimer had finished his tale his dark face seemed to grow darker and his twinkling eyes grew brighter as he cried out in a tone of despair and hopeless yearning oh past are those days of old and the worthy deeds of the brave and these are the days of the homestayers of the wise but feeblehearted yet the norns have spoken and it must be that another hero shall arise of the volsung blood and he shall restore the name and the fame of his kin of the early days and he shall be my bane and in him shall the race of heroes have an enden siegfrieds heart was strangely stirred within him as he hearkened to this story of ancient times and to the fateful words of the master and for a long time he sat in silent thought and neither he nor mimer moved or spoke again until the darkness of the night had begun to fade and the gray light of morning to steal into the smithy then as if moved by a sudden impulse he turned to the master and said you speak of the norns dear master and of their foretelling but your words are vague and their meaning very broad when shall that hero come and who shall he be and what deeds shall be his doing alas answered mimer i know not save that he shall be of the volsung race and that my fate is linked with his and why do you not know returned siegfried are you not that old mimer in whom it is said the garnered wisdom of the world is stored is there not truth in the old story that even odin pawned one of his eyes for a single draught from your fountain of knowledge and is the possessor of so much wisdom unable to look into the future with clearness and certainty alas answered mimer again and his words came hard and slow i am not that mimer of whom old stories tell who gave wisdom to the allfather in exchange for an eye he is one of the giants and he still watches his fountain in faroff jotunheim i claim kinship with the dwarfs and am sometimes known as an elf sometimes as a woodsprite men have called me mimer because of my wisdom and skill and the learning which i impart to my pupils could i but drink from the fountain of the real mimer then the wisdom of the world would in truth be mine and the secrets of the future would be no longer hidden but i must wait as i have long waited for the day and the deed and the doom that the norns have foretold and the old strange look of longing came again into his eyes and the wrinkles on his swarthy face seemed to deepen with agony as he arose and left the smithy and siegfried sat alone before the smouldering fire and pondered upon what he had heard adventure ii greyfell many were the pleasant days that siegfried spent in mimers smoky smithy and if he ever thought of his fathers stately dwelling or of the life of ease which he might have enjoyed within its halls he never by word or deed showed signs of discontent for mimer taught him all the secrets of his craft and all the lore of the wise men to beat hot iron to shape the fireedged sword to smithy warcoats to fashion the slender bracelet of gold and jewels all this he had already learned but there were many other things to know and these the wise master showed him he told him how to carve the mystic runes which speak to the knowing ones with silent unseen tongues he told him of the men of other lands and taught him their strange speech he showed him how to touch the harpstrings and bring forth bewitching music and the heart of siegfried waxed very wise while his body grew wondrous strong and the master loved his pupil dearly but the twelve apprentices grew more jealous day by day and when mimer was away they taunted siegfried with cruel jests and sought by harsh threats to drive him from the smithy but the lad only smiled and made the old shop ring again with the music from his anvil on a day when mimer had gone on a journey veliant the foreman so far forgot himself as to strike the boy for a moment siegfried gazed at him with withering scorn then he swung his hammer high in air and brought it swiftly down not upon the head of veliant who was trembling with expectant fear but upon the foremans anvil the great block of iron was shivered by the blow and flew into a thousand pieces then turning again towards the thoroughly frightened foreman siegfried said while angry lightningflashes darted from his eyes what if i were to strike you thus veliant sank upon the ground and begged for mercy you are safe said siegfried walking away i would scorn to harm a being like you the apprentices were struck dumb with amazement and fear and when siegfried had returned to his anvil they one by one dropped their hammers and stole away from the smithy in a secret place not far from the shop they met together to plot some means by which they might rid themselves of him whom they both hated and feared the next morning veliant came to siegfrieds forge with a sham smile upon his face the boy knew that cowardice and base deceit lurked ill concealed beneath that smile yet as he was wont to do he welcomed the foreman kindly siegfried said veliant let us be friends again i am sorry that i was so foolish and so rash yesterday and i promise that i will never again be so rude and unmanly as to become angry at you let us be friends good siegfried give me your hand i pray you and with it your forgiveness siegfried grasped the rough palm of the young smith with such a gripe that the smile vanished from veliants face and his muscles writhed with pain i give you my hand certainly said the boy and i will give you my forgiveness when i know that you are worthy of it as soon as veliants aching hand allowed him speech he said siegfried you know that we have but little charcoal left for our forges and our master will soon return from his journey it will never do for him to find us idle and the fires cold some one must go today to the forestpits and bring home a fresh supply of charcoal how would you like the errand it is but a pleasant days journey to the pits and a ride into the greenwood this fine summer day would certainly be more agreeable than staying in the smoky shop i should like the drive very much answered siegfried but i have never been to the coalpits and i might lose my way in the forest no danger of that said veliant follow the road that goes straight into the heart of the forest and you cannot miss your way it will lead you to the house of regin the master the greatest charcoalman in all rhineland he will be right glad to see you for mimers sake and you may lodge with him for the night in the morning he will fill your cart with the choicest charcoal and you can drive home at your leisure and when our master comes again he will find our forges flaming and our bellows roaring and our anvils ringing as of yore siegfried after some further parley agreed to undertake the errand although he felt that veliant in urging him to do so wished to work him some harm he harnessed the donkey to the smiths best cart and drove merrily away along the road which led towards the forest the day was bright and clear and as siegfried rode through the flowery meadows or betwixt the fields of corn a thousand sights and sounds met him and made him glad now and then he would stop to watch the reapers in the fields or to listen to the song of some heavensoaring lark lost to sight in the blue sea overhead once he met a company of gayly dressed youths and maidens carrying sheaves of golden grain for it was now the harvesttime and singing in praise of frey the giver of peace and plenty whither away young prince they merrily asked to regin the coalburner in the deep greenwood he answered then may the good frey have thee in keeping they cried it is a long and lonesome journey and each one blessed him as they passed it was nearly noon when he drove into the forest and left the blooming meadows and the warm sunshine behind him and now he urged the donkey forwards with speed for he knew that he had lost much precious time and that many miles still lay between him and regins charcoalpits and there was nothing here amid the thick shadows of the wood to make him wish to linger for the ground was damp and the air was chilly and every thing was silent as the grave and not a living creature did siegfried see save now and then a gray wolf slinking across the road or a doleful owl sitting low down in some treetop and blinking at him in the dull but garish light evening at last drew on and the shadows in the wood grew deeper and still no sign of charcoalburner nor of other human being was seen night came and thick darkness settled around and all the demons of the forest came forth and clamored and chattered and shrieked and howled but siegfried was not afraid the bats and vampires came out of their hidingplaces and flapped their clammy wings in his face and he thought that he saw ogres and many fearful creatures peeping out from behind every tree and shrub but when he looked upwards through the overhanging treetops he saw the stardecked roof of heaven the blue mantle which the allfather has hung as a shelter over the world and he went bravely onwards never doubting but that odin has many good things in store for those who are willing to trust him and by and by the great round moon arose in the east and the fearful sounds that had made the forest hideous began to die away and siegfried saw far down the path a red light feebly gleaming and he was glad for he knew that it must come from the charcoalburners pits soon he came out upon a broad cleared space and the charcoalburners fires blazed bright before him and some workmen swarthy and sootbegrimed came forwards to meet him who are you they asked and why do you come through the forest at this late hour i am siegfried answered the boy and i come from mimers smithy i seek regin the king of charcoalburners for i must have coal for my masters smithy come with me said one of the men i will lead you to regin siegfried alighted from his cart and followed the man to a lowroofed hut not far from the burning pits as they drew near they heard the sound of a harp and strange wild music within and siegfrieds heart was stirred with wonder as he listened the man knocked softly at the door and the music ceased who comes to break into regins rest at such a time as this said a rough voice within a youth who calls himself siegfried answered the man he says that he comes from mimers smithy and he would see you my master let him come in said the voice siegfried passed through the low door and into the room beyond and so strange was the sight that met him that he stood for a while in awe for never in so lowly a dwelling had treasures so rich been seen jewels sparkled from the ceiling rare tapestry covered the walls and on the floor were heaps of ruddy gold and silver still unfashioned and in the midst of all this wealth stood regin the king of the forest the greatest of charcoalmen and a strange old man he was wrinkled and gray and beardless but out of his eyes sharp glances gleamed of a light that was not human and his heavy brow and broad forehead betokened wisdom and shrewd cunning and he welcomed siegfried kindly for mimers sake and set before him a rich repast of venison and wild honey and fresh white bread and luscious grapes and when the meal was finished the boy would have told his errand but regin stopped him say nothing of your business tonight said he for the hour is already late and you are weary better lie down and rest until the morrow and then we will talk of the matter which has brought you hither and siegfried was shown to a couch of the fragrant leaves of the myrtle and hemlock overspread with soft white linen such as is made in the faroff emerald isle and he was lulled to sleep by sweet strains of music from regins harp music which told of the days when the gods were young on the earth and as he slept he dreamed he dreamed that he stood upon the crag of a high mountain and that the eagles flew screaming around him and the everlasting snows lay at his feet and the world in all its beauty was stretched out like a map below him and he longed to go forth to partake of its abundance and to make for himself a name among men then came the norns who spin the thread and weave the woof of every mans life and they held in their hands the web of his own destiny and urd the past sat on the tops of the eastern mountains where the sun begins to rise at dawn while verdanda the present stood in the western sea where sky and water meet and they stretched the web between them and its ends were hidden in the faraway mists then with all their might the two norns span the purple and golden threads and wove the fatal woof but as it began to grow in beauty and in strength and to shadow the earth with its gladness and its glory skuld the pitiless norn of the future seized it with rude fingers and tore it into shreds and cast it down at the feet of hela the white queen of the deaden and the eagles shrieked and the mountain shook and the crag toppled and siegfried awoke the next morning at earliest break of day the youth sought regin and made known his errand i have come for charcoal for my master mimers forges my cart stands ready outside and i pray you to have it filled at once for the way is long and i must be back betimes then a strange smile stole over regins wrinkled face and he said does siegfried the prince come on such a lowly errand does he come to me through the forest driving a donkey and riding in a sooty coalcart i have known the day when his kin were the mightiest kings of earth and they fared through every land the noblest men of menfolk the taunting word the jeering tones made siegfrieds anger rise the blood boiled in his veins but he checked his tongue and mildly answered it is true that i am a prince and my father is the wisest of kings and it is for this reason that i come thus to you mimer is my master and my father early taught me that even princes must obey their masters behests then regin laughed and asked how long art thou to be mimers thrall does no work wait for thee but at his smoky forge when mimer gives me leave and odin calls me answered the lad then i too will go faring over the world like my kin of the earlier days to carve me a name and great glory and a place with the noble of earth regin said not a word but he took his harp and smote the strings and a sad wild music filled the room and he sang of the gods and the dwarffolk and of the deeds that had been in the time long past and gone and a strange mist swam before siegfrieds eyes and so bewitching were the strains that fell upon his ears and filled his soul that he forgot about his errand and his master mimer and his father siegmund and his lowland home and thought only of the heartgladdening sounds by and by the music ended the spell was lifted and siegfried turned his eyes towards the musician a wonderful change had taken place the little old man still stood before him with the harp in his hand but his wrinkled face was hidden by a heavy beard and his thin gray locks were covered with a long black wig and he seemed taller and stouter than before as siegfried started with surprise his host held out his hand and said you need not be alarmed my boy it is time for you to know that regin and mimer are the same person or rather that mimer is regin disguiseden the day has come for you to go your way into the world and mimer gives you leave siegfried was so amazed he could not say a word he took the masters hand and gazed long into his deep bright eyes then the two sat down together and mimer or regin as we shall now call him told the prince many tales of the days that had been and of his bold wise forefathers and the lads heart swelled within him and he longed to be like them to dare and do and suffer and gloriously win at last and he turned to regin and said tell me wisest of masters what i shall do to win fame and to make myself worthy to rule the fair land which my fathers held go forth in your own strength and with odins help answered regin go forth to right the wrong to help the weak to punish evil and come not back to your fathers kingdom until the world shall know your noble deeds but whither shall i go asked siegfried i will tell you answered regin put on these garments which better befit a prince than those sootbegrimed clothes you have worn so long gird about you this sword the good balmung and go northward when you come to the waste lands which border upon the sea you will find the ancient gripir the last of the kin of the giants ask of him a warsteed and odin will tell you the rest so when the sun had risen high above the trees siegfried bade regin goodby and went forth like a man to take whatsoever fortune should betide he went through the great forest and across the bleak moorland beyond and over the huge black mountains that stretched themselves across his way and came to a pleasant country all dotted with white farmhouses and yellow with waving corn but he tarried not here though many kind words were spoken to him and all besought him to stay right onwards he went until he reached the waste land which borders the sounding sea and there high mountains stood with snowcrowned crags beetling over the waves and a great river all foaming with the summer floods went rolling through the valley and in the deep dales between the mountains were rich meadows green with grass and speckled with thousands of flowers of every hue where herds of cattle and deer and noble elks and untamed horses fed in undisturbed peace and siegfried when he saw knew that these were the pastures of gripir the ancient high up among the gray mountainpeaks stood gripirs dwelling a mighty house made of huge bowlders brought by giant hands from the far northland and the wild eagle built their nests around it and the mountain vultures screamed about its doors but siegfried was not afraid he climbed the steep pathway which the feet of men had never touched before and without pausing walked straightway into the highbuilt hall the room was so dark that at first he could see nothing save the white walls and the glassgreen pillars which upheld the roof but the light grew stronger soon and siegfried saw beneath a heavy canopy of stone the ancient gripir seated in a chair made from the seahorses teethen and the son of the giants held in his hand an ivory staff and a purple mantle was thrown over his shoulders and his white beard fell in sweeping waves almost to the seagreen floor very wise he seemed and he gazed at siegfried with a kindly smile hail siegfried he cried hail prince with the gleaming eye i know thee and i know the woof that the norns have woven for thee welcome to my lonely mountain home come and sit by my side in the highseat where man has never sat and i will tell thee of things that have been and of things that are yet to be then siegfried fearlessly went and sat by the side of the ancient wise one and long hours they talked together strong youth and hoariest age and each was glad that in the other he had found some source of hope and comfort and they talked of the great midworld and of the starry dome above it and of the seas which gird it and of the men who live upon it all night long they talked and in the morning siegfried arose to go thou hast not told me of thy errand said gripir but i know what it is come first with me and see this great midworld for thyself then gripir leaning on his staff led the way out of the great hall and up to the top of the highest mountaincrag and the wild eagles circled in the clear cold air above them and far below them the white waves dashed against the mountains feet and the frosty winds swept around them unchecked bringing to their ears the lone lamenting of the north giants moaning for the days that had been and for the glories that were past then siegfried looked to the north and he saw the dark mountainwall of norway trending away in solemn grandeur towards the frozen sea but broken here and there by sheltering fjords and pleasant sunny dales he looked to the east and saw a great forest stretching away and away until it faded to sight in the blue distance he looked to the south and saw a pleasant land with farms and vineyards and towns and strongbuilt castles and through it wound the river rhine like a great white serpent reaching from the snowcapped alps to the northern sea and he saw his fathers little kingdom of the netherlands lying like a green speck on the shore of the ocean then he looked to the west and nothing met his sight but a wilderness of rolling restless waters save in the far distance a green island half hidden by sullen mists and clouds and siegfried sighed and said the world is so wide and the life of man so short the world is all before thee answered gripir take what the norns have allotted thee choose from my pastures a battlesteed and ride forth to win for thyself a name and fame among the sons of men then siegfried ran down the steep side of the mountain to the grassy dell where the horses were feeding but the beasts were all so fair and strong that he knew not which to choose while he paused uncertain what to do a strange man stood before him tall and handsome was the man with one bright eye and a face beaming like the dawn in summer and upon his head he wore a skyblue hood bespangled with golden stars and over his shoulder was thrown a cloak of ashen gray would you choose a horse sir siegfried asked the stranger indeed i would answered he but it is hard to make a choice among so many there is one in the meadow said the man far better than all the rest they say that he came from odins pastures on the green hillslopes of asgard and that none but the noblest shall ride him which is he asked siegfried drive the herd into the river was the answer and then see if you can pick him out and siegfried and the stranger drove the horses down the sloping bank and into the rolling stream but the flood was too strong for them some soon turned back to the shore while others struggling madly were swept away and carried out to the sea only one swam safely over he shook the dripping water from his mane tossed his head in the air and then plunged again into the stream right bravely he stemmed the torrent the second time he clambered up the shelving bank and stood by siegfrieds side what need to tell you that this is the horse said the stranger take him he is yours he is greyfell the shining hope that odin sends to his chosen heroes and then siegfried noticed that the horses mane glimmered and flashed like a thousand rays from the sun and that his coat was as white and clear as the freshfallen snow on the mountains he turner to speak to the stranger but he was nowhere to be seen and siegfried bethought him how he had talked with odin unawares then he mounted the noble greyfell and rode with a light heart across the flowery meadows whither ridest thou cried gripir the ancient from his doorway among the crags i ride into the wide world said siegfried but i know not whither i would right the wrong and help the weak and make myself a name on the earth as did my kinsmen of yore tell me i pray you where i shall go for you are wise and you know the things which have been and those which shall befall ride back to regin the master of masters answered gripir he will tell thee of a wrong to be righted and the ancient son of the giants withdrew into his lonely abode and siegfried on the shining greyfell rode swiftly away towards the south adventure iii the curse of gold forth then rode siegfried upon the beaming greyfell out into the broad midworld and the sun shone bright above him and the air was soft and pure and the earth seemed very lovely and life a gladsome thing and his heart was big within him as he thought of the days to come of the deeds of love and daring of the righting of many wrongs of the peoples praise and the glory of a life well lived and he wended his way back again toward the south and the fair lands of the rhine he left the barren moorlands behind him and the pleasant farms and villages of the fruitful countryside and after many days came once more to regins woodland dwelling for he said to himself my old master is very wise and he knows of the deeds that were done when yet the world was young and my kin were the mightiest of men i will go to him and learn what grievous evil it is that he has so often vaguely hinted at regin when he saw the lad and the beaming greyfell standing like a vision of light at his door welcomed them most gladly and led siegfried into the inner room where they sat down together amid the gold and the gemstones and the finewrought treasures there truly said the master the days of my long waiting are drawing to a close and at last the deed shall be done and the old look of longing came again into his eyes and his pinched face seemed darker and more wrinkled than before and his thin lips trembled with emotion as he spoke what is that deed of which you speak asked siegfried it is the righting of a grievous wrong answered regin and the winning of treasures untold lo many years have i waited for the coming of this day and now my heart tells me that the hero so long hoped for is here and the wisdom and the wealth of the world shall be mine but what is the wrong to be righted asked siegfried and what is this treasure that you speak of as your own alas answered regin the treasure is indeed mine and yet wrongfully has it been withheld from me but listen a while to a tale of the early days and thou shalt know what the treasure is and what is the wrong to be righted he took his harp and swept the strings and played a soft low melody which told of the dim past and of blighted hopes and of a nameless neversatisfied yearning for that which might have been and then he told siegfried this story regins story when the earth was still very young and men were feeble and few and the dwarfs were many and strong the asafolk were wont ofttimes to leave their halls in heaventowering asgard in order to visit the newformed midworld and to see what the shortlived sons of men were doing sometimes they came in their own godlike splendor and might sometimes they came disguised as feeble menfolk with all mans weaknesses and all his passions sometimes odin as a beggar wandered from one country to another craving charity sometimes as a warrior clad in coat of mail he rode forth to battle for the cause of right or as a minstrel he sang from door to door and played sweet music in the halls of the great or as a huntsman he dashed through brakes and fens and into dark forests and climbed steep mountains in search of game or as a sailor he embarked upon the sea and sought new scenes in unknown lands and many times did menfolk entertain him unawares once on a time he came to the midworld in company with hoenir and loki and the three wandered through many lands and in many climes each giving gifts wherever they went odin gave knowledge and strength and taught men how to read the mystic runes hoenir gave gladness and good cheer and lightened many hearts with the glow of his comforting presence but loki had nought to give but cunning deceit and base thoughts and he left behind him bitter strife and many aching breasts at last growing tired of the fellowship of men the three asas sought the solitude of the forest and as huntsmen wandered long among the hills and over the wooded heights of hunaland late one afternoon they came to a mountainstream at a place where it poured over a ledge of rocks and fell in clouds of spray into a rocky gorge below as they stood and with pleased eyes gazed upon the waterfall they saw near the bank an otter lazily making ready to eat a salmon which he had caught and loki ever bent on doing mischief hurled a stone at the harmless beast and killed it and he boasted loudly that he had done a worthy deed and he took both the otter and the fish which it had caught and carried them with him as trophies of the days success just at nightfall the three huntsmen came to a lone farmhouse in the valley and asked for food and for shelter during the night shelter you shall have said the farmer whose name was hreidmar for the rising clouds foretell a storm but food i have none to give you surely huntsmen of skill should not want for food since the forest teems with game and the streams are full of fish then loki threw upon the ground the otter and the fish and said we have sought in both forest and stream and we have taken from them at one blow both flesh and fish give us but the shelter you promise and we will not trouble you for food the farmer gazed with horror upon the lifeless body of the otter and cried out this creature which you mistook for an otter and which you have robbed and killed is my son oddar who for mere pastime had taken the form of the furry beast you are but thieves and murderers then he called loudly for help and his two sons fafnir and regin sturdy and valiant kin of the dwarffolk rushed in and seized upon the huntsmen and bound them hand and foot for the three asas having taken upon themselves the forms of men had no more than human strength and were unable to withstand them then odin and his fellows bemoaned their ill fate and loki said wherefore did we foolishly take upon ourselves the likenesses of puny men had i my own power once more i would never part with it in exchange for mans weaknesses and hoenir sighed and said now indeed will darkness win and the frosty breath of the reimthursen giants will blast the fair handiwork of the sunlight and the heat for the givers of life and light and warmth are helpless prisoners in the hands of these cunning and unforgiving jailers surely said odin not even the highest are free from obedience to heavens behests and the laws of right i whom men call the preserver of life have demeaned myself by being found in evil company and although i have done no other wrong i suffer rightly for the doings of this mischiefmaker with whom i have stooped to have fellowship for all are known not so much by what they are as by what they seem to be and they bear the bad name which their comrades bear now i am fallen from my high estate eternal right is higher than i and in the last twilight of the gods i must needs meet the dread fenriswolf and in the end the world will be made new again and the shining balder will rule in sunlight majesty forever then the asas asked hreidmar their jailer what ransom they should pay for their freedom and he not knowing who they were said i must first know what ransom you are able to give we will give any thing you may ask hastily answered loki hreidmar then called his sons and bade them strip the skin from the otters body when this was done they brought the furry hide and spread it upon the ground and hreidmar said bring shining gold and precious stones enough to cover every part of this otterskin when you have paid so much ransom you shall have your freedom that we will do answered odin but one of us must have leave to go and fetch it the other two will stay fast bound until the morning dawns if by that time the gold is not here you may do with us as you please hreidmar and the two young men agreed to odins offer and lots being cast it fell to loki to go and fetch the treasure when he had been loosed from the cords which bound him loki donned his magic shoes which had carried him over land and sea from the farthest bounds of the midworld and hastened away upon his errand and he sped with the swiftness of light over the hills and the wooded slopes and the deep dark valleys and the fields and forests and sleeping hamlets until he came to the place where dwelt the swarthy elves and the cunning dwarf andvari there the river rhine no larger than a meadowbrook breaks forth from beneath a mountain of ice which the frost giants and blind old hoder the winterking had built long years before for they had vainly hoped that they might imprison the river at its fountainhead but the babybrook had eaten its way beneath the frozen mass and had sprung out from its prison and gone on leaping and smiling and kissing the sunlight in its everwidening course towards burgundy and the sea loki came to this place because he knew that here was the home of the elves who had laid up the greatest hoard of treasures ever known in the midworld he scanned with careful eyes the mountainside and the deep rocky caverns and the dark gorge through which the little river rushed but in the dim moonlight not a living being could he see save a lazy salmon swimming in the quieter eddies of the stream any one but loki would have lost all hope of finding treasure there at least before the dawn of day but his wits were quick and his eyes were very sharp one salmon has brought us into this trouble and another shall help us out of it he cried then swift as thought he sprang again into the air and the magic shoes carried him with greater speed than before down the rhine valley and through burgundyland and the low meadows until he came to the shores of the great north sea he sought the halls of old aegir the oceanking but he wist not which way to go whether across the north sea towards isenland or whether along the narrow channel between britainland and the main while he paused uncertain where to turn he saw the palehaired daughters of old aegir the whiteveiled waves playing in the moonlight near the shore of them he asked the way to aegirs hall seven days journey westward said they beyond the green isle of erin is our fathers hall seven days journey northward on the bleak norwegian shore is our fathers hall and they stopped not once in their play but rippled and danced on the shelving beach or dashed with force against the shore where is your mother ran the queen of the ocean asked loki and they answered in the deep seacaves by the sounding shore in the dashing waves when the wild storms roar in her cold green bowers in the northern fiords she lurks and she glowers she grasps and she hoards and she spreads her strong net for her prey loki waited to hear no more but he sprang into the air and the magic shoes carried him onwards over the water in search of the oceanqueen he had not gone far when his sharp eyes espied her lurking near a rocky shore against which the breakers dashed with frightful fury half hidden in the deep dark water she lay waiting and watching and she spread her cunning net upon the waves and reached out with her long greedy fingers to seize whatever booty might come near her when the wary queen saw loki she hastily drew in her net and tried to hide herself in the shadows of an overhanging rock but loki called her by name and said sister ran fear not i am your friend loki whom once you served as a guest in aegirs goldlit halls then the oceanqueen came out into the bright moonlight and welcomed loki to her domain and asked why does loki thus wander so far from asgard and over the trackless waters and loki answered i have heard of the net which you spread upon the waves and from which no creature once caught in its meshes can ever escape i have found a salmon where the rhinespring gushes from beneath the mountains and a very cunning salmon he is for no common skill can catch him come i pray with your wondrous net and cast it into the stream where he lies do but take the wary fish for me and you shall have more gold than you have taken in a year from the wrecks of stranded vessels i dare not go cried ran a bound is set beyond which i may not venture if all the gold of earth were offered me i could not go then lend me your net entreated loki lend me your net and i will bring it back tomorrow filled with gold much i would like your gold answered ran but i cannot lend my net should i do so i might lose the richest prize that has ever come into my husbands kingdom for three days now a goldrigged ship bearing a princely crew with rich armor and abundant wealth has been sailing carelessly over these seas tomorrow i shall send my daughters and the bewitching mermaids to decoy the vessel among the rocks and into my net the ship and the brave warriors and all their armor and gold shall fall a rich prize it will be no i cannot part with my net even for a single hour but loki knew the power of flattering words beautiful queen said he there is no one on earth nor even in asgard who can equal you in wisdom and foresight yet i promise you that if you will but lend me your net until the morning dawns the ship and the crew of which you speak shall be yours and all their golden treasures shall deck your azure halls in the deep sea then ran carefully folded the net and gave it to loki remember your promise was all that she said an asa never forgets he answered and he turned his face again towards rhineland and the magic shoes bore him aloft and carried him in a moment back to the icemountain and the gorge and the infant river which he had so lately left the salmon still rested in his place and had not moved during lokis short absence loki unfolded the net and cast it into the stream the cunning fish tried hard to avoid being caught in its meshes but dart which way he would he met the skilfully woven cords and these drew themselves around him and held him fast then loki pulled the net up out of the water and grasped the helpless fish in his right hand but lo as he held the struggling creature high in the air it was no longer a fish but the cunning dwarf andvari thou king of the elves cried loki thy cunning has not saved thee tell me on thy life where thy hidden treasures lie the wise dwarf knew who it was that thus held him as in a vise and he answered frankly for it was his only hope of escape turn over the stone upon which you stand beneath it you will find the treasure you seek then loki put his shoulder to the rock and pushed with all his might but it seemed as firm as the mountain and would not be moved help us thou cunning dwarf he cried help us and thou shalt have thy life the dwarf put his shoulder to the rock and it turned over as if by magic and underneath was disclosed a wondrous chamber whose walls shone brighter than the sun and on whose floor lay treasures of gold and glittering gemstones such as no man had ever seen and loki in great haste seized upon the hoard and placed it in the magic net which he had borrowed from the oceanqueen then he came out of the chamber and andvari again put his shoulder to the rock which lay at the entrance and it swung back noiselessly to its place what is that upon thy finger suddenly cried loki wouldst keep back a part of the treasure give me the ring thou hast but the dwarf shook his head and made answer i have given thee all the riches that the elves of the mountain have gathered since the world began this ring i cannot give thee for without its help we shall never be able to gather more treasures together and loki grew angry at these words of the dwarf and he seized the ring and tore it by force from andvaris fingers it was a wondrous little piece of mechanism shaped like a serpent coiled with its tail in its mouth and its scaly sides glittered with many a tiny diamond and its ruby eyes shone with an evil light when the dwarf knew that loki really meant to rob him of the ring he cursed it and all who should ever possess it saying may the illgotten treasure that you have seized tonight be your bane and the bane of all to whom it may come whether by fair means or by foul and the ring which you have torn from my hand may it entail upon the one who wears it sorrow and untold ills the loss of friends and a violent death the norns have spoken and thus it must be loki was pleased with these words and with the dark curses which the dwarf pronounced upon the gold for he loved wrongdoing for wrongdoings sake and he knew that no curses could ever make his own life more cheerless than it always had been so he thanked andvari for his curses and his treasures and throwing the magic net upon his shoulder he sprang again into the air and was carried swiftly back to hunaland and just before the dawn appeared in the east he alighted at the door of the farmhouse where odin and hoenir still lay bound with thongs and guarded by fafnir and regin then the farmer hreidmar brought the otters skin and spread it upon the ground and lo it grew and spread out on all sides until it covered an acre of ground and he cried out fulfil now your promise cover every hair of this hide with gold or with precious stones if you fail to do this then your lives by your own agreement are forfeited and we shall do with you as we list odin took the magic net from lokis shoulder and opening it he poured the treasures of the mountain elves upon the otterskin and loki and hoenir spread the yellow pieces carefully and evenly over every part of the furry hide but after every piece had been laid in its place hreidmar saw near the otters mouth a single hair uncovered and he declared that unless this hair too were covered the bargain would be unfulfilled and the treasures and lives of his prisoners would be forfeited and the asas looked at each other in dismay for not another piece of gold and not another precious stone could they find in the net although they searched with the greatest care at last odin took from his bosom the ring which loki had stolen from the dwarf for he had been so highly pleased with its form and workmanship that he had hidden it hoping that it would not be needed to complete the payment of the ransom and they laid the ring upon the uncovered hair and now no portion of the otters skin could be seen and fafnir and regin the ransom being paid loosed the shackles of odin and hoenir and bade the three huntsmen go on their way odin and hoenir at once shook off their human disguises and taking their own forms again hastened with all speed back to asgard but loki tarried a little while and said to hreidmar and his sons by your greediness and falsehood you have won for yourselves the curse of the earth which lies before you it shall be your bane it shall be the bane of every one who holds it it shall kindle strife between father and son between brother and brother it shall make you mean selfish beastly it shall transform you into monsters the noblest king among menfolk shall feel its curse such is gold and such it shall ever be to its worshippers and the ring which you have gotten shall impart to its possessor its own nature grasping snaky cold unfeeling shall he live and death through treachery shall be his doom then he turned away delighted that he had thus left the curse of andvari with hreidmar and his sons and hastened northward toward the sea for he wished to redeem the promise that he had made to the oceanqueen to bring back her magic net and to decoy the richly laden ship into her clutches no sooner were the strange huntsmen well out of sight than fafnir and regin began to ask their father to divide the glittering hoard with them by our strength and through our advice said they this great store has come into your hands let us place it in three equal heaps and then let each take his share and go his way at this the farmer waxed very angry and he loudly declared that he would keep all the treasure for himself and that his sons should not have any portion of it whatever so fafnir and regin nursing their disappointment went to the fields to watch their sheep but their father sat down to guard his newgotten treasure and he took in his hand the glittering serpentring and gazed into its cold ruby eyes and as he gazed all his thoughts were fixed upon his gold and there was no room in his heart for love toward his fellows nor for deeds of kindness nor for the worship of the allfather and behold as he continued to look at the snaky ring a dreadful change came over him the warm red blood which until that time had leaped through his veins and given him life and strength and human feelings became purple and cold and sluggish and selfishness like serpentpoison took hold of his heart then as he kept on gazing at the hoard which lay before him he began to lose his human shape his body lengthened into many scaly folds and he coiled himself around his loved treasures the very likeness of the ring upon which he had looked so long when the day drew near its close fafnir came back from the fields with his herd of sheep and thought to find his father guarding the treasure as he had left him in the morning but instead he saw a glittering snake fast asleep encircling the hoard like a huge scaly ring of gold his first thought was that the monster had devoured his father and hastily drawing his sword with one blow he severed the serpents head from its body and while yet the creature writhed in the deathagony he gathered up the hoard and fled with it beyond the hills of hunaland until on the seventh day he came to a barren heath far from the homes of men there he placed the treasures in one glittering heap and he clothed himself in a wondrous mailcoat of gold that was found among them and he put on the helmet of dread which had once been the terror of the midworld and the like of which no man had ever seen and then he gazed with greedy eyes upon the fateful ring until he too was changed into a cold and slimy reptile a monster dragon and he coiled himself about the hoard and with his restless eyes forever open he gloated day after day upon his loved gold and watched with ceaseless care that no one should come near to despoil him of it this was ages and ages ago and still he wallows among his treasures on the glittering heath and guards as of yore the garnered wealth of andvarien when i regin the younger brother came back in the late evening to my fathers dwelling i saw that the treasure had been carried away and when i beheld the dead serpent lying in its place i knew that a part of andvaris curse had been fulfilled and a strange fear came over me and i left every thing behind me and fled from that dwelling never more to return then i came to the land of the volsungs where your fathers fathers dwelt the noblest kingfolk that the world has ever seen but a longing for the gold and the treasure a hungry yearning that would never be satisfied filled my soul then for a time i sought to forget this craving i spent my days in the getting of knowledge and in teaching menfolk the ancient lore of my kin the dwarfs i taught them how to plant and to sow and to reap the yellow grain i showed them where the precious metals of the earth lie hidden and how to smelt iron from its ores how to shape the ploughshare and the spade the spear and the battleaxe i taught them how to tame the wild horses of the meadows and how to train the yokebeasts to the plough how to build lordly dwellings and mighty strongholds and how to sail in ships across old aegirs watery kingdom but they gave me no thanks for what i had done and as the years went by they forgot who had been their teacher and they said that it was frey who had given them this knowledge and skill and i taught the young maidens how to spin and weave and to handle the needle deftly to make rich garments and to work in tapestry and embroidery but they too forgot me and said that it was freyja who had taught them then i showed men how to read the mystic runes aright and how to make the sweet beverage of poetry that charms all hearts and enlightens the world but they say now that they had these gifts from odin i taught them how to fashion the tales of old into rich melodious songs and with music and sweetmouthed eloquence to move the minds of their fellowmen but they say that bragi taught them this and they remember me only as regin the elfin schoolmaster or at best as mimer the master of smiths at length my heart grew bitter because of the neglect and ingratitude of men and the old longing for andvaris hoard came back to me and i forgot much of my cunning and lore but i lived on and on and generations of shortlived men arose and passed and still the hoard was not mine for i was weak and no man was strong enough to help me then i sought wisdom of the norns the weird women who weave the woof of every creatures fateen and en how long asked i must i hope and wait in weary expectation of that day when the wealth of the world and the garnered wisdom of the ages shall be mine and the witches answered when a prince of the volsung race shall come who shall excel thee in the smithying craft and to whom the allfather shall give the shining hope as a helper then the days of thy weary watching shall cease how long asked i shall i live to enjoy this wealth and this wisdom and to walk as a god among men shall i be longlived as the asafolk and dwell on the earth until the last twilight comes it is written answered skuld that a beardless youth shall see thy death but go thou now and bide thy time here regin ended his story and both he and siegfried sat for a long time silent and thoughtful i know what you wish said siegfried at last you think that i am the prince of whom the weird sisters spoke and you would have me slay the dragon fafnir and win for you the hoard of andvari it is even so answered regin but the hoard is accursed said the lad let the curse be upon me was the answer is not the wisdom of the ages mine and think you that i cannot escape the curse is there aught that can prevail against him who has all knowledge and the wealth of the world at his call nothing but the word of the norns and the will of the allfather answered siegfried but will you help me asked regin almost wild with earnestness will you help me to win that which is rightfully mine and to rid the world of a horrible evil why is the hoard of andvari more thine than fafnirs he is a monster and he keeps the treasure but to gloat upon its glittering richness i will use it to make myself a name upon the earth i will not hoard it away but i am weak and he is strong and terrible will you help me tomorrow said siegfried be ready to go with me to the glittering heath the treasure shall be thine and also the curse and also the curse echoed regin adventure iv fafnir the dragon regin took up his harp and his fingers smote the strings and the music which came forth sounded like the wail of the winters wind through the dead treetops of the forest and the song which he sang was full of grief and wild hopeless yearning for the things which were not to be when he had ceased siegfried said that was indeed a sorrowful song for one to sing who sees his hopes so nearly realized why are you so sad is it because you fear the curse which you have taken upon yourself or is it because you know not what you will do with so vast a treasure and its possession begins already to trouble you oh many are the things i will do with that treasure answered regin and his eyes flashed wildly and his face grew red and pale i will turn winter into summer i will make the desertplaces glad i will bring back the golden age i will make myself a god for mine shall be the wisdom and the gathered wealth of the world and yet i fear what do you fear the ring the ring it is accursed the norns too have spoken and my doom is known i cannot escape it the norns have woven the woof of every mans life answered siegfried tomorrow we fare to the glittering heath and the end shall be as the norns have spoken and so early the next morning siegfried mounted greyfell and rode out towards the desertland that lay beyond the forest and the barren mountainrange and regin his eyes flashing with desire and his feet never tiring trudged by his side for seven days they wended their way through the thick greenwood sleeping at night on the bare ground beneath the trees while the wolves and other wild beasts of the forest filled the air with their hideous howlings but no evil creature dared come near them for fear of the shining beams of light which fell from greyfells gleaming mane on the eighth day they came to the open country and to the hills where the land was covered with black bowlders and broken by yawning chasms and no living thing was seen there not even an insect nor a blade of grass and the silence of the grave was over all and the earth was dry and parched and the sun hung above them like a painted shield in a blueblack sky and there was neither shade nor water anywhere but siegfried rode onwards in the way which regin pointed out and faltered not although he grew faint with thirst and with the overpowering heat towards the evening of the next day they came to a dark mountainwall which stretched far out on either hand and rose high above them so steep that it seemed to close up the way and to forbid them going farther this is the wall cried regin beyond this mountain is the glittering heath and the goal of all my hopes and the little old man ran forwards and scaled the rough side of the mountain and reached its summit while siegfried and greyfell were yet toiling among the rocks at its foot slowly and painfully they climbed the steep ascent sometimes following a narrow path which wound along the edge of a precipice sometimes leaping from rock to rock or over some deep gorge and sometimes picking their way among the crags and cliffs the sun at last went down and one by one the stars came out and the moon was rising round and red when siegfried stood by regins side and gazed from the mountaintop down upon the glittering heath which lay beyond and a strange weird scene it was that met his sight at the foot of the mountain was a river white and cold and still and beyond it was a smooth and barren plain lying silent and lonely in the pale moonlight but in the distance was seen a circle of flickering flames ever changing now growing brighter now fading away and now shining with a dull cold light like the glimmer of the glowworm or the foxfire and as siegfried gazed upon the scene he saw the dim outline of some hideous monster moving hither and thither and seeming all the more terrible in the uncertain light it is he whispered regin and his lips were ashy pale and his knees trembled beneath him it is fafnir and he wears the helmet of terror shall we not go back to the smithy by the great forest and to the life of ease and safety that may be ours there or will you rather dare to go forwards and meet the terror in its abode none but cowards give up an undertaking once begun answered siegfried go back to rhineland yourself if you are afraid but you must go alone you have brought me thus far to meet the dragon of the heath to win the hoard of the swarthy elves and to rid the world of a terrible evil before the setting of another sun the deed which you have urged me to do will be done then he dashed down the eastern slope of the mountain leaving greyfell and the trembling regin behind him soon he stood on the banks of the white river which lay between the mountain and the heath but the stream was deep and sluggish and the channel was very wide he paused a moment wondering how he should cross and the air seemed heavy with deadly vapors and the water was thick and cold while he thus stood in thought a boat came silently out of the mists and drew near and the boatman stood up and called to him and said what man are you who dares come into this land of loneliness and fear i am siegfried answered the lad and i have come to slay fafnir the terror sit in my boat said the boatman and i will carry you across the river and siegfried sat by the boatmans side and without the use of an oar and without a breath of air to drive it forwards the little vessel turned and moved silently towards the farther shore in what way will you fight the dragon asked the boatman with my trusty sword balmung i shall slay him answered siegfried but he wears the helmet of terror and he breathes deathly poisons and his eyes dart forth lightning and no man can withstand his strength said the boatman i will find some way by which to overcome him then be wise and listen to me said the boatman as you go up from the river you will find a road worn deep and smooth starting from the waters edge and winding over the moor it is the trail of fafnir adown which he comes at dawn of every day to slake his thirst at the river do you dig a pit in this roadway a pit narrow and deep and hide yourself within it in the morning when fafnir passes over it let him feel the edge of balmung as the man ceased speaking the boat touched the shore and siegfried leaped out he looked back to thank his unknown friend but neither boat nor boatman was to be seen only a thin white mist rose slowly from the cold surface of the stream and floated upwards and away towards the mountaintops then the lad remembered that the strange boatman had worn a blue hood bespangled with golden stars and that a gray kirtle was thrown over his shoulders and that his one eye glistened and sparkled with a light that was more than human and he knew that he had again talked with odin then with a braver heart than before he went forwards along the riverbank until he came to fafnirs trail a deep wide furrow in the earth beginning at the rivers bank and winding far away over the heath until it was lost to sight in the darkness the bottom of the trail was soft and slimy and its sides had been worn smooth by fafnirs frequent travel through it in this road at a point not far from the river siegfried with his trusty sword balmung scooped out a deep and narrow pit as odin had directed and when the gray dawn began to appear in the east he hid himself within this trench and waited for the coming of the monster he had not long to wait for no sooner had the sky begun to redden in the light of the coming sun than the dragon was heard bestirring himself siegfried peeped warily from his hidingplace and saw him coming far down the road hurrying with all speed that he might quench his thirst at the sluggish river and hasten back to his gold and the sound which he made was like the trampling of many feet and the jingling of many chains with bloodshot eyes and gaping mouth and flaming nostrils the hideous creature came rushing onwards his sharp curved claws dug deep into the soft earth and his batlike wings half trailing on the ground half flapping in the air made a sound like that which is heard when thor rides in his goatdrawn chariot over the dark thunderclouds it was a terrible moment for siegfried but still he was not afraid he crouched low down in his hidingplace and the bare blade of the trusty balmung glittered in the morning light on came the hastening feet and the flapping wings the red gleam from the monsters flaming nostrils lighted up the trench where siegfried lay he heard a roaring and a rushing like the sound of a whirlwind in the forest then a black inky mass rolled above him and all was dark now was siegfrieds opportunity the bright edge of balmung gleamed in the darkness one moment and then it smote the heart of fafnir as he passed some men say that odin sat in the pit with siegfried and strengthened his arm and directed his sword or else he could not thus have slain the terror but be this as it may the victory was soon won the monster stopped short while but half of his long body had glided over the pit for sudden death had overtaken him his horrid head fell lifeless upon the ground his cold wings flapped once and then lay quivering and helpless spread out on either side and streams of thick black blood flowed from his heart through the wound beneath and filled the trench in which siegfried was hidden and ran like a mountaintorrent down the road towards the river siegfried was covered from head to foot with the slimy liquid and had he not quickly leaped from his hidingplace he would have been drowned in the swiftrushing streamen the bright sun rose in the east and gilded the mountaintops and fell upon the still waters of the river and lighted up the treeless plains around the south wind played gently against siegfrieds cheeks and in his long hair as he stood gazing on his fallen foe and the sound of singing birds and rippling waters and gay insects such as had not broken the silence of the glittering heath for ages came to his ears the terror was dead and nature had awakened from her sleep of dread and as the lad leaned upon his sword and thought of the deed he had done behold the shining greyfell with the beaming hopeful mane having crossed the now bright river stood by his side and regin his face grown wondrous cold came trudging over the meadows and his heart was full of guile then the mountain vultures came wheeling downwards to look upon the dead dragon and with them were two ravens black as midnight and when siegfried saw these ravens he knew them to be odins birds hugin thought and munin memory and they alighted on the ground near by and the lad listened to hear what they would say then hugin flapped his wings and said the deed is done why tarries the hero and munin said the world is wide fame waits for the hero and hugin answered what if he win the hoard of the elves that is not honor let him seek fame by nobler deeds then munin flew past his ear and whispered beware of regin the master his heart is poisoned he would be thy bane and the two birds flew away to carry the news to odin in the happy halls of gladsheim when regin drew near to look upon the dragon siegfried kindly accosted him but he seemed not to hear and a snaky glitter lurked in his eyes and his mouth was set and dry and he seemed as one walking in a dream it is mine now he murmured it is all mine now the hoard of the swarthy elffolk the garnered wisdom of ages the strength of the world is mine i will keep i will save i will heap up and none shall have part or parcel of the treasure which is mine alone then his eyes fell upon siegfried and his cheeks grew dark with wrath and he cried out why are you here in my way i am the lord of the glittering heath i am the master of the hoard i am the master and you are my thrall siegfried wondered at the change which had taken place in his old master but he only smiled at his strange words and made no answer you have slain my brother regin cried and his face grew fearfully black and his mouth foamed with rage it was my deed and yours calmly answered siegfried i have rid the world of a terror i have righted a grievous wrong you have slain my brother said regin and a murderers ransom you shall pay take the hoard for your ransom and let us each wend his way said the lad the hoard is mine by rights answered regin still more wrathfully i am the master and you are my thrall why stand you in my way then blinded with madness he rushed at siegfried as if to strike him down but his foot slipped in a puddle of gore and he pitched headlong against the sharp edge of balmung so sudden was this movement and so unlooked for that the sword was twitched out of siegfrieds hand and fell with a dull splash into the bloodfilled pit before him while regin slain by his own rashness sank dead upon the ground full of horror siegfried turned away and mounted greyfellen this is a place of blood said he and the way to glory leads not through it let the hoard still lie on the glittering heath i will go my way from hence and the world shall know me for better deeds than this and he turned his back on the fearful scene and rode away and so swiftly did greyfell carry him over the desert land and the mountain waste that when night came they stood on the shore of the great north sea and the white waves broke at their feet and the lad sat for a long time silent upon the warm white sand of the beach and greyfell waited at his side and he watched the stars as they came out one by one and the moon as it rose round and pale and moved like a queen across the sky and the night wore away and the stars grew pale and the moon sank to rest in the wilderness of waters and at daydawn siegfried looked towards the west and midway between sky and sea he thought he saw dark mountaintops hanging above a land of mists that seemed to float upon the edge of the sea while he looked a white ship with sails all set came speeding over the waters towards him it came nearer and nearer and the sailors rested upon their oars as it glided into the quiet harbor a minstrel with long white beard floating in the wind sat at the prow and the sweet music from his harp was wafted like incense to the shore the vessel touched the sands its white sails were reefed as if by magic and the crew leaped out upon the beach hail siegfried the golden cried the harper whither do you fare this summer day i have come from a land of horror and dread answered the lad and i would fain fare to a brighter then go with me to awaken the earth from its slumber and to robe the fields in their garbs of beauty said the harper and he touched the strings of his harp and strains of the softest music arose in the still morning air and siegfried stood entranced for never before had he heard such music tell me who you are he cried when the sounds died away tell me who you are and i will go to the ends of the earth with you i am bragi answered the harper smiling and siegfried noticed then that the ship was laden with flowers of every hue and that thousands of singing birds circled around and above it filling the air with the sound of their glad twitterings now bragi was the sweetest musician in all the world it was said by some that his home was with the songbirds and that he had learned his skill from them but this was only part of the truth for wherever there was loveliness or beauty or things noble and pure there was bragi and his wondrous power in music and song was but the outward sign of a blameless soul when he touched the strings of his golden harp all nature was charmed with the sweet harmony the savage beasts of the wood crept near to listen the birds paused in their flight the waves of the sea were becalmed and the winds were hushed the leaping waterfall was still and the rushing torrent tarried in its bed the elves forgot their hidden treasures and joined in silent dance around him and the stromkarls and the musicians of the wood vainly tried to imitate him and he was as fair of speech as he was skilful in song his words were so persuasive that he had been known to call the fishes from the sea to move great lifeless rocks and what is harder the hearts of kings he understood the voice of the birds and the whispering of the breeze the murmur of the waves and the roar of the waterfalls he knew the length and breadth of the earth and the secrets of the sea and the language of the stars and every day he talked with odin the allfather and with the wise and good in the sunlit halls of gladsheim and once every year he went to the northlands and woke the earth from its long winters sleep and scattered music and smiles and beauty everywhereen right gladly did siegfried agree to sail with bragi over the sea for he wot that the bright asagod would be a very different guide from the cunning evileyed regin so he went on board with bragi and the gleaming greyfell followed them and the sailors sat at their oars and bragi stood in the prow and touched the strings of his harp and as the music arose the white sails leaped up the masts and a warm south breeze began to blow and the little vessel wafted by sweet sounds and the incense of spring sped gladly away over the sea adventure v in aegirs kingdom the vessel in which siegfried sailed was soon far out at sea for the balmy south wind and the songs of the birds and the music from bragis harp all urged it cheerily on and siegfried sat at the helm and guided it in its course by and by they lost all sight of land and the sailors wist not where they were but they knew that bragi the wise would bring them safely into some haven whenever it should so please him and they felt no fear and the fishes leaped up out of the water as the white ship sped by on woven wings and the monsters of the deep paused and listened to the sweet music which floated down from above after a time the vessel began to meet great icemountains in the sea mountains which the reifriesen and old hoder the king of the winter months had sent drifting down from the frozen land of the north but these melted at the sound of bragis music and at the sight of siegfrieds radiant armor and the cold breath of the frostgiants which had driven them in their course turned and became the ally of the south wind at length they came in sight of a dark shore which stretched on either hand north and south as far as the eye could reach and as they drew nearer they saw a line of huge mountains rising as it were out of the water and stretching their gray heads far above the clouds and the overhanging cliffs seemed to look down half in anger half in pity upon the little white winged vessel which had dared thus to sail through these unknown waters but the surface of the sea was smooth as glass and the gentle breeze drove the ship slowly forwards through the calm water and along the rockbound coast and within the dark shadows of the mountainpeaks long ago the frostgiants had piled great heaps of snow upon these peaks and built huge fortresses of ice between and sought indeed to clasp in their cold embrace the whole of the norwegian land but the breezes of the southland that came with bragis ship now played among the rocky steeps and swept over the frozen slopes above and melted the snow and ice and thousands of rivulets of halffrozen water ran down the mountainsides and tumbled into rocky gorges or plunged into the sea and the grass began to grow on the sunny slopes and the flowers peeped up through the halfmelted snow and the music of spring was heard on every side now and then the little vessel passed by deep dark inlets enclosed between high mountainwalls and reaching many leagues far into land but the sailors steered clear of these shadowy fjords for they said that ran the dread oceanqueen lived there and spread her nets in the deep green waters to entangle unwary seafaring men and the sound of bragis harp awakened all sleeping things and it was carried from rock to rock and from mountainheight to valley and was borne on the breeze far up the fjords and all over the land one day as they were sailing through these quiet waters beneath the overhanging cliffs bragi tuned his harp and sang a song of sea and then he told siegfried a story of aegir and his goldlit hall old aegir was the oceanking at most times he was rude and rough and his manners were uncouth and boisterous but when balder the shining one smiled kindly upon him from above or when bragi played his harp by the seashore or sailed his ship on the waters the heart of the bluff old king was touched with a kindly feeling and he tried hard to curb his ungentle passions and to cease his blustering ways he was one of the old race of giants and men believe that he would have been a very good and quiet giant had it not been for the evil ways of his wife the crafty queen ran for however kind at heart the king might be his good intentions were almost always thwarted by the queen ran could never be trusted and no one unless it were loki the mischiefmaker could ever say any thing in her praise she was always lurking among hidden rocks or in the deep sea or along the shores of silent fjords and reaching out with her long lean fingers seeking to clutch in her greedy grasp whatever prey might unwarily come near her and many richlyladen vessels and many brave seamen and daring warriors had she dragged down to her bluehung chamber in old aegirs hall and this is the story that bragi told of the feast in aegirs hall it happened long ago when the good folk at gladsheim were wont to visit the midworld oftener than now on a day in early autumn queen ran with her older daughters raging sea breaker billow surge and surf went out to search for plunder but old aegir staid at home and with him his younger daughters fair purplehair gentle diver dancing ripple and smiling skyclear and as they played around him and kissed his old stormbeaten cheeks the heart of the king was softened into gentleness and he began to think kindly of the green earth which bordered his kingdom and of the brave men who lived there but most of all did he think of the great and good asafolk who dwell in asgard and overlook the affairs of the world then he called his servants funfeng and elder and bade them prepare a feast in his goldlit hall and he sent fleet messengers to invite the asafolk to come and partake of the good cheer and his four young daughters played upon the beach and smiled and danced in the beaming sunlight and the hearts of many seafaring men were gladdened that day as they spread their sails to the wind for they saw before them a pleasant voyage and the happy issue of many an undertaking long before the day had begun to wane the asafolk arrived in a body at aegirs hall for they were glad to answer the bidding of the oceanking odin came riding sleipner his eightfooted steed thor rode in his iron chariot drawn by goats frey came with gullinburste his goldenbristled boar there too was the warlike tyr and blind hoder and the silent vidar and the sage forsete and the hearkening heimdal and niord the ruler of the winds and bragi with his harp and lastly came many elves the thralls of the asafolk and loki the cunning mischiefmaker in his rude but hearty way old aegir welcomed them and they went down into his amber hall and rested themselves upon the seagreen couches that had been spread for them and a thousand fair mermaids stood around them and breathed sweet melodies through seashells of rainbow hue while the gentle whiteveiled daughters of the oceanking danced to the bewitching music hours passed by and the sun began to slope towards the west and the waiting guests grew hungry and ill at ease and then they began to wonder why the feast was so long in getting ready at last the host himself became impatient and he sent out in haste for his servants funfeng and elder trembling with fear they came and stood before him master said they we know that you are angry because the feast is not yet made ready but we beg that your anger may not fall upon us the truth is that some thief has stolen your brewingkettle and we have no ale for your guests then old aegirs brow grew dark and his breath came quick and fast and had not niord held the winds tightly clutched in his hand there would have been a great uproar in the hall even as it was the mermaids fled away in great fright and the whiteveiled waves stopped dancing and a strange silence fell upon all the company some enemy has done this crier aegir as soon as he could speak some enemy has taken away my brewingkettle and unless we can find it i fear our feast will be but a dry one then thor said if any one knows where this kettle is let him speak and i will bring it back and i promise you you shall not wait long for the feast but not one in all this company knew aught about the missing kettle at last tyr stood up and said if we cannot find the same vessel that our host has lost mayhap we may find another as good i know a dogwise giant who lives east of the rivers elivagar and who has a strong kettle fully a mile deep and large enough to brew ale for all the world that is the very kettle we want cried thor think you that we can get it if we are cunning enough we may answered tyr but old hymer will never give it up willingly is it hymer of whom you speak asked thor then i know him well and willingly or not willingly he must let us have his kettle for what is a feast without the gladsome ale then thor and tyr set out on their journey towards the land of elivagar and they travelled many a league northwards across snowy mountains and barren plains until they came to the shores of the frozen sea and there the sun rises and sets but once a year and even in summer the sea is full of ice on the lonely beach stood hymers dwelling a dark and gloomy abode tyr knocked at the door and it was opened by hymers wife a strangely handsome woman who bade them come in inside the hall they saw hymers old mother sitting in the chimneycorner and crooning over the smouldering fire she was a horribly ugly old giantess with nine hundred heads but every head was blind and deaf and toothless ah me what a wretched old age that must have been is your husband at home asked thor speaking to the pretty woman who had opened the door he is not was the answer he is catching fish in the warm waters of the sheltered bay or mayhap he is tending his cows in the open sea just around the headland for the great icebergs that float down from the frozen sea are called old hymers cows we have come a very long journey said tyr will you not give two tired strangers food and lodging until they shall have rested themselves the woman seemed in nowise loath to do this and she set before the two asafolk a plentiful meal of the best that she had in the house when they had eaten she told them that it would be far safer for them to hide themselves under the great kettles in the hall for she said her husband would soon be home and he might not be kind to them so thor and tyr hid themselves and listened for hymers coming after a time the great halldoor opened and they heard the heavy steps of the giant welcome home cried the woman as hymer shook the frost from his hair and beard and stamped the snow from his feet i am so glad that you have come for there are two strangers in the hall and they have asked for you one of them i know is thor the foe of the giants and the friend of man the other is the onearmed god of war the brave tyr what can be their errand at hymers hall where are they roared hymer stamping so furiously that even his deaf old mother seemed to hear and lifted up her heads they are under the kettles at the gableend of the hall answered the woman hymer cast a wrathful glance towards the place the post at the end of the hall was shivered in pieces by his very look the beam that upheld the floor of the loft was broken and all the kettles tumbled down with a fearful crash thor and tyr crept out from among the rubbish and stood before old hymer the giant was not well pleased at the sight of such guests come thus unbidden to his hall but he knew that his rude strength would count as nothing if matched with their skill and weapons hence he deemed it wise to treat the two asas as his friends and to meet them with cunning and strategy welcome to my hall he cried fear no hurt from hymer for he was never known to harm a guest and thor and tyr were given the warmest seats at the fireside and the giant ordered his thralls to kill the fatted oxen and to make ready a great feast in honor of his guests and while the meal was being got ready he sat by thors side and asked him many questions about what was going on in the great southland and thor answered him pleasantly meeting guile with guile when the feast was in readiness all sat down at the table which groaned beneath its weight of meat and drink for hymers thralls had killed three fat oxen and baked them whole for this meal and they had filled three huge bowls with ale from his great brewingkettle hymer ate and drank very fast and wished to make his guests fear him because he could eat so much but thor was not to be taken aback in this way for he at once ate two of the oxen and quaffed a huge bowl of ale which the giant had set aside for himself the giant saw that he was outdone and he arose from the table saying not all my cows would serve to feed two guests so hungry as these we shall be obliged to live on fish now he strode out of the hall without another word and began getting his boat ready for a sail but thor followed him it is a fine day for fishing said thor gayly how i should like to go out with you such little fellows as you would better stay at home growled hymer but let me go with you persisted thor i can certainly row the boat while you fish i have no need of help from such a stunted pygmy muttered the giant you could not be of the least use to me you would only be in my way still if you are bent on doing so you may go and you shall take all the risks if i go as far as i do sometimes and stay as long as i often do you may make up your mind never to see the dry land again for you will certainly catch your death of cold and be food for the fishes if indeed they would deign to eat such a scrawny scrap these taunting words made thor so angry that he grasped his hammer and was sorely tempted to crush the giants skull but he checked himself and coolly said i pray you not to trouble yourself on my account i have set my head on going with you and go i will tell me where i can find something that i can use for bait and i will be ready in a trice i have no bait for you roughly answered hymer you must look for it yourself half a dozen oxen the very finest and fattest of hymers herd were grazing on the short grass which grew on the sunnier slopes of the hillside for not all of the giants cattle had yet taken to the water when thor saw these great beasts he ran quickly towards them and seizing the largest one which hymer called the heavenbreaker he twisted off his head as easily as he would that of a small fowl and ran back with it to the boat hymer looked at him in anger and amazement but said nothing and the two pushed the boat off from the shore the little vessel sped through the water more swiftly than it had ever done before for thor plied the oars in a moment the long low beach was out of sight and hymer who had never travelled so fast began to feel frightened stop he cried here is the place to fish i have often caught great store of flatfish here let us out with our lines no no answered thor and he kept on plying the oars we are not yet far enough from shore the best fish are still many leagues out and the boat skimmed onwards through the waters and the white spray dashed over the prow and hymer now very much frightened sat still and looked at his strange fellowfisherman but said not a word on and on they went and the shore behind them first grew dim and then sank out of sight and the high mountaintops began to fade away in the sky and then were seen no more and when at last the fishermen were so far out at sea that nothing was in sight but the rolling waters on every side thor stopped his rowing we have come too far cried the giant trembling in every limb the great midgard snake lies hereabouts let us turn back not yet answered thor quietly we will fish here a little while without loss of time he took from his pocket a strong hook wonderfully made to which he fastened a long line as strong as ten ships cables twisted together then he carefully baited the hook with the gory head of the heavenbreaker ox and threw it into the water as the giant had feared they were now right over the head of the great midgard snake the huge beast looked upward with his sleepy eyes and saw the tempting bait falling slowly through the water but he did not see the boat it was so far above him thinking of no harm he opened his leathern jaws and greedily gulped the morsel down but the strong iron hook stuck fast in his throat maddened by the pain he began to lash his tail against the floor of the sea and he twisted and writhed until the ocean was covered with foam and the waves ran mountainhigh but thor pulled hard upon the line above and strove to lift the reptiles head out of the water then the snake darted with lightning speed away pulling the boat after him so swiftly that had not thor held on to the oarlocks he would have been thrown into the sea quickly he tightened his magic girdle of strength around him and standing up in the boat he pulled with all his might the snake would not be lifted but the boat split in two and thor slid into the water and stood upon the bottom of the sea he seized the great snake in his hands and raised his head clean above the water what a scene of frightful turmoil was there then the earth shook the mountains belched forth fire the lightnings flashed the caves howled and the sky grew black and red nobody knows what the end would have been had not hymer reached over and cut the strong cord the slippery snake glided out of thors hands and hid himself in the deep sea and every thing became quiet again silently thor and hymer sat in the broken boat and rowed swiftly back towards land thor felt really ashamed of himself because he had gained nothing by his venture and the giant was not at all happy when they reached the frozen shore and hymers cheerless castle again they found tyr there anxiously waiting for them he felt that they were tarrying too long in this dreary place and he wished to be back among his fellows in old aegirs hall hymer felt very cross and ugly because his boat had been broken and when they came into the hall he said to thor you may think that you are very stout you who dared attack the midgard snake and lifted him out of the sea yet there are many little things that you cannot do for instance here is the earthen goblet from which i drink my ale great men like myself can crush such goblets between their thumbs and fingers but such puny fellows as you will find that they cannot break it by any means let me try cried thor he took the great goblet in his hands and threw it with all his strength against a stone post in the middle of the hall the post was shattered into a thousand pieces but the goblet was unharmed ha ha laughed the giant try again thor did so this time he threw it against a huge granite rock that stood like a mountain near the seashore the rock crumbled in pieces and fell but the goblet was whole as ever what a very stout fellow you are cried hymer in glee go home now and tell the good asafolk that you cannot even break a goblet let me try once more said thor amazed but not disheartened throw it against hymers forehead whispered some one over his shoulder it is harder than any rock thor looked and saw that it was the giants handsome wife who had given him this kind advice he took the goblet and hurled it quickly straight at old hymers head the giant had no time to dodge the vessel struck him squarely between the eyes and was shattered into ten thousand little pieces but the giants forehead was unhurt that drink was rather hot cried hymer trying to joke at his ill luck but it doesnt take a very great man to break a goblet there is one thing however that you cannot do yonder is my great brewingkettle a mile deep no man has ever lifted it now if you will carry it out of the hall where it sits you may have it for your own agreed cried thor it is a fair bargain and if i fail i will go home and never trouble you again then he took hold of the edge of the great kettle and lifted it with all his might the floor of hymers hall broke under him and the walls and roof came tumbling down but he turned the kettle over his head and walked away with it the great rings of the vessel clattering at his heels tyr went before him and cleared the way and hymer gazed after him in utter amazement the two asafolk had fairly won the brewingkettle in due time they reached old aegirs hall where the guests were still waiting for them some said that they had been gone three days but most agreed that it was only three hours be that as it may aegirs thralls funfeng and elder brewed great store of ale in the kettle which thor had brought and when the guests were seated at the table the foaming liquor passed itself around to each and there was much merriment and glad good cheer and old aegir was so happy in the pleasant company of the asafolk that men say that he forgot to blow and bluster for a full six months thereafteren such was the story which the wise harper told to siegfried as they sailed gayly along the norwegian shore and with many other pleasant tales did they beguile the hours away and no one ever thought of danger for the sky was blue and cloudless and besides this bragi himself was on board and he could charm and control the rudest elements one day however the sea became unaccountably ruffled there was no wind but yet the waves rose suddenly and threatened to overwhelm the little ship quickly the sailors sprang to their oars and tried by rowing to drive the vessel away from the shore and into the quieter waters of the open sea but all their strength was of no avail the swift stream carried the little bark onward in its course as an autumn leaf is borne on the bosom of a mighty river then the whole surface of the water seemed lashed into fury the waves formed hundreds of currents each stronger than a mountain torrent and each seeming to follow a course of its own they clashed wildly against each other they heaved and boiled and hissed and threw great clouds of spray high into the air they formed deep whirlpools which twisted and twirled and broke into a thousand eddies and then plunged deep down into rocky caverns beneath or laid bare the bottom of the sea the helpless ship was carried round and round swiftly and more swiftly still and vain were the efforts of the crew to steer her out of the seething caldron of waters then the cheeks of the sailors grew white with fear and they dropped their oars and clung to the masts and ropes and cried out alas we are lost this is old aegirs brewingkettle but siegfried stood by the helm and said if that be true then we may sup with him in his goldlit hall and all this time bragi slept in the hold and no one dared awaken him faster and faster the ship was carried round the seething pool the flying spray was frozen in the air and it filled the masts with snow and pattered like heavy hail upon the deck the light of the sun seemed shut out and darkness closed around a dismal chasm yawned deep before them and in the gray gloom the ships crew saw many wondrous things great seamonsters swam among the rocks and seemed not to heed the uproar above them lovely mermaids sat in their greenandpurple caves and combed their tresses of golden hair and thoughtful mermen groped among the seaweeds searching hopefully for lost or hidden treasures then siegfried caught a glimpse of the mighty aegir sitting in his banquetroom and as he quaffed his foaming ale he called aloud to his daughters to leave their play and come to their father in his goldlit hall and the whiteveiled waves answered to their names and came at his call first raging sea entered the wide hall and sat by the oceankings side then billow then surge then surf and breakers then came the purplehaired and the diver but aegirs two youngest daughters laughing ripple and smiling skyclear came not at their fathers beck but lingered to play among the rocks and in the open sea so deeply engaged was siegfried in watching this scene that he did not notice bragi who now came upon the deck with his harp in his hand and sweet music arose from among the dashing waves and was heard far down in the deep seacaverns and even in aegirs hall and when siegfried looked up again the eddying whirlpools and the threatening waves and the flying spray were no more but the ship was gliding over the quiet waters of a deep blue sea and the sun was shining brightly in the clear sky above then an east wind filled the sails and as bragis music rose sweeter and higher they glided swiftly away from the coast and soon the snowcapped mountainpeaks grew dim in the distance and then sank from sight many days they sailed over an unknown sea and towards an unknown land and none but bragi knew what the end of their voyage would be and yet no one doubted or was afraid for the secrets of the earth and the sea were known to the sweet singer after a time the water became as smooth as glass not a ripple moved upon its surface and not the slightest breath of air stirred among the idlyhanging sails then the sailors went to their oars but they seemed overcome with languor and sleepiness and only when bragi played upon his harp did they move their oars with their wonted strength and quickness and at last they came in sight of a long low coast and a shelving beach up which the tide was slowly creeping in drowsy silence and not half a league from the shore was a grand old castle with a tall tower and many turrets and broad halls and high battlements and in the light of the setting sun every thing was as green as emerald or as the fresh grass of early spring and a pale flickering light gleamed on the castlewalls and the moat seemed filled with a glowing fire the ship glided silently up to the sandy beach and the sailors moored it to the shore but siegfried heard no sound upon the land nor could he see any moving living thing silence brooded everywhere and the castle and its inmates seemed to be wrapped in slumber the sentinels could be seen upon the ramparts standing like statues of stone and showing no signs of life while above the barbacan gate the watchman was at his post motionless and asleep adventure vi brunhild siegfried and the harper sat together in the little ship as it lay moored to the sandy shore and their eyes were turned towards the seagreen castle and its glowing walls and they looked in vain for any movement or any sign of wakeful life every thing was still not a breath of air was stirring the leaves of the trees hung motionless as if they too were asleep the great green banner on the towers top clung around the flagstaff as if it had never fluttered to the breeze no song of birds nor hum of insects came to their ears there was neither sound nor motion anywhere play your harp good bragi and awaken all these sleepers said siegfried then the harper touched the magic strings and strains of music loud and clear but sweet as a babys breath rose up in the still air and floated over the quiet bay and across the green meadows which lay around the castlewalls and it was borne upward over the battlements and among the shining turrets and towers and was carried far out over the hills and among the silent trees of the plain and bragi sung of the beginning of all things and of whatsoever is beautiful on the land or in the sea or in the sky and siegfried looked to see every thing awakened and quickened into life as had oft been done before by bragis music but nothing stirred the sun went down and the gray twilight hung over sea and land and the red glow in the castlemoat grew redder still and yet every thing slept then bragi ended his song and the strings of his harp were mute music has no charms to waken from sleep like that he said and then he told siegfried what it all meant and to make the story plain he began by telling of odins bright home at gladsheim and of the many great halls that were there one of the halls in gladsheim is called valhal this hall is so large and wide that all the armies of the earth might move within it outside it is covered with gold and with sunbright shields a fierce wolf stands guard before it and a mountaineagle hovers over it it has five hundred and forty doors each large enough for eight hundred heroes to march through abreast inside every thing is glittering bright the rafters are made of spears and the ceiling is covered with shields and the walls are decked with warcoats in this hall odin sets daily a feast for all the heroes that have been slain in battle these sit at the great table and eat of the food which odins servants have prepared and drink of the heavenly mead which the valkyries odins handmaids bring them but the valkyries have a greater duty when the battle rages and swords clash and shields ring and the air is filled with shouts and groans and all the din of war then these maidens hover over the field of blood and death and carry the slain heroes home to valhalen one of odins valkyries was named brunhild and she was the most beautiful of all the maidens that chose heroes for his warhost but she was wilful too and did not always obey the allfathers behests and when odin knew that she had sometimes snatched the doomed from death and sometimes helped her chosen friends to victory he was very angry and he drove her away from gladsheim and sent her friendless and poor to live among the children of men and to be in all ways like them but as she wandered weary and alone over the earth the good old king of isenland saw her beauty and her distress and pity and love moved his heart and as he had no children of his own he took her for his daughter and made her his heir and not long afterward he died and the matchless brunhild became queen of all the fair lands of isenland and the hall of isenstein when odin heard of this he was more angry still and he sent to isenstein and caused brunhild to be stung with the thorn of sleep and he said she shall sleep until one shall come who is brave enough to ride through fire to awaken her and all isenland slept too because brunhild the maiden of spring lay wounded with the sleepful thorn when siegfried heard this story he knew that the land which lay before them was isenland and that the castle was isenstein and that brunhild was sleeping within that circle of fire my songs have no power to awaken such a sleeper said bragi a hero strong and brave must ride through the flame to arouse her it is for this that i have brought you hither and here i will leave you while i sail onwards to brighten other lands with my music siegfrieds heart leaped up with gladness for he thought that here at last was a worthy deed for him to do and he bade his friend bragi goodby and stepped ashore and greyfell followed him and bragi sat at the prow of the ship and played his harp again and the sailors plied their oars and the little vessel moved swiftly out of the bay and was seen no more and siegfried stood alone on the silent sandy beach as he thus stood the full moon rose white and dripping from the sea and its light fell on the quiet water and the sloping meadows and the green turrets of the castle and the last notes of bragis harp came floating to him over the sea then a troop of fairies came down to dance upon the sands it was the first sign of life that siegfried had seen as the little creatures drew near he hid himself among the tall reeds which grew close to the shore for he wished to see them at their gambols and to listen to their songs at first as if half afraid of their own tiny shadows they danced in silence but as the moon rose higher they grew bolder and began to sing and their music was so sweet and soft that siegfried forgot almost every thing else for the time they sang of the pleasant summer days and of cooling shades and still fountains and silent birds and peaceful slumber and a strange longing for sleep took hold of siegfried and his eyes grew heavy and the sound of the singing seemed dim and far away but just as he was losing all knowledge of outward things and his senses seemed moving in a dream the fairies stopped dancing and a little brown elf came up from the sea and saluted the queen of the tiny folk what news bring you from the great world beyond the water asked the queen the prince is on his way hither answered the elf and what will he do if he is brave enough he will awaken the princess and arouse the drowsy people of isenstein for the norns have said that such a prince shall surely come but he must be the bravest of men ere he can enter the enchanted castle said the queen for the wide moat is filled with flames and no faint heart will ever dare battle with them but i will dare cried siegfried and he sprang from his hidingplace forgetful of the little folk who suddenly flitted away and left him alone upon the beach he glanced across the meadows at the green turrets glistening in the mellow moonlight and then at the flickering flames around the castle walls and he resolved that on the morrow he would at all hazards perform the perilous feat in the morning as soon as the gray dawn appeared he began to make ready for his difficult undertaking but when he looked again at the red flames he began to hesitate he paused uncertain whether to wait for a sign and for help from the allfather or whether to go straightway to the castle and trusting in his good armor alone try to pass through the burning moat while he thus stood in doubt his eyes were dazzled by a sudden flash of light he looked up greyfell came dashing across the sands and from his long mane a thousand sunbeams gleamed and sparkled in the morning light siegfried had never seen the wondrous creature so radiant and as the steed stood by him in all his strength and beauty he felt new hope and courage as if odin himself had spoken to him he hesitated no longer but mounted the noble horse and greyfell bore him swiftly over the plain and paused not until he had reached the brink of the burning moat now indeed would siegfrieds heart have failed him had he not been cheered by the sunbeam presence of greyfell for filling the wide deep ditch were angry hissing flames which like a thousand serpenttongues reached out and felt here and there for what they might devour and ever and anon they took new forms and twisted and writhed like fiery snakes and then they swirled in burning coils high over the castlewalls siegfried stopped not a moment he spoke the word and boldly the horse with his rider dashed into the fiery lake and the vile flames fled in shame and dismay before the pure sunbeam flashes from greyfells mane and unscorched and unscathed siegfried rode through the moat and through the wideopen gate and into the castleyard the gatekeeper sat fast asleep in his lodge while the chains and the heavy key with which when awake he was wont to make the great gate fast lay rusting at his feet and neither he nor the sentinels on the ramparts above stirred or awoke at the sound of greyfells clattering hoofs as siegfried passed from one part of the castle to another many strange sights met his eyes in the stables the horses slumbered in their stalls and the grooms lay snoring by their sides the birds sat sound asleep on their nests beneath the eaves the watchdogs with fastclosed eyes lay stretched at fulllength before the open doors in the garden the fountain no longer played the halfladen bees had gone to sleep among the blossoms of the appletrees and the flowers themselves had forgotten to open their petals to the sun in the kitchen the cook was dozing over the halfbaked meats in front of the smouldering fire the butler was snoring in the pantry the dairymaid was quietly napping among the milkpans and even the houseflies had gone to sleep over the crumbs of sugar on the table in the great banquetroom a thousand knights overcome with slumber sat silent at the festal board and their chief sitting on the dais slept with his halfemptied goblet at his lips siegfried passed hurriedly from room to room and from hall to hall and cast but one hasty glance at the strange sights which met him at every turn for he knew that none of the drowsy ones in that spacious castle could be awakened until he had aroused the princess brunhild in the grandest hall of the palace he found her the peerless maiden most richly dight reclined upon a couch beneath a goldhung canopy and her attendants the ladies of the court sat near and around her sleep held fast her eyelids and her breathing was so gentle that but for the blush upon her cheeks siegfried would have thought her dead for long long years had her head thus lightly rested on that goldfringed pillow and in all that time neither her youth had faded nor her wondrous beauty waned siegfried stood beside her gently he touched his lips to that matchless forehead softly he named her name brunhild the charm was broken up rose the peerless princess in all her queenlike beauty up rose the courtly ladies round her all over the castle from cellar to belfrytower from the stable to the banquet hall there was a sudden awakening a noise of hurrying feet and mingled voices and sounds which had long been strangers to the halls of isenstein the watchman on the tower and the sentinels on the ramparts yawned and would not believe they had been asleep the porter picked up his keys and hastened to lock the longforgotten gates the horses neighed in their stalls the watchdogs barked at the sudden hubbub the birds ashamed at having allowed the sun to find them napping hastened to seek their food in the meadows the servants hurried here and there each intent upon his duty the warriors in the banquethall clattered their knives and plates and began again their feast and their chief dropped his goblet and rubbed his eyes and wondered that sleep should have overtaken him in the midst of such a mealen and siegfried standing at an upper window looked out over the castlewalls and he saw that the flames no longer raged in the moat but that it was filled with clear sparkling water from the fountain which played in the garden and the south wind blew gently from the sea bringing from afar the sweetest strains of music from bragis golden harp and the breezes whispered among the trees and the flowers opened their petals to the sun and birds and insects made the air melodious with their glad voices then brunhild radiant with smiles stood by the heros side and welcomed him kindly to isenland and to her greentowered castle of isenstein adventure vii in nibelungen land every one in the castle of isenstein from the princess to the kitchenmaid felt grateful to the young hero for what he had done the best rooms were fitted up for his use and a score of serving men and maidens were set apart to do his bidding and ordered to be mindful of his slightest wish and all the earlfolk and brave men and all the fair ladies and brunhild fairest of them all besought him to make his home there nor ever think of going back to rhineland siegfried yielded to their persuasions and for six months he tarried in the enchanted land in one long round of merrymaking and gay enjoyment but his thoughts were ever turned toward his fathers home in the lowlands across the sea and he longed to behold again his gentle mother sigelind then he grew tired of his life of idleness and ease and he wished that he might go out again into the busy world of manly action and worthy deeds and day by day this feeling grew stronger and filled him with unrest one morning as he sat alone by the seashore and watched the lazy tide come creeping up the sands two ravens lighted near him glad was he to see them for he knew them to be hugin and munin the sacred birds of odin and he felt sure that they brought him words of cheer from the allfather then hugin flapped his wings and said in idleness the stings of death lie hidden but in busy action are the springs of life for a hundred years fair brunhild slept but why should siegfried sleep the world awaits him but it waits too long then munin flapped his wings also but he said nothing and busy memory carried siegfried back to his boyhood days and he called to mind the wise words of his father siegmund and the fond hopes of his gentle mother and he thought too of the noble deeds of his kinsfolk of the earlier days and he rose in haste and cried life of ease farewell i go where duty leads to him who wills to do the great allfather will send strength and help while he spoke his eyes were dazzled with a flash of light he looked and the beaming greyfell his long mane sparkling like a thousand sunbeams dashed up the beach and stood beside him as the noble steed in all his strength and beauty stood before him the youth felt fresh courage for in the presence of the shining hope which the allfather had given him all hinderances seemed to vanish and all difficulties to be already overcome he looked toward the sea again and saw in the blue distance a whitesailed ship drawing swiftly near its golden dragonstem ploughing through the waves like some great bird of the deep and as with straining eager eyes he watched its coming he felt that odin had sent it and that the time had come wherein he must be up and doing the hour for thriving action comes to us once if not seized upon and used it may never come again the ship drew near the shore the sailors rested on their oars siegfried and the steed greyfell sprang upon the deck then the sailors silently bent again to their rowing the flapping sails were filled and tightened by the strong west wind and the light vessel leaped from wave to wave like a thing of life until isenstein with its tall towers and its green marble halls sank from sight in the distance and the mist and siegfried and his noble steed seemed to be the only living beings on board for the sailors who plied the oars were so silent and phantomlike that they appeared to be nought but the ghosts of the summer seabreezes as the ship sped swiftly on its way all the creatures in the sea paused to behold the sight the mermen rested from their weary search for hidden treasures and the mermaids forgot to comb their long tresses as the radiant vessel and its herofreight glided past and even old king aegir left his brewingkettle in his great hall and bade his daughters the whiteveiled waves cease playing until the vessel should safely reach its haven when at length the day had passed and the evening twilight had come siegfried saw that the ship was nearing land but it was a strange landen like a fleecy cloud it appeared to rest above the waves midway between the earth and the sky a dark mist hung upon it and it seemed a land of dreams and shadows the ship drew nearer and nearer to the mysterious shore and as it touched the beach the sailors rested from their rowing then siegfried and the horse greyfell leaped ashore but when they looked back the fair vessel that had carried them was nowhere to be seen whether it had suddenly been clutched by the greedy fingers of the seaqueen ran and dragged down into her deep seacaverns or whether like the wondrous ship skidbladner it had been folded up and made invisible to the eyes of men siegfried never knew the thick mists and the darkness of night closed over and around both hero and horse and they dared not stir but stood long hours in the silent gloom waiting for the coming of the dawn at length the morning came but the light was not strong enough to scatter the fogs and thick vapors that rested upon the land then siegfried mounted greyfell and the sunbeams began to flash from the horses mane and from the heros glittering mailcoat and the hazy clouds fled upward and away until they were caught and held fast by great mistgiants who stood like sentinels on the mountaintops as the shining pair came up from the sea and passed through the woods and valleys of the nibelungen land there streamed over all that region such a flood of sunlight as had never before been seen in every leafy tree and behind every blade of grass elves and fairies were hidden and under every rock and in every crevice lurked cunning dwarfs but siegfried rode straight forward until he came to the steep side of a shadowy mountain there at the mouth of a cavern a strange sight met his eyes two young men dressed in princes clothing sat upon the ground their features were all haggard and gaunt and pinched with hunger and their eyes wild with wakefulness and fear and all around them were heaps of gold and precious stones more than a hundred wagons could carry away and neither of the two princes would leave the shining hoard for food nor close his eyes in sleep lest the other might seize and hide some part of the treasure and thus they had watched and hungered through many long days and sleepless nights each hoping that the other would die and that the whole inheritance might be his own when they saw siegfried riding near they called out to him and said noble stranger stop a moment come and help us divide this treasure who are you asked siegfried and what treasure is it that lies there we are the sons of niblung who until lately was king of this mist land our names are schilbung and the young niblung faintly answered the princes and what are you doing here with this gold and these glittering stones this is the great nibelungen hoard which our father not long ago brought from the southland it is not clear just how he obtained iten some say that he got it unjustly from his brother whose vassals had digged it from the earth others say that he found it lying on the glittering heath where fafnir the dragon had guarded it zealously for ages past until he was slain by a hero who cared nought for his gold but be this as it may our father is now dead and we have brought the hoard out of the cavern where he had hidden it in order that we may share it between us equally but we cannot agree and we pray you to help us divide it then siegfried dismounted from the horse greyfell and came near the two princes i will gladly do as you ask said he but first i must know more about your father who he was and whether this is really the hoard of the glittering heath then niblung answered as well as his feeble voice would allow our father was from the earliest times the ruler of this land and the lord of the fog and the mist many strongholds and many noble halls had he in this land and ten thousand brave warriors were ever ready to do his bidding the trolls and the swarthy elves of the mountains and the giants of the cloudy peaks were his vassals but he did more than rule over the nibelungen land twice every year he crossed the sea and rambled through the rhine valleys or loitered in the moist lowlands and now and then he brought rich trophies back to his island home the last time he brought this treasure with him but as we have said it is not clear how he obtained it we have heard men say that it was the hoard of andvari and that when fafnir the dragon who watched it was slain the hero who slew him left it to be taken again by the swarthy elves who had gathered it but because of a curse which andvari had placed upon it no one would touch it until some man would assume its ownership and take upon himself the risk of incurring the curse this thing it is said our father did and the dwarf alberich undertook to keep it for him and he with the help of the ten thousand elves who live in these caverns and the twelve giants whom you see standing on the mountainpeaks around guarded it faithfully so long as our father lived but when he died we and our thralls fetched it forth from the cavern and spread it here on the ground and lo for many days we have watched and tried to divide it equally but we cannot agree what hire will you give me if i divide it for you asked siegfried name what you will have answered the princes give me the sword which lies before you on the glittering heap then niblung handed him the sword and said right gladly will we give it it is a worthless blade that our father brought from the southland they say that he found it also on the glittering heath in the trench where fafnir was slain and some will have it that it was forged by regin fafnirs own brother but how that is i do not know at any rate it is of no use to us for it turns against us whenever we try to use it siegfried took the sword it was his own balmung that had been lost so long forthwith he began the task of dividing the treasure and the two brothers so faint from hunger and want of sleep that they could scarcely lift their heads watched him with anxious greedy eyes first he placed a piece of gold by niblungs side and then a piece of like value he gave to schilbung and this he did again and again until no more gold was left then in the same manner he divided the precious gemstones until none remained and the brothers were much pleased and they hugged their glittering treasures and thanked siegfried for his kindness and for the fairness with which he had given to each his own but one thing was left which had not fallen to the lot of either brother it was a ring of curious workmanship a serpent coiled with its tail in its mouth and with ruby eyes glistening and cold what shall i do with this ring asked siegfried give it to me cried niblung give it to me cried schilbung and both tried to snatch it from siegfrieds hand but the effort was too great for them their arms fell helpless at their sides their feet slipped beneath them their limbs failed they sank fainting each upon his pile of treasures o my dear dear gold murmured niblung trying to clasp it all in his arms my dear dear gold thou art mine mine only no one shall take thee from me here thou art here thou shalt rest o my dear dear gold and then calling up the last spark of life left in his famished body he cried out to siegfried give me the ring the ring i say he hugged his cherished gold nearer to his bosom he ran his thin fingers deep down into the shining yellow heap he pressed his pale lips to the cold and senseless metal he whispered faintly my dear dear gold and then he died o precious precious gemstones faltered schilbung how beautiful you are and you are mine all mine i will keep you safe come come my brighteyed beauties no one but me shall touch you you are mine mine mine and he chattered and laughed as only madmen laugh and he kissed the hard stones and sought to hide them in his bosom but his hands trembled and failed dark mists swam before his eyes he fancied that he heard the black dwarfs clamoring for his treasure he sprang up quickly he shrieked and then fell lifeless upon his hoard of sparkling gems a strange sad sight it was boundless wealth and miserable death two piles of yellow gold and sunbright diamonds and two thin starved corpses stretched upon them some stories relate that the brothers were slain by siegfried because their foolish strife and greediness had angered himen but i like not to think so it was the gold and not siegfried that slew them o gold gold cried the hero sorrowfully truly thou art the midworlds curse thou art mans bane but when the bright springtime of the new world shall come and balder shall reign in his glory then will the curse be taken from thee and thy yellow brightness will be the sign of purity and enduring worth and then thou wilt be a blessing to mankind and the precious plaything of the gods but siegfried had little time for thought and speech a strange sound was heard upon the mountainside the twelve great giants who had stood as watchmen upon the peaks above were rushing down to avenge their masters and to drive the intruder out of nibelungen land siegfried waited not for their onset but he mounted the noble horse greyfell and with the sword balmung in his hand he rode forth to meet his foes who with fearful threats and hideous roars came striding toward him the sunbeams flashed from greyfells mane and dazzled the dull eyes of the giants unused as they were to the full light of day doubtful they paused and then again came forward but they mistook every tree in their way for an enemy and every rock they thought a foe and in their fear they fancied a great host to be before them did you ever see the dark and threatening stormclouds on a summers day scattered and put to flight by the bright beams of the sun it was thus that siegfrieds giant foes were routed one and all they dropped their heavy clubs and stood ashamed and trembling not knowing what to do and siegfried made each one swear to serve him faithfully and then he sent them back to the snowcovered mountainpeaks to stand again as watchmen at their posts and now another danger appeared alberich the dwarf the master of the swarthy elves who guarded the nibelungen hoard had come out from his cavern and seen the two princes lying dead beside their treasures and he thought that they had been murdered by siegfried and when he beheld the giants driven back to the mountaintops he lifted a little silver horn to his lips and blew a shrill buglecall and the little brown elves came trooping forth by thousands from under every rock from the nooks and crannies and crevices in the mountainside from the deep cavern and the narrow gorge they came at the call of their chief then at alberichs word they formed in line of battle and stood in order around the hoard and the bodies of their late masters their little golden shields and their sharppointed spears were thick as the blades of grass in a rhine meadow and siegfried when he saw them was pleased and surprised for never before had such a host of pygmy warriors stood before him while he paused and looked the elves became suddenly silent and siegfried noticed that alberich stood no longer at their head but had strangely vanished from sight ah alberich cried the hero thou art indeed cunning i have heard of thy tricks thou hast donned the tarnkappe the cloak of darkness which hides thee from sight and makes thee as strong as twelve common men but come on thou brave dwarf scarcely had he spoken when he felt a shock which almost sent him reeling from his saddle and made greyfell plunge about with fright quickly then did siegfried dismount and with every sense alert he waited for the second onset of the unseen dwarf it was plain that alberich wished to strike him unawares for many minutes passed in utter silence then a brisk breath of wind passed by siegfrieds face and he felt another blow but by a quick downward movement of his hand he caught the plucky elfking and tore off the magic tarnkappe and then with firm grasp he held him struggling in vain to get free ah alberich he cried now i know thou art cunning but the tarnkappe i must have for my own what wilt thou give for thy freedom worthy prince answered alberich humbly you have fairly overcome me in fight and made me your prisoner i and all mine as well as this treasure rightfully belong to you we are yours and you we shall obey swear it said siegfried swear it and thou shalt live and be the keeper of my treasures and alberich made a sign to his elfin host and every spear was turned point downwards and every tiny shield was thrown to the ground and the ten thousand little warriors kneeled as did also their chief and acknowledged siegfried to be their rightful master and the lord of the nibelungen land and the owner of the hoard of andvari then by alberichs orders the elves carried the hoard back into the cavern and there kept faithful watch and ward over it and they buried the starved bodies of the two princes on the top of the mistveiled mountain and heralds were sent to all the strongholds in nibelungen land proclaiming that siegfried through his wisdom and might had become the true lord and king of the land afterwards the prince riding on the beaming greyfell went from place to place scattering sunshine and smiles where shadows and frowns had been before and the nibelungen folk welcomed him everywhere with glad shouts and music and dancing and ten thousand warriors and many noble earlfolk came to meet him and plighted their faith to him and the pure brightness of his herosoul and the gleaming sunbeams from greyfells mane the light of hope and faith lifted the curtain of mists and fogs that had so long darkened the land and let in the glorious glad light of day and the genial warmth of summer adventure viii siegfrieds welcome home in santen castle one day there was a strange uproar and confusion everybody was hurrying aimlessly about and no one seemed to know just what to do on every side there were restless whisperings and hasty gestures and loud commands the knights and warriors were busy donning their warcoats and buckling on their swords and helmets wise king siegmund sat in his councilchamber and the knowing men of the kingdom stood around him and the minds of all seemed troubled with doubt if not with fear what could have caused so great an uproar in the once quiet old castle what could have brought perplexity to the mind of the wisest king in all rhineland it was this a herald had just come from the seashore bringing word that a strange fleet of a hundred whitesailed vessels had cast anchor off the coast and that an army of ten thousand fighting men had landed and were making ready to march against santen nobody had ever heard of so large a fleet before and no one could guess who the strangers might be nor whence they had come nor why they should thus without asking leave land in the country of a peaceloving king the news spread quickly over all the land people from every part came hastening to the friendly shelter of the castle the townsmen with their goods and cattle hurried within the walls the sentinels on the ramparts paced uneasily to and fro and scanned with watchful eye every stranger that came near the walls the warders stood ready to hoist the drawbridge and close the gate at the first signal given by the watchman above who was straining his eyes to their utmost in order to see the first approach of the foe a heavy mist hung over the meadowlands between santen and the sea and nothing was visible beyond the gates of the town the ten thousand strange warriors might be within half a league of the castle and yet the sharpest eagleeye could not see them all at once a clatter of horses hoofs was heard the dark mist rose up from the ground and began to roll away like a great cloud into the sky and then strange sunbeamflashes were seen where the fog had lately rested they come cried one of the sentinels i see the glitter of their shields and lances not so said the watchman from his place on the tower above i see but one man and he rides with the speed of the wind and lightning flashes from the mane of the horse which carries him the drawbridge was hastily hoisted the heavy gates were quickly shut and fastened with bolts and bars every man in the castle was at his post ready to defend the fortress with his life in a short time the horse and his rider drew near all who looked out upon them were dazzled with the golden brightness of the heros armor as well as with the lightning gleams that flashed from the horses mane and some whispered this is no man who thus comes in such kingly splendor more likely it is odin on one of his journeys or the shining balder come again to earth as the stranger paused on the outer edge of the moat the sentinels challenged him who are you who come thus uninvited and unheralded to santen one who has the right to come answered the stranger i am siegfried and i have come to see my father the good siegmund and my mother the gentle sigelind it was indeed siegfried and he had come from his kingdom in the nibelungen land with his great fleet and the noblest of his warriors to see once more his boyhoods home and to cheer for a time the hearts of his loving parents for he had done many noble deeds and had ruled wisely and well and he felt that he was now not unworthy to be called the son of siegmund and to claim kinship with the heroes of the earlier days as soon as it was surely known that he who stood before the castlewalls was the young prince who had been gone so many years and about whom they had heard so many wonderful stories the drawbridge was hastily let down and the great gates were thrown wide open and siegfried whose return had been so long wished for stood once again in his fathers halls and the fear and confusion which had prevailed gave place to gladness and gayety and all the folk of santen greeted the returned hero with cheers and joyfully welcomed him home and in the whole world there was no one more happy than siegmund and sigelind on the morrow the ten thousand nibelungen warriors came to santen and siegmund made for them a great banquet and entertained them in a right kingly way as the faithful liegemen of his son and siegfried when he had given them rich gifts sent them with the fleet back to nibelungen land for he meant to stay for a time with his father and mother at santen when the harvest had been gathered and the fruit was turning purple and gold and the moon rode round and full in the clear autumn sky a gay hightide was held for siegfrieds sake and everybody in the lowland country whether high or low rich or poor was asked to come to the feast for seven days nought but unbridled gayety prevailed in siegmunds halls on every hand were sounds of music and laughter and sickness and poverty and pain were for the time forgotten a mockbattle was fought on the grassy plain not far from the town and the young men vied with each other in feats of strength and skill never before had so many beautiful ladies nor so many brave men been seen in santen and when the time of jollity and feasting had drawn to an end siegmund called together all his guests and gave to each choice gifts a festal garment and a horse with rich trappings and queen sigelind scattered gold without stint among the poor and many were the blessings she received then all the folk went back to their homes with light hearts and happy facesen the autumn days passed quickly by and siegfried began to grow weary of the idle inactive life in his fathers halls and greyfell in his stall pined for the fresh free air and his mane lost all its brightness when siegmund saw how full of unrest his son had become he said to him siegfried i have grown old and feeble and have no longer the strength of my younger days my kingdom would fare better were a younger ruler placed over it take my crown i pray you and let me withdraw from kingly cares but siegfried would not listen to such an offer he had his own kingdom of the nibelungens he said and besides he would never sit on his fathers throne while yet that father lived and although he loved the pleasant companionship of his mother and was delighted to listen to the wise counsels of his father the craving for action and the unrest which would not be satisfied grew greater day by day at last he said i will ride out into the world again mayhap i may find some other wrong to right or some other kingdom to win it was thus that my kin in the golden age long past went faring over the land and sea and met their doom at last they were not homeabiders nor tillers of the soil but the world was their abidingplace and they filled the hearts of men and when his father and mother heard this they tried no longer to keep him with them for they knew that it would be more cruel than the keeping of a caged bird away from the sunlight only go not into burgundy said his father the kings of that country are not friendly to us and they may do you harm hagen the kinsman of the kings and the chief of their fightingmen is old and crafty and he cannot brook a greater hero than himself siegfried laughed that is all the better reason why i should go to burgundyland he said then take ten thousand of my warriors said his father and make yourself master of the land no no cried siegfried one kingdom is enough for me my own nibelungen land is all i want i will take my twelve nibelungen knights that i have with me here and we will fare forth to see the world and its beauties and mens work and when we have tired with riding we will sail across the sea to our nibelungen home adventure ix the journey to burgundyland for many days before siegfrieds departure the queen and all the women of the household busily plied their needles and many suits of rich raiment made they for the prince and his worthy comrades at length the time for leavetaking came and all the inmates of the castle went out to the gate to bid the heroes godspeed siegfried sat upon his noble horse greyfell and his trusty sword balmung hung at his side and his nibelungen knights were mounted on lordly steeds with goldred saddles and silver trappings chased with gold and their glittering helmets and burnished shields and warcoats of polished steel when added to their noble bearing and manlike forms made up a picture of beauty and strength such as no one in santen had ever seen before or would ever see again only go not into burgundyland were the parting words of siegmund and all who had come to bid them farewell wept bitterly as the young men rode out of the city and were lost to sight in the distance only go not into burgundyland these words of his father sounded still in siegfrieds ears and he turned his horses head towards the west and south and they rode through the level country and among the fields from which the corn had already been gathered and at night they slept in the open air upon the still warm ground thus for many days they travelled and they left the lowlands far behind them and burgundy far to the left of them and by and by they came to a country covered with high hills and mountains that seemed to touch the sky the crags and peaks were covered with snow and ice lay all summer in the dales and in the deep gorges cleft long time ago by giant hands here it is that the rivers take their beginning and here it is that the purple grapes and the rare fruits of milder climes are found for the sun shines warm in the valleys and upon the plains and the soil is exceeding rich it is said that these mountains are midway between the cold regions of jotunheim and the glowing gardens of muspelheim and that in ages past they were the scene of many battles between the giants who would overwhelm the earth these with ice and those with fire here and there were frowning caves dug out of the solid mountainside while higher up were great pits halffilled with ashes where it is said the dwarffolk when they were mighty on earth had their forges siegfried stopped not long in this land thoughts of the nibelungen land and of his faithful liegemen who waited for his return began to fill his mind then the heroes turned their horses heads and rode back towards the north following the course of the river rhine as it wound here and there between hills and mountains and through meadows where the grass was springing up anew and by the side of woodlands now beginning to be clothed in green again for the winter was well over and spring was hastening on apace and as they rode down the valley of the rhine they came ere they were aware into the burgundian land and the high towers of king gunthers castle rose up before them then siegfried remembered again his fathers words only go not into burgundyland but it was now too late to go back and they determined to stop for a few days with the burgundian kings they rode onwards through the meadows and the pleasant farminglands which lay around the city and they passed a wonderful garden of roses said to belong to kriemhild the peerless princess of the rhine country and at last they halted before the castlegate so lordly was their bearing that a company of knights came out to meet them and offered as the custom was to take charge of their horses and their shields but siegfried asked that they be led at once to king gunther and his brothers and as their stay would not be long they said they would have no need to part with horses or with shields then they followed their guides and rode through the great gateway and into the open court and halted beneath the palace windows and the three kings gunther gernot and giselher and their young sister the matchless kriemhild looked down upon them from above and hazarded many guesses as to who the lordly strangers might be and all the inmates of the castle stood at the doors and windows or gathered in curious groups in the courtyard and gazed with openmouthed wonder upon the rich armor and noble bearing of the thirteen heroes but all eyes were turned most towards siegfried and the wondrous steed greyfell some of the knights whispered that this was odin and some that it was thor the thunderer making a tour through rhineland but others said that thor was never known to ride on horseback and that the youth who sat on the milkwhite steed was little like the ancient odin and the ladies who looked down upon the heroes from the palace windows said that this man could be no other than the sunbright balder come from his home in breidablik to breathe gladness and sunshine into the hearts and lives of men only one among all the folk in the castle knew who the hero was who had ridden thus boldly into the heart of burgundyland that one was hagen the uncle of the three kings and the doughtiest warrior in all rhineland with a dark frown and a sullen scowl he looked out upon the little party and already plotted in his mind how he might outwit and bring to grief the youth whose name and fame were known the whole world over for his evil mind loved deeds of darkness and hated the pure and good by his side at an upper window stood kriemhild the peerless maiden of the rhine but her thoughts were as far from his thoughts as the heavensmile on her face was unlike the sullen scowl on his grim visage as the moon in her calm beauty is sometimes seen in the sky riding gloriously by the side of a dark thundercloud the one more lovely the other more dreadful by their very nearness so seemed kriemhild standing there by the side of hagen think you not dear uncle she said that this is the shining balder come to earth again the gods have forgotten the earth answered hagen in surly tones but if indeed this should be balder we shall without doubt find another blind archer who with another sprig of mistletoe will send him back again to hela what do you mean asked kriemhild earnestly but old hagen said not a word in answer he quietly withdrew from the room and left the maiden and her mother the good dame ute alone what does uncle hagen mean by his strange words and why does he look so sullen and angry asked kriemhild indeed i know not answered the queenmother his ways are dark and he is cunning i fear that evil will yet come to our house through him meanwhile the three kings and their chiefs had gone into the courtyard to greet their unknown guests very kindly did gunther welcome the strangers to his home and then he courteously asked them whence they came and what the favors they wished i have heard answered siegfried that many knights and heroes live in this land and that they are the bravest and the proudest in the world i too am a knight and some time if i am worthy i shall be a king but first i would make good my right to rule over land and folk and for this reason i have come hither if indeed you are as brave as all the world says you are ride now to the meadows with us and let us fight man to man and he who wins shall rule over the lands of both we will wager our kingdom and our heads against yours king gunther and his brothers were amazed at this unlookedfor speech such is not the way to try where true worth lies they cried we have no cause of quarrel with you neither have you any cause of quarrel with us why then should we spill each others blood again siegfried urged them to fight with him but they flatly refused and gernot said the burgundian kings have never wished to rule over folk that are not their own much less would they gain new lands at the cost of their best heroes blood and they have never taken part in needless quarrels good men in burgundy are worth more than the broadest lands and we will not hazard the one for the sake of gaining the other no we will not fight but we greet you most heartily as our friends and guests all the others joined in urging siegfried and his comrades to dismount from their steeds and partake of the cheer with which it was their use to entertain strangers and at last he yielded to their kind wishes and alighted from greyfell and grasping king gunthers hand he made himself known and there was great rejoicing in the castle and throughout all the land and the most sumptuous rooms were set apart for the use of siegfried and his nibelungen knights and a banquet was at once made ready and no pains were spared in giving the strangers a right hearty welcome to the kingly halls of burgundy but hagen darkbrowed and evileyed stood silent and alone in his chamber and waited his time adventure x kriemhilds dream early on the morrow morning ere the sun had risen high the peerless kriemhild walked alone amid the sweetscented bowers of her rosegarden the dewdrops still hung thick on flower and thorn and the wild birds carolled their songs of merry welcome to the newborn day every thing seemed to have put on its handsomest colors and to be using its sweetest voice on purpose to gladden the heart of the maiden but kriemhild was not happy there was a shadow on her face and a sadness in her eye that the beauty and the music of that morning could not drive away what ails thee my child asked her mother queen ute who met her why so sad as if thy heart were heavy with care has any one spoken unkindly or has aught grievous happened to thee oh no dearest mother said kriemhild it is nothing that saddens me nothing but a foolish dream i cannot forget it tell me the dream said her mother mayhap it betokens something that the norns have written for thee then kriemhild answered i dreamed that i sat at my window high up in the eastern tower and the sun shone bright in the heavens and the air was mild and warm and i thought of nought but the beauty and the gladness of the hour then in the far north i saw a falcon flying at first he seemed but a black speck in the sky but swiftly he drew nearer and nearer until at last he flew in at the open window and i caught him in my arms oh how strong and beautiful he was his wings were purple and gold and his eyes were as bright as the sun oh a glorious prize i thought him and i held him on my wrist and spoke kind words to him then suddenly from out of the sky above two eagles dashed in at the window and snatched my darling from me and they tore him in pieces before my eyes and laughed at my distress thy dream said queen ute is easy to explain a king shall come from the northland and a mighty king shall he be and he shall seek thee and love thee and wed thee and thy heart shall overflow with bliss the two eagles are the foes who shall slay him but who they may be or whence they may come is known only to the norns but i slept and i dreamed again said kriemhild this time i sat in the meadow and three women came to me and they span and they wove a woof more fair than any i have ever seen and methought that another woof was woven which crossed the first and yet it was no whit less beautiful then the women who wove the woofs cried out enough and a fair white arm reached out and seized the rare fabrics and tore them into shreds and then the sky was overcast and the thunder began to roll and the lightning to flash and red fires gleamed and fierce wolves howled around me and i awoke this dream said queen ute is more than i can understand only this i can see and explain that in the dim future the woof of anothers fate shall cross thy own but trouble not thyself because of that which shall be while yet the sun shines for thee and the birds sing and the flowers shed their sweet perfume it is for thee to rejoice and be lighthearted what the norns have woven is woven and it cannot be undoneen adventure xi how the springtime came siegfried when he came to gunthers castle thought of staying there but a few days only but the king and his brothers made every thing so pleasant for their honored guest that weeks slipped by unnoticed and still the hero remained in burgundy spring had fairly come and the weeping april clouds had given place to the balmy skies of may the young men and maidens as was their wont made ready for the mayday games and siegfried and his knights were asked to take part in the sport on the smooth greensward which they called nannas carpet beneath the shade of ashtrees and elms he who played old winters part lingered with his few attendants these were clad in the dull gray garb which becomes the sober season of the year and were decked with yellow straw and dead brown leaves out of the wood came the mayking and his followers clad in the gayest raiment and decked with evergreens and flowers with staves and willowwithes they fell upon old winters champions and tried to drive them from the sward in friendly fray they fought and many mishaps fell to both parties but at length the mayking won and grave winter battered and bruised was made prisoner and his followers were driven from the field then in merry sport sentence was passed on the luckless wight for he was found guilty of killing the flowers and of covering the earth with hoarfrost and he was doomed to a long banishment from music and the sunlight the laughing party then set up a wooden likeness of the worsted winterking and pelted it with stones and turf and when they were tired they threw it down and put out its eyes and cast it into the river and then a pole decked with wildflowers and fresh green leaves was planted in the midst of the sward and all joined in merry dance around it and they chose the most beautiful of all the maidens to be the queen of may and they crowned her with a wreath of violets and yellow buttercups and for a whole day all yielded fealty to her and did her bidding it was thus that may day came in burgundy and in the evening when the party were seated in king gunthers hall siegfried at the command of the mayqueen who was none other than kriemhild the peerless amused them by telling the story of idun and her apples it is a story that bragi told while at the feast in aegirs hall idun is bragis wife very handsome is she but the beauty of her face is by no means greater than the goodness of her heart right attentive is she to every duty and her words and thoughts are always worthy and wise a long time ago the good asafolk who dwell in heaventowering asgard knowing how trustworthy idun was gave into her keeping a treasure which they would not have placed in the hands of any other person this treasure was a box of apples and idun kept the golden key safely fastened to her girdle you ask me why the gods should prize a box of apples so highly i will tell you old age you know spares none not even odin and his asafolk they all grow old and gray and if there were no cure for age they would become feeble and toothless and blind deaf tottering and weak minded the apples which idun guarded so carefully were the priceless boon of youth whenever the gods felt old age coming on they went to her and she gave them of her fruit and when they had tasted they grew young and strong and handsome again once however they came near losing the apples or losing rather idun and her golden key without which no one could ever open the box in those early days odin delighted to come down now and then from his high home above the clouds and to wander disguised among the woods and mountains and by the seashore and in wild desert places for nothing pleases him more than to commune with nature as she is found in the loneliness of vast solitudes or in the boisterous uproar of the elements once on a time he took with him his friends hoenir and loki and they rambled many days among the icy cliffs and along the barren shores of the great frozen sea in that country there was no game and no fish was found in the cold waters and the three wanderers as they had brought no food with them became very hungry late in the afternoon of the seventh day they reached some pasturelands belonging to the giant hymer and saw a herd of the giants cattle browsing upon the short grass which grew in the sheltered nooks among the hills ah cried loki after fasting for a week we shall now have food in abundance let us kill and eat so saying he hurled a sharp stone at the fattest of hymers cows and killed her and the three quickly dressed the choicest pieces of flesh for their supper then loki gathered twigs and dry grass and kindled a blazing fire hoenir filled the pot with water from melted ice and odin threw into it the bits of tender meat but make the fire as hot as they would the water would not boil and the flesh would not cook all night long the supperless three sat hungry around the fire and every time they peeped into the kettle the meat was as raw and gustless as before morning came but no breakfast and all day loki kept stirring the fire and odin and hoenir waited hopefully but impatiently when the sun again went down the flesh was still uncooked and their supper seemed no nearer ready than it was the night before as they were about yielding to despair they heard a noise overhead and looking up they saw a huge gray eagle sitting on the dead branch of an oak ha ha cried the bird you are pretty fellows indeed to sit hungry by the fire a night and a day rather than eat raw flesh becomes you well do but give me my share of it as it is and i warrant you the rest shall boil and you shall have a fat supper agreed answered loki eagerly come down and get your share the eagle waited for no second asking down he swooped right over the blazing fire and snatched not only the eagles share but also what the lybians call the lions share that is he grasped in his strong talons the kettle with all the meat in it and flapping his huge wings slowly rose into the air carrying his booty with him the three gods were astonished loki was filled with anger he seized a long pole upon the end of which a sharp hook was fixed and struck at the treacherous bird the hook stuck fast in the eagles back and loki could not loose his hold of the other end of the pole the great bird soared high above the treetops and over the hills and carried the astonished mischiefmaker with him but it was no eagle it was no bird that had thus outwitted the hungry gods it was the giant old winter clothed in his eagleplumage over the lonely woods and the snowcrowned mountains and the frozen sea he flew dragging the helpless loki through treetops and over jagged rocks scratching and bruising his body and almost tearing his arms from his shoulders at last he alighted on the craggy top of an iceberg where the stormwinds shrieked and the air was filled with driving snow as soon as loki could speak he begged the giant to carry him back to his comrades odin and hoenir on one condition only will i carry you back answered old winter swear to me that you will betray into my hands dame idun and her golden key loki asked no questions but gladly gave the oath and the giant flew back with him across the sea and dropped him torn and bleeding and lame by the side of the fire where odin and hoenir still lingered and the three made all haste to leave that cheerless place and returned to odins glad home in asgard some weeks after this loki the prince of mischiefmakers went to bragis house to see idun he found her busied with her household cares not thinking of a visit from any of the gods i have come good dame said he to taste your apples again for i feel old age coming on apace idun was astonished you are not looking old she answered there is not a single gray hair upon your head and not a wrinkle on your brow if it were not for that scar upon your cheek and the arm which you carry in a sling you would look as stout and as well as i have ever seen you besides i remember that it was only a year ago when you last tasted of my fruit is it possible that a single winter should make you old a single winter has made me very lame and feeble at least said loki i have been scarcely able to walk about since my return from the north another winter without a taste of your apples will be the death of me then the kindhearted idun when she saw that loki was really lame went to the box and opened it with her golden key and gave him one of the precious apples to taste he took the fruit in his hand bit it and gave it back to the good dame she put it in its place again closed the lid and locked it with her usual care your apples are not so good as they used to be said loki making a very wry face why dont you fill your box with fresh fruit idun was amazed her apples were supposed to be always fresh fresher by far than any that grow nowadays none of the gods had ever before complained about them and she told loki so very well said he i see you do not believe me and that you mean to feed us on your sour withered apples when we might as well have golden fruit if you were not so bent on having your own way i could tell you where you might fill your box with the choicest of apples such as odin loves i saw them in the forest over yonder hanging ripe on the trees but women will always have their own way and you must have yours even though you do feed the gods on withered apples so saying and without waiting to hear an answer he limped out at the door and was soon gone from sight idun thought long and anxiously upon the words which loki had spoken and the more she thought the more she felt troubled if her husband the wise bragi had been at home what would she not have given he would have understood the mischiefmakers cunning but he had gone on a long journey to the south singing in natures choir and painting natures landscapes and she would not see him again until the return of spring at length she opened the box and looked at the fruit the apples were certainly fair and round she could not see a wrinkle or a blemish on any of them their color was the same goldenred like the sky at dawn of a summers day yet she thought there must be something wrong about them she took up one of the apples and tasted it she fancied that it really was sour and she hastily put it back and locked the box again he said that he had seen better apples than these growing in the woods said she to herself i half believe that he told the truth although everybody knows that he is not always trustworthy i think i shall go to the forest and see for myself at any rate so she donned her cloak and hood and with a basket on her arm left the house and walked rapidly away along the road which led to the forest it was much farther than she had thought and the sun was almost down when she reached the edge of the wood but no appletrees were there tall oaks stretched their bare arms up towards the sky as if praying for help there were thorntrees and brambles everywhere but there was no fruit neither were there any flowers nor even green leaves the frostgiants had been there idun was about to turn her footsteps homewards when she heard a wild shriek in the treetops over her head and before she could look up she felt herself seized in the eagletalons of old winter struggle as she would she could not free herself high up over wood and stream the giant carried her and then he flew swiftly away with her towards his home in the chill northland and when morning came poor idun found herself in an icewalled castle in the cheerless country of the giants but she was glad to know that the precious box was safely locked at home and that the golden key was still at her girdle time passed and i fear that idun would have been forgotten by all save her husband bragi had not the gods begun to feel the need of her apples day after day they came to iduns house hoping to find the good dame and her golden key at home and each day they went away some hours older than when they had come bragi was beside himself with grief and his golden harp was unstrung and forgotten no one had seen the missing idun since the day when loki had visited her and none could guess what had become of her the heads of all the folk grew white with age deep furrows were ploughed in their faces their eyes grew dim and their hearing failed their hands trembled their limbs became palsied their feet tottered and all feared that old age would bring death in his train then bragi and thor questioned loki very sharply and when he felt that he too was growing odd and feeble he regretted the mischief he had done and told them how he had decoyed idun into old winters clutches the gods were very angry and thor threatened to crush loki with his hammer if he did not at once bring idun safe home again so loki borrowed the falconplumage of freyja the goddess of love and with it flew to the country of the giants when he reached old winters castle he found the good dame idun shut up in the prisontower and bound with fetters of ice but the giant himself was on the frozen sea herding old hymers cows and loki quickly broke the bonds that held idun and led her out of her prisonhouse and then he shut her up in a magic nutshell which he held between his claws and flew with the speed of the wind back towards the southland and the home of the gods but old winter coming home and learning what had been done donned his eagleplumage and followed swiftly in pursuit bragi and thor anxiously gazing into the sky saw loki in freyjas falconplumage speeding homewards with the nutshell in his talons and old winter in his eagleplumage dashing after in sharp pursuit quickly they gathered chips and slender twigs and placed them high upon the castlewall and when loki with his precious burden had flown past they touched fire to the dry heap and the flames blazed up to the sky and caught old winters plumage as close behind the falcon he blindly pressed and his wings were scorched in the flames and he fell helpless to the ground and was slain within the castlegates loki slackened his speed and when he reached bragis house he dropped the nutshell softly before the door as it touched the ground it gently opened and idun radiant with smiles and clothed in gay attire stepped forth and greeted her husband and the waiting gods and the heavenly music of bragis longsilent harp welcomed her home and she took the golden key from her girdle and unlocked the box and gave of her apples to the aged company and when they had tasted their youth was reneweden it is thus with the seasons and their varied changes the gifts of spring are youth and jollity and renewed strength and the music of air and water and all things living and lifeless follow in her train the desolating winter plots to steal her from the earth and the summerheat deserts and betrays her then the music of nature is hushed and all creatures pine in sorrow for her absence and the world seems dying of white old age but at length the summerheat repents and frees her from her prisonhouse and the icy fetters with which old winter bound her are melted in the beams of the returning sun and the earth is young again adventure xii the war with the northkings so swiftly and so pleasantly the days went by that weeks lengthened into months and the springtime passed and the summer came and still siegfried lingered in burgundy with his kind friends the time was spent in all manner of joyance in hunting the deer in the deep oakwoods in riding over the daisied meadows or among the fields of corn in manly games and sports in music and dancing in feasting and in pleasant talk and of all the noble folk who had ever sat at gunthers table or hunted in the burgundian woods none were so worthy or so fair as the proud young lord of the nibelungens one day in early autumn a party of strange knights rode up to the castle and asked to speak with the burgundian kings they were led straightway into the great hall and gunther and his brothers welcomed them as was their wont right heartily and asked them from what country they had come and what was their errand we come they answered from the north country and we bring word from our lords and kings leudiger and leudigast and what would our kingly neighbors say to us asked gunther then the strangers said that their lords had become very angry with the burgundian kings and that they meant within twelve weeks from that day to come with a great army and lay the country waste and besiege their city and castle all this they had sworn to do unless the burgundians would make peace with them upon such terms as leudiger and leudigast should please to grant when gunther and his brothers heard this they were struck with dismay but they ordered the messengers to be well cared for and handsomely entertained within the palace until the morrow at which time they should have the burgundians answer all the noblest knights and earlfolk were called together and the matter was laid before them what answer shall we send to our rude neighbors of the north asked gunther gernot and the young giselher declared at once for war old hagen and other knights whose prudence was at least equal to their bravery said but little it was known that in the armies of the northkings there were at least forty thousand soldiers but in burgundy there were not more than thirty thousand fightingmen all told the northkings forces were already equipped and ready to march but the burgundians could by no means raise and arm any considerable body of men in the short space of twelve weeks it would be the part of wisdom to delay and to see what terms could best be made with their enemies such were the prudent counsels of the older knights but gernot and the young chief volker would not listen to such words the burgundians are not cowards said they we have never been foiled in battle never have we been the vassals of a stranger why then shall we cringe and cower before such men as leudiger and leudigast then hagen answered let us ask our friend and guest siegfried let us learn what he thinks about this business everybody knows that he is as wise in council as he is brave in the field we will abide by what he says but gunther and gernot and the young giselher were unwilling to do this for it was not their custom to annoy their guests with questions which should be allowed to trouble themselves alone and the kings and their counsellors went out of the councilchamber each to ponder in silence upon the troublesome question as gunther with downcast head and troubled brow walked thoughtfully through the great hall he unexpectedly met siegfried what evil tidings have you heard asked the prince surprised at the strange mien of the king what has gone amiss that should cause such looks of dark perplexity that is a matter which i can tell only to friends long tried and true answered gunther siegfried was surprised and hurt by these words and he cried out what more would gunther ask of me that i might prove my friendship surely i have tried to merit his esteem and trust tell me what troubles you and i will further show myself to be your friend both tried and true then gunther was ashamed of the words he had spoken to his guest and he took siegfried into his own chamber and told him all and he asked him what answer they should send on the morrow to the overbearing northkings tell them we will fight answered siegfried i myself will lead your warriors to the fray never shall it be said that my friends have suffered wrong and i not tried to help them then he and gunther talked over the plans which they would follow and the clouds fled at once from the brow of the king and he was no longer troubled or doubtful for he believed in siegfried the next morning the heralds of the northkings were brought again before gunther and his brothers and they were told to carry this word to their masters the burgundians will fight they will make no terms with their enemies save such as they make of their own freewill then the heralds were loaded with costly presents and a company of knights and warriors went with them to the borderline of burgundy and filled with wonder at what they had seen they hastened back to their liege lords and told all that had happened to them and leudiger and leudigast were very wroth when they heard the answer which the burgundians had sent to them but when they learned that the noble siegfried was at gunthers castle they shook their heads and seemed to feel more doubtful of success many and busy were the preparations for war and in a very few days all things were in readiness for the march northwards it was settled that siegfried with his twelve nibelungen chiefs and a thousand picked men should go forth to battle against their boastful enemies the darkbrowed hagen as he had always done rode at the head of the company and by his side was siegfried on the noble horse greyfell next came gernot and the bold chief volker bearing the standard upon which a golden dragon was engraved then followed dankwart and ortwin and the twelve worthy comrades of siegfried and then the thousand warriors the bravest in all rhineland mounted on impatient steeds and clad in bright steel armor with broad shields and plumed helmets and burnished swords and sharppointed spears and all rode proudly out through the great castlegate and gunther and the young giselher and all the fair ladies of the court bade them godspeed the little army passed through the forest and went northwards until on the fifth day they reached the boundaries of saxon land and siegfried gave spur to his horse greyfell and leaving the little army behind him hastened forwards to see where the enemy was encamped as he reached the top of a high hill he saw the armies of the northkings resting carelessly in the valley beyond knights mounted on their horses rode hither and thither the soldiers sauntered lazily among the trees or slept upon the grass arms were thrown about in great disorder or stacked in piles near the smoking campfires no one dreamed of danger but all supposed that the burgundians were still at home and would never dare to attack a foe so numerous and so strong for it was indeed a mighty army which siegfried saw before him full forty thousand men were there and they not only filled the valley but spread over the hills beyond and far to the right and left while he stood at the top of the hill and gazed upon this sight a warrior who had spied him from below rode up and paused before him like two black thunderclouds with lightning flashing between the two knights stood facing each other and casting wrathful glances from beneath their visors then each spurred his horse and charged with fury upon the other and the heavy lances of both were broken in shivers upon the opposing shields then quick as thought they turned and drew their swords and hand to hand they fought but soon siegfried by an unlookedfor stroke sent his enemys sword flying from him broken in a dozen pieces and by a sudden movement he threw him from his horse the heavy shield of the fallen knight was no hinderance to the quick strokes of siegfrieds sword and his glittering armor soiled by the mud into which he had been thrown held him down he threw up his hands and begged for mercy i am leudigast the king he cried spare my life i am your prisoner siegfried heard the prayer of the discomfited king and lifting him from the ground he helped him to remount his charger but while he was doing this thirty warriors who had seen the combat from below came dashing up the hill to the rescue of their liegelord siegfried faced about with his horse greyfell and quietly waited for their onset but as they drew near they were so awed by the noble bearing and grand proportions of the hero and so astonished at sight of the sunbeam mane of greyfell and the cold glitter of the blade balmung that in sudden fright they stopped then turned and fled in dismay down the sloping hillside nor paused until they were safe among their friends in the mean while leudiger the other king seeing what was going on at the top of the hill had caused an alarm to be sounded and all his hosts had hastily arranged themselves in battlearray at the same time hagen and gernot and their little army of heroes hove in sight and came quickly to siegfrieds help and the dragonbanner was planted upon the crest of the hill the captive king leudigast was taken to the rear and a guard was placed over him the champions of the rhine formed in line and faced their foes the great army of the northkings moved boldly up the hill and when they saw how few were the burgundians they laughed and cheered most lustily for they felt that the odds was in their favor and forty to one is no small odds then siegfried and his twelve comrades and hagen and the thousand burgundian knights dashed upon them with the fury of the whirlwind the lances flew so thick in the air that they hid the sun from sight swords flashed on every side the sound of clashing steel and horses hoofs and soldiers shouts filled earth and sky with a horrid din and soon the boastful foes of the burgundians were everywhere worsted and thrown into disorder siegfried dashed hither and thither from one part of the field to another in search of king leudiger thrice he cut his way through the ranks and at last he met face to face the one for whom he sought king leudiger saw the flashing sunbeams that glanced from greyfells mane he saw the painted crown upon the heros broad shield and then he felt the fearful stroke of the sword balmung as it clashed against his own and cut it clean in halves he dropped his weapons raised his visor and gave himself up as a prisoner give up the fight my brave fellows he cried this is siegfried the brave the prince of the lowlands and the lord of nibelungen land it were foolishness to fight against him save yourselves as best you can this was the signal for a frightful panic all turned and fled each thought of nothing but his own safety and knights and warriors horsemen and footsoldiers in one confused mass throwing shields and weapons here and there rushed wildly down the hill and through the valley and ravines and sought as best they could their way homeward the burgundian heroes were the masters of the field and on the morrow they turned their faces joyfully towards rhineland and all joined in saying that to siegfried was due the praise for this wonderful victory which they had gained heralds had been sent on the fleetest horses to carry the glad news to burgundy and when one morning they dashed into the courtyard of the castle great was the anxiety to know what tidings they brought and king gunther and the young giselher and the peerless kriemhild came out to welcome them and eagerly to inquire what had befallen the heroes with breathless haste the heralds told the story of all that had happened and how fares our brother gernot asked kriemhild there is no happier man on earth answered the herald in truth there was not a coward among them all but the bravest of the brave was siegfried he it was who took the two kings prisoners and everywhere in the thickest of the fight there was siegfried and now our little army is on its homeward march with a thousand prisoners and large numbers of the enemys wounded had it not been for the brave siegfried no such victory could have been won in a few days the rhine champions reached their home and gayly were the castle and all the houses in the city decked in honor of them and all those who had been left behind went out to meet them as they came down from the forestroad and drew near to the castle and the young girls strewed flowers in their path and hung garlands upon their horses and music and song followed the heroes into the city and through the castlegate when they reached the palace the two prisoner kings leudiger and leudigast were loosed from their bonds and handsomely entertained at gunthers table and the burgundian kings assured them that they should be treated as honored guests and have the freedom of the court and castle if they would pledge themselves not to try to escape from burgundy until terms of peace should be agreed upon this pledge they gladly gave and rich apartments in the palace were assigned for their use like favors were shown to all the prisoners according to their rank and the wounded were kindly cared for and the burgundians made ready for a gay hightide a glad festival of rejoicing to be held at the next full moon when the day drew near which had been set for this hightide the folk from all parts of rhineland began to flock towards the city they came in companies with music and laughter and the glad songs of the springtime and all the knights were mounted on gallant horses caparisoned with goldred saddles from which hung numbers of tinkling silver bells as they rode up the sands towards the castlegate with their dazzling shields upon their saddlebows and their gay and manycolored banners floating in the air king gernot and the young giselher with the noblest knights of the fortress went courteously out to meet them and the friendly greetings which were offered by the two young kings won the hearts of all thirty and two princes and more than five thousand warriors came as bidden guests the city and castle were decked in holiday attire and all the people in the land gave themselves up to enjoyment the sick and the wounded who until now had thought themselves at deaths door forgot their ailments and their pains as they heard the shouts of joy and the peals of music in the streets in a green field outside of the city walls arrangements had been made for the games and galleries and high stages had been built for the lookerson here jousts and tournaments were held and the knights and warriors engaged in trials of strength and skill when king gunther saw with what keen enjoyment both his own people and his guests looked upon these games and took part in the gay festivities he asked of those around him what more can we do to heighten the pleasures of the day and one of his counsellors answered my lord the ladies of the court and the little children pine in silence in the sunless rooms of the palace while we enjoy the free air and light of heaven the music and the gay scenes before us there is nothing wanting to make this days joy complete save the presence of our dear ones to share these pleasures with us gunther was delighted to hear these words and he sent a herald to the palace and invited all the ladies of the court and all the children to come out and view the games and join in the general gladness when dame ute heard the message which the herald brought from her kingly son she hastened to make ready rich dresses and costly jewels wherewith to adorn the dames and damsels of the court and when all were in readiness the peerless kriemhild with her mother at her side went forth from the castle and a hundred knights all sword in hand went with her as a bodyguard and a great number of noble ladies dressed in rich attire followed her as the red dawn peers forth from behind gray clouds and drives the mists and shadows away from earth so came the lovely one as the bright full moon in radiant splendor moves in queenlike beauty before her train of attendant stars and outshines them all so was kriemhild the most glorious among all the noble ladies there and the thousand knights and warriors paused in their games and greeted the peerless princess as was due to one so noble and fair upon the highest platform under a rich canopy of clothofgold seats were made ready for the maiden and her mother and the fair ladies in their train and all the most worthy princes in rhineland sat around and the games were begun again for twelve days the gay hightide lasted and nought was left undone whereby the joy might be increased and of all the heroes and princes who jousted in the tournament or took part in the games none could equal the unassuming siegfried and his praises were heard on every hand and all agreed that he was the most worthy prince that they had ever seen when at last the festal days came to an end gunther and his brothers called their guests and vassals around them and loaded them with costly gifts and bade them godspeed and tears stood in the eyes of all at parting the captive kings leudiger and leudigast were not forgotten what will ye give me for your freedom asked king gunther half in jest they answered if you will allow us without further hinderance to go back to our people we pledge our lives and our honor that we will straightway send you gold as much as half a thousand horses can carry then gunther turned to siegfried and said what think you friend siegfried of such princely ransom noble lord said siegfried i think you are in need of no such ransom friendship is worth much more than gold if your kingly captives will promise on their honor never more to come towards burgundy as enemies let them go we have no need of gold tis well said cried gunther highly pleased and leudiger and leudigast with tears of thankfulness gladly made the askedfor promise and on the morrow with light hearts and costly gifts they set out on their journey homewards when all the guests had gone and the daily routine of idle palacelife set in again siegfried began to talk of going back to nibelungen land but young giselher and the peerless kriemhild and king gunther besought him to stay yet a little longer and he yielded to their kind wishes and autumn passed away with its fruits and its vintage and grim old winter came howling down from the north and siegfried was still in burgundy and then old hoder the king of the winter months came blustering through the rhine valley and with him were the reifriesen the thieves that steal the daylight from the earth and the warmth from the sun and they nipped the flowers and withered the grass and stripped the trees and sealed up the rivers and covered the earth with a white mantle of sorrow but within king gunthers wide halls there was joy and good cheer and the season of the yulefeast came and still siegfried tarried in burgundyland adventure xiii the story of balder there was mirth in king gunthers dwelling for the time of the yulefeast had come the broad banquet hall was gayly decked with cedar and spruce and sprigs of the mistletoe and the fires roared in the great chimneys throwing warmth and a ruddy glow of light into every corner of the room the long table fairly groaned under its weight of good cheer at its head sat the kings and the earlfolk and before them on a silver platter of rare workmanship was the head of a huge wild boar the festal offering to the good frey in honor of whom the yulefeast was held for now the sun which had been driven by the frostgiants far away towards the southland had begun to return and frey was on his way once more to scatter peace and plenty over the land the harp and the wassailbowl went round and each one of the company sang a song or told a story or in some way did his part to add to the evenings enjoyment and a young seaking who sat at siegfrieds side told most bewitching tales of other lands which lie beyond old aegirs kingdom then when the harp came to him he sang the wondrous song of the shaping of the earth and all who heard were charmed with the sweet sound and with the pleasant words he sang of the sunlight and the south winds and the summertime of the storms and the snow and the sombre shadows of the northland and he sang of the dead ymir the giant whose flesh had made the solid earth and whose blood the sea and whose bones the mountains whose teeth the cliffs and crags and whose skull the heavens and he sang of odin the earths preserver the giver of life the father of all and of the asafolk who dwell in asgard and of the ghostly heroes in valhal then he sang of the heaventower of the thundergod and of the shimmering asabridge or rainbow all afire and lastly of the four dwarfs who hold the blue skydome above them and of the elves of the mountains and of the woodsprites and the fairies then he laid aside his harp and told the old but everbeautiful story of the death of balder the good the story balder as you know was odins son and he was the brightest and best of all the asafolk wherever he went there were gladness and lighthearted mirth and blooming flowers and singing birds and murmuring waterfalls balder too was a hero but not one of the blustering kind like thor he slew no giants he never went into battle he never tried to make for himself a name among the dwellers of the midworld and yet he was a hero of the noblest type he dared to do right and to stand up for the good the true and the beautiful there are still some such heroes but the world does not always hear of them hoder the blind king of the winter months was balders brother and as unlike him as darkness is unlike daylight while one rejoiced and was merry and cheerful the other was lowspirited and sad while one scattered sunshine and blessings everywhere the other carried with him a sense of cheerlessness and gloom yet the brothers loved each other dearly one night balder dreamed a strange dream and when he awoke he could not forget it all day long he was thoughtful and sad and he was not his own bright happy self his mother the asaqueen saw that something troubled him and she asked whence comes that cloud upon your brow will you suffer it to chase away all your sunshine and will you become like your brother hoder all frowns and sighs and tears then balder told her what he had dreamed and she too was sorely troubled for it was a frightful dream and foreboded dire disasters then both she and balder went to odin and to him they told the cause of their uneasiness and the allfather also was distressed for he knew that such dreams dreamed by asafolk were the forewarnings of evil so he saddled his eightfooted steed sleipner and without telling any one where he was going he rode with the speed of the winds down into the valley of death the dog that guards the gateway to that dark and doleful land came out to meet him blood was on the fierce beasts breast and he barked loudly and angrily at the allfather and his wondrous horse but odin sang sweet magic songs as he drew near and the dog was charmed with the sound and sleipner and his rider went onward in safety and they passed the dark halls of the palefaced queen and came to the east gate of the valley there stood the low hut of a witch who lived in darkness and like the norns spun the thread of fate for gods and men odin stood before the hut and sang a wondrous song of witchery and enchantment and he laid a spell upon the weird woman and forced her to come out of her dark dwelling and to answer his questions who is this stranger asked the witch who is this unknown who calls me from my narrow home and sets an irksome task for me long have i been left alone in my quiet house nor recked i that the snow sometimes covered with its cold white mantle both me and my restingplace or that the pattering rain and the gently falling dew often moistened the roof of my dwelling long have i rested quietly and i do not wish now to be aroused i am valtams son said odin and i come to learn of thee tell me i pray for whom are the soft couches prepared that i saw in the broad halls of death for whom are the jewels and the rings and the rich clothing and the shining shield all are for balder odins son she answered and the mead which has been brewed for him is hidden beneath the shining shield then odin asked who would be the slayer of balder and she answered that hoder was the one who would send the shining asa to the halls of death who will avenge balder and bring distress upon his slayer asked odin a son of earth but one day old shall be balders avenger go thou now home odin for i know thou art not valtams son go home and none shall again awaken me nor disturb me at my task until the new day shall dawn and balder shall rule over the young world in its purity and there shall be no more death then odin rode sorrowfully homeward but he told no one of his journey to the dark valley nor of what the weird witch had said to him balders mother the asaqueen could not rest because of the illomened dream that her son had had and in her distress she called all the asafolk together to consider what should be done but they were speechless with sorrow and alarm and none could offer advice nor set her mind at ease then she sought out every living creature and every lifeless thing upon the earth and asked each one to swear that it would not on any account hurt balder nor touch him to do him harm and this oath was willingly made by fire and water earth and air by all beasts and creeping things and birds and fishes by the rocks and by the trees and all metals for every thing loved balder the good then the asafolk thought that great honor was shown to balder each time any thing refused to hurt him and to show their love for him as well as to amuse themselves they often hewed at him with their battleaxes or struck at him with their sharp swords or hurled toward him their heavy lances for every weapon turned aside from its course and would neither mark nor bruise the shining target at which it was aimed and balders princely beauty shone as bright and as pure as ever when loki the mischiefmaker saw how all things loved and honored balder his heart was filled with jealous hate and he sought all over the earth for some beast or bird or tree or lifeless thing that had not taken the oath but he could find not one then disguised as a fair maiden he went to fensal hall where dwelt balders mother the fair asaqueen was busy at her distaff with her golden spindles spinning flax to be woven into fine linen for the gods and her maidservant fulla of the flowing hair sat on a stool beside her when the queen saw loki she asked whence come you fair stranger and what favor would you ask of odins wife i come answered the disguised loki from the plains of ida where the gods meet for pleasant pastime as well as to talk of the weightier matters of their kingdom and how do they while away their time today asked the queen they have a pleasant game which they call balders honor was the answer the shining hero stands before them as a target and each one tries his skill at hurling some weapon toward him first odin throws at him the spear gungner which never before was known to miss its mark but it passes harmlessly over balders head then thor takes up a huge rock and hurls it full at balders breast but it turns in its course and will not smite the sunbright target then tyr seizes a battleaxe and strikes at balder as though he would hew him down but the keen edge refuses to touch him and in this way the asafolk show honor to the best of their number the asaqueen smiled in the glad pride of her motherheart and said yes every thing shows honor to the best of odins sons for neither metal nor wood nor stone nor fire nor water will touch balder to do him harm is it true then asked loki that every thing has made an oath to you and promised not to hurt your son and the queen not thinking what harm an unguarded word might do answered every thing has promised save a little feeble sprig that men call the mistletoe so small and weak it is that i knew it could never harm any one and so i passed it by and did not ask it to take the oath then loki went out of fensal hall and left the asaqueen at her spinning and he walked briskly away and paused not until he came to the eastern side of valhal where on the branches of an old oak the mistletoe grew rudely he tore the plant from its supporting branch and hid it under his cloak then he walked leisurely back to the place where the asafolk were wont to meet in council the next day the asas went out as usual to engage in pleasant pastimes on the plains of ida when they had tired of leaping and footracing and tilting they placed balder before them as a target again and as each threw his weapon toward the shining mark they laughed to see the missile turn aside from its course and refuse to strike the honored one but blind hoder stood sorrowfully away from the others and did not join in any of their sports loki seeing this went to him and said brother of the gloomy brow why do you not take part with us in our games i am blind answered hoder i can neither leap nor run nor throw the lance but you can shoot arrows from your bow said loki alas said hoder that i can do only as some one shall direct my aim for i can see no target do you hear that laughter asked loki thor has hurled the straight trunk of a pinetree at your brother and rather than touch such a glorious mark it has turned aside and been shivered to pieces upon the rocks over there it is thus that the asafolk and all things living and lifeless honor balder hoder is the only one who hangs his head and fears to do his part come now let me fit this little arrow in your bow and then as i point it do you shoot when you hear the gods laugh you will know that your arrow has shown honor to the hero by refusing to hit him and hoder thinking no harm did as loki wished and the deadly arrow sped from the bow and pierced the heart of shining balder and he sank lifeless upon the ground then the asafolk who saw it were struck speechless with sorrow and dismay and had it not been that the ida plains where they then stood were sacred to peace they would have seized upon loki and put him to death forthwith the world was draped in mourning for balder the good the birds stopped singing and flew with drooping wings to the far southland the beasts sought to hide themselves in their lairs and in the holes of the ground the trees shivered and sighed until their leaves fell withered to the earth the flowers closed their eyes and died the rivers stopped flowing and dark and threatening billows veiled the sea even the sun shrouded his face and withdrew silently towards the south when balders good mother heard the sad news she left her golden spindle in fensal hall and with her maidens hastened to the idaplains where the body of her son still lay nanna the faithful wife of balder was already there and wild was her grief at sight of the lifeless loved one and all the asafolk save guilty loki who had fled for his life stood about them in dumb amazement but odin was the most sorrowful of all for he knew that with balder the world had lost its most gladsome life they lifted the body and carried it down to the sea where the great ship ringhorn which balder himself had built lay ready to be launched and a great company followed and stood upon the beach and bewailed the untimely death of the hero first came odin with his griefstricken queen and then his troop of handmaidens the valkyrien followed by his ravens hugin and munin then came thor in his goatdrawn car and heimdal on his horse goldtop then frey in his wagon behind the boar gullinbruste of the golden bristles then freyja in her chariot drawn by cats came weeping tears of gold lastly poor blind hoder overcome with grief was carried thither on the back of one of the frostgiants and old aegir the ocean king raised his dripping head above the water and gazed with dewy eyes upon the scene and the waves as if affrighted left off their playing and were still high on the deck they built the funeralpile and they placed the body upon it and covered it with costly garments and with woods of the finest scent and the noble horse which had been balders they slew and placed beside him that he might not have to walk to the halls of death and odin took from his finger the ring draupner the earths enricher and laid it on the pile then nanna the faithful wife was overcome with grief and her gentle heart was broken and she fell lifeless at the feet of the asaqueen and they carried her upon the ship and laid her by her husbands side when all things were in readiness to set fire to the pile the gods tried to launch the ship but it was so heavy that they could not move it so they sent in haste to jotunheim for the stout giantess hyrroken and she came with the speed of the whirlwind and riding on a wolf which she guided with a bridle of writhing snakes what will you have me do she asked we would have you launch the great ship ring horn answered odin that i will do roared the grim giantess and giving the vessel a single push she sent it sliding with speed into the deep waters of the bay then she gave the word to her grisly steed and she flew onwards and away no one knew whither the ringhorn floated nobly upon the water a worthy bier for the body which it bore the fire was set to the funeralpile and the red flames shot upwards to the sky but their light was but a flickering beam when matched with the sunbright beauty of balder whose body they consumed then the sorrowing folk turned away and went back to their homes a cheerless gloom rested heavily where light gladness had ruled before and when they reached the high halls of asgard the asaqueen spoke and said who now for the love of balder and his stricken mother will undertake an errand who will go down into the valley of death and seek for balder and ransom him and bring him back to asgard and the midworld then hermod the nimble the brother of balder answered i will go i will find him and with helas leave will bring him back and he mounted sleipner the eightfooted steed and galloped swiftly away nine days and nine nights he rode through strange valleys and mountain gorges where the suns light had never been and through gloomy darkness and fearful silence until he came to the black river and the glittering golden bridge which crosses it over the bridge his strong horse carried him although it shook and swayed and threatened to throw him into the raging inky flood below on the other side a maiden keeps the gate and hermod stopped to pay the toll what is thy name she asked my name is hermod and i am called the nimble he answered what is thy fathers name his name is odin mayhap you have heard of him why ridest thou with such thunderous speed five kingdoms of dead men passed over this bridge yesterday and it shook not with their weight as it did with thee and thy strange steed thou art not of the pale multitude that are wont to pass this gate what is thy errand and why ridest thou to the domains of the dead i go to find my brother balder answered hermod it is but a short time since he unwillingly came down into these shades three days ago said the maiden balder passed this way and by his side rode the faithful nanna so bright was his presence even here that the whole valley was lighted up as it had never before been lighted the black river glittered like a gem the frowning mountains smiled for once and hela herself the queen of these regions slunk far away into her most distant halls but balder went on his way and even now he sups with nanna in the dark castle over yonder then hermod rode forward till he came to the castle walls these were built of black marble and the iron gate was barred and bolted and none who went in had ever yet come out hermod called loudly to the porter to open the gate and let him in but no one seemed to hear nor heed him for the words of the living are unknown in that place then he drew the saddlegirths more tightly around the horse sleipner and urged him forward high up the great horse leaped and he sprang clear over the gates and landed at the open door of the great hall leaving his steed hermod went boldly in and there he found his brother balder and the faithful nanna seated at the festal board and honored as the most worthy of all the guests with balder hermod staid until the night had passed and many were the pleasant words they spoke when morning came hermod went into the presence of hela and said o mighty queen i come to ask a boon of thee balder the good whom both gods and men loved has been sent to dwell with thee here in thy darksome house and all the world weeps for him and has donned the garb of mourning and cannot be consoled until his bright light shall shine upon them again and the gods have sent me his brother to ask thee to let balder ride back with me to asgard to his noble sorrowing mother the asaqueen for then will hope live again in the hearts of men and happiness will return to the earth the deathqueen was silent for a moment and then she said in a sad voice hardly can i believe that any being is so greatly loved by things living and lifeless for surely balder is not more the friend of earth than i am and yet men love me not but go thou back to asgard and if every thing shall weep for balder then i will send him to you but if any thing shall refuse to weep then i will keep him in my halls so hermod made ready to return home and balder gave him the ring draupner to carry to his father as a keepsake and nanna sent to the queenmother a rich carpet of purest green then the nimble messenger mounted his horse and rode swiftly back over the dark river and through the frowning valleys until he at last reached odins halls when the asafolk learned upon what terms they might have balder again with them they sent heralds all over the world to beseech every thing to mourn for him and men and beasts and creeping things and birds and fishes and trees and stones and air and water all things living and lifeless joined in weeping for the lost balder but as the heralds were on their way back to asgard they met a giantess named thok and they asked her to join in the universal grief and she answered what good thing did balder ever do for thok what gladness did he ever bring her if she should weep for him it would be with dry tears let hela keep him in her hallsen and yet the day shall come added the storyteller when the words of the weird woman to odin shall prove true and balder shall come again to rule over a newborn world in which there shall be no wrongdoing and no more death adventure xiv how gunther outwitted brunhild while still the festivities were at their height an old man of noble mien and with snowwhite beard and hair came into the great hall and sang for the gay company and some whispered that this must be bragi for surely such rare music could not be made by any other but he sang not of spring as bragi does nor yet of youth nor of beauty nor like one whose home is with the songbirds and who lives beside the babbling brooks and the leaping waterfalls his song was a sorrowful one of dying flowers and falling leaves and the wailing winds of autumn of forgotten joys of blasted hopes of a crushed ambition of gray hairs of uttering footsteps of old age of a lonely grave and as he sang all were moved to tears by the mournful melody and the sad sad words good friend said siegfried thy music agrees not well with this time and place for where nothing but mirth and joy are welcome thou hast brought sorrowful thoughts and gloomy forebodings come now and undo the harm thou hast done by singing a song which shall tell only of mirth and gladness the old man shook his head and answered were i bragi as some think i am or were i even a strolling harper i might do as you ask but i am neither and i know no gladsome songs men have called me a messenger of ill omen and such indeed i have sometimes been although through no wish of my own i come as a herald from a faroff land and i bear a message to all the kings and the noblest chiefs of rhineland if king gunther will allow me i will now make that message known let the herald speak on said gunther graciously far over the sea said the herald there lies a dreamy land called isenland and in that land there is a glorious castle with six and eighty towers built of purest marble green as grass in that castle there lives the fairest of all earths daughters brunhild the maiden of the springtime in the early days she was one of odins valkyrien and with other heavenly maidens it was her duty to follow unseen in the wake of armies and when they met in battle to hover over the field and with kisses to waken the dead heroes and lead their souls away to odins glad banquethall but upon a day she failed to do the allfathers bidding and he in anger sent her to live among men and like them to be shortlived and subject to old age and death but the childless old king of isenland took pity upon the friendless maiden and called her his daughter and made her his heir then odin still more angered sent the thorn of sleep to wound the princess and sleep seized upon every creature in isenland and silence reigned in the halls of the marble palace for odin said thus shall they all sleep until the hero comes who will ride through fire and awaken brunhild with a kiss at last the hero so long waited for came he passed the fiery barrier safe and awoke the slumbering maiden and all the castle sprang suddenly into life again and brunhild became known once more as the most glorious princess in this midworld but the sunbright hero who freed her from her prison of sleep vanished from isenland and no one knew where he went but men say that he rides through the noble world the fairest and the best of kings and brunhild has sought for him in many lands and although all folk have heard of his deeds none know where he dwells and so as a last resort she has sent heralds into every land to challenge every king to match his skill with hers in three games of strength in casting the spear in hurling the heavy stone and in leaping the one who can equal her in these feats shall be king of isenland and share with her the throne of isenstein and by this means she hopes to find the longabsent hero for she believes that there is no other prince on earth whose strength and skill are equal to her own many men have already risked their lives in this adventure and all have failed and now king gunther continued the herald i have come by her orders into rhineland and i deliver the challenge to you if you accept and are beaten your life is forfeited if you succeed the fairest kingdom and the most beautiful queen in the world are yours for you will have proved that you are at least the equal of the hero whom she seeks what reply shall i carry back to isenland king gunther answered hastily and as one dazed and in a dream say that i accept the challenge and that when the springtime comes again and the waters in the river are unlocked i shall go to isenland and match my skill and strength with that of the fair and mighty brunhild all who stood around were greatly astonished at gunthers reply for although his mind was somewhat weak he was not given to rash and hazardous undertakings and siegfried who was at his side whispered think twice friend gunther ere you decide you do not know the strength of this mighty but lovely warriormaiden were your strength four times what it is you could not hope to excel her in those feats give up this hasty plan i pray you and recall your answer to the challenge think no more of such an undertaking for it surely will cost you your life but these warnings and the words of others who tried to dissuade him only made gunther the more determined and he vowed that nothing should hinder him from undertaking the adventure then the darkbrowed hagen said our friend siegfried seems to know much about isenland and its maidenqueen and indeed if there is any truth in hearsay he has had the best of means for learning now if our good king gunther has set his mind on going upon this dangerous enterprise mayhap siegfried would be willing to bear him company gunther was pleased with hagens words and he said to siegfried my best of friends go with me to isenland and help me if we do well in our undertaking ask of me any reward you wish and i will give it you so far as in my power lies you know kind gunther answered siegfried that for myself i have no fear and yet again i would warn you to shun the unknown dangers with which this enterprise is fraught but if after all your heart is set upon it make ready to start as soon as the warm winds shall have melted the ice from the river i will go with you the king grasped siegfrieds hand and thanked him heartily we must build a fleet said he a thousand fightingmen shall go with us and we will land in isenland with a retinue such as no other prince has had a number of stanch vessels shall be built at once and in the early spring they shall be launched upon the rhine siegfried was amused at gunthers earnestness and he answered do not think of taking such a following you would waste twelve months in building and victualling such a fleet you would take from burgundy its only safeguard against foes from without and after you should reach isenland you would find such a large force to be altogether useless take my advice have one small vessel built and rigged and victualled for the long and dangerous voyage and when the time shall come you and i and your kinsmen hagen and dankwart we four only will undertake the voyage and the emprise you have decided upon gunther knew that his friends judgment in this matter was better than his own and he agreed readily to all of siegfrieds plans when at length the winter months began to wane many hands were busy making ready for the voyage the peerless kriemhild called together thirty of her maidens the most skilful seamstresses in burgundyland and began the making of rich clothing for her brother and his friendsen with her own fair hands she cut out garments from the rarest stuffs from the silky skins brought from the sunny lands of lybia from the rich cloth of zazemang green as clover from the silk that traders bring from araby white as the drifted snow for seven weeks the clever maidens and their gentle mistress plied their busy needles and twelve suits of wondrous beauty they made for each of the four heroes and the princely garments were covered with fine needlework and with curious devices all studded with rare and costly jewels and all were wrought with threads of gold many carpenters and shipbuilders were busy with axes and hammers and flaming forges working day and night to make ready a vessel new and stanch to carry the adventurers over the sea and great stores of food and of all things needful to their safety or comfort were brought together and put on board neither were the heroes themselves idle for when not busy in giving directions to the workmen or in overseeing the preparations that were elsewhere going on they spent the time in polishing their armor now long unused in looking after their weapons or in providing for the management of their business while away and siegfried forgot not his trusty sword balmung nor his cloak of darkness the priceless tarnkappe which he had captured from the dwarf alberich in the nibelungen land then the twelve suits of garments which fair fingers had wrought were brought and when the men tried them on so faultless was the fit so rare and perfect was every piece in richness and beauty that even the wearers were amazed and all declared that such dazzling and kingly raiment had never before been seen at last the spring months had fairly vanquished all the forces of the cold northland the warm breezes had melted the snow and ice and unlocked the river and the time had come for gunther and his comrades to embark the little ship well victualled and made stanch and stout in every part had been launched upon the rhine and she waited with flying streamers and impatient sails the coming of her crew down the sands at length they came riding upon their steeds and behind them followed a train of vassals bearing their kingly garments and their goldred shields and on the banks stood many of the noblest folk of burgundy gernot and the young giselher and ute the queenmother and kriemhild the peerless and a number of earlfolk and warriors and fair dames and blushing damsels and the heroes bade farewell to their weeping friends and went upon the waiting vessel taking their steeds with them and siegfried seized an oar and pushed the bark off from the shore i myself will be the steersman for i know the way he said and the sails were unfurled to the brisk south wind and the vessel sped swiftly toward the sea and many fair eyes were filled tears as they watched it until it could be seen no more and with sighs and gloomy forebodings the good people went back to their homes and but few hoped ever again to see their king and his brave comrades driven by favorable winds the trusty little vessel sailed gayly down the rhine and ere many days had passed was out in the boundless sea for a long time the heroes sailed and rowed through old aegirs watery kingdom but they kept good cheer and their hearts rose higher and higher for each day they drew nearer the end of their voyage and the goal of their hopes at length they came in sight of a farreaching coast and a lovely land and not far from the shore they saw a noble fortress with a number of tall towers pointing toward the sky what land is that asked the kingen and siegfried answered that it was isenland and that the fortress which they saw was the castle of isenstein and the green marble hall of the princess brunhild but he warned his friends to be very wary when they should arrive at the hall let all tell this story said he say that gunther is the king and that i am his faithful vassal the success of our undertaking depends on this and his three comrades promised to do as he advised as the vessel neared the shore the whole castle seemed to be alive from every tower and turretwindow from every door and balcony lords and ladies fightingmen and servingmen looked out to see what strangers these were who came thus unheralded to isenland the heroes went on shore with their steeds leaving the vessel moored to the bank and then they rode slowly up the beach and across the narrow plain and came to the drawbridge and the great gateway where they paused the matchless brunhild in her chamber had been told of the coming of the strangers and she asked the maidens who stood around who think you are the unknown warriors who thus come boldly to isenstein without asking leave what is their bearing do they seem to be worthy of our notice or are they some straggling beggars who have lost their way and one of the maidens looking through the casement answered the first is a king i know from his noble mien and the respect which his fellows pay to him but the second bears himself with a prouder grace and seems the noblest of them all he reminds me much of the brave young siegfried of former days indeed it must be siegfried for he rides a steed with sunbeam mane which can be none other than greyfell the third is a dark and gloomy man he wears a sullen frown upon his brow and his eyes seem to shoot quick glances around how nervously he grasps his swordhilt as if ever guarding against surprise i think his temper must be grim and fiery and his heart a heart of flint the fourth and last of the company is young and fair and of gentle port little business has he with rude warriors and many tears methinks would be shed for him at home should harm overtake him never before have i seen so noble a company of strangers in isenland their garments are of dazzling lustre their saddles are covered with gemstones their weapons are of unequalled brightness surely they are worthy of your notice when brunhild heard that siegfried was one of the company she was highly pleased and she hastened to make ready to meet them in the great hall and she sent ten worthy lords to open the gate and to welcome the heroes to isenland when siegfried and his comrades passed through the great gateway and came into the castleyard their horses were led away to the stables and the clanging armor and the broad shields and swords which they carried were taken from them and placed in the castle armory little heed was paid to hagens surly complaint at thus having every means of defence taken away he was told that such had always been the rule at isenstein and that he like others must submit after a short delay the heroes were shown into the great hall where the matchless brunhild already was awaiting them clad in richest raiment from every fold of which rare jewels gleamed and wearing a coronet of pearls and gold the warriormaiden sat on a throne of snowwhite ivory five hundred earlfolk and warriors the bravest in isenland stood around her with drawn swords and fierce determined looks surely men of mettle less heroic than that of the four knights from rhineland would have quaked with fear in such a presence king gunther and his comrades went forward to salute the queen with a winning smile she kindly greeted them and then said to siegfried gladly do we welcome you back to our land friend siegfried we have ever remembered you as our best friend may we ask what is your will and who are these warriors whom you have with you most noble queen answered he right thankful am i that you have not forgotten me and that you should deign to notice me while in the presence of this my liege lord and he pointed towards king gunther the king of all burgundyland whose humble vassal i am has heard the challenge you have sent into different lands and he has come to match his strength with yours does he know the conditions asked brunhild he does was the answer in case of success the fairest of women for his queen in case of failure death yet scores of worthy men have made trial and all have failed said she i warn your liege lord to pause and weigh well the chances ere he runs so great a risk then gunther stepped forward and spoke the chances fairest queen have all been weighed and nothing can change our mind make your own terms arrange every thing as pleases you best we accept your challenge and ask to make a trial of our strength the warriormaiden without more words bade her servants help her to make ready at once for the contest she donned a rich warcoat brought long ago from the faroff lybian shores an armor which it was said no sword could dint and upon which the heaviest stroke of spear fell harmless her hemlet was edged with golden lace and sparkled all over with rich gemstones her lance of wondrous length a heavy weight for three stout men was brought her shield was as broad and as bright as the sun and three spans thick with steel and gold while the princess was thus arming herself the heroes looked on with amazement and fear but siegfried unnoticed hastened quietly out of the hall and through the open castlegate and sped like the wind to the seashore and to their little ship there he arrayed himself in the tarnkappe and then silent and unseen he ran back to his friends in the great hall be of good cheer he whispered in the ears of the trembling gunther but the king could not see who it was that spoke to him so well was the hero hidden in the cloak of darkness yet he knew that it must be siegfried and he felt greatly encouraged hagens frowning face grew darker and the uneasy glances which shot from beneath his shaggy eyebrows were not those of fear but of anger and deep anxiety dankwart gave up all as lost and loudly bewailed their folly must we unarmed stand still and see our liege lord slain for a womans whim he cried had we only our good swords we might defy this maidenqueen and all her isenland brunhild overheard his words scornfully she called to her servants bring to these boasters their armor and let them have their keenedged swords brunhild has no fear of such men whether they be armed or unarmed when hagen and dankwart felt their limbs again enclosed in steel and when they held their trusty swords in hand their uneasiness vanished and hope returned in the castleyard a space was cleared and brunhilds five hundred warriors stood around as umpires the unseen siegfried kept close by gunthers side fear not he said do my bidding and you are safe let me take your shield when the time comes make you the movements and trust me to do the work then brunhild threw her spear at gunthers shield the mighty weapon sped through the air with the swiftness of lightning and when it struck the shield both gunther and the unseen siegfried fell to the ground borne down by its weight and the force with which it was thrown blood gushed from the nostrils of both and sad would have been their fate if the friendly tarnkappe had not hidden siegfried from sight and given him the strength of twelve giants quickly they rose and gunther seemed to pick up the heavy shaft but it was really siegfried who raised it from the ground for one moment he poised the great beam in the air and then turning the blunt end foremost he sent it flying back more swiftly than it had come it struck the huge shield which brunhild held before her with a sound that echoed to the farthest cliffs of isenland the warriormaiden was dashed to the earth but rising at once she cried that was a noble blow sir gunther i confess myself fairly outdone but there are two chances yet and you will do well if you equal me in those we will now try hurling the stone and jumping twelve men came forward carrying a huge rough stone in weight a ton or more and brunhild raised this mass of rock in her white arms and held it high above her head then she swung it backwards once and threw it a dozen fathoms across the castleyard scarcely had it reached the ground when the mighty maiden leaped after and landed just beside it and the thousand lookerson shouted in admiration but old hagen bit his unshorn lip and cursed the day that had brought them to isenland gunther and the unseen siegfried not at all disheartened picked up the heavy stone which was half buried in the ground and lifting it with seeming ease threw it swiftly forward not twelve but twenty fathoms it flew and siegfried snatching up gunther in his arms leaped after and landed close to the castlewall and brunhild believed that gunther alone had done these great feats through his own strength and skill and she at once acknowledged herself beaten in the games and bade her vassals do homage to gunther as their rightful liege lord alas that the noblest of menfolk should gave stooped to such deed of base deception the punishment although long delayed came surely at last for not even the highest are exempt from obedience to heavens behests and the laws of right when the contest was ended the unseen siegfried ran quickly back to the little ship and hastily doffed the magic tarnkappe then in his own form he returned to the castle and leisurely entered the castleyard when he met his pleased comrades and the vanquished maidenqueen he asked in careless tones when the games would begin all who heard his question laughed and brunhild said surely sir siegfried the old sleepthorn of isenstein must have caught you and held you in your ship the games are over and gunther your liege lord is the winner at this news siegfried seemed much delighted as indeed he was and all went together to the great banquethall where a rich feast was served to our heroes and to the worthy earlfolk and warriors of isenland adventure xv in nibelungen land again when the folk of isenland learned that their queen had been outwitted and won by a strange chief from a faroff and unknown land great was their sorrow and dismay for they loved the fair maidenqueen and they feared to exchange her mild reign for that of an untried foreigner nor was the queen herself at all pleased with the issue of the late contest she felt no wish to leave her loved people and her pleasant home and the fair island which was her kingdom to take up her abode in a strange land as the queen of one for whom she could feel no respect and every one wondered how it was that a man like gunther so commonplace and so feeble in his every look and act could have done such deeds and won the wary warriormaiden if it had only been siegfried whispered the maidens among themselves if it had only been siegfried murmured the knights and the fightingmen if it had only been siegfried thought the queen away down in the most secret corner of her heart and she shut herself up in her room and gave wild vent to her feelings of grief and disappointment then heralds mounted the swiftest horses and hurried to every village and farm and to every hightowered castle in the land and they carried word to all of brunhilds kinsmen and liegemen bidding them to come without delay to isenstein and every man arose as with one accord and hastened to obey the call of their queen and the whole land was filled with the notes of busy preparation for war and day by day to the castle the warriors came and went and the sound of echoing horsehoofs and the rattling of ready swords and the ringing of the warshields were heard on every hand what means this treason cried gunther in dismay the coy warriormaiden would fain break her plighted word and we here in our weakness shall perish from her wrath and even old hagen who had never felt a fear when meeting a host in open battle was troubled at the thought of the mischief which was brewing tis true too true he said and the dark frown deepened on his face that we have done a foolish thing for we four men have come to this cheerless land upon a hopeless errand and if we await the gathering of the storm our ruin will be wrought and he grasped his swordhilt with such force that his knuckles grew white as he paced fiercely up and down the hall dankwart too bewailed the fate that had driven them into this net from which he saw no way of escape and both the warriors besought king gunther to take ship at once and to sail for rhineland before it was too late but siegfried said what account will you give to the folk at home if you thus go back beaten outwitted and ashamed brave warriors indeed we should be called wait a few days and trust all to me when brunhilds warriors shall be outnumbered by our own she will no longer hesitate and our return to rhineland shall be a triumphant one for we shall carry the glorious warriorqueen home with us yes answered hagen mocking we will wait until her warriors are outnumbered by our own but how long shall that be will the lightning carry the word to burgundy and will the stormclouds bring our brave men from across the sea had you allowed king gunthers plans to be followed they would have been here with us now and we might have quelled this treason at the first and dankwart said by this time the fields of the southland are green with young corn and the meadows are full of sweetsmelling flowers and the summer comes on apace why should we stay longer in this chilly and fogridden land waiting upon the whims of a fickle maiden as fickle as the winds themselves better face the smiles and the jeers of the folk at home than suffer shameful shipwreck in this cold isenland but siegfried would not be moved by the weak and wavering words of his once valiant comrades trust me he said and all will yet be well wait here but a few days longer in quietness while i go aboard ship and fare away within three days i will bring to isenstein a host of warriors such as you have never seen and then the fickle fancies of brunhild will flee and she will no longer refuse to sail with us to the now sunny southland hagen frowned still more deeply and as he strode away he muttered he only wants to betray us and leave us to die in this trap which he himself has doubtless set for us but gunther anxiously grasped the hand of siegfried and said go i trust you and believe in you but be sure not to linger for no one knows what a day may bring forth in this uncertain and variable clime without saying a word in reply siegfried turned and hastened down to the shore without any loss of time he unmoored the little ship and stepped aboard then he donned his tarnkappe spread the sails and seized the helm and the vessel like a bird with woven wings sped swiftly out of the bay and isenstein with its wide halls and glassgreen towers was soon lost to the sight of the invisible helmsman for four and twenty hours did siegfried guide the flying vessel as it leaped from wave to wave and sent the white foam dashing to left and right like flakes of snow and late on the morrow he came to a rockbound coast where steep cliffs and white mountainpeaks rose up as it were straight out of the blue sea having found a safe and narrow inlet he moored his little bark and keeping the tarnkappe well wrapped around him he stepped ashore briskly he walked along the rough shore and through a dark mountainpass until he came to a place well known to him a place where years before he had seen a caverns yawning mouth and a great heap of shining treasures and two princes dying of hunger but now upon the selfsame spot there stood a frowning fortress dark and gloomy and strong which siegfried himself had built in afteryears and the iron gates were barred and bolted fast and no living being was anywhere to be seen loud and long did siegfried wrapped in his cloak of darkness knock and call outside at last a grim old giant who sat within and kept watch and ward of the gate cried out who knocks there siegfried angrily and in threatening tones answered open the gate at once lazy laggard and ask no questions a stranger who has lost his way among the mountains seeks shelter from the storm which is coming open the gate without delay or i will break it down upon your dull head then the giant in hot anger seized a heavy iron beam and flung the gate wide open and leaped quickly out to throttle the insolent stranger warily he glanced around on every side but siegfried was clad in the magic tarnkappe and the giant could see no one amazed and ashamed he turned to shut the gate and to go again to his place for he began to believe that a foolish dream had awakened and deceived him then the unseen siegfried seized him from behind and though he struggled hard and fought with furious strength our hero threw him upon the ground and bound him with cords of sevenfold strength the unwonted noise at the gate rang through the castle and awakened the sleeping inmates the dwarf alberich who kept the fortress against siegfrieds return and who watched the nibelungen treasure which was stored in the hollow hill arose and donned his armor and hurried to the giants help a right stout dwarf was alberich and as we have seen in a former adventure he was as bold as stout armed in a warcoat of steel he ran out to the gate flourishing a seventhonged whip on each thong of which a heavy golden ball was hung great was his amazement and his wrath when he saw the giant lying bound and helpless upon the ground and with sharp eager eyes he peered warily around to see if perchance he might espy his hidden foe but when he could find no one his anger grew hotter than before and he swung his golden scourge fiercely about his head well was it for siegfried then that the tarnkappe hid him from sight for the dwarf kept pounding about in air so sturdily and strong that even as it was he split the heros shield from the centre to the rim then siegfried rushed quickly upon the doughty little fellow and seized him by his long gray beard and threw him so roughly upon the ground that alberich shrieked with pain spare me i pray you he cried i know that you are no mean knight and if i had not promised to serve my master siegfried until death i fain would acknowledge you as my lord but siegfried bound the writhing dwarf and placed him struggling and helpless by the side of the giant tell me now your name i pray said the dwarf for i must give an account of this adventure to my master when he comes who is your master his name is siegfried and he is king of the nibelungens and lord by right of the great nibelungen hoard to me and to my fellows he long ago intrusted the keeping of this castle and of the hoard that lies deep hidden in the hollow hill and i have sworn to keep it safe until his return then siegfried threw off his tarnkappe and stood in his own proper person before the wonderstricken dwarf noble siegfried cried the delighted alberich right glad i am that you have come again to claim your own spare my life and pardon me i pray and let me know what is your will your bidding shall be done at once hasten then said siegfried loosing him from his bonds hasten and arouse my nibelungen hosts tell them that their chief has come again to mist land and that he has work for them to do then alberich when he had set the giant gatekeeper free sent heralds to every town and castle in the land to make known the words and wishes of siegfried and the gallant nibelungen warriors when they heard that their liege lord had come again sprang up joyously and girded on their armor and hastened to obey his summons and soon the strongbuilt castle was full of noble men of earls and the faithful liegemen who had known siegfried of old and joyful and happy were the words of greeting in the mean while alberich had busied himself in preparing a great feast for his master and his masters chieftains in the long low hall that the dwarfs had hollowed out within the mountains heart the table was spread and on it was placed every delicacy that could be wished there were fruits and wines from the sunny southland and snowwhite loaves made from the wheat of gothland and fish from old aegirs kingdom and venison from the kings wildwood and the flesh of many a fowl most delicately baked and near the head of the board a huge wild boar roasted whole and the hall was lighted by a thousand tapers each held in the hands of a swarthy elf and the guests were served by the elfwomen who ran hither and thither obedient to every call but alberich at siegfrieds desire sat upon the dais at his lords right hand merriment ruled the hour and happy greetings were heard on every side and when the feast was at its height a troop of hillfolk came dancing into the hall and a hundred little fiddlers perched in the niches of the wall made merry music and kept time for the busy clattering little feet and when the guests had tired of music and laughter and the dancers had gone away and the tables no longer groaned under the weight of good cheer siegfried and his earls still sat at their places and beguiled the hours with pleasant talk and with stories of the earlier days and alberich as the master of the feast told a tale of the dwarffolk and how once they were visited in their hillhome by loki the mischiefmaker alberichs story my story begins with the asafolk and has as much to do with the gods as with my kinsmen the dwarfs it happened long ago when the world was young and the elffolk had not yet lost all their ancient glory sif as you all know is thors young wife and she is very fair it is said too that she is as gentle and lovable as her husband is rude and strong and that while he rides noisily through storm and wind furiously fighting the foes of the midworld she goes quietly about lifting up the downtrodden and healing the brokenhearted in the summer season when the thunderer has driven the stormgiants back to their misthidden mountain homes and the black clouds have been rolled away and piled upon each other in the far east sif comes gleefully tripping through the meadows raising up the bruised flowers and with smiles calling the frightened birds from their hidingplaces to frolic and sing in the fresh sunshine again the growing fields and the grassy mountain slopes are hers and the rustling green leaves and the sparkling dewdrops and the sweet odors of spring blossoms and the glad songs of the summertime follow in her footsteps sif as i have said is very fair and at the time of my story there was one thing of which she was a trifle vain that was her long silken hair which fell in glossy waves almost to her feet on calm warm days she liked to sit by the side of some still pool and gaze at her own beauty pictured in the water below while like the seamaidens of old aegirs kingdom she combed and braided her rich flowing tresses and in all the midworld nothing has ever been seen so like the golden sunbeams as was sifs silken hair at that time the cunning mischiefmaker loki was still living with the asafolk and as you well know this evil worker was never pleased save when he was plotting trouble for those who were better than himself he liked to meddle with business which was not his own and was always trying to mar the pleasures of others his tricks and jokes were seldom of the harmless kind and yet great good sometimes grew out of them when loki saw how proud sif was of her long hair and how much time she spent in combing and arranging it he planned a very cruel piece of mischief he hid himself in a little rocky cavern near the pool where sif was wont to sit and slily watched her all the morning as she braided and unbraided her flowing silken locks at last overcome by the heat of the midday sun she fell asleep upon the grassy bank then the mischiefmaker quietly crept near and with his sharp shears cut off all that wealth of hair and shaved her head until it was as smooth as her snowwhite hand then he hid himself again in the little cave and chuckled with great glee at the wicked thing he had done by and by sif awoke and looked into the stream but she started quickly back with horror and affright at the image which she saw she felt of her shorn head and when she learned that those rich waving tresses which had been her joy and pride were no longer there she knew not what to do hot burning tears ran down her cheeks and with sobs and shrieks she began to call aloud for thor forthwith there was a terrible uproar the lightning flashed and the thunder rolled and an earthquake shook the rocks and trees loki looking out from his hidingplace saw that thor was coming and he trembled with fear for he knew that should the thunderer catch him he would have to pay dearly for his wicked sport he ran quickly out of the cavern and leaped into the river and changed himself into a salmon and swam as swiftly as he could away from the shore but thor was not so easily fooled for he had long known loki and was acquainted with all his cunning ways so when he saw sif bewailing her stolen hair and beheld the frightened salmon hurrying alone towards the deep water he was at no loss to know whose work this mischief was straightway he took upon himself the form of a seagull and soared high up over the water then poising a moment in the air he darted swift as an arrow down into the river when he arose from the water he held the struggling salmon tightly grasped in his strong talons vile mischiefmaker cried thor as he alighted upon the top of a neighboring crag i know thee who thou art and i will make thee bitterly rue the work of this day limb from limb will i tear thee and thy bones will i grind into powder loki when he saw that he could not by any means get away from the angry thunderer changed himself back to his own form and humbly said to thor what if you do your worst with me will that give back a single hair to sifs shorn head what i did was only a thoughtless joke and i really meant no harm do but spare my life and i will more than make good the mischief i have done how can that be asked thor i will hie me straight to the secret smithies of dwarfs answered loki and those cunning little kinsmen of mine shall make golden tresses for fair sif which will grow upon her head like other hair and cause her to be an hundredfold more beautiful than before thor knew that loki was a slippery fellow and that he did not always do what he promised and hence he would not let him go he called to frey who had just come up and said come cousin frey help me to rid the world of this sly thief while i hold fast to his raven hair and his long slim arms do you seize him by the heels and we will give his limbs to the fishes and his body to the birds for food loki now thoroughly frightened wept and kissed freys feet and humbly begged for mercy and he promised that he would bring from the dwarfs smithy not only the golden hair for sif but also a mighty hammer for thor and a swift steed for frey so earnest were his words and so pitiful was his plea that thor at last set the trembling mischiefmaker free and bade him hasten away on his errand quickly then he went in search of the smithy of the dwarfs he crossed the desert moorlands and came after three days to the bleak hillcountry and the rugged mountainland of the south there the earthquake had split the mountains apart and dug dark and bottomless gorges and hollowed out many a lowwalled cavern where the light of day was never seen through deep winding ways and along narrow crevices loki crept and he glided under huge rocks and downward through slanting crooked clefts until at last he came to a great underground hall where his eyes were dazzled by a light which was stronger and brighter than day for on every side were glowing fires roaring in wonderful little forges and blown by wonderful little bellows and the vaulted roof above was thickly set with diamonds and precious stones that sparkled and shone like thousands of bright stars in the blue sky and the little dwarfs with comical brown faces and wearing strange leathern aprons and carrying heavy hammers were hurrying here and there each busy at his task some were smelting pure gold from the coarse rough rocks others were making precious gems and rich rare jewels such as the proudest king would be glad to wear here one was shaping pure round pearls from dewdrops and maidens tears there another wrought green emeralds from the first leaves of spring so busy were they all that they neither stopped nor looked up when loki came into their hall but all kept hammering and blowing and working as if their lives depended upon their being always busy after loki had curiously watched their movements for some time he spoke to the dwarf whose forge was nearest to him and made known his errand but the little fellow was fashioning a flashing diamond which he called the mountain of light and he scarcely looked up as he answered i do not work in gold go to ivalds sons they will make whatever you wish to ivalds sons then in the farthest and brightest corner of the hall loki went they very readily agreed to make the golden hair for sif and they began the work at once a lump of purest gold was brought and thrown into the glowing furnace and it was melted and drawn and melted and drawn seven times then it was given to a little brown elf with merry twinkling eyes who carried it with all speed to another part of the great hall where the dwarfs pretty wives were spinning one of the little women took the yellow lump from the elfs hands and laid it like flax upon her spinningwheel then she sat down and began to spin and as she span the dwarfwives sang a strange sweet song of the old old days when the dwarffolk ruled the world and the tiny brown elves danced gleefully around the spinner and the thousand little anvils rang out a merry chorus to the music of the singers and the yellow gold was twisted into threads and the threads ran into hair softer than silk and finer than gossamer and at last the dwarfwoman held in her hand long golden tresses ten times more beautiful than the amber locks that loki had cut from sifs fair head when ivalds sons proud of their skill gave the rare treasure to the mischiefmaker loki smiled as if he were well pleased but in his heart he was angry because the dwarfs had made so fair a piece of workmanship then he said this is indeed very handsome and will be very becoming to sif oh what an uproar was made about those flaxen tresses that she loved so well and that reminds me that her husband the gruff old giantkiller wants a hammer i promised to get him one and if i fail he will doubtless be rude with me i pray you make such a hammer as will be of most use to him in fighting the jotuns and you may win favor both for yourselves and me not now said the elder of ivalds sons we cannot make it now for who would dare to send a present to thor before he has offered one to odin the great allfather make me then a gift for odin cried loki and he will shelter me from the thunderers wrath so the dwarfs put iron into their furnace and heated it to a glowing whiteheat and then they drew it out and rolled it upon their anvils and pounded it with heavy hammers until they had wrought a wondrous spear such as no man had ever seen then they inlaid it with priceless jewels and plated the point with gold seven times tried this is the spear gungner said they take it to the great allfather as the best gift of his humble earthworkers make me now a present for frey the gentle said loki i owe my life to him and i have promised to take him a swift steed that will bear him everywhere then ivalds sons threw gold into the furnace and blew with their bellows until the very roof of the great cavehall seemed to tremble and the smoke rolled up the wide chimney and escaped in dense fumes from the mountaintop when they left off working and the fire died away a fairy ship with masts and sails and two banks of long oars and a golden dragon stem rose out of the glowing coals and it grew in size until it filled a great part of the hall and might have furnished room for a thousand warriors with their arms and steeds then at a word from the dwarfs it began to shrink and it became smaller and smaller until it was no broader than an oakleaf and the younger of ivalds sons folded it up like a napkin and gave it to loki saying take this to frey the gentle it is the ship skidbladner when it is wanted for a voyage it will carry all the asafolk and their weapons and stores and no matter where they wish to go the wind will always drive it straight to the desired port but when it is not needed the good frey may fold it up as i have done and carry it safely in his pocket loki was much pleased and although he felt disappointed because he had no present for thor he heartily thanked the dwarfs for their kindness and taking the golden hair and the spear gungner and the ship skidbladner he bade ivalds sons goodby and started for home but before he reached the narrow doorway which led out of the cave he met two crookedbacked dwarfs much smaller and much uglier than any he had seen before what have you there asked one of them whose name was brok hair for sif a spear for odin and a ship for frey answered loki let us see them said brok loki kindly showed them the strange gifts and told them that in his belief no dwarfs in all the world had ever before wrought such wonderful things who made them inquired brok ivalds sons ah ivalds sons sometimes do good work but there are many other dwarfs who can do better for instance my brother sindre who stands here can make three other treasures altogether as good as those you have it cannot be cried loki i tell you the truth said the dwarf and to show you that i mean just what i say i will wager against your head all the diamonds in the ceiling above us that he will make not only as good treasures but those which the asas will esteem much higher agreed cried loki agreed i take the wager let your brother try his skill at once the three went straightway to sindres forge and the brothers began their task when the fire was roaring hot and the sparks flew from the chimney like showers of shootingstars sindre put a pigskin into the furnace and bade brok blow the bellows with all his might and never stop until he should speak the word the flames leaped up white and hot and the furnace glowed with a dazzling light while brok plied the bellows and sindre with unblinking eyes watched the slowly changing colors that played around the melted and shapeless mass within while the brothers were thus intent upon their work loki changed himself to a great horsefly and settled upon broks hand and bit him without mercy but the dwarf kept on blowing the bellows and stopped not until his brother cried out enough then sindre drew out of the flickering blue flames a huge wild boar with long tusks of ivory and golden bristles that glittered and shone like the beams of the sun this is golden bristle said the dwarf it is the gift of brok and his brother to the gentle frey his ship skidbladner can carry him only over the sea but golden bristle shall be a trusty steed that will bear him with the speed of the wind over the land or through the air next the dwarfs threw gold into the furnace and brok plied the bellows and sindre gazed into the flames as before and the great horsefly buzzed in broks face and darted at his eyes and at last settled upon his neck and stung him until the pain caused big drops of sweat to roll off of his forehead but the dwarf stopped not nor faltered until his brother again cried out enough this time sindre drew out a wondrous ring of solid gold sparkling all over with the rarest and most costly jewels this is the ring draupner said he it is well worthy to be worn on odins finger every ninth day eight other rings equal to it in every way shall drop from it it shall enrich the earth and make the desert blossom as the rose and it shall bring plentiful harvests and fill the farmers barns with grain and their houses with glad good cheer take it to the allfather as the best gift of the earthfolk to him and to mankind after this the dwarfs took iron which had been brought from the mountains of norse land and after beating it upon their bellows until it glowed white and hot sindre threw it into the furnace this shall be the gift of gifts said he to brok ply the bellows as before and do not for your life stop or falter until the work is done but as brok blew the bellows and his brother gazed into the glowing fire the horsefly came again this time he settled between the dwarfs eyes and stung his eyelids until the blood filled his eyes and ran down his cheeks and blinded him so that he could not see at last in sore distress and wild with pain brok let go of the bellows and lifted his hand to drive the fly away then sindre drew his work out of the furnace it was a blue steel hammer well made in every way save that the handle was half an inch too short this is the mighty mjolner said sindre to loki who had again taken his proper shape the thunderer may have the hammer that you promised him although it is our gift and not yours the stoutest giant will not be able now to cope with thor no shield nor armor nor mountainwall nor indeed any thing on earth shall be proof against the lightningstrokes of mjolner and brok took the three treasures which sindre had fashioned and went with loki to asgard the home of the asafolk and they chose odin and thor and frey to examine and judge which was best lokis three gifts the work of ivalds sons or broks three gifts the work of sindre when the judges were seated and all were in readiness loki went forward and gave to odin the spear gungner that would always hit the mark and to frey he gave the ship skidbladner that would sail whithersoever he wished then he gave the golden hair to thor who placed it upon the head of fair sif and it grew there and was a thousandfold more beautiful than the silken tresses she had worn before after the asas had carefully looked at these treasures and talked of their merits little brok came humbly forward and offered his gifts to odin he gave the precious ring draupner already dropping richness to frey he gave the boar golden bristle telling him that wherever he chose to go this steed would serve him well and would carry him faster than any horse while his shining bristles would light the way on the darkest night or in the gloomiest path at last he gave to thor the hammer mjolner and said that it like odins spear would never miss the mark and that whatever it struck it would crush in pieces and whithersoever it might be hurled it would come back to his hand again then the asas declared at once that thors hammer was the best of all the gifts and that the dwarf had fairly won the wager but when brok demanded lokis head as the price of the wager the cunning mischiefmaker said my head is by the terms of our agreement yours but my neck is my own and you shall not on any account touch or harm iten so brok went back to his brother and his smithy without the head of loki but he was loaded with rich and rare presents from the asafolk adventure xvi how brunhild was welcomed home when the next mornings sun arose and its light gilded the mountain peaks and fell in a flood of splendor down upon the rich uplands and the broad green fields of nibelungen land siegfried with his earls and mighty men rode through the valley and down to the seashore there a pleasant sight met his eyes for the little bay was white with the sails of a hundred goldbeaked vessels which lay at anchor and on the sandy beach there stood in order three thousand island warriors the bravest and the best of all the nibelungens clad in armor and ready to hear and to do their masters bidding and siegfried told them why he had thus hastily called them together and he gave to each one rich gifts of gold and jewels and costly raiment then he chose from among them one thousand of the most trustworthy who should follow him back to isenland and these went aboard the waiting vessels amid the cheers and the farewells of their comrades who were left behind and when every thing was in readiness the anchors were hoisted and the sails were set and the little fleet wafted by pleasant winds sailed out of the bay and eastward across the calm blue sea and siegfrieds vessel with a golden dragon banner floating from the masthead led all the rest on the fourth day after siegfrieds departure from isenland dankwart and grim old hagen sat in a room of the castle at isenstein outside and below they heard the fairhaired warriors of queen brunhild pacing to and fro and ready at a word to seize upon the strangers and either to put them to death or to drive them forever from the land old hagens brows were closely knit and his face was dark as a thundercloud and his hands played nervously with his swordhilt as he said where now is gunther the man whom we once called king he is standing on the balcony above talking with the queen and her maidens answered dankwart the craven that he is cried hagen hoarsely once he was a king and worthy to be obeyed but now who is the king that upstart siegfried has but to say what shall be done and our master gunther blindly and like a child complies four days ago we might have taken ship and sailed safely home now our vessel is gone the boasted hero is gone and nothing is left for us to do but to fight and die but we are sure of odins favor returned dankwart and a wild light gleamed from his eyes and he brandished his sword high over his head a place in valhal is promised to us for him who bravely dies with his bloodstained sword beside him and his heart unrent with fears the allfathers victorywafters will gently carry home even now methinks i sit in the banquetinghall of the heroes and quaff the flowing mead in the mean while gunther stood with queen brunhild at an upper window and looked out upon the great sea that spread forever and away towards the setting sun and all at once as if by magic the water was covered with whitesailed ships which driven by friendly winds and the helping hands of aegirs daughters and the brawny arms of many a stalwart oarsman came flying towards the bay what ships are those with the snowwhite sails and the dragonstems asked brunhild wondering gunther gazed for a moment towards the swiftcoming fleet and his eyes were gladdened with the sight of siegfrieds dragonbanner floating from the vessel in the van a great load seemed lifted from his breast for now he knew that the hopedfor help was at hand and smiling he answered the queen those whitesailed ships are mine my bodyguard a thousand of my trustiest fightingmen are on board and every man is ready to die for me and as the vessels came into the harbor and the sailors furled the sails and cast the anchors into the sea siegfried was seen standing on the golden prow of his ship arrayed in princely raiment with his earls and chiefs around him and their bright armor glittered in the sunlight and their burnished shields shone like so many golden mirrors a fairer sight had the folk of isenstein never seen long and earnestly queen brunhild gazed and then turning away she burst into tears for she knew that she had been again outwitted and that it was vain for her to struggle against the norns decrees then crushing back the grief and the sore longing that rose in her heart she spoke again to gunther and her eyes shone stern and strange what now will you have me do she asked for you have fairly won me and my wayward fancies shall no longer vex you shall i greet your friends with kindness or shall we send them back again over the sea i pray you give them welcome to the broad halls of isenstein he answered for no truer nobler men live than these my liegemen so the queen sent word to siegfried and his nibelungen warriors to leave the ships and come ashore and she herself as radiant now as a morning in may went down to meet them and welcome them then she had a great feast made in honor of the heroes and the long lowraftered feasthall rang with the sounds of merriment instead of with the clash of arms the fairhaired blueeyed warriors of the queen sat side by side with the tall strangers from over the sea and in the highseat was brunhild her face exceeding pale yet beauteous to behold and by her side sat gunther smiling and glad and clad in his kingly raiments and around them were the earls and chieftains and many a fair lady of isenland and hagen smiling through his frowns and dankwart now grown fearless and siegfried sad and thoughtful mirth and gladness ruled the hour and not until the morning star began to fade in the coming sunlight lid the guests retire to rest only a few days longer did the heroes tarry in isenland for the mild spring days were growing warmer and all faces were southward turned and the queen herself was anxious to haste to her southland home when at last the time for leavetaking came the folk of isenland gathered around to bid their queen godspeed then brunhild called to dankwart and gave him her golden keys and bade him unlock her closets where her gold and jewels were stored and to scatter with hands unstinted her treasures among the poor and many were the tearful blessings and many the kind words said as the radiant queen went down to the waiting whitewinged vessel and stepped aboard with gunther and the heroes of the rhine but she was not to go alone to the land of strangers for with her were to sail a hundred fair young damsels and more than fourscore noble dames and two thousand blueeyed warriors the bravest of her land when all had gone on board the waiting fleet the anchors were hoisted and the sails were unfurled to the breeze and amid the tearful farewells of friends and the joyful shouting of the sailors the hundred heavyladen vessels glided from the bay and were soon far out at sea and the sorrowing folk of isenland turned away and went back to their daily tasks and to the old life of mingled pain and pleasure of shadow and sunshine and they never saw their loved warriorqueen again the gay white fleet with its precious cargo of noble men and fair ladies sped swiftly onwards through old aegirs kingdom and it seemed as if queen ran had forgotten to spread her nets so smooth and quiet was the sea and the waves slept on the peaceful bosom of the waters only ripple and skyclear danced in the wake of the flying ships and added to the general joy and on shipboard music and song enlivened the dragging hours and from morn till eve no sounds were heard save those of merriment and sport and glad good cheer yet as day after day passed by and no sight met their eyes but the calm blue waters beneath and the calm blue sky above all began to wish for a view once more of the solid earth and the fields and the wild greenwood but the ships sailed steadily onward and every hour brought them nearer and nearer to the wishedfor haven at length on the ninth day they came in sight of a long flat coast stretching far away towards the lowlands where old aegir and his daughters sometimes by wasting warfare sometimes by stealthy strategy ever plot and toil to widen the seakings domains when the sailors saw the green shore rising up as it were out of the quiet water and the wild woodland lying dense and dark beyond and when they knew that they were nearing the end of their long seavoyage they rent the air with their joyful shouts and a brisker breeze sprang up and filled the sails and made the ships leap forward over the water like glad living creatures it was then that the thought came to king gunther that he ought to send fleet heralds to burgundyland to make known the happy issue of his bold emprise and to tell of his glad homecoming with brunhild the warriormaiden as his queen so he called old hagen to him and told him of his thoughts and asked him if he would be that herald nay answered the frowning chief no bearer of glad tidings am i to every man odin has given gifts to some he has given light hearts and cheery faces and glad voices and such alone are fitted to carry good news and happy greetings to others he has given darker souls and less lightsome faces and more uncouth manners and these may bear the brunt of the battle and rush with odins heroes to the slaughter but they would be ill at ease standing in the presence of fair ladies or telling glad tidings at court let me still linger i pray on board this narrow ship and send your friend siegfried as herald to burgundyland he is well fitted for such a duty so gunther sent at once for siegfried to whom when he had come he said my best of friends although we are now in sight of land our voyage still is a long one for the river is yet far away and when it is reached its course is winding and the current will be against us and our progress must needs be slow the folk at home have had no tidings from us since we left them in the early spring and no doubt their hearts grow anxious and they long to hear of our whereabouts and whether we prosper or no now as we near the headland which juts out dark and green before us we will set you on shore with the noble greyfell and as many comrades as you wish to haste with all speed to burgundy to tell the glad news of our coming to the loved ones waiting there siegfried at first held back and tried to excuse himself from undertaking this errand not because he felt any fear of danger but because he scorned to be any mans thrall to go and do at his beck and bidding then gunther spoke again and in a different tone gentle siegfried he said if you will not do this errand for my sake i pray that you will undertake it for the sake of my sister the fair kriemhild who has so long waited for our coming then willingly did the prince agree to be the kings herald and on the morrow the ship touched land and siegfried bade his companions a short farewell and went ashore with four and twenty nibelungen chiefs who were to ride with him to burgundy and when every thing was in readiness he mounted the noble greyfell as did also each warrior his favorite steed and they galloped briskly away and their glittering armor and nodding plumes were soon lost to sight among the green trees of the wood and the ship which bore gunther and his kingly party weighed anchor and moved slowly along the shore towards the distant rivers mouth for many days and through many strange lands rode siegfried and his nibelungen chiefs they galloped through the woodland and over a stony waste and came to a peopled country rich in farms and meadows and dotted with pleasant towns and the folk of that land wondered greatly at sight of the radiant siegfried and the tall warriors with him and their noble steeds and their sunbright armor for they thought that it was a company of the gods riding through the midworld as the gods were wont to do in the golden days of old so they greeted them with smiles and kind good words and scattered flowers and blessings in their way they stopped for a day in vilkinaland where dwelt one eigill a famous archer who it is said was a brother of veliant siegfrieds fellowapprentice in the days of his boyhood and men told them this story of eigill that once on a time old nidung the king of that land in order to test his skill with the bow bade him shoot an apple or as some say an acorn from the head of his own little son and eigill did this but two other arrows which he had hidden beneath his coat dropped to the ground and when the king asked him what these were for he answered to kill thee wretch had i slain my childen after this our heroes rode through a rough hillcountry where the ground was covered with sharp stones and the roads were steep and hard and their horses lost their shoes and were so lamed by the travel that they were forced to turn aside to seek the house of one welland a famous smith who reshod their steeds and entertained them most kindly three days and nights and it is said by some that welland is but another name for veliant and that this was the selfsame foreman whom we knew in siegfrieds younger days but be this as it may he was at this time the master of all smiths and no one ever wrought more cunningly and men say that his grandfather was vilkinus the first king of that land and that his grandmother wachitu was a fair mermaid who lived in the deep green sea and that his father wada had carried him when a child upon his shoulders through water five fathoms deep to apprentice him to the cunning dwarfs from whom he learned his trade and if this story is true he could not have been veliant he was wedded to a beautiful lady who sometimes took the form of a swan and flew away to a pleasant lake near by where with other swanmaidens she spent the warm summer days among the reeds and the waterlilies and many other strange tales were told of welland the smith how he had once made a boat from the single trunk of a tree and had sailed in it all around the midworld how being lame in one foot he had forged a wondrous winged garment and flown like a falcon through the air and how he had wrought for beowulf the anglosaxon hero a gorgeous warcoat that no other smith could equalen and so pleasantly did welland entertain his guests that they were loath to leave him but on the fourth day they bade him farewell and wended again their way now our heroes rode forward with greater speed than before across many a mile of waste land and over steep hills and through pleasant wooded dales then again they came to fair meadows and broad pasturelands and fields green with growing corn and every one whom they met blessed them and bade them a hearty godspeed then they left the farmlands and the abodes of men far behind them and they passed by the shore of a sparkling lake where they heard the swanmaidens talking to each other as they swam among the rushes or singing in silvery tones of gladness as they circled in the air above then they crossed a dreary moor where nothing grew but heather and they climbed a barren stony mountain where the feet of men had never been and came at last to a wild dark forest where silence reigned undisturbed forever it was the wood in which dwells vidar the silent god far from the sound of mans busy voice in the solemn shade of centuryliving oaks and elms there he sits in quiet but awful grandeur strong almost as thor but holding his mighty strength in check hoary and gray he sits alone in natures temple and communes with natures self waiting for the day when natures silent but resistless forces shall be quickened into dread action his head is crowned with sear and yellow leaves and long white moss hangs pendent from his brows and cheeks and his garments are rusted with age on his feet are iron shoes with soles made thick with the scraps of leather gathered through centuries past and with these it is said he shall in the last great twilight of the midworld rend the jaws of the fenriswolfen who is this fenriswolf asked one of the nibelungens as they rode through the solemn shadows of the wood and siegfried thereupon related how that fierce creature had been brought up and cared for by the asafolk and how when he grew large and strong they sought to keep him from doing harm by binding him with an iron chain called leding but the strength of the monster was so great that he burst the chain asunder and escaped then the asas made another chain twice as strong which they called drome and they called to the wolf and besought him to allow them to bind him again so that in bursting the second chain he might clear up all doubts in regard to his strength flattered by the words of the asas the wolf complied and they chained him with drome and fastened him to a great rock but fenris stretched his legs and shook himself and the great chain was snapped in pieces then the asas knew that there was no safety for them so long as a monster so huge and terrible was unbound and they besought the swarthy elves to forge them another and a stronger chain this the elves did they made a most wondrous chain smooth as silk and soft as down yet firmer than granite and stronger than steel they called it gleipner and it was made of the sinews of a bear the footsteps of a cat the beard of a woman the breath of a fish the sweat of a bird and the roots of a mountain when the asas had obtained this chain they lured the fenriswolf to the rocky island of lyngve and by flattery persuaded him to be bound again but this he would not agree to do until tyr placed his hand in his mouth as a pledge of good faith then they tied him as before and laughingly bade him break the silken cord the huge creature stretched himself as before and tried with all his might to burst away but gleipner held him fast and the worst that he could do was to bite off the hand of unlucky tyr and this is why tyr is called the onearmed god but it is said added siegfried that in the last twilight the fenriswolf will break his chain and that he will swallow the sun and slay the great odin himself and that none can subdue him save vidar the silent it was thus that the heroes conversed with each other as they rode through the silent ways of the wood at length one afternoon in early summer the little company reached the rhine valley and looking down from the sloping hilltops green with growing corn they saw the pleasant town of the burgundians and the high gray towers of gunthers dwelling and not long afterwards they rode through the streets of the old town and tired and travelstained halted outside of the castlegates very soon it became noised about that siegfried and a company of strange knights fair and tall had come again to burgundy and to the home of the burgundian kings but when it was certainly known that neither gunther the king nor hagen of the evil eye nor dankwart his brother had returned the people felt many sad misgivings for they greatly feared that some hard mischance had befallen their loved king then gernot and the young giselher having heard of siegfrieds arrival came out with glad but anxious faces to greet him welcome worthy chief they cried but why are you alone what are your tidings where is our brother and where are our brave uncles hagen and dankwart and who are those strange fair men who ride with you and what about brunhild the warriormaiden alas if our brother has fallen by her cruel might then woe to burgundy tell us quickly all about it have patience friends answered siegfried give me time to speak and i will gladden the hearts of all the folk of burgundy with my news your brother gunther is alive and well and he is the happiest man in the whole midworld because he has won the matchless brunhild for his bride and he is ere now making his way up the river with a mighty fleet of a hundred vessels and more than two thousand warriors indeed you may look for him any day and he has sent me with these my nibelungen earls to bid you make ready for his glad homecoming then even before he had alighted from greyfell he went on to tell of the things that had happened at isenstein but he said nothing of the part which he had taken in the strange contest and a crowd of eager listeners stood around and heard with unfeigned joy of the happy fortune of their king and now said siegfried to giselher when he had finished his story carry the glad news to your mother and your sister for they too must be anxious to learn what fate has befallen king gunther nay answered the prince you yourself are the kings herald and you shall be the one to break the tidings to them full glad theyll be to hear the story from your own lips for long have they feared that our brother would never be seen by us again i will tell them of your coming but you must be the first to tell them the news you bring very well answered siegfried it shall be as you say then he dismounted from greyfell and with his nibelungen earls was shown into the grand hall where they were entertained in a right kingly manner when kriemhild the peerless and ute her mother heard that siegfried had come again to burgundy and that he brought news from gunther the king they hastened to make ready to see him and when he came before them he seemed so noble so bright and so glad that they knew he bore no evil tidings most noble prince said kriemhild trembling in his presence right welcome are you to our dwelling but wherefore are you come how fares my brother gunther why came he not with you back to burgundyland oh undone are we if through the cruel might of the warriorqueen he has been lost to us now give me a heralds fees cried siegfried laughing king gunther is alive and well in the games of strength to which fair brunhild challenged him he was the winner and now he comes up the rhine with his bride and a great retinue of lords and ladies and fightingmen indeed the sails of his ships whiten the river for miles and i am come by his desire to ask that every thing be made ready for his glad homecoming and the loving welcome of his peerless queen great was the joy of kriemhild and her queenly mother when they heard this gladsome news and they thanked the prince most heartily for all that he had done you have truly earned a heralds fee said the lovely maiden and gladly would i pay it you in gold for you have cheered us with pleasant tidings and lightened our minds of a heavy load but men of your noble rank take neither gifts nor fees and hence we have only to offer our deepest and heartiest thanks not so answered siegfried gayly think not i would scorn a fee had i a kingdom of thirty realms i should still be proud of a gift from you then you shall have your heralds fee cried kriemhild and she sent her maidens to fetch the gift and with her own lily hands she gave him twenty golden bracelets richly inwrought with every kind of rare and costly gemstones happy indeed was siegfried to take such priceless gift from the hand of so peerless a maiden and his face shone radiant with sunbeams as he humbly bowed and thanked her but he had no need for the jewels nor wished he to keep them long so he gave them with gracious wishes to the fair young maidens at court from this time forward for many days there was great bustle in gunthers dwelling on every side was heard the noise of busy hands making ready for the glad day when the king should be welcomed home the broad halls and the tall gray towers were decked with flowers and floating banners and many a gay device the houses and streets of the pleasant burgh put on their holiday attire the shady road which led through kriemhilds rosegarden down to the riverbanks was dusted and swept with daily care and the watchman was cautioned to keep on the lookout every moment for the coming of the expected fleet and heralds had been sent to every burgh and castle and to every countryside in burgundy announcing the happy homecoming of gunther and his bride and bidding every one both high and low to the glad merrymaking on the morning of the eleventh day ere the sun had dried the dew from the springing grass the keeneyed watchman in his perch on the topmost tower cried out in happy accents to the waiting folk below they come at last i see the whitewinged ships still far down the stream but a breeze springs up from the northward and the sailors are at the oars and swift speed the hastening vessels as if borne on the wings of the wind ride forth o ye brave and fair to welcome the fair and the brave then quickly the kingfolk and the warriors and fair ladies mounted their ready steeds and gayly through the gates of the castle they rode out riverwards and ute the noble queenmother went first and the company moved in glittering array with flying banners and music and the noisy flourish of drums adown the rosecovered pathway which led to the waters side and the peerless kriemhild followed with a hundred lovely maidens all mounted on snowwhite palfreys and siegfried proud and happy on greyfell rode beside her when the party reached the riverbank a pleasant sight met their eyes for the fleet had now drawn near and the whole river as far as the eye could reach glittered with the light reflected from the shieldhung rails and the golden prows of the swiftcoming ships king gunthers own vessel led all the rest and the king himself stood on the deck with the glorious brunhild by his side nearer and nearer the fresh breeze of the summer morning wafted the vessel to the shore where stood the waiting multitude softly the golden dragon glided in to the landingplace and quickly was it moored to the banks then gunther clad in his kingly garments stepped ashore and with him his lovely queen and a mighty shout of welcome and an answering shout of gladness seemed to rend the sky as the waiting hosts beheld the sight and the queenmother ute and the peerless kriemhild and her kingly brothers went forward to greet the pair and kriemhild took brunhild by the hand and kissed her and said welcome thrice welcome dear sister to thy home and thy kindred and thy people who hail thee as queen and may thy days be full of joyance and thy years be full of peace then all the folk cried out their goodly greetings and the sound of their glad voices rang out sweet and clear in the morning air and rose up from the riverside and was echoed among the hillslopes and carried over the meadows and vineyards to the farthest bounds of burgundyland and the matchless brunhild smiling returned the happy greeting and her voice was soft and sweet as she said o kin of the fair rhineland and folk of my newfound home may your days be summer sunshine and your lives lack grief and pain and may this hour of glad rejoicing be the type of all hours to come then the lovely queen was seated in a golden wain which stood in waiting for her and gunther mounted his own warsteed and the whole company made ready to ride to the castle never before had so pleasant a sight been seen in rhineland as that glorious array of kingfolk and lords and ladies wending from river to fortress along the rosestrewn roadway foremost went the king and by his side was siegfried on the radiant greyfell then came the queens golden wain drawn by two snowwhite oxen which were led with silken cords by sweetfaced maidens and in it on an ivory throne deepcarved with mystic runes sat glorious brunhild behind rode the queenmother and her kingly sons and frowning hagen and dankwart and volker and all the earlfolk and mighty warriors of burgundy and of nibelungen land and lastly came kriemhild and her hundred damsels sitting on their snowwhite steeds and they rode past the blooming gardens and through the glad streets of the burgh and then like a radiant vision they entered the castlehalls and the lovely pageant was seen no more for twelve days after this a joyful hightide was held at the castle and the broad halls rang with merriment and music and festive mirth and games and tournaments were held in honor of the kings return brave horsemen dashed here and there at breakneck speed or contended manfully in the lists lances flew thick in the air shouts and glad cries were heard on every hand and for a time the most boisterous tumult reigned but gladness and goodfeeling ruled the hour and no one thought of aught but merrymaking and careless joy at length when the days of feasting were past the guests bade gunther and his queen farewell and each betook himself to his own home and to whatsoever his duty called him and one would have thought that none but happy days were henceforth in store for the kingly folk of burgundy but alas too soon the cruel frost and the cold north winds nipped the buds and blossoms of the short summer and the days of gladness gave place to nights of gloom adventure xvii how siegfried lived in nibelungen land when the twelvedays hightide at king gunthers homecoming had been brought to an end and the guests had all gone to their homes siegfried too prepared to bid farewell to the rhineland kings and to wend to his own country but he was not to go alone for kriemhild the peerless princess was to go with him as his bride they had been wedded during the merry festivities which had just closed and that event had added greatly to the general joy for never was there a fairer or a nobler pair than siegfried the fearless and kriemhild the peerless it grieves my heart to part with you said gunther wringing siegfrieds hand it will fare but ill with us i fear when we no longer see your radiant face or hear your cheery voice say not so my brother answered siegfried for the gods have many good things in store for you and if ever you need the help of my arm you have but to say the word and i will hasten to your aid then the burgundian kings besought the hero to take the fourth part of their kingdom as his own and kriemhilds and to think no more of leaving them but siegfried would not agree to this his heart yearned to see his father and mother once again and then to return to his own loved nibelungen land so he thanked the kings for their kind offer and hastened to make ready for his intended journey early on midsummer day the hero and his bride rode out of gunthers dwelling and turned their faces northward and with them was a noble retinue of warriors five hundred brave burgundians with eckewart as their chief who had sworn to be queen kriemhilds vassals in her new fardistant home thirty and two fair maidens too went with her and with siegfried were his nibelungen earls as the company rode down the sands and filed gayly along the riverroad it seemed a lovely although a sad sight to their kinsmen who gazed after them from the castletowers fair and young were all the folk and the world to most was still untried and they rode in the morning sunlight away from their native land nor recked that never again would they return each warrior sat upon a charger richly geared with giltred saddle and gorgeous bridle and trappings of every hue and their warcoats were bright and dazzling and their spears glanced in the sun and their golden shields threw rays of resplendent light around them the maidens too were richly dight in broidered cloaks of blue and rare stuffs brought from faroff araby and each sat on a snowwhite palfrey geared with silken housings and trappings of bright blue for some days the company followed the course of the river passing through many a rich meadow and between lovely vineyards and fields of yellow corn then they rode over a dreary barren waste and through a wild greenwood and reached at last the hills which marked the beginning of king siegmunds domains then siegfried sent fleet heralds before them to carry to his father the tidings of his coming with his bride fair kriemhild glad indeed were old king siegmund and siegfrieds gentle mother when they heard this news oh happy is the day cried the king thrice happy be the day that shall see fair kriemhild a crowned queen and siegfried a king in the throne of his fathers and they showered upon the heralds who had brought the happy news rich fees of gold and silver and gave them garments of silken velvet and on the morrow they set out with a train of earlfolk and lovely ladies to meet their son and his bride for one whole day they journeyed to the old fortress of santen where in former days the kings dwelling had been there they met the happy bridalparty and fond and loving were the hearty greetings they bestowed upon kriemhild and the radiant siegfried then without delay they returned to siegmunds kingly hall and for twelve days a high tide more happy and more splendid than that which had been held in burgundy was made in honor of siegfrieds marriageday and in the midst of those days of sport and joyance the old king gave his crown and sceptre to his son and all the people hailed siegfried king of the broad lowlands and kriemhild his lovely queen old stories tell how siegfried reigned in peace and glad contentment in his fatherland and how the joyous sunshine shone wherever he went and poured a flood of light and warmth and happiness into every nook and corner of his kingdom and how at length after the gentle sigelind had died he moved his court to that other country of his the faroff nibelungen land and it is in that strange dreamhaunted land in a strongbuilt mountain fortress that we shall next find him glad were the nibelungen folk when their own king and his lovely wife came to dwell among them and the mists once more were lifted and the skies grew bright and clear and men said that the night had departed and the better days were near golden indeed and most glorious was that summertime and long to be remembered was siegfrieds too brief reign in nibelungen land and ages afterward folk loved to sing of his care for his peoples welfare of his wisdom and boundless lore of his deeds in the time of warring and the victories gained in peace and strong and brave were the menfolk and wise and fair were the women and broad and rich were the acres in siegfrieds wellruled land the farmlands were yellow with the abundant harvests fruitful orchards grew in the pleasant dales and fair vineyards crowned the hills fine cities sprang up along the seacoast and strong fortresses were built on every height great ships were made which sailed to every land and brought home rich goods from every clime coffee and spices from india rich silks from zazemang fine fruits from the iberian shore and soft furs and ivory tusks of the seabeast from the frozen coasts of the north never before was country so richly blessed for siegfried taught his people how to till the soil best and how to delve far down into the earth for hidden treasures and how to work skilfully in iron and bronze and all other metals and how to make the winds and the waters and even the thunderbolt their thralls and helpful servants and he was as great in war as in peace for no other people dared harm or in any way impose upon the nibelungen folk or any of his faithful liegemen it is told how once on a time he warred against the hundings who had done his people an injury and how he sailed against them in a long dragonship of a hundred oars when he was far out in the midsea and no land was anywhere in sight a dreadful storm arose the lightnings flashed and the winds roared and threatened to carry the ship to destruction quickly the fearful sailors began to reef the sails but siegfried bade them stop why be afraid he cried the norns have woven the woof of every mans life and no man can escape his destiny if the gods will that we should drown it is folly for us to strive against fate we are bound to the shore of the hundings land and thither must our good ship carry us hoist the sails high on the masts even though the wind should tear them into shreds and split the masts into splinters the sailors did as they were bidden and the hurricane caught the ship in its mighty arms and hurried it over the rolling waves with the speed of lightning and siegfried stood calmly at the helm and guided the flying vessel presently they saw a rocky point rising up out of the waters before them and on it stood an old man his gray cloak streaming in the wind and his blue hood tied tightly down over his head whose ship is that which comes riding on the storm cried the man king siegfrieds ship answered the man at the prow there lives no braver man on earth than he thou sayest truly came back from the rock lay by your oars reef the sails and take me on board what is your name asked the sailor as the ship swept past him when the raven croaks gladly over his battlefeast men call me hnikar but call me now karl from the mountain fengr or fjolner reef quick your sails and take me in the men at siegfrieds command obeyed and at once the wind ceased blowing and the sea was calm and the warm sun shone through the rifted clouds and the coast of hundings land lay close before them but when they looked for fjolner as he called himself they could not find him one day siegfried sat in his sunlit hall in nibelungen land and kriemhild lovely as a morning in june sat beside him and they talked of the early days when alone he fared through the midworld and alone did deeds of wondrous daring and siegfried bethought him then of the glittering hoard of andvari and the cave and the mountain fortress where the faithful dwarf alberich still guarded the measureless treasure how i should like to see that mountain fastness and that glittering hoard cried kriemhild you shall see answered the king and at once horses were saddled and preparations were made for a mornings jaunt into the mountains and ere an hour had passed siegfried and his queen and a small number of knights and ladies were riding through the passes about noon they came to alberichs dwelling a frowning fortress of granite built in the mountainside the gate was opened by the sleepy giant who always sat within and the party rode into the narrow courtyard there they were met by alberich seeming smaller and grayer and more pinched and wan than ever before hail noble master cried he bowing low before siegfried how can alberich serve you today lead us to the treasurevaults answered the king my queen would fain feast her eyes upon the yellow sparkling hoard the dwarf obeyed through a narrow door they were ushered into a long low cavern so frowning and gloomy that the queen started back in affright but reassured by siegfrieds smiling face she went forward again the entranceway was lighted by little torches held in the hands of tiny elves who bowed in humble politeness to the kingly party but when once beyond the entrancehall no torches were needed to show the way for the huge pile of glittering gold and sparkling jewels which lay heaped up to the caverns roof lighted all the space around with a glory brighter than day there is the dwarfs treasure cried siegfried behold the hoard of andvari the gathered wealth of the ages henceforth fair kriemhild it is yours all yours save this serpentring and why not that too asked the queen for she admired its glittering golden scales and its staring ruby eyes alas answered he a curse rests upon it the curse which andvari the ancient laid upon it when loki tore it from his hand a misers heart selfish cold snaky is bred in its owners being and he thenceforth lives a very serpents life or should he resist its influence then death through the guile of pretended friends is sure to be his fate then why asked the queen why do you keep it yourself why do you risk its bane why not give it to your sworn foe or cast it into the sea or melt it in the fire and thus escape the curse siegfried answered by telling how when in the heyday of his youth he had slain fafnir the keeper of this hoard upon the glittering heath and how while still in the narrow trench which he had dug the blood of the horrid beast had flown in upon him and covered him up and this i have been told by odins birds he went on to say that every part of my body that was touched by the slimy flood was made forever proof against sword and spear and sharp weapons of every kind hence i have no cause to fear the stroke either of open foes or of traitorous false friends but was all of your body covered with the dragons blood was there no small spot untouched asked the queen more anxious now than she had ever seemed to be before she had known aught of her husbands strange security from wounds only one very little spot between the shoulders was left untouched answered siegfried i afterwards found a limeleaf sticking there and i know that the slimy blood touched not that spot but then who fears a thrust in the back none save cowards are wounded there ah said the queen toying tremulously with the fatal ring that little limeleaf may yet bring us unutterable woe but siegfried laughed at her fears and he took the serpentring and slipped it upon his forefinger and said that he would wear it there bane or no bane so long as odin would let him live then after another long look at the heaps of glittering gold and priceless gemstones the company turned and followed alberich back through the gloomy entranceway and the narrow door to the open air again and mounting their steeds which stood ready they started homewards but at the outer gate siegfried paused and said to the dwarf at parting hearken alberich the hoard of andvari is no longer mine i have made a present of it to my queen hold it and guard it therefore as hers and hers alone and whatever her bidding may be regarding it that do your word is law and shall be obeyed said the dwarf bowing low then the drowsy gatekeeper swung the heavy gate to its place and the kingly party rode gayly away on their way home the company went by another route through the narrow mountain pass which led towards the sea and thence through a rocky gorge between two smoking mountains and on one side of this road a great cavern yawned so dark and deep that no man had ever dared to step inside of it and as they paused before it and listened they heard away down in its dismal depths horrid groans sad moanings and faint wild shrieks so far away that it seemed as if they had come from the very centre of the earth and while they still listened the ground around them trembled and shook and the smoking mountain on the other side of the gorge smoked blacker than before loki is uneasy today said siegfried as they all put spurs to their horses and galloped swiftly home it was the cavern of the mischiefmaker which the party had visited and that evening as they again sat in siegfrieds pleasant hall they amused themselves by telling many strange old tales of the midworlds childhood when the gods and the giants and the dwarffolk had their dwelling on the earth but they talked most of loki the flame the restless the evildoer and this my children is the story that was told of the doom of the mischiefmakeren the story you have heard of the feast that old aegir once made for the asafolk in his goldlit dwelling in the deep sea and how the feast was hindered through the loss of his great brewingkettle until thor had obtained a still larger vessel from hymer the giant it is very likely that the thief who stole king aegirs kettle was none other than loki the mischiefmaker but if this was so he was not long unpunished for his meanness there was great joy in the oceankings hall when at last the banquet was ready and the foaming ale began to pass itself around to the guests but thor who had done so much to help matters along could not stay to the merrymaking for he had heard that the stormgiants were marshalling their forces for a raid upon some unguarded corner of the midworld and so grasping his hammer mjolner he bade his kind host goodby and leaped into his iron car business always before pleasure he cried as he gave the word to his swift strong goats and rattled away at a wonderful rate through the air in old aegirs hall glad music resounded on every side and the gleeful waves danced merrily as the asafolk sat around the festalboard and partook of the oceankings good fare aegirs two thralls the faithful funfeng and the trusty elder waited upon the guests and carefully supplied their wants never in all the world had two more thoughtful servants been seen and every one spoke in praise of their quickness and their skill and their ready obedience then loki unable to keep his hands from mischief waxed very angry because every one seemed happy and free from trouble and no one noticed or cared for him so while good funfeng was serving him to meat he struck the faithful thrall with a carvingknife and killed him then arose a great uproar in the oceankings feasthall the asafolk rose up from the table and drove the mischiefmaker out from among them and in their wrath they chased him across the waters and forced him to hide in the thick greenwood after this they went back to aegirs hall and sat down again to the feast but they had scarcely begun to eat when loki came quietly out of his hidingplace and stole slyly around to aegirs kitchen where he found elder the other thrall grieving sadly because of his brothers death i hear a great chattering and clattering over there in the feasthall said loki the greedy silly asafolk seem to be very busy indeed both with their teeth and their tongues tell me now good elder what they talk about while they sit over their meat and ale they talk of noble deeds answered elder they speak of gallant heroes and brave men and fair women and strong hearts and willing hands and gentle manners and kind friends and for all these they have words of praise and songs of beauty but none of them speak well of loki the thief and the vile traitor ah said loki wrathfully twisting himself into a dozen different shapes no one could ask so great a kindness from such folk i must go into the feasthall and take a look at this fine company and listen to their noisy merrymaking i have a fine scolding laid up for those good fellows and unless they are careful with their tongues they will find many hard words mixed with their ale then he went boldly into the great hall and stood up before the wonderstricken guests at the table when the asafolk saw who it was that had darkened the doorway and was now in their midst a painful silence fell upon them and all their merriment was at an end and loki stretched himself up to his full height and said to them hungry and thirsty come i to aegirs gold lit hall long and rough was the road i trod and wearisome was the way will no one bid me welcome will none give me a seat at the feast will none offer me a drink of the precious mead why are you all so dumb why so sulky and stiffnecked when your best friend stands before you give me a seat among you yes one of the highseats or else drive me from your hall in either case the world will never forget me i am loki then one among the asafolk spoke up and said let him sit with us he is mad and when be slew funfeng he was not in his right mind he is not answerable for his rash act but bragi the wise who sat on the innermost seat arose and said nay we will not give him a seat among us nevermore shall he feast or sup with us or share our goodfellowship thieves and murderers we know and will shun this speech enraged loki all the more and he spared not vile words but heaped abuse without stint upon all the folk before him and by main force he seized hold of the silent vidar who had come from the forest solitudes to be present at the feast and dragged him away from the table and seated himself in his place then as he quaffed the foaming ale he flung out taunts and jeers and hard words to all who sat around but chiefly to bragi the wise then he turned to sif the beautiful wife of thor and began to twit her about her golden hair oh how handsome you were when you looked at your bald head in the mirror that day oh what music you made when your hands touched your smooth pate and now whose hair do you wear and the wretch laughed wickedly as he saw the tears welling up in poor sifs eyes then suddenly a great tumult was heard outside the mountains shook and trembled and the bottom of the sea seemed moved and the waves affrighted and angry rushed hither and thither in confusion all the guests looked up in eager expectation and some of them fled in alarm from the hall then the mighty thor strode through the door and up to the table swinging his hammer and casting wrathful glances at the mischiefmaker loki trembled and dropped his goblet and sank down upon his knees before the terrible asa i yield me he cried spare my life i pray you and i will be your thrall forever i want no such thrall answered thor and i spare your life on one condition only that you go at once from hence and nevermore presume to come into the company of asafolk i promise all that you ask said loki trembling more than ever let me go thor stepped aside and the frightened culprit fled from the hall and was soon out of sight the feast was broken up the folk bade aegir a kind farewell and all embarked on freys good ship skidbladner and fair winds wafted them swiftly home to asgard loki fled to the dark mountain gorges of mist land and sought for a while to hide himself from the sight of both gods and men in a deep ravine by the side of a roaring torrent he built himself a house of iron and stone and placed a door on each of its four sides so that he could see whatever passed around him there for many winters he lived in lonely solitude planning with himself how he might baffle the gods and regain his old place in asgard and now and then he slipped slyly away from his hidingplace and wrought much mischief for a time among the abodes of men but when thor heard of his evildoings and sought to catch him and punish him for his evil deeds he was nowhere to be found and at last the asafolk determined that if he could ever be captured the safety of the world required that he should be bound hand and foot and kept forever in prison loki often amused himself in his mountain home by taking upon him his favorite form of a salmon and lying listlessly beneath the waters of the great fanander cataract which fell from the shelving rocks a thousand feet above him one day while thus lying he bethought himself of former days when he walked the glad young earth in company with the allfather and among other things he remembered how he had once borrowed the magic net of ran the oceanqueen and had caught with it the dwarf andvari disguised as he himself now was in the form of a slippery salmon i will make me such a net he cried i will make it strong and good and i too will fish for men so he took again his proper shape and went back to his cheerless home in the ravine and he gathered flax and wool and long hemp and spun yarn and strong cords and wove them into meshes after the pattern of queen rans magic net for men had not at that time learned how to make or use nets for fishing and the first fisherman who caught fish in that way is said to have taken lokis net as a model odin sat on the morrow in his high hall of hlidskialf and looked out over all the world and saw even to the uttermost corners what menfolk were everywhere doing when his eye rested upon the dark line which marked the mountainland of the mist country he started up in quick surprise and cried out who is that who sits by the fanander force and ties strong cords together but none of those who stood around could tell for their eyes were not strong enough and clear enough to see so far bring heimdal then cried odin now heimdal the white dwells among the blue mountains of sunny himminbjorg where the rainbow the shimmering asabridge spans the space betwixt heaven and earth he is the son of odin goldentoothed purefaced and cleanhearted and he ever keeps watch and ward over the midworld and the homes of frail menfolk lest the giants shall break in and destroy and slay he rides upon a shining steed named goldtop and he holds in his hand a horn called gjallarhorn with which in the last great twilight he shall summon the world to battle with the fenriswolf and the sons of loki this watchful guardian of the midworld is as wakeful as the birds and his hearing is so keen that no sound on earth escapes him not even that of the rippling waves upon the seashore nor of the quiet sprouting of the grass in the meadows nor even of the growth of the soft wool on the backs of sheep and his eyesight too is wondrous clear and sharp for he can see by night as well as by day and the smallest thing although a hundred leagues away cannot be hidden from him to heimdal then the heralds hastened bearing the words which odin had spoken and the watchful warder of the midworld came at once to the call of the allfather turn your eyes to the sombre mountains that guard the shadowy mistland from the sea said odin now look far down into the rocky gorge in which the fanander cataract pours and tell me what you see heimdal did as he was bidden i see a shape said he sitting by the torrents side it is lokis shape and he seems strangely busy with strong strings and cords call all our folk together commanded odin the wily mischiefmaker plots our hurt he must be driven from his hidingplace and put where he can do no further harm great stir was there then in asgard every one hastened to answer odins call and to join in the quest for the mischiefmaker thor came on foot with his hammer tightly grasped in his hands and lightning flashing from beneath his red brows tyr the onehanded came with his sword then followed bragi the wise with his harp and his sage counsels then hermod the nimble with his quick wit and ready hands and lastly a great company of elves and woodsprites and trolls then a whirlwind caught them up in its swirling arms and carried them through the air over the hilltops and the countryside and the meadows and the mountains and set them down in the gorge of the fanander force but loki was not caught napping his wakeful ears had heard the tumult in the air and he guessed who it was that was coming he threw the net which he had just finished into the fire and jumped quickly into the swift torrent where changing himself into a salmon he lay hidden beneath the foaming waters when the eager asafolk reached lokis dwelling they found that he whom they sought had fled and although they searched high and low among the rocks and the caves and the snowy crags they could see no signs of the cunning fugitive then they went back to his house again to consult what next to do and while standing by the hearth kwaser a sharpsighted elf whose eyes were quicker than the sunbeam saw the white ashes of the burned net lying undisturbed in the still hot embers the woven meshes unbroken and whole see what the cunning fellow has been making cried the elf it must have been a trap for catching fish or rather for catching men said bragi for it is strangely like the seaqueens net in that case said hermod the nimble he has made a trap for himself for no doubt he has changed himself as is his wont to a slippery salmon and lies at this moment hidden beneath the fanander torrent here are plenty of cords of flax and hemp and wool with which he intended to make other nets let us take them and weave one like the pattern which lies there in the embers and then if i mistake not we shall catch the too cunning fellow all saw the wisdom of these words and all set quickly to work in a short time they had made a net strong and large and full of fine meshes like the model among the coals then they threw it into the roaring stream thor holding to one end and all the other folk pulling at the other with great toil they dragged it forwards against the current even to the foot of the waterfall but the cunning loki crept close down between two sharp stones and lay there quietly while the net passed harmlessly over him let us try again cried thor i am sure that something besides dead rocks lies at the bottom of the stream so they hung heavy weights to the net and began to drag it a second time this time going down stream loki looked out from his hidingplace and saw that he would not be able to escape again by lying between the rocks and that his only chance for safety was either to leap over the net and hide himself behind the rushing cataract itself or to swim with the current out to the sea but the way to the sea was long and there were many shallow places and loki had doubts as to how old aegir would receive him in his kingdom he feared greatly to undertake so dangerous and uncertain a course so turning upon his foes and calling up all his strength he made a tremendous leap high into the air and clean over the net but thor was too quick for him as he fell towards the water the thunderer quickly threw out his hand and caught the slippery salmon holding him firmly by the tail when loki found that he was surely caught and could not by any means escape he took again his proper shape fiercely did he struggle with mighty thor and bitter were the curses which he poured down upon his enemies but he could not get free into the deep dark cavern beneath the smoking mountain where daylight never comes nor the warmth of the sun nor the sound of natures music the fallen mischiefmaker was carried and they bound him firmly to the sharp rocks with his face turned upwards toward the dripping roof for they said that nevermore until the last dread twilight should he be free to vex the world with his wickedness and skade the giant wife of niord and the daughter of grim old winter took a hideous poison snake and hung it up above loki so that its venom would drop into his upturned face but sigyn the loving wife of the suffering wretch left her home in the pleasant halls of asgard and came to his horrible prisonhouse to soothe and comfort him and evermore she holds a basin above his head and catches in it the poisonous drops as they fall when the basin is filled and she turns to empty it in the tarblack river that flows through that home of horrors the terrible venom falls upon his unprotected face and loki writhes and shrieks in fearful agony until the earth around him shakes and trembles and the mountains spit forth fire and fumes of sulphursmoke and there the mischiefmaker the spirit of evil shall lie in torment until the last great day and the dread twilight of all midworld things how strange and how sad that while loki lies thus bound and harmless evil still walks the earth and that so much mischief and such dire disasters were prepared for siegfried and the folk of nibelungen land adventure xviii how the mischief began to brew one day a party of strangers came to siegfrieds nibelungen dwelling and asked to speak with the king who are you and what is your errand asked the porter at the gate our errand is to the king and he will know who we are when he sees us was the answer when siegfried was told of the strange men who waited below and of the strange way in which they had answered the porters question he asked from what country seem they to have come for surely their dress and manners will betray something of that matter to you are they southland folk or eastland folk are they from the mountains or from the sea they belong to none of the neighborlands answered the earl who had brought the word to the king no such men live upon our borders they seem to have come from a faroff land for they are travelworn and their seastained clothing betokens a people from the south they are tall and dark and their hair is black and they look much like those rhineland warriors who came hither with our lady the queen and they carry a bloodred banner with a golden dragon painted upon it oh they must be from burgundy cried the queen who had overheard these words and she went at once to the window to see the strangers who were waiting in the courtyard below there indeed she saw thirty tall burgundians clad in the gay costume of rhineland now faded and worn with long travel but all save one were young and strangers to kriemhild that one was their leader an old man with a kind face and a right noble bearing see said the queen to siegfried there is our brave captain gere who ever since my childhood has been the trustiest man in my brother gunthers household those men are from the fatherland and they bring tidings from the dear old burgundian home welcome are they to our nibelungen land cried the delighted king and he ordered that the strangers should be brought into the castle and that the most sumptuous rooms should be allotted to them and a plenteous meal prepared and every thing done to entertain them in a style befitting messengers from kriemhilds fatherland then gere the trusty captain was led into the presence of the king and queen right gladly did they welcome him and many were the questions they asked about their kinfolk and the old rhineland home tell us good gere said siegfried what is thy message from our friends for we are anxious to know whether they are well and happy or whether some ill luck has overtaken them if any harm threatens them they have but to speak and i with my sword and my treasures will hasten to their help they are all well answered the captain no ill has befallen them and no harm threatens them peace rules all the land and fair weather and sunshine have filled the peoples barns and made their hearts glad and thus it has been ever since gunther brought to his dwelling the warriormaiden brunhild to be his queen and this is my errand and the message that i bring king gunther blessed with happiness intends to hold a grand hightide of joy and thanksgiving at the time of the harvestmoon and nothing is wanting to complete the gladness of that time but the sight of you and the peerless kriemhild in your old places at the feast and it is to invite you to this festival of rejoicing that i have come at the kings command to nibelungen land siegfried sat a moment in silence and then thoughtfully answered it is a long long journey from this land to burgundy and many dangers beset the road and my own people would sadly miss me while away and i know not what mishaps might befall then gere spoke of the queenmother ute now grown old and feeble who wished once more ere death called her hence to see her daughter kriemhild and he told how all the people both high and low yearned for another sight of the radiant hero who in former days had blessed their land with his presence and his noble deeds and his persuasive words had much weight with siegfried who said at length tarry a few days yet for my answer i will talk with my friends and the nibelungen earls and what they think best that will i do for nine days then waited gere at siegfrieds hall but still the king put off his answer wait until tomorrow he said each day for his heart whispered dim forebodings at length as midsummer was fast drawing near the impatient captain could stay no longer and he bade his followers make ready to go back forthwith to burgundy when the queen saw that they were ready to take their leave and that gere could wait no longer upon the kings pleasure she urged her husband to say to gunther that they would come to his harvest festival and the lords and noble earlfolk added their persuasions to hers send word back to the burgundian king said they that you will go as he desires we will see to it that no harm comes to your kingdom while you are away so siegfried called gere and his comrades into the ball and loaded them with costly gifts such as they had never before seen and bade them say to their master that he gladly accepted the kind invitation he had sent and that ere the harvest hightide began he and kriemhild would be with him in burgundy and the messengers went back with all speed and told what wondrous things they had seen in nibelungen land and in what great splendor siegfried lived and when they showed the rare presents which had been given them all joined in praising the goodness and greatness of the heroking but old chief hagen frowned darkly as he said it is little wonder that he can do such things for the shining hoard of andvari is his if we had such a treasure we too might live in more than kingly grandeur early in the month of roses siegfried and his peerless queen with a retinue of more than a thousand warriors and many fair ladies started on their long and toilsome journey to the southland and the folk who went with them to the city gates bade them mane tearful farewells and returned to their homes feeling that the sunshine had gone forever from the nibelungen land but the sky was blue and cloudless and the breezes warm and mild and glad was the song of the reapers as adown the seaward highway the kingly company rode two days they rode through mist land to the shore of the peaceful sea ten days they sailed on the waters and the winds were soft and gentle and the waves slept in the sunlight or merrily danced in their wake but each day far behind them there followed a stormcloud dark as night and the pleasant shores of mist land were hidden forever behind it five days they rode through the lowlands and glad were the lowland folk with sight of their heroking two days through the silent greenwood and one oer the barren moor and three amid vineyards and fields and between orchards fruitful and fair they rode and on the four and twentieth day they came in sight of the quiet town and the tall gray towers where dwelt the burgundian kings and a great company on horseback with flashing shields and finewrought garments and nodding plumes came out to meet them it was king gernot and a thousand of the best men and fairest women in burgundy and they welcomed siegfried and kriemhild and their nibelungenfolk to the fair land of the rhine and then they turned and rode back with them to the castle and as the company passed through the pleasant streets of the town the people stood by the wayside anxious to catch sight of the radiant siegfried on his sunbright steed and of the peerless kriemhild riding on a palfrey by his side and young girls strewed roses in their pathway and hung garlands upon their horses and every one shouted hail to the conquering hero hail to the matchless queen when they reached the castle king gunther and giselher met them and ushered them into the old familiar halls where a right hearty welcome greeted them from all the kingly household and none seemed more glad in this happy hour than brunhild the warriorqueen now more gloriously beautiful than even in the days of yore when the harvestmoon began to shine full and bright lighting up the whole world from evening till morn with its soft radiance the gay festival so long looked forward to began and care and anxiety and the fatigues of the long journey were forgotten amid the endless round of pleasure which for twelve days enlivened the whole of burgundy and the chiefest honors were everywhere paid to siegfried the heroking and to kriemhild the peerless queen of beauty then queen brunhild called to mind how on a time it had been told her in isenland that siegfried was but the liegeman and vassal of king gunther and she wondered why such honor should be paid to an underling and why the king himself should treat him with so much respect and as she thought of this and of the high praises with which every one spoke of kriemhild her mind became filled with jealous broodings and soon her bitter jealousy was turned to deadly hate for she remembered then how in the days long past a noble youth more beautiful and more glorious than the world would ever see again had awakened her from the deep sleep that odins thorn had given and she remembered how gunther had won her by deeds of strength and skill which he never afterwards could even imitate and she thought how grand indeed was kriemhilds husband compared with her own weak and wavering and commonplace lord and her soul was filled with sorrow and bitterness and deepest misery when putting these thoughts together she believed that she had in some way been duped and cheated into becoming gunthers wife when at last the gay feast was ended and most of the guests had gone to their homes she sought her husband and thus broached the matter to him often have i asked you said she why your sister kriemhild was given in marriage to a vassal and as often have you put me off with vague excuses often too have i wondered why your vassal siegfried has never paid you tribute for the lands which he holds from you and why he has never come to render you homage now he is here in your castle but he sets himself up not as your vassal but as your peer i pray you tell me what such strange things mean was an underling and a vassal ever known before to put himself upon a level with his liege lord gunther was greatly troubled and he knew not what to say for he feared to tell the queen how they had deceived her when he had won the games at isenstein and how the truth had ever since been kept hidden from her ask me not to explain this matter further than i have already done he answered it is enough that siegfried is the greatest of all my vassals and that his lands are broader even than my own he has helped me out of many straits and has added much to the greatness and strength of my kingdom for this reason he has never been asked to pay us tribute and for this reason we grant him highest honors but this answer failed to satisfy the queen is it not the first duty of a vassal she asked to help his liege lord in every undertaking if so siegfried has but done his duty and you owe him nothing but you have not told me all you have deceived me and you would fain deceive me again you have a secret and i will find it out the king made no answer but walked silently and thoughtfully away it happened one evening not long thereafter that the two queens sat together at an upper window and looked down upon a company of men in the courtyard below among them were the noblest earlfolk of burgundy and gunther the king and siegfried but siegfried towered above all the rest and he moved like a god among men see my noble siegfried cried kriemhild in her pride how grandly he stands there what a type of manly beauty and strength no one cares to look at other men when he is near he maybe handsome answered brunhild sadly and for aught i know he may be noble but what is all that by the side of kingly power were he but the peer of your brother gunther then you might well boast he is the peer of gunther returned kriemhild and not only his peer but more for he stands as high above him in kingly power and worth as in bodily stature how can that be asked brunhild growing angry for when gunther so gallantly won me at isenstein he told me that siegfried was his vassal and often since that time i have heard the same and even your husband told me that gunther was his liege lord queen kriemhild laughed at these words and answered i tell you again that siegfried is a king far nobler and richer and higher than any other king on earth think you that my brothers would have given me to a mere vassal to be his wife then brunhild full of wrath replied your husband is gunthers vassal and my own and he shall do homage to us as the humblest and meanest of our underlings he shall not go from this place until he has paid all the tribute that has so long been due from him then we shall see who is the vassal and who is the lord nay answered kriemhild it shall not be no tribute was ever due and if homage is to be paid it is rather gunther who must pay it it shall be settled once for all cried brunhild now boiling over with rage i will know the truth if siegfried is not our vassal then i have been duped and i will have revenge it is well was the mild answer let it be settled once for all and then mayhap we shall know who it was who really won the games at isenstein and you for gunthers wife and the two queens parted in wrathen kriemhilds anger was as fleeting as an april cloud which does but threaten and then passes away in tears and sunshine but brunhilds was like the dread winter storm that sweeps down from niflheim and brings ruin and death in its wake she felt that she had been cruelly wronged in some way and that her life had been wrecked and she rested not until she had learned the truth it was hagen who at last told her the story of the cruel deceit that had made her gunthers wife and then her wrath and her shame knew no bounds woe betide the day she cried woe betide the day that brought me to rhineland and made me the wife of a weakling and coward and the jest of him who might have done nobler things hagen smiled he had long waited for this day it was siegfried and siegfried alone who plotted to deceive you he said had it not been for him you might still have been the happy maidenqueen of isenland and now he laughs at you and urges his queen kriemhild to scorn you as she would an underling i know it i know it returned the queen in distress and yet how grandly noble is the man how he rushed through the flames to awaken me when no one else could save how brave how handsome and yet he has been my bane i can have no peace while he lives hagen smiled again and a strange light gleamed from his dark eye then he said truly handsome and brave is he but a viler traitor was never born he even now plots to seize this kingdom and to add it to his domain why else should he bring so great a retinue of nibelungen warriors to burgundy i will see king gunther at once and we will put an end to his wicked projects do even so good hagen said brunhild take him from my path and bring low the haughty pride of his wife and i shall be content that i will do cried hagen that i will do gunther is and shall be the king without a peer and no one shall dare dispute the worth and the queenly beauty of his wife then the wily chief sought gunther and with cunning words poisoned his weak mind the feeble old king was easily made to believe that siegfried was plotting against his life and seeking to wrest the kingdom from him and he forgot the many kind favors he had received at the heros hand he no longer remembered how siegfried had slain the terror of the glittering heath and freed the burgundians from many a fear and how he had routed the warlike hosts of the northland and made prisoners of their kings and how he had brought his voyage to isenland to a happy and successful ending he forgot also that siegfried was his sisters husband he had ears and mind only for hagens wily words while this man lives said the darkbrowed chief none of us are safe see how the people follow him hear how they shout at his coming they look upon him as a god and upon gunther as a nobody if we are wise we shall rid ourselves of so dangerous a man it is but a week until he takes his leave of us and goes back to his own home in nibelungen land watch him carefully until that time but do him no harm when he is once gone he shall never come back again said the king but he spoke thus not because of any kind feelings towards siegfried but rather because he feared the nibelungen hero he has no thought of going at that time answered hagen he speaks of it only to hide his wicked and traitorous plots instead of going home his plans will then be ready for action and it will be too late for us to save ourselves still if you will not believe me take your own course you have been warned the cunning chief arose to leave the room but gunther now thoroughly frightened stopped him hagen he said you have always been my friend and the words which you say are wise save us and our kingdom now in whatsoever way you may deem best i know not what to do then the weak king and the warriorchief talked long together in low hoarse whispers and when they parted shame and guilt were stamped in plain lines on gunthers face from which they were nevermore erased and he dared not lift his gaze from the floor fearing that his eyes would betray him if seen by any more purehearted than he but a smile of triumph played under the lurking gleams of hagens eye and he walked erect and bold as if he had done a praiseworthy deed that night a storm came sweeping down from the north and the cold rain fell in torrents and great hailstones pattered on the roofs and towers of the castle and cruelly pelted the cattle in the fields and the birds in the friendly shelter of the trees and old thor fought bravely with the stormgiants and all night long the rattle of his chariotwheels and the heavy strokes of his dread hammer were heard resounding through the heavens in his lonely chamber hagen sat and rubbed his hands together and grimly smiled the time so long waited for has come at last he said but the guilty king unable to sleep walked restlessly to and fro and trembled with fear at every sound of the stormgust without when day dawned at last a sad scene met the eyes of all beholders the earth was covered with the broken branches of leafy trees the flowers and shrubs were beaten pitilessly to the ground and here and there lay the dead bodies of little feathered songsters who the day before had made the woods glad with their music the sun had scarcely risen above this sorrowful scene gilding the gray towers and turrets and the drooping trees with the promise of better things than a strange confusion was noticed outside of the castlegates thirty and two horsemen wearing the livery of the northlands stood there and asked to be led to the burgundian kings who are you and what is your errand asked the gatekeeper we come as heralds and messengers from leudiger and leudigast the mighty kings of the north they answered but our errand we can tell to no man save to gunther your king or to his brothers gernot and giselher then they were led by the kings command into the councilhall where sat gunther gernot and the noble giselher and behind them stood their uncle and chief brave old hagen what message bring you from our old friends leudiger and leudigast asked gunther of the strangers call them not your friends answered the chief of the company we bring you this message from our liege lords whom you may well count as enemies many years ago they were sorely beaten in battle and suffered much hurt at your hands and they vowed then to avenge the injury and to wipe out the disgrace you had caused them just so soon as they were strong enough to do so now they are ready with fifty thousand men to march into your country and they swear to lay waste your lands and to burn your towns and villages and all your castles unless you at once acknowledge yourselves their vassals and agree to pay them tribute this is the kings message and we were further ordered not to wait for an answer but to carry back to them without delay your reply whether you will agree to their terms or no king gunther as was his wont turned to hagen for advice send for siegfried whispered the chief it was done and soon the hero came into the hall his kingly grace and warlike bearing were such that gunther dared not raise his guilty eyes from the ground and hagens furtive glances were for the moment freighted with fear and shame the message of the heralds was repeated to siegfried and gunther said most noble friend you hear what word these traitorous kings dare send us now we remember that long years ago you led us against them and gave us a glorious victory we remember too how by your counsel their lives were spared and they were sent home with costly gifts it is thus they repay our kindness what answer shall we send them say that we will fight answered siegfried at once i will lead my brave nibelungens against them and they shall learn how serious a thing it is to break an oath or to return treason for kindness the news soon spread through all the town and through the countryside that leudiger and leudigast with fifty thousand men were marching into burgundy and destroying every thing in their way and great flight and confusion prevailed men and women hurried hither and thither in dismay soldiers busily sharpened their weapons and burnished their armor ready for the fray little children were seen cowering at every sound and anxious faces were found everywhere when queen kriemhild saw the busy tumult and heard the shouts and cries in the street and the courtyard and learned the cause of it all she was greatly troubled and went at once to seek siegfried when she found him she drew him aside and besought him not to take part in the war which threatened but to hasten with all speed back to their own loved nibelungen land and why would my noble queen wish me thus to play the part of a coward and to leave my friends when they most need my help asked siegfried in surprise i would not have you play the coward answered kriemhild and hot tears stood in her eyes but some unseen danger overhangs there are other traitors than leudiger and leudigast and men to be more feared than they last night i dreamed a fearful dream and it follows me still i dreamed that you hunted in the forest and that two wild boars attacked you the grass and the flowers were stained with your gore and the cruel tusks of the beasts tore you in pieces and no one came to your help and i cried out in my distress and awoke and the stormclouds roared and threatened and the hail pattered on the roof and the wind and rain beat against the windowpanes then i slept again and another dream as fearful as the first came to me i dreamed that you rode in the forest and that music sprang up in your footsteps and all things living called you blessed but that suddenly two mountains rose up from the ground and their high granite crags toppled over and fell upon you and buried you from my sight forever then i awoke again and my heart has ever since been heavy with fearful forebodings i know that some dread evil threatens us yet what it is i cannot tell but go not out against the northkings our nibelungenfolk wait too long for your coming siegfried gayly laughed at his queens fears and said the woof of every mans fate has been woven by the norns and neither he nor his foes can change it when his hour comes then he must go to meet his destiny then he led her gently back to her room in the castle and bade her a loving farewell saying when the foes of our burgundian hosts are put to flight and there is no longer need for us here then will we hasten back to nibelungen land have patience and hope for a few days only and all will yet be well forget your foolish dreams and think only of my glad return it was arranged that in the march against the northkings siegfried with his nibelungens should take the lead while hagen with a picked company of fightingmen should bring up the rear every one was eager to join in the undertaking and no one save king gunther and his cunning counsellor and ortwin and dankwart knew that the pretended heralds from the northkings were not heralds at all but merely the false tools of wicked hagen for the whole was but a wellplanned plot as we shall see to entrap unwary trusting siegfried soon all things were in readiness for the march but as the day was now well spent it was agreed that at early dawn of the morrow the little army should set out and every one went home to put his affairs in order and to rest for the night late that evening old hagen went to bid siegfrieds queen goodby kriemhild had tried hard to drown her gloomy fears and to forget her sad foreboding dreams but it was all in vain for deep anxiety still rested heavily upon her mind yet she welcomed her darkbrowed uncle with the kindest words how glad i am she said that my husband is here to help my kinsfolk in this their time of need i know right well that with him to lead you shall win but dear uncle remember when you are in the battle that we have always loved you and that siegfried has done many kindnesses to the burgundians and if any danger threaten him turn it aside i pray you for kriemhilds sake i know that i merit queen brunhilds anger because of the sharp words i lately spoke to her but let not my husband suffer blame for that which is my fault alone kriemhild answered hagen no one shall suffer blame neither siegfried nor yourself we are all forgetful and sometimes speak hasty words but that which we say in angry thoughtlessness should not be cherished up against us there is no one who thinks more highly of siegfried than i and there is nothing i would not do to serve him i should not fear for him said she if he were not so bold and reckless when he is in the battle he never thinks of his own safety and i tremble lest at some time he may dare too much and meet his death if you knew every thing as i do you would fear for him too what is it asked hagen trying to hide his eagerness what is it that gives you cause for fear tell me all about it and then i will know the better how to shield him from danger i will lay down my life for his sake then kriemhild trusting in her uncles word and forgetful of every caution told him the secret of the dragons blood and of siegfrieds strange bath and of the mischiefworking limeleaf and now she added since i know that there is one spot which a deadly weapon might reach i am in constant fear that the spear of an enemy may perchance strike him there is there not some way of shielding that spot there is answered hagen make some mark or put some sign upon his coat that i may know where that spot is and when the battle rages i will ride close behind him and ward off every threatened stroke and kriemhild joyfully promised that she would at once embroider a silken limeleaf on the heros coat just over the fatal spot and hagen well pleased bade her farewell and went away without delay the chief sought the weakminded gunther and to him he related all that the trustful kriemhild had told him and until the midnight hour the two plotters sat in the kings bedchamber and laid their cunning plans both thought it best now they had learned the fatal secret to give up the sham march against the northkings and to seek by other and easier means to lure siegfried to his death the chiefs will be much displeased said gunther for all will come ready to march at the rising of the sun what shall we do to please them and make them more ready to change their plans hagen thought a moment and then the grim smile that was wont to break the dark lines of his face when he was pleased spread over his features we will have a grand hunt in the odenwald tomorrow he hoarsely whispered adventure xix how they hunted in the odenwald next morning at earliest daybreak while yet the stars were bright and the trees hung heavy with dewdrops and the clouds were light and high king siegfried stood with his warriors before the castlegate they waited but for the sunrise and a word from gunther the king to ride forth over dale and woodland and through forest and brake and field to meet as they believed the hosts of the northland kings and siegfried moved among them calmfaced and bright as a wargod upon the radiant greyfell and men said long years afterward that never had the shining hero seemed so glorious to their sight within the spacious courtyard a thousand burgundian braves stood waiting too for the signal and the kings word of command and at their head stood hagen dark as a cloud in summer guilefully hiding his vile plots and giving out orders for the marching there too were honest gernot fearless and upright and giselher true as gold and neither of them dreamed of evil or of the dark deed that day was doomed to see close by the gate was ortwin bearing aloft the bloodred dragonbanner which the burgundians were wont to carry in honor of siegfrieds famous fight with fafnir and there was dankwart also ever ready to boast when no danger threatened and ever willing to do chief hagens bidding and next came volker the fiddler good with the famed sword fiddlebow by him on which it is said he could make the sweetest music while fighting his foes in battle at length the sun began to peep over the eastern hills and his beams fell upon the castlewalls and shot away through the trees and over the meadows and made the dewdrops glisten like myriads of diamonds among the dripping leaves and blossoms and a glad shout went up from the throats of the waiting heroes for they thought that the lookedfor moment had come and the march would soon begin and the shout was echoed from walls to turrets and from turrets to trees and from trees to hills and from the hills to the vaulted sky above and nothing was wanting now but king gunthers word of command suddenly far down the street the sound of a bugle was heard and then of the swift clattering of horses hoofs coming up the hill towards the castle who are they who come thus to join us at the last moment asked hagen of the watchman above the gate they are strangers answered the watchman and they carry a peaceflag in a few moments the strange horsemen dashed up and halted some distance from the castlegate where siegfried and his heroes stood who are you and what is your errand cried hagen in the kings name they answered that they were heralds from the northland kings sent quickly to correct the message of the day before for their liege lords leudiger and leudigast they said had given up warring against burgundy and had gone back to their homes and they had sent humbly to ask the rhineland kings to forget the rash threats which they had made and to allow them to swear fealty to gunther and henceforth to be his humble vassals if only they might be forgiven right cheerfully do we forgive them cried gunther not waiting to consult with his wise men and our forgiveness shall be so full that we shall ask neither fealty nor tribute from them then he turned to siegfried and said you hear friend siegfried how this troublesome matter has been happily ended accept our thanks we pray you for your proffered help for without it it might have gone but roughly with us in a second war with the northland kings but now you are free to do what pleases you if as you said yesterday you would fain return to nibelungen land you may send your warriors on the way today for they are already equipped for the journey but abide you with us another day and tomorrow we will bid you godspeed and you may easily overtake your nibelungen friends ere they have reached our own boundaries siegfried was not well pleased to give up an undertaking scarce begun and still less could he understand why the king should be so ready to forgive the affront which the northland kings had offered him and he was not slow in reading the look of shame and guilt that lurked in gunthers face or the smile of jealous hate that hagen could no longer hide yet no word of displeasure spoke he nor seemed he to understand that any mischief was brewing for he feared neither force nor guile so he bade his nibelungens to begin their homeward march saying that he and kriemhild and the ladies of her train would follow swiftly on the morrow since it is your last day with us said gunther grown cunning through hagens teaching what say you dear siegfried to a hunt in odins wood right glad will i be to join you in such sport answered siegfried i will change my warcoat for a huntingsuit and be ready within an hour then siegfried went to his apartments and doffed his steelclad armor and searched in vain through his wardrobe for his favorite huntingsuit but it was nowhere to be found and he was fain to put on the rich embroidered coat which he sometimes wore in battle instead of a coatofmail and he did not see the white limeleaf that kriemhild with anxious care had worked in silk upon it then he sought the queen and told her of the unlookedfor change of plans and how on the morrow they would ride towards nibelungen land but today he said he had promised gunther to hunt with him in the odenwald but kriemhild to his great surprise begged him not to leave her even to hunt in the odenwald for she had begun to fear that she had made a great mistake in telling hagen the story of the limeleaf and yet she could not explain to siegfried the true cause of her uneasiness oh do not join in the hunt she cried something tells me that danger lurks hidden in the wood stay in the castle with me and help me put things in readiness for our journey homewards tomorrow last night i had another dream i thought that odins birds hugin and munin sat on a tree before me and hugin flapped his wings and said what more vile than a false friend what more to be feared than a secret foe harder than stone is his unfeeling heart sharper than the adders poisonfangs are his words a snake in the grass is he then munin flapped his wings too but said nothing and i awoke and thought at once of the sunbright balder slain through lokis vile deceit and as i thought upon his sad death a withered leaf came fluttering through the casement and fell upon my couch sad signs and tokens are these my husband and much grief i fear they foretell but siegfried was deaf to her words of warning and he laughed at the foolish dream then he bade her farewell till eventide and hastened to join the party of huntsmen who waited for him impatiently at the gate when the party reached the odenwald they separated each man taking his own course and following his own game siegfried with but one trusty huntsman and his own fleetfooted hound sought at once the wildest and thickest part of the wood and great was the slaughter he made among the fierce beasts of the forest for nothing that was worthy of notice could hide from his sight or escape him from his lair in a thorny thicket a huge wild boar sprang up and with glaring red eyes and mouth foaming and tusks gnashing with rage he charged fiercely upon the hero but with one skilful stroke from his great spear siegfried laid the beast dead on the heather next he met a tawny lion couched ready to spring upon him but drawing quickly his heavy bow he sent a quivering arrow through the animals heart then one after another he slew a buffalo four bisons a mighty elk with branching horns and many deers and stags and savage beasts at one time the hound drove from its hidingplace another wild boar much greater than the first and far more fierce quickly siegfried dismounted from his horse and met the grizzly creature as it rushed with raving fury towards him the sword of the hero cleft the beast in twain and its bloody parts lay lifeless on the ground then siegfrieds huntsman in gay mood said my lord would it not be better to rest a while if you keep on slaughtering at this rate there will soon be no game left in odenwald siegfried laughed heartily at the merry words and at once called in his hound saying you are right we will hunt no more until our good friends have joined us soon afterward the call of a bugle was heard and gunther and hagen and dankwart and ortwin with their huntsmen and hounds came riding up what luck have you had my friends asked siegfried then hagen told what game they had taken a deer a young bear and two small wild boars but when they learned what siegfried had done the old chiefs face grew dark and he knit his eyebrows and bit his lips in jealous hate for four knights ten huntsmen and four and twenty hounds had beaten every bush and followed every trail and yet the nibelungen king with but one follower and one hound had slain ten times as much game as they while they stood talking over the successes of the day the sound of a horn was heard calling the sportsmen together for the midday meal and knights and huntsmen turned their steeds and rode slowly towards the trystingplace suddenly a huge bear roused by the noise of baying hounds and tramping feet crossed their pathway ah cried siegfried there goes our friend bruin just in time to give us a bit of fun and some needed sport at dinner he shall go with us and be our guest with these words he loosed his hound and dashed swiftly forwards after the beast through thick underbrush and tangled briers and over fallen trees the frightened creature ran until at last it reached a steep hillside there in a rocky cleft it stood at bay and fought fiercely for its life when siegfried came up and saw that his hound dared not take hold of the furious beast he sprang from his horse and seized the bear in his own strong arms and bound him safely with a stout cord then he fastened an end of the cord to his saddlebows and remounted his steed and thus he rode through the forest to the place where the dinner waited dragging the unwilling bear behind him while the dog bounded gayly along by his side no nobler sight had ever been seen in that forest than that which gunthers people saw that day the nibelungen king was dressed as well became so great a hero his suit was of the speckled lynxs hide and rich black silk upon which were embroidered many strange devices with threads of gold but alas between the shoulders was the silken limeleaf that queen kriemhilds busy fingers had wrought his cap was of the blackest fur brought from the frozen siberian land over his shoulder was thrown his wellfilled quiver made of lions skin and in his hands he carried his bow of mulberry a very beam in size and so strong that no man save himself could bend it a golden huntinghorn was at his side and his sunbright shield lay on his saddlebow while his mighty sword the fireedged balmung in its sheath glittering with gemstones hung from his jewelled belt the men who stood around chief hagen and who saw the hero coming thus godlike through the greenwood admired and trembled and dankwart whispered a word of caution to his darkbrowed brother but the old chiefs face grew gloomier than before and he scowled fiercely upon the fainthearted dankwart as he hoarsely whispered in return what though he be odin himself still will i dare it is not i it is the norns who shape every mans fate when siegfried reached the camp with his prize the huntsmen shouted with delight and the hounds howled loudly and shook their chains and tried hard to get at the shaggy beast the king leaped to the ground and unloosed the cords which bound him and at the same time the hounds were unleashed and set upon the angry frightened creature hemmed in on every side the bear rushed blindly forwards and leaped over the fires where the cooks were busy with the dinner pots and kettles were knocked about in great confusion and the scared cooks thrown sprawling upon the ground and many a dainty dish and savory mess was spoiled the bear fled fast down the forest road followed by the baying hounds and the fleetfooted warriors but none dared shoot an arrow at him for fear of killing the dogs and it seemed as if he would surely escape so fast he ran away then siegfried bounded forwards swifter than a deer overtook the bear and with one stroke of the sword gave him his deathblow and all who saw this feat of strength and quickness wondered greatly and felt that such a hero must indeed be without a peer when gunthers cooks had made the dinner ready the company sat down on the grass and all partook of a merry meal for the bracing air and the mornings sport had made sharp appetites but when they had eaten they were surprised to find that there was nothing to drink indeed there was neither wine nor water in the camp how glad i am said siegfried gayly that i am not a huntsman by trade if it is a huntsmans way to go thus dry oh for a glass of wine or even a cup of cold springwater to quench my thirst we will make up for this oversight when we go back home said gunther and his heart was black with falsehood the blame in this matter should rest on hagen for it was he who was to look after the drinkables my lord said hagen i fell into a mistake by thinking that we would dine not here but at the spessart springs and thither i sent the wine and is there no water near asked siegfried yes answered hagen there is a cool shady spring not far from here where the water gushes in a clear cold stream from beneath a lindentree do but forgive me for the lack of wine and i will lead you to it it is a rare spring and the water is almost as good as wine better than wine for me cried siegfried and he asked to be shown to the spring at once hagen arose and pointed to a tree not far away beneath whose spreading branches siegfried could see the water sparkling in the sunlight men have told me said the chief that the nibelungen king is very fleet of foot and that no one has ever outstripped him in the race time was when king gunther and myself were spoken of as very swift runners and though we are now growing old i fancy that many young men would even now fail to keep pace with us suppose we try a race to the spring and see which of the three can win agreed cried siegfried we will run and if i am beaten i will kneel down in the grass to him who wins i will give the odds in your favor too for i will carry with me my spear and my shield and my helmet and sword and all the trappings of the chase while you may doff from your shoulders whatever might hinder your speed so gunther and hagen laid aside all their arms and put off their heavy clothing but siegfried took up his bow and quiver and his heavy shield and his beamlike spear then the word was given and all three ran with wondrous speed gunther and his chief flew over the grass as lightfooted as two wild panthers but siegfried sped swift as an arrow shot from the hand of a skilful bowman he reached the spring when yet the others were not half way to it he laid his spear and sword and bow and quiver of arrows upon the ground and leaned his heavy shield against the lindentree and then he waited courteously for king gunther to come up for his knightly honor would not allow him to drink until his host had quenched his thirst gunther when he reached the spring stooped over and drank heartily of the cool refreshing water and after he had risen siegfried knelt upon the grass at the edge of the pool to quaff from the same gushing fountain stealthily then and with quickness did chief hagen hide his huge bow and his quiver and his good sword balmung and seizing the heros spear he lifted it in air and with too steady aim struck the silken limeleaf that the loving kriemhild had embroidered never in all the wide midworld was known a deed more cowardly never a baser act the hero was pierced with his own weapon by one he had deemed his friend his blood gushed forth in torrents and dyed the green grass red and discolored the sparkling water and even filled the face and eyes of vile hagen yet in the hour of death king siegfried showed how noble was his soul how great his strength of will up he rose from his bended knees and fiercely glanced around then had not the evileyed chief who never before had shunned a foe fled with fleetfooted fear quick vengeance would have overtaken him in vain did the dying king look for his bow and his trusty sword too safely had they been hidden then though death was fast dimming his eyes he seized his heavy shield and sprang after the flying hagen swift as the wind he followed him quickly he overtook him with his last strength he felled the vile wretch to the ground and beat him with the shield until the heavy plates of brass and steel were broken and the jewels which adorned it were scattered among the grass the sound of the heavy blows was heard far through the forest and had the heros strength held out hagen would have had his rewarden but siegfried weak and pale from the loss of blood now staggered and fell among the trampled flowers of the wood then with his last breath he thus upbraided his false friends cowards and traitors ye a curse shall fall upon you my every care has been to serve and please you and thus i am requited bitterly shall you rue this deed the brand of traitor is set upon your foreheads and it shall be a mark of loathing and shame to you forever then the weak old gunther began to wring his hands and to bewail the death of siegfried but the hero bade him hush and asked him of what use it was to regret an act which could have been done only by his leave and sanction better to have thought of tears and groans before said he i have always known that you were a man of weak mind but never did i dream that you could lend yourself to so base a deed and now if there is left aught of manliness in your bosom i charge you to have a care for kriemhild your sister long shall my loved nibelungenfolk await my coming home the glorious hero struggled in the last agony the grass and flowers were covered with his blood the trees shivered as if in sympathy with him and dropped their leaves upon the ground the birds stopped singing and sorrowfully flew away and a solemn silence fell upon the earth as if the very heart of nature had been crushed and the men who stood around all save the four guilty ones bowed their heads upon their hands and gave way to one wild burst of grief then tenderly they took up siegfried and laid him upon a shield with his mighty weapons by him and when the sorrowing night had spread her black mantle over the midworld they carried him silently out of the forest and across the river and brought him by gunthers orders to the old castle which now nevermore would resound with mirth and gladness and they laid him at kriemhilds door and stole sadly away to their own places and each one thought bitterly of the morrowen adventure xx how the hoard was brought to burgundy and what was done on the morrow too sad is the tale of kriemhilds woe and her grief for the mighty dead let us pass it by in tearful pitying silence nor wish to awaken the echoes of that morning of hopeless anguish which dawned on the cold and cheerless dwelling of the kings for peace had fled from burgundy nevermore to return siegfried was dead faded now was the glory of the nibelungen land and gone was the midworlds hope it is told in ancient story how men built a funeralpile far out on the grassy meadows where the quiet river flows and how in busy silence they laid the sundried beams of ash and elm together and made ready the heros couch and how the pile was dight with many a sunbright shield with warcoats and glittering helms and silks and rich dyed cloths from the southland and furs and finewrought ivory and gemstones priceless and rare and how over all they scattered sweet spices from araby and the pleasantest of all perfumes then they brought the golden siegfried and laid him on his couch and beside him were his battered shield and balmung with its fireedge bare and as the sun rose high in heaven the noblest earlfolk who had loved siegfried best touched fire to the funeralpile and a pleasant breeze from the southland fanned the fire to a flame and the white blaze leaped on high and all the folk cried out in mighty agony to the gods such was the story that men told to each other when the world was still young and the heroes were unforgottenen and some said too that brunhild the fair and hapless queen died then of a broken heart and of a hopeless yearning sorrow and that she was burned with siegfried on that highbuilt funeralpile they are gone the lovely the mighty the hope of the ancient earth it shall labor and bear the burden as before the day of their birth it shall yearn and be ofttimes holpen and forget their deeds no more till the new sun beams on balder and the happy sealess shoreen another and much later story is sometimes told of these last sad days how the heros body was laid in a coffin and buried in the quiet earth amid the sorrowful lamentations of all the rhineland folk and how at kriemhilds earnest wish it was afterwards removed to the place where now stands the little minster of lorsch as to which of these stories is the true one it is not for me to say enough it is to know that siegfried was dead and that the springtime had fled and the summerseason with all its golden glories had faded away from rhineland and that the powers of darkness and of cold and of evil had prevailed to this day the city where was the dwelling of the burgundian kings is called worms in remembrance of the dragon or worm which siegfried slew and a figure of that monster was for many years painted upon the city arms and borne on the banner of the burgundians and until recently travellers were shown the reisenhaus a stronghold which men say siegfried built and in it were many strange and mighty weapons which they claim were wielded by the hero the lance which was shown there was a great beam nearly eighty feet in length and the warcoat wrought with steel and gold and bespangled with gemstones was a wonder to behold and now in the church of st cecilia you may see what purports to be the heros grave and a pleasant meadow not far from the town is still called kriemhilds rosegarden while farther away is the place called drachenfels or the dragons field where they say siegfried met fafnir but whether it is the same as the glittering heath of the ancient legend i know not and what became of the hoard of andvari the story is briefly tolden when the days of mourning were past and the people had gone back sadly to their homes queen kriemhild began to speak of returning to the land of the nibelungens but ute her aged mother could not bear to part with her and besought her to stay for a while at least in the now desolate burgundian castle and gernot and giselher her true and loving brothers added their words of entreaty also and so though heartsick and with many misgivings she agreed to abide for a season in this cheerless and comfortless place many days even months dragged by and still she remained for she found it still harder and harder to tear herself away from her mother and all that her heart held dear yet never for three years and more did she even speak to gunther or by any sign show that she remembered him and as for hagen no words could utter the deep and settled hate she felt towards him but the darkbrowed chief cared nought either for love or hate and he walked erect as in the days of yore and he smiled and frowned alike for both evil and good and he said it was not i it was the norns who wove the woof of his life and mine the years went by on leaden wings and brought no sunlight to gunthers dwelling for his days were full of sadness and his nights of fearful dreams at length he said to chief hagen if there is aught in the midworld that can drive away this gloom i pray thee to help me find it for madness steals upon me there is one thing answered hagen which might brighten our land again and lift up your drooping spirits and bring gladness to your halls what is that asked the king it is the nibelungen hoard said the chief it is the wondrous treasure of andvari which siegfried gave as a gift to kriemhild if it were ours we might become the masters of the world but how can we obtain it it is kriemhilds was the answer but she does not care for it neither could she use it if she wished if you could only gain her favor and forgiveness i feel sure that she would let you do with it as you wish then gunther besought his younger brothers to intercede for him with kriemhild that she would so far forgive him as to look upon his face and speak with him once more and this the queen at last consented to do and when gunther came into her presence she was so touched at sight of his haggard face and whitened locks and his earnest words of sorrow that she forgave him the great wrong that he had done and welcomed him again as her brother and he swore that never would he again wrong her or hers nor do aught to grieve her but it was not until a long time after this that he proposed to her that they should bring the hoard of andvari away from the nibelungen land for if it were here dear sister he said it might be of great use to you do whatever seems best to you answered kriemhild only remember the oath that you have given me then gunther because he was anxious to see the wondrous hoard but more because he was urged on by hagen made ready to send to the nibelungen land to bring away the treasure by kriemhilds command eight thousand men with gernot and giselher as their leaders sailed over the sea in stanch vessels and landed on the nibelungen shore and when they told who they were and whence they came and showed the queens signetring they were welcomed heartily by the fairhaired folk of mist land who gladly acknowledged themselves the faithful liegemen of the loved kriemhild when the burgundians made known their errand to alberich the dwarf who still held watch and ward over the mountain stronghold he was much amazed and he grieved to part with his cherished treasure but said he to his little followers who stood around him by thousands each anxious to fight the intruders but there is queen kriemhilds order and her signetring and we must perforce obey yet had we again the good tarnkappe which siegfried took from us the hoard should never leave us then sadly he gave up the keys and the burgundians began to remove the treasure for four whole days and nights they toiled carrying the hoard in huge wagons down to the sea and on the fifth day they set sail and without mishap arrived in good time at worms and many of alberichs people the swarthy elves of the cave came with gernot to rhineland for they could not live away from the hoard and it is said that hidden among the gold and the gemstones was the farfamed wishingrod which would give to its owner the power of becoming the lord of the wide midworld and the vast treasure was stored in the towers and vaults of the castle and queen kriemhild alone held the keys and lavishly she scattered the gold wherever it was needed most the hungry were fed the naked were clothed the sick were cared for and everybody near and far blessed the peerless queen of nibelungen land then hagen always plotting evil whispered to king gunther and said it is dangerous to suffer your sister to hold so vast a treasure all the people are even now ready to leave you and follow her she will yet plot to seize the kingdom and destroy us and he urged the king to take the keys and to make the nibelungen hoard his own but gunther answered i have already done too great a wrong and i have sworn to my sister never to harm her again or to do aught that will grieve her let the guilt then rest on me said hagen and he strode away and took the keys from kriemhild by force when gernot and giselher heard of this last vile act of the evileyed chief they waxed very angry and vowed that they would help their sister regain that which was her own but the wary hagen was not to be foiled for while the brothers were away from the burgh he caused the great hoard to be carried to the river at a place called lochheim and sunk fathoms deep beneath the water and then for fear of the vengeance which might be wreaked upon him he fled from rhineland and hid himself for a while among the mountains and the barren hillcountry of the south and this was the end of the fated hoard of andvari the after word such is the story of siegfried or sigurd as we gather it from various german and scandinavian legends in this recital i have made no attempt to follow any one of the numerous originals but have selected here and there such incidents as best suited my purpose in constructing one connected story which would convey to your minds some notion of the beauty and richness of our ancient myths in doing this i have drawn now from the volsunga saga now from the nibelungen lied now from one of the eddas and now from some of the minor legends relating to the great hero of the north these ancient stories although differing widely in particulars have a certain general relationship and agreement which proves beyond doubt a common origin the primeval myth says thomas carlyle whether it were at first philosophical truth or historical incident floats too vaguely on the breath of men each has the privilege of inventing and the far wider privilege of borrowing and new modelling from all that preceded him thus though tradition may have but one root it grows like a banian into a whole overarching labyrinth of trees if you would follow the tradition of siegfried to the end if you would learn how after the great hoard had been buried in the rhine the curse of the dwarf andvari still followed those who had possessed it and how kriemhild wreaked a terrible vengeance upon siegfrieds murderers you must read the original story as related in the volsung myth or in the nibelungen song our story ends with siegfried the episodes which i have inserted here and there the stories of aegir and of balder and of idun and of thor do not as you may know belong properly to the legend of siegfried but i have thrown them in in order to acquaint you with some of the most beautiful mythical conceptions of our ancestors a grand old people were those early kinsmen of ours not at all so savage and inhuman as our histories would sometimes make us believe for however mistaken their notions may have been and however ignorant they were according to our ideas of things they were stronghearted brave workers and so far as opportunity was afforded them they acted well their parts what their notions were of true manhood a strong mind in a strong body good brave and handsome may be learned from the story of siegfried end of the story of siegfried the story of siegfried endnotes en siegfrieds boyhood allmen agree that siegfried was a kings son he was born as we here have good reason to know at santen in netherland of siegmund and the fair siegelinde yet by some family misfortune or discord of which the accounts are very various he came into singular straits during boyhood having passed that happy period of life not under the canopies of costly state but by the sooty stithy in one mimer a blacksmiths shop thomas carlyle the nibelungen lied the older versions of this story represent siegfried under the name of sigurd as being brought up at the court of the danish king hialprek his own father sigmund having been slain in battle as related in this chapter he was early placed under the tuition of regin or regino an elf who instructed his pupil in draughts runes languages and various other accomplishments see preface to vollmers nibelunge not also the song of sigurd fafnisbane in the elder edda and the icelandic volsunga saga en mimer the vilkinasaga brings before us yet another smith mimer by whom not only is velint instructed in his art but sigfrit siegfried is brought up another smiths apprentice he is occasionally mentioned in the later poem of biterolf as mime the old the old name of munster in westphalia was mimigardiford the westphalian minden was originally mimidun and memleben on the unstrut mimileba the elder norse tradition names him just as often and in several different connections in one place a mimingus a woodsatyr and possessor of a sword and jewels is interwoven into the myth of balder and hoder the edda gives a higher position to its mimer he has a fountain in which wisdom and understanding lie hidden drinking of it every morning he is the wisest most intelligent of men to mimers fountain came odin and desired a drink but did not receive it till he had given one of his eyes in pledge and hidden it in the fountain this accounts for odin being oneeyed mimer is no asa but an exalted being with whom the asas hold converse of whom they make use the sum total of wisdom possibly an older naturegod later fables degraded him into a woodsprite or clever smith grimms deutsche mythologie i p concerning the mimer of the eddas professor anderson says the name mimer means the knowing the giants being older than the asas looked deeper than the latter into the darkness of the past they had witnessed the birth of the gods and the beginning of the world and they foresaw their downfall concerning both these events the gods had to go to them for knowledge it is this wisdom that mimer keeps in his fountain norse mythology p in the older versions of the legend the smith who cared for siegfried sigurd is called as we have before noticed regin he is thus described by morris the lore of all men he knew and was deft in every cunning save the dealings of the sword so sweet was his tonguespeech fashioned that men trowed his every word his hand with the harpstrings blended was the mingler of delight with the latter days of sorrow all tales he told aright the master of the masters in the smithying craft was he and he dealt with the wind and the weather and the stilling of the sea nor might any learn him leechcraft for before that race was made and that manfolks generation all their lifedays had he weighed sigurd the volsung bk ii en the sword by this sword balmung also hangs a tale doubtless it was one of those invaluable weapons sometimes fabricated by the old northern smiths compared with which our modern foxes and ferraras and toledos are mere leaden tools von der hagen seems to think it simply the sword mimung under another name in which case siegfrieds old master mimer had been the maker of it and called it after himself as if it had been his son carlyle on the nibelungen lied note in scandinavian legends the story of mimer and amilias is given differing but slightly from the rendering in this chapter see weber and jamiesons illustrations of northern antiquities in the older versions of the myth the sword is called gram or the wrath it was wrought from the shards or broken pieces of sigmunds sword the gift of odin it was made by regin for sigurds siegfrieds use and its temper was tested as here described en sigmund the volsung sigmund the volsung in the volsunga saga is represented as the father of sigurd siegfried but there is such a marked contrast between him and the wise homeabiding king siegmund of the later stories that i have thought proper to speak of them here as two different individuals the word sigmund or siegmund means literally the mouth of victory the story of the volsungs as here supposed to be related by mimer is derived mainly from the volsunga saga en siegfrieds journey into the forest in the shop of mimer siegfried was nowise in his proper element ever quarrelling with his fellowapprentices nay as some say breaking the hardest anvils into shivers by his too stout hammering so that mimer otherwise a firstrate smith could by no means do with him there he sends him accordingly to the neighboring forest to fetch charcoal well aware that a monstrous dragon one regin the smiths own brother would meet him and devour him but far otherwise it proved carlyle on the nibelungen lied en the norns the norns are the fates which watch over man through life they are urd the past verdande the present and skuld the future they approach every newborn child and utter his doom they are represented as spinning the thread of fate one end of which is hidden by urd in the far east the other by verdande in the far west skuld stands ready to rend it in pieces see grimms teutonic mythology p also andersons norse mythology p the three weird women in shakespeares tragedy of macbeth represent a later conception of the three norns now degraded to mere witches compare the norns with the fates of the greek mythology these also are three in number they sit clothed in white and garlanded singing of destiny clotho the past spins lachesis the present divides and atropos the future stands ready with her shears to cut the thread en the idea of fatality throughout the story of the nibelungs and volsungs of sigurd and of siegfried whether we follow the older versions or the mote recent renderings there is as it were an everpresent but indefinable shadow of coming fate a low inarticulate voice of doom foretelling the inevitable this is but in consonance with the general ideas of our northern ancestors regarding the fatality which shapes and controls every mans life these ideas are embodied in more than one ancient legend we find them in the old anglosaxon poem of beowulf to us cries beowulf in his last fight to us it shall be as our weird betides that weird that is every mans lord each man of us shall abide the end of his lifework let him that may work work his doomed deeds ere death comes similar ideas prevailed among the greeks read for example that passage in the iliad describing the parting of hector and andromache and notice the deeper meaning of hectors words en regin as we have already observed en the older versions of this myth called siegfrieds master and teacher regin while the more recent versions call him mimer we have here endeavored to harmonize the two versions by representing mimer as being merely regin in disguise en gripir a man of few words was gripir but he knew of all deeds that had been and times there came upon him when the deeds to be were seen no sword had he held in his hand since his father fell to field and against the life of the slayer he bore undinted shield yet no fear in his heart abided nor desired he aught at all but he noted the deeds that had been and looked for what should befall morriss sigurd the volsung bk ii en the hoard this story is found in both the elder and the younger eddas and is really the basis upon which the entire plot of the legend of sigurd or siegfried is constructed see also en en the dragon the oldest form of this story is the song of sigurd fafnisbane in the elder edda the english legend of st george and the dragon was probably derived from the same original sources a similar myth may be found among all aryan peoples sometimes it is a treasure sometimes a beautiful maiden that the monster guards or attempts to destroy its first meaning was probably this the maiden or the treasure is the earth in its beauty and fertility the monster is the stormcloud the hero who fights it is the sun with his glorious sword the lightningflash by his victory the earth is relieved from her peril the fable has been varied to suit the atmospheric peculiarities of different climes in which the aryans found themselves in northern mythology the serpent is probably the winter cloud which broods over and keeps from mortals the gold of the suns light and heat till in the spring the bright orb overcomes the powers of darkness and tempest and scatters his gold over the face of the earth this myth appears in a great variety of forms among the scandinavian and german nations in the eddas sigurd siegfried is represented as roasting the heart of fafnir and touching it to his lips we have ventured to present a less revolting version see baringgoulds curious myths of the middle ages the slaying of the dragon fafnir reminds us of python whom apollo overcame and as python guarded the delphic oracle the dying fafnir prophesies jacob grimm en in order to harmonize subsequent passages in the story as related in different versions we here represent siegfried as turning his back upon the glittering heath and leaving the hoard to some other hero or discoverer in the younger edda siegfried sigurd rides onward until he comes to fafnirs bed from which he took out all the gold packed it in two bags and laid it on granes greyfells back then got on himself and rode away en bragi this episode of bragi and his vessel is no part of the original story of siegfried but is here introduced in order to acquaint you with some of the older myths of our ancestors bragi was the impersonation of music and eloquence and here represents the music of nature the glad songs and sounds of the springtime above any other god says grimm one would like to see a more general veneration of bragi revived in whom was vested the gift of poetry and eloquence he appears to have stood in pretty close relation to aegir en aegir aegir was the god presiding over the stormy sea he entertains the gods every harvest and brews ale for them the name still survives in provincial english for the seawave on rivers andersons norse mythology see carlyles heroes and heroworship en the valkyries see grimms teutonic mythology p and andersons norse mythology p en brunhild in the elder edda brunhilds inaccessible hall stands on a mountain where she was doomed to sleep under her shield until sigurd should release her in the nibelungen lied she is represented as ruling in isenland an island far over the sea the wellknown story of the sleeping beauty is derived from this myth en nibelungen land vain were it to inquire where that nibelungen land specially is its very name is nebelland or niflland the land of darkness of invisibility far beyond the firm horizon that wonderbearing region swims on the infinite waters unseen by bodily eye or at most discerned as a faint streak hanging in the blue depths uncertain whether island or cloud carlyle on the nibelungen lied en schilbung and nibelung old king nibelung the former lord of the land had left when he died a mighty hoard concealed within a mountaincavern as siegfried rode past the mountainside alone he found schilbung and nibelung the kings sons seated at the mouth of the cavern surrounded by more gold and precious stones than a hundred wagons could bear away espying siegfried they called upon him to settle their dispute offering him as reward their fathers mighty sword balmung auber forestiers translation of the nibelungen lied we have here made some slight variations from the original versions see also en an ancient legend relates how king schilbung had obtained the hoard in the upper rhine valley and how he was afterwards slain by his brother niblung this niblung possessed a magic ring in the shape of a coiled serpent with ruby eyes it had been presented to him by a prince named gunthwurm who had come to him in the guise of a serpent desiring the hand of his daughter in marriage this ring according to the eddas was the one taken by loki from the dwarf andvari and was given by sigurd siegfried to brunhild in token of betrothal it was the cause of all the disasters that afterwards occurred see w jordans sigfridssaga see also en en siegfried the hero good failed the long task to finish this stirred their angry mood the treasure undivided he needs must let remain when the two kings indignant set on him with their train but siegfried gripped sharp balmung so hight their fathers sword and took from them their country and the beaming precious hoard the nibelungenlied lettsom en siegfrieds welcome home in the nibelungen lied this is our first introduction to the hero the hightide held in honor of siegfrieds coming to manhood and which we suppose to have occurred at this time forms the subject of the second adventure in that poem en kriemhilds dream this forms the subject of the first chapter of the nibelungen lied the eagles of kriemhilds dream says auber forestier are wintergiants whose wont it was to transform themselves into eagles while the pure gods were in the habit of assuming the falcons form en idun the story of idun and her apples is related in the younger edda it is there represented as having been told by bragi himself to his friend aegir this myth means that the everrenovating spring idun being taken captive by the desolating winter thjasse all nature all the asafolk languishes until she regains her freedom through the intervention of the summers heat loki see andersons norse mythology en balder the story of balder is in reality the most ancient form of the siegfried myth both balder and siegfried are impersonations of the beneficent light of the summers sun and both are represented as being treacherously slain by the powers of winter the errand of hermod to the halls of death hela reminds us of the errand of hermes to hades to bring back persephone to her mother demetre we perceive also a resemblance in this story to the myth of orpheus in which that hero is described as descending into the lower regions to bring away his wife eurydice en the making of rich clothing for the heroes is frequently referred to in the nibelungen lied carlyle says this is a neverfailing preparative for all expeditions and is always specified and insisted on with a simple loving almost female impressiveness en the winning of brunhild the story of the outwitting of brunhild as related in the pages which follow is essentially the same as that given in the nibelungen lied it is quite different from the older versions en sif sif corresponds to the ceres of the southern mythology see grimm p the story of loki and the dwarfs is derived from the younger edda it has been beautifully rendered by the german poet oelenschlager a translation of whose poem on this subject may be found in longfellows poets and poetry of europe en eigill eigill

very thick shoe and he is the strongest next to thor from him the gods have much help in all hard tasks the younger edda andersons translation fn the word vidar means forest en loki loki in nature is the corrupting element in air fire and water in the bowels of the earth he is the volcanic flame in the sea he appears as a fierce serpent and in the lower world we recognize him as pale death like

remotely to the prometheus of the greeks en the quarrel of the queens in the ancient versions the culmination of this quarrel occurred while the queens were bathing in the river in the nibelungen lied it happened on the steps leading up to the door of the church en hagen hagen corresponds to the hoder of the more ancient myth of balder in the sigurd sagas he is called hogni and is a brother instead of an uncle of gunther gunnar en the death of siegfried this story is related here essentially as found in the nibelungen lied it is quite differently told in the older versions siegfrieds invulnerability save in one spot reminds us of achilles who also was made invulnerable by a bath and who could be wounded only in the heel en the burial of siegfried the story of the burning of siegfrieds body upon a funeralpile as related of sigurd in the older myths reminds us of the burning of balder upon the ship ringhorn see p the nibelungen lied represents him as being buried in accordance with the rites of the romancatholic church this version of the story must of course have been made after the conversion of the germans to christianity when the emperor frederick iii visited worms after his netherlands campaign says forestier he undertook to have the mighty heros bones disinterred probably in view of proving the truth of the marvellous story then sung throughout germany but although he had the ground dug into until water streamed forth no traces of these became manifest en morris sigurd the volsung bk iii en the hoard the story of bringing the hoard from nibelungen
