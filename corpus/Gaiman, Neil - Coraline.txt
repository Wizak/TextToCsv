fairy tales are more than true not because they tell us that dragons exist but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten g k chesterton coraline discovered the door a little while after they moved into the house it was a very old house it had an attic under the roof and a cellar under the ground and an overgrown garden with huge old trees in it coralines family didnt own all of the house it was too big for that instead they owned part of it there were other people who lived in the old house miss spink and miss forcible lived in the flat below coralines on the ground floor they were both old and round and they lived in their flat with a number of ageing highland terriers who had names like hamish and andrew and jock once upon a time miss spink and miss forcible had been actresses as miss spink told coraline the first time she met her you see caroline miss spink said getting coralines name wrong both myself and miss forcible were famous actresses in our time we trod the boards lovey oh dont let hamish eat the fruitcake or hell be up all night with his tummy its coraline not caroline coraline said coraline in the flat above coralines under the roof was a crazy old man with a big moustache he told coraline that he was training a mouse circus he wouldnt let anyone see it one day little caroline when they are all ready everyone in the whole world will see the wonders of my mouse circus you ask me why you cannot see it now is that what you asked me no said coraline quietly i asked you not to call me caroline its coraline the reason you cannot see the mouse circus said the man upstairs is that the mice are not yet ready and rehearsed also they refuse to play the songs i have written for them all the songs i have written for the mice to play go oompah oompah but the white mice will only play toodle oodle like that i am thinking of trying them on different types of cheese coraline didnt think there really was a mouse circus she thought the old man was probably making it up the day after they moved in coraline went exploring she explored the garden it was a big garden at the very back was an old tennis court but no one in the house played tennis and the fence around the court had holes in it and the net had mostly rotted away there was an old rose garden filled with stunted flyblown rose bushes there was a rockery that was all rocks there was a fairy ring made of squidgy brown toadstools which smelled dreadful if you accidentally trod on them there was also a well on the first day coralines family moved in miss spink and miss forcible made a point of telling coraline how dangerous the well was and they warned her to be sure she kept away from it so coraline set off to explore for it so that she knew where it was to keep away from it properly she found it on the third day in an overgrown meadow beside the tennis court behind a clump of trees a low brick circle almost hidden in the high grass the well had been covered over by wooden boards to stop anyone falling in there was a small knothole in one of the boards and coraline spent an afternoon dropping pebbles and acorns through the hole and waiting and counting until she heard the plop as they hit the water far below coraline also explored for animals she found a hedgehog and a snakeskin and a rock that looked just like a frog and a toad that looked just like a rock there was also a haughty black cat who would sit on walls and tree stumps and watch her but would slip away if ever she went over to try to play with it that was how she spent her first two weeks at the house exploring the garden and the grounds her mother made her come back inside for dinner and for lunch and coraline had to make sure she dressed up warmly before she went out for it was a very cold summer that year but go out she did exploring every day until the day it rained when coraline had to stay inside what should i do asked coraline read a book said her mother watch a video play with your toys go and pester miss spink or miss forcible or the crazy old man upstairs no said coraline i dont want to do those things i want to explore i dont really mind what you do said coralines mother as long as you dont make a mess coraline went over to the window and watched the rain come down it wasnt the kind of rain you could go out in it was the other kind the kind that threw itself down from the sky and splashed where it landed it was rain that meant business and currently its business was turning the garden into a muddy wet soup coraline had watched all the videos she was bored with her toys and shed read all her books she turned on the television she went from channel to channel to channel but there was nothing on but men in suits talking about the stock market and sports programmes eventually she found something to watch it was the last half of a naturalhistory programme about something called protective coloration she watched animals birds and insects which disguised themselves as leaves or twigs or other animals to escape from things that could hurt them she enjoyed it but it ended too soon and was followed by a programme about a cake factory it was time to talk to her father coralines father was home both of her parents worked doing things on computers which meant that they were home a lot of the time each of them had their own study hello coraline he said when she came in without turning round mmph said coraline its raining yup said her father its bucketing down no said coraline its just raining can i go outside what does your mother say she says youre not going out in weather like that coraline jones then no but i want to carry on exploring then explore the flat suggested her father look heres a piece of paper and a pen count all the doors and windows list everything blue mount an expedition to discover the hotwater tank and leave me alone to work can i go into the drawing room the drawing room was where the joneses kept the expensive furniture coralines grandmother had left them when she died coraline wasnt allowed in there nobody went in there it was only for best if you dont make a mess and you dont touch anything coraline considered this carefully then she took the paper and pen and went off to explore the inside of the flat she discovered the hotwater tank she counted everything blue she counted the windows she counted the doors of the doors that she found thirteen opened and closed the other the big carved brown wooden door at the far corner of the drawing room was locked she said to her mother where does that door go nowhere dear it has to go somewhere her mother shook her head look she told coraline she reached up and took a string of keys from the top of the kitchen doorframe she sorted through them carefully and selected the oldest biggest blackest rustiest key they went into the drawing room she unlocked the door with the key the door swung open her mother was right the door didnt go anywhere it opened on to a brick wall when this place was just one house said coralines mother that door went somewhere when they turned the house into flats they simply bricked it up the other side is the empty flat on the other side of the house the one thats still for sale she shut the door and put the string of keys back on top of the kitchen doorframe you didnt lock it said coraline her mother shrugged why should i lock it she asked it doesnt go anywhere coraline didnt say anything it was nearly dark now and the rain was still coming down pattering against the windows and blurring the lights of the cars in the street outside coralines father stopped working and made them all dinner coraline was disgusted daddy she said youve made a recipe again its leek and potato stew with a tarragon garnish and melted gruyere cheese he admitted coraline sighed then she went to the freezer and got out some microwave chips and a microwave minipizza you know i dont like recipes she told her father while her dinner went round and round and the little red numbers on the microwave oven counted down to zero if you tried it maybe youd like it said coralines father but she shook her head that night coraline lay awake in her bed the rain had stopped and she was almost asleep when something went tttttt she sat up in bed something went kreeee aaaak coraline got out of bed and looked down the hall but saw nothing strange she walked down the hallway from her parents bedroom came a low snoring that was her father and an occasional sleeping mutter that was her mother coraline wondered if shed dreamed it whatever it was something moved it was little more than a shadow and it scuttled down the darkened hall fast like a little patch of night she hoped it wasnt a spider spiders made coraline intensely uncomfortable the black shape went into the drawing room and coraline followed it in a little nervously the room was dark the only light came from the hall and coraline who was standing in the doorway cast a huge and distorted shadow on to the drawingroom carpet she looked like a thin giant woman coraline was just wondering whether or not she ought to turn on the light when she saw the black shape edge slowly out from beneath the sofa it paused and then dashed silently across the carpet towards the farthest corner of the room there was no furniture in that corner of the room coraline turned on the light there was nothing in the corner nothing but the old door that opened on to the brick wall she was sure that her mother had shut the door but now it was ever so slightly open just a crack coraline went over to it and looked in there was nothing there just a wall built of red bricks coraline closed the old wooden door turned out the light and went back to bed she dreamed of black shapes that slid from place to place avoiding the light until they were all gathered together under the moon little black shapes with little red eyes and sharp yellow teeth they started to sing we are small but we are many we are many we are small we were here before you rose we will be here when you fall their voices were high and whispery and slightly whiny they made coraline feel uncomfortable then coraline dreamed a few commercials and after that she dreamed of nothing at all the next day it had stopped raining but a thick white fog had lowered over the house im going for a walk said coraline dont go too far said her mother and dress up warmly coraline put on her blue coat with a hood her red scarf and her yellow wellington boots she went out miss spink was walking her dogs hello caroline said miss spink rotten weather yes said coraline i played portia once said miss spink miss forcible talks about her ophelia but it was my portia they came to see when we trod the boards miss spink was bundled up in pullovers and cardigans so she seemed more small and circular than ever she looked like a large fluffy egg she wore thick glasses that made her eyes seem huge they used to send flowers to my dressing room they did she said who did asked coraline miss spink looked around cautiously looking first over one shoulder and then over the other peering into the mist as though someone might be listening men she whispered then she tugged the dogs to heel and waddled off back towards the house coraline continued her walk she was three quarters of the way around the house when she saw miss forcible standing at the door to the flat she shared with miss spink have you seen miss spink caroline coraline told her that she had and that miss spink was out walking the dogs i do hope she doesnt get lost itll bring on her shingles if she does youll see said miss forcible youd have to be an explorer to find your way around in this fog im an explorer said coraline of course you are lovey said miss forcible dont get lost now coraline continued walking through the garden in grey mist she always kept in sight of the house after about ten minutes of walking she found herself back where she had started the hair over her eyes was limp and wet and her face felt damp ahoy caroline called the crazy old man upstairs oh hello said coraline she could hardly see the old man through the mist he walked down the steps on the outside of the house that led up past coralines front door to the door of his flat he walked down very slowly coraline waited at the bottom of the steps the mice do not like the mist he told her it makes their whiskers droop i dont like the mist much either admitted coraline the old man leaned down so close that the bottom of his moustache tickled coralines ear the mice have a message for you he whispered coraline didnt know what to say the message is this dont go through the door he paused does that mean anything to you no said coraline the old man shrugged they are funny the mice they get things wrong they got your name wrong you know they kept saying coraline not caroline not caroline at all he picked up a milk bottle from the bottom step and started back up to his attic flat coraline went indoors her mother was working in her study her mothers study smelt of flowers what shall i do asked coraline when do you go back to school asked her mother next week said coraline hmph said her mother i suppose i shall have to get you new school clothes remind me dear or else ill forget and she went back to typing things on the computer screen what shall i do repeated coraline draw something her mother passed her a sheet of paper and a ballpoint pen coraline tried drawing the mist after ten minutes of drawing she still had a white sheet of paper with mst i written on it in one corner in slightly wiggly letters she grunted and passed it to her mother mm very modern dear said coralines mother coraline crept into the drawing room and tried to open the old door in the corner it was locked once more she supposed her mother must have locked it again she shrugged coraline went to see her father he had his back to the door as he typed go away he said cheerfully as she walked in tm bored she said learn how to tapdance he suggested without turning round coraline shook her head why dont you play with me she asked busy he said working he added he still hadnt turned around to look at her why dont you go and bother miss spink and miss forcible coraline put on her coat and pulled up her hood and went out of the house she went down the steps she rang the door of miss spink and miss forcibles flat coraline could hear a frenzied woofing as the scottie dogs ran out into the hall after a while miss spink opened the door oh its you caroline she said angus hamish bruce down now lovies its only caroline come in dear would you like a cup of tea the flat smelt of furniture polish and dogs yes please said coraline miss spink led her into a dusty little room which she called the parlour on the walls were black and white photographs of pretty women and theatre programmes in frames miss forcible was sitting in one of the armchairs knitting hard miss spink poured coraline a cup of tea in a little pink bonechina cup with a saucer and gave her a dry garibaldi biscuit to go with it miss forcible looked at miss spink picked up her knitting and took a deep breath anyway april as i was saying you still have to admit theres life in the old dog yet she said miriam dear neither of us is as young as we were madame arcati replied miss forcible the nurse in romeo lady bracknell character parts they cant retire you from the stage now miriam we agreed said miss spink coraline wondered if theyd forgotten she was there they werent making much sense she decided they were having an argument as old and comfortable as an armchair the kind of argument that no one ever really wins or loses but which can go on for ever if both parties are willing she sipped her tea ill read the leaves if you want said miss spink to coraline sorry said coraline the tea leaves dear ill read your future coraline passed miss spink her cup miss spink peered shortsightedly at the black tea leaves in the bottom she pursed her lips you know caroline she said after a while you are in terrible danger miss forcible snorted and put down her knitting dont be silly april stop scaring the girl your eyes are going pass me that cup child coraline carried the cup over to miss forcible miss forcible looked into it carefully and shook her head and looked into it again oh dear she said you were right april she is in danger see miriam said miss spink triumphantly my eyes are as good as they ever were what am i in danger from asked coraline misses spink and forcible stared at her blankly it didnt say said miss spink tea leaves arent reliable for that kind of thing not really theyre good for generalities but not for specifics what should i do then asked coraline who was slightly alarmed by this dont wear green in your dressing room suggested miss spink or mention the scottish play added miss forcible coraline wondered why so few of the adults she had met made any sense she sometimes wondered who they thought they were talking to and be very very careful said miss spink she got up from her armchair and went over to the fireplace on the mantelpiece was a small jar and miss spink took off the top of the jar and began to pull things out of it there was a tiny china duck a thimble a strange little brass coin two paperclips and a stone with a hole in it she passed coraline the stone with a hole in it whats it for asked coraline the hole went all the way through the middle of the stone she held it up to the window and looked through it it might help said miss spink theyre good for bad things sometimes coraline put on her coat said goodbye to misses spink and forcible and to the dogs and went outside the mist hung like blindness around the house she walked slowly to the steps up to her familys flat and then stopped and looked around in the mist it was a ghostworld in danger thought coraline to herself it sounded exciting it didnt sound like a bad thing not really coraline went back up the steps her fist closed tightly around her new stone the next day the sun shone and coralines mother took her into the nearest large town to buy clothes for school they dropped her father off at the railway station he was going into london for the day to see some people coraline waved him goodbye they went to the department store to buy the school clothes coraline saw some dayglo green gloves she liked a lot her mother refused to get them for her preferring instead to buy white socks navyblue school underpants four grey blouses and a dark grey skirt but mum everybody at schools got grey blouses and everything nobodys got green gloves i could be the only one her mother ignored her she was talking to the shop assistant they were talking about which kind of pullover to get for coraline and were agreeing that the best thing to do would be to get one that was embarrassingly large and baggy in the hope that one day she might grow into it coraline wandered off and looked at a display of wellington boots shaped like frogs and ducks and rabbits then she wandered back coraline oh there you are where on earth were you i was kidnapped by aliens said coraline they came down from outer space with ray guns but i fooled them by wearing a wig and laughing in a foreign accent and i escaped yes dear now i think you could do with some more hairclips dont you no well lets say half a dozen to be on the safe side said her mother coraline didnt say anything in the car on the way back home coraline said whats in the empty flat i dont know nothing i expect it probably looks like our flat before we moved in empty rooms do you think you could get into it from our flat not unless you can walk through bricks dear oh they got home around lunchtime the sun was shining although the day was cold coralines mother looked in the fridge and found a sad little tomato and a piece of cheese with green stuff growing on it there was only a crust in the bread bin id better dash down to the shops and get some fishfingers or something said her mother do you want to come no said coraline suit yourself said her mother and left then she came back and got her purse and car keys and went out again coraline was bored she flipped through a book her mother was reading about native people in a distant country how every day they would take pieces of white silk and draw on them in wax then dip the silks in dye then draw on them more in wax and dye them some more then boil the wax out in hot water and then finally throw the nowbeautiful cloths on a fire and burn them to ashes it seemed particularly pointless to coraline but she hoped that the people enjoyed it she was still bored and her mother wasnt yet home coraline got a chair and pushed it over to the kitchen door she climbed on to the chair and reached up she clambered down and got a broom from the broom cupboard she climbed back on the chair again and reached up with the broom chink she climbed down from the chair and picked up the keys she smiled triumphantly then she leaned the broom against the wall and went into the drawing room the family did not use the drawing room they had inherited the furniture from coralines grandmother along with a wooden coffee table a side table a heavy glass ashtray and the oil painting of a bowl of fruit coraline could never work out why anyone would want to paint a bowl of fruit other than that the room was empty there were no knickknacks on the mantelpiece no statues or clocks nothing that made it feel comfortable or livedin the old black key felt colder than any of the others she pushed it into the keyhole it turned smoothly with a satisfying clunk coraline stopped and listened she knew she was doing something wrong and she was trying to listen for her mother coming back but she heard nothing then coraline put her hand on the doorknob and turned it and finally she opened the door it opened on to a dark hallway the bricks had gone as if theyd never been there there was a cold musty smell coming through the open doorway it smelled like something very old and very slow coraline went through the door she wondered what the empty flat would be like if that was where the corridor led coraline walked down the corridor uneasily there was something very familiar about it the carpet beneath her feet was the same carpet they had in their flat the wallpaper was the same wallpaper they had the picture hanging in the hall was the same that they had hanging in their hallway at home she knew where she was she was in her own home she hadnt left she shook her head confused she stared at the picture hanging on the wall no it wasnt exactly the same the picture they had in their own hallway showed a boy in oldfashioned clothes staring at some bubbles but now the expression on his face was different he was looking at the bubbles as if he was planning to do something very nasty indeed to them and there was something peculiar about his eyes coraline stared at his eyes trying to work out what exactly was different she almost had it when somebody said coraline it sounded like her mother coraline went into the kitchen where the voice had come from a woman stood in the kitchen with her back to coraline she looked a little like coralines mother only only her skin was white as paper only she was taller and thinner only her fingers were too long and they never stopped moving and her darkred fingernails were curved and sharp coraline the woman said is that you and then she turned round her eyes were big black buttons lunchtime coraline said the woman who are you asked coraline im your other mother said the woman go and tell your other father that lunch is ready she opened the door of the oven suddenly coraline realised how hungry she was it smelled wonderful well go on coraline went down the hall to where her fathers study was she opened the door there was a man in there sitting at the keyboard with his back to her hello said coraline i i mean she said to say that lunch is ready the man turned round his eyes were buttons big and black and shiny hello coraline he said im starving he got up and went with her into the kitchen they sat at the kitchen table and coralines other mother brought them lunch a huge goldenbrown roasted chicken fried potatoes tiny green peas coraline shovelled the food into her mouth it tasted wonderful weve been waiting for you for a long time said coralines other father forme yes said the other mother it wasnt the same here without you but we knew youd arrive one day and then we could be a proper family would you like some more chicken it was the best chicken that coraline had ever eaten her mother sometimes made chicken but it was always out of packets or frozen and was very dry and it never tasted of anything when coralines father cooked chicken he bought real chicken but he did strange things to it like stewing it in wine or stuffing it with prunes or baking it in pastry and coraline would always refuse to touch it on principle she took some more chicken i didnt know i had another mother said coraline cautiously of course you do everyone does said the other mother her blackbutton eyes gleaming after lunch i thought you might like to play in your room with the rats the rats from upstairs coraline had never seen a rat except on television she was quite looking forward to it this was turning out to be a very interesting day after all after lunch her other parents did the washingup and coraline went down the hall to her other bedroom it was different from her bedroom at home for a start it was painted in an offputting shade of green and a peculiar shade of pink coraline decided that she wouldnt want to have to sleep in there but that the colour scheme was an awful lot more interesting than the one in her own bedroom there were all sorts of remarkable things in there shed never seen before windup angels that fluttered around the bedroom like startled sparrows books with pictures that writhed and crawled and shimmered little dinosaur skulls that chattered their teeth as she passed a whole toybox filled with wonderful toys this is more like it thought coraline she looked out of the window outside the view was the same one she saw from her own bedroom trees fields and beyond them on the horizon distant purple hills something black scurried across the floor and vanished under the bed coraline got down on her knees and looked under the bed fifty little red eyes stared back at her hello said coraline are you the rats they came out from under the bed blinking their eyes in the light they had short sootblack fur little red eyes pink paws like tiny hands and pink hairless tails like long smooth worms can you talk she asked the largest blackest of the rats shook its head it had an unpleasant sort of smile coraline thought well asked coraline what do you do the rats formed a circle then they began to climb on top of each other carefully but swiftly until they had formed a pyramid with the largest rat at the top the rats began to sing in high whispery voices we have teeth and we have tails we have tails we have eyes we were here before you fell you will be here when we rise it wasnt a pretty song coraline was sure shed heard it before or something like it although she was unable to remember exactly where then the pyramid fell apart and the rats scampered fast and black towards the door the other crazy old man upstairs was standing in the doorway holding a tall black hat in his hands the rats scampered up him burrowing into his pockets into his shirt up his trouserlegs down his neck the largest rat climbed on to the old mans shoulders swung up on the long grey moustache past the big blackbutton eyes and on to the top of the mans head in seconds the only evidence that the rats were there at all were the restless lumps under the mans clothes forever sliding from place to place across him and there was still the largest rat who stared down with glittering red eyes at coraline from the mans head the old man put his hat on and the last rat was gone hello coraline said the other old man upstairs i heard you were here it is time for the rats to have their dinner but you can come up with me if you like and watch them feed there was something hungry in the old mans button eyes that made coraline feel uncomfortable no thank you she said tm going outside to explore the old man nodded very slowly coraline could hear the rats whispering to each other although she couldnt tell what they were saying she was not certain that she wanted to know what they were saying her other parents stood in the kitchen doorway as she walked down the corridor smiling identical smiles and waving slowly have a nice time outside said her other mother well just wait here for you to come back said her other father when coraline got to the front door she turned back and looked at them they were still watching her and waving and smiling coraline walked outside and down the steps the house looked exactly the same from the outside or almost exactly the same around miss spink and miss forcibles door were blue and red lightbulbs that flashed on and off spelling out words the lights chasing each other around the door on and off around and around astounding was followed by a theatrical and then triumph it was a sunny cold day exactly like the one shed left there was a polite noise from behind her she turned round standing on the wall next to her was a large black cat identical to the large black cat shed seen in the grounds at home good afternoon said the cat its voice sounded like the voice at the back of coralines head the voice she thought words in but a mans voice not a girls hello said coraline i saw a cat like you in the garden at home you must be the other cat the cat shook its head no it said tm not the other anything im me it tipped its head on one side green eyes glinted you people are spread all over the place cats on the other hand keep ourselves together if you see what i mean i suppose but if youre the same cat i saw at home how can you talk cats dont have shoulders not like people do but the cat shrugged in one smooth movement that started at the tip of its tail and ended in a raised movement of its whiskers i can talk cats dont talk at home no said the cat no said coraline the cat leapt smoothly from the wall to the grass near coralines feet it stared up at her well youre the expert on these things said the cat drily after all what would i know im only a cat it began to walk away head and tail held high and proud come back said coraline please im sorry i really am the cat stopped walking and sat down and began to wash itself thoughtfully apparently unaware of coralines existence we we could be friends you know said coraline we could be rare specimens of an exotic breed of african dancing elephants said the cat but were not at least it added cattily after darting a brief look at coraline im not coraline sighed please whats your name coraline asked the cat look im coraline okay the cat yawned slowly carefully revealing a mouth and tongue of astounding pinkness cats dont have names it said no said coraline no said the cat now you people have names thats because you dont know who you are we know who we are so we dont need names there was something irritatingly selfcentred about the cat coraline decided as if it were in its opinion the only thing in any world or place that could possibly be of any importance half of her wanted to be very rude to it the other half of her wanted to be polite and deferential the polite half won please what is this place the cat glanced around briefly its here said the cat i can see that well how did you get here like you did i walked said the cat like this coraline watched as the cat walked slowly across the lawn it walked behind a tree but didnt come out the other side coraline went over to the tree and looked behind it the cat was gone she walked back towards the house there was another polite noise from behind her it was the cat by the by it said it was sensible of you to bring protection id hang on to it if i were you protection thats what i said said the cat and anyway it paused and stared intently at something that wasnt there then it went down into a low crouch and moved slowly forward two or three steps it seemed to be stalking an invisible mouse abruptly it turned tail and dashed for the woods it vanished among the trees coraline wondered what the cat had meant she also wondered whether cats could all talk where she came from and just chose not to or whether they could only talk when they were here wherever here was she walked down the brick steps to the misses spink and forcibles front door the blue and red lights flashed on and off the door was open just slightly she knocked on it but her first knock made the door swing open and coraline went in she was in a dark room that smelled of dust and velvet the door swung shut behind her and the room was black coraline edged forward into a small anteroom her face brushed against something soft it was cloth she reached up her hand and pushed at the cloth it parted she stood blinking on the other side of the velvet curtains in a poorly lit theatre far away at the edge of the room was a high wooden stage empty and bare a dim spotlight shining on to it from above there were seats between coraline and the stage rows and rows of seats she heard a shuffling noise and a light came towards her swinging from side to side when it was closer she saw the light was coming from a torch being carried in the mouth of a large black scottie dog its muzzle grey with age hello said coraline the dog put the torch down on the floor and looked up at her right lets see your ticket it said gruffly ticket thats what i said ticket i havent got all day you know you cant watch the show without a ticket coraline sighed i dont have a ticket she admitted another one said the dog gloomily come in here bold as anything wheres your ticket havent got one i dont know it shook its head then shrugged come on then the dog picked up the torch in its mouth and trotted off into the dark coraline followed when it got near to the front of the stage it stopped and shone the torch on to an empty seat coraline sat down and the dog wandered off as her eyes got used to the darkness she realised that the other inhabitants of the seats were also dogs there was a sudden hissing noise from behind the stage coraline decided it was the sound of a scratchy old record being put on to a record player the hissing became the noise of trumpets and miss spink and forcible came on to the stage miss spink was riding a onewheeled bicycle and juggling balls miss forcible skipped on behind her holding a basket of flowers she scattered the flower petals across the stage as she went they reached the front of the stage and miss spink leapt nimbly off the unicycle and the two old women bowed low all the dogs thumped their tails and barked enthusiastically coraline clapped politely then they unbuttoned their fluffy round coats and opened them but their coats werent all that opened their faces opened too like empty shells and out of the old empty fluffy round bodies stepped two young women they were thin and pale and quite pretty and had blackbutton eyes the new miss spink was wearing green tights and high brown boots that went most of the way up her legs the new miss forcible wore a white dress and had flowers in her long yellow hair coraline pressed back against her seat miss spink left the stage and the noise of trumpets squealed as the gramophone needle dug its way across the record and was pulled off this is my favourite bit whispered the little dog in the seat next to her the other miss forcible picked a knife out of a box on the corner of the stage is this a dagger that i see before me she asked yes shouted all the little dogs it is miss forcible curtseyed and all the dogs applauded again coraline didnt bother clapping this time miss spink came back on she slapped her thigh and all the little dogs woofed and now miss spink said miriam and i proudly present a new and exciting addendum to our theatrical exposition do i see a volunteer the little dog next to coraline nudged her with its front paw thats you it hissed coraline stood up and walked up the wooden steps to the stage can i have a big round of applause for the young volunteer asked miss spink the dogs woofed and squealed and thumped their tails on the velvet seats now coraline said miss spink whats your name coraline said coraline and we dont know each other do we coraline looked at the thin young woman with blackbutton eyes and shook her head slowly now said the other miss spink stand over here she led coraline over to a board by the side of the stage and put a balloon on top of coralines head miss spink walked over to miss forcible she blindfolded miss forcibles button eyes with a black scarf and put the knife into her hands then she turned her round three or four times and pointed her at coraline coraline held her breath and squeezed her fingers into two tight fists miss forcible threw the knife at the balloon it popped loudly and the knife stuck into the board just above coralines head and twanged there coraline breathed out the dogs went wild miss spink gave coraline a very small box of chocolates and thanked her for being such a good sport coraline went back to her seat you were very good said the little dog thank you said coraline misses forcible and spink began juggling with huge wooden clubs coraline opened the box of chocolates the little dog looked at them longingly would you like one she asked it yes please whispered the dog only not toffee ones they make me drool i thought chocolates werent very good for dogs she said remembering something miss forcible had once told her maybe where you come from whispered the little dog here its all we eat coraline couldnt see what the chocolates were in the dark she took an experimental bite of one which turned out to be coconut coraline didnt like coconut she gave it to the dog thank you said the dog youre welcome said coraline miss forcible and miss spink were doing some acting miss forcible was sitting on a stepladder and miss spink was standing at the bottom whats in a name asked miss forcible that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet have you got any more chocolates said the dog coraline gave the dog another chocolate i know not how to tell thee who i am said miss spink to miss forcible this bit finishes soon whispered the dog then they start folk dancing how long does this go on for asked coraline the theatre all the time said the dog for ever and always here said coraline keep the chocolates thank you said the dog coraline stood up see you soon said the dog bye said coraline she walked out of the theatre and back into the garden she had to blink her eyes at the daylight her other parents were waiting for her in the garden standing side by side they were smiling did you have a nice time asked her other mother it was interesting said coraline r the three of them walked back up to coralines other house together coralines other mother stroked coralines hair with her long white fingers coraline shook her head dont do that said coraline her other mother took her hand away so said her other father do you like it here i suppose said coraline its much more interesting than at home they went inside im glad you like it said coralines other mother because wed like to think that this is your home you can stay here for ever and always if you want to hmm said coraline she put her hands in her pockets and thought about it her fingertips touched the stone that the real misses spink and forcible had given her the day before the stone with the hole in it if you want to stay said her other father theres only one little thing well have to do so you can stay here for ever and always they went into the kitchen on a china plate on the kitchen table were a spool of black cotton and a long silver needle and beside them two large black buttons i dont think so said coraline oh but we want you to said her other mother we want you to stay and its just a little thing it wont hurt said her other father coraline knew that when grownups told you something wouldnt hurt it almost always did she shook her head her other mother smiled brightly and the hair on her head drifted like plants under the sea we only want whats best for you she said she put her hand on coralines shoulder coraline backed away im going now said coraline she put her hands back in her pockets her fingers closed around the stone with the hole in her other mothers hand scuttled off coralines shoulder like a frightened spider if thats what you want she said yes said coraline well see you soon though said her other father when you come back um said coraline and then well all be together as one big happy family said her other mother for ever and always coraline backed away she turned and hurried into the drawing room and pulled open the door in the corner there was no brick wall there now just darkness a nightblack underground darkness that seemed as if things in it might be moving coraline hesitated she turned back her other mother and her other father were walking towards her holding hands they were looking at her with their blackbutton eyes or at least she thought they were looking at her she couldnt be sure her other mother reached out her free hand and beckoned gently with one white finger her pale lips mouthed come back soon although she said nothing aloud coraline took a deep breath and stepped into the darkness where strange voices whispered and distant winds howled she became certain that there was something in the dark behind her something very old and very slow her heart beat so hard and so loudly she was scared it would burst out of her chest she closed her eyes against the dark eventually she bumped into something and opened her eyes startled she had bumped into an armchair in her drawing room the open doorway behind her was blocked by rough red bricks she was home coraline locked the door of the drawing room with the cold black key she went back into the kitchen and climbed on to a chair she tried to put the bunch of keys back on top of the door again she tried four or five times before she was forced to accept that she just wasnt big enough and she put them down on the counter next to the door her mother still hadnt returned from her shopping expedition coraline went to the freezer and took out the spare loaf of frozen bread in the bottom compartment she made herself some toast with jam and peanut butter she drank a glass of water she waited for her parents to come back when it began to get dark coraline microwaved herself a frozen pizza then coraline watched television she wondered why grownups gave themselves all the good programmes with all the shouting and running around in after a while she started yawning then she undressed brushed her teeth and put herself to bed in the morning she went into her parents room but their bed hadnt been slept in and they werent around she ate tinned spaghetti for breakfast for lunch she had a block of cooking chocolate and an apple the apple was yellow and slightly shrivelled but it tasted sweet and good for tea she went down to see misses spink and forcible she had three digestive biscuits a glass of limeade and a cup of weak tea the limeade was very interesting it didnt taste anything like limes it tasted bright green and vaguely chemical coraline liked it enormously she wished they had it at home how are your dear mother and father asked miss spink missing said coraline i havent seen either of them since yesterday im on my own i think ive probably become a single child family tell your mother that we found the glasgow empire press clippings we were telling her about she seemed very interested when miriam mentioned them to her shes vanished under mysterious circumstances said coraline and i believe my father has as well im afraid well be out all day tomorrow caroline lovey said miss forcible well be staying with aprils niece in royal tunbridge wells they showed coraline a photographic album with photographs of miss spinks niece in it and then coraline went home she opened her money box and walked down to the supermarket she bought two large bottles of limeade a chocolate cake and a new bag of apples and went back home and ate them for dinner she cleaned her teeth and went into her fathers office she woke up his computer and wrote a story coralines story there was a girl her name was apple she used to dance a lot she danced and danced until her feet turnd into sossajes the end she printed out the story and turned off the computer then she drew a picture of the little girl dancing underneath the words on the paper she ran herself a bath with too much bubble bath in it and the bubbles ran over the side and went all over the floor she dried herself and the floor as best she could and went to bed coraline woke up in the night she went into her parents bedroom but the bed was made and empty the glowing green numbers on the digital clock glowed am all alone in the middle of the night coraline began to cry there was no other sound in the empty flat she climbed into her parents bed and after a while she went back to sleep coraline was woken by cold paws batting her face she opened her eyes big green eyes stared back at her it was the cat hello said coraline how did you get in the cat didnt say anything coraline got out of bed she was wearing a long tshirt and pyjama bottoms have you come to tell me something the cat yawned which made its eyes flash green do you know where mummy and daddy are the cat blinked at her slowly is that a yes the cat blinked again coraline decided that that was indeed a yes will you take me to them the cat stared at her then it walked out into the hall she followed it walked the length of the corridor and stopped down at the very end where a fulllength mirror hung the mirror had been a long time before the inside of a wardrobe door it had been hanging there on the wall when they moved in and although coralines mother had spoken occasionally of replacing it with something newer she never had coraline turned on the light in the hall the mirror showed the corridor behind her that was only to be expected but also reflected in the mirror were her parents they stood awkwardly in the reflection of the hall they seemed sad and alone as coraline watched they waved to her slowly with limp hands coralines father had his arm around her mother in the mirror coralines mother and father stared at her her father opened his mouth and said something but she could hear nothing at all her mother breathed on the inside of the mirrorglass and quickly before the fog faded she wrote u qjh with the tip of her forefinger the fog on the inside of the mirror faded and so did her parents and now the mirror reflected only the corridor and coraline and the cat where are they coraline asked the cat the cat made no reply but coraline could imagine its voice dry as a dead fly on a windowsill in winter saying well where do you think they are they arent going to come back are they said coraline not under their own steam the cat blinked at her coraline took it as a yes right said coraline then i suppose there is only one thing left to do she walked into her fathers study she sat down at his desk then she picked up the telephone and opened the phone book and called the local police station police said a gruff male voice hello she said my name is coraline jones youre up a bit after your bedtime arent you young lady said the policeman possibly said coraline who was not going to be diverted but i am ringing to report a crime and what sort of crime would that be kidnapping grownupnapping really my parents have been stolen away into a world on the other side of the mirror in our hall and do you know who stole them asked the police officer coraline could hear the smile in his voice and she tried extra hard to sound like an adult might sound to make him take her seriously i think my other mother has them both in her clutches she may want to keep them and sew their eyes with black buttons or she may simply have them in order to lure me back into reach of her fingers im not sure ah the nefarious clutches of her fiendish fingers is it he said mm you know what i suggest miss jones no said coraline what you ask your mother to make you a big old mug of hot chocolate and then give you a great big old hug theres nothing like hot chocolate and a hug for making the nightmares go away and if she starts to tell you off for waking her up at this time of night why you tell her that thats what the policeman said he had a deep reassuring voice coraline was not reassured when i see her said coraline i shall tell her that and she put down the telephone the black cat who had sat on the floor grooming its fur through this entire conversation now stood up and led the way into the hall coraline went back into her bedroom and put on her blue dressing gown and her slippers she looked under the sink for a torch and found one but the batteries had long since run down and it barely glowed with the faintest strawcoloured light she put it down again and found a box of incaseofemergency white wax candles and thrust one into a candlestick she put an apple into each pocket she picked up the ring of keys and took the old black key off the ring she walked into the drawing room and looked at the door she had the feeling that the door was looking back at her which she knew was silly and knew on a deeper level was somehow true she went back into her bedroom and rummaged in the pocket of her jeans she found the stone with the hole in it and put it into her dressinggown pocket she lit the candle wick with a match and watched it sputter and light then she picked up the black key it was cold in her hand she put the key into the keyhole in the door but did not turn it when i was a little girl said coraline to the cat when we lived in our old house a long long time ago my dad took me for a walk on the wasteland between our house and the shops it wasnt the best place to go for a walk really there were all these things that people had thrown away back there old cookers and broken dishes and dolls with no arms and no legs and empty cans and broken bottles mum and dad made me promise not to go exploring back there because there were too many sharp things and tetanus and such but i kept telling them i wanted to explore it so one day my dad put on his big brown boots and his gloves and put my boots on me and my jeans and sweater and we went for a walk we must have walked for about twenty minutes we went down this hill to the bottom of a gully where a stream was when my dad suddenly said to me coraline run away up the hill now he said it in a tight sort of way urgently so i did i ran away up the hill something hurt me on the back of my arm as i ran but i kept running as i got to the top of the hill i heard somebody thundering up the hill behind me it was my dad charging like a rhino when he reached me he picked me up in his arms and swept me over the edge of the hill and then we stopped and we puffed and we panted and we looked back down the gully the air was alive with yellow wasps we must have stepped on a wasps nest in a rotten branch as we walked and while i was running up the hill my dad stayed and got stung to give me time to run away his glasses had fallen off when he ran i only had the one sting on the back of my arm he had thirtynine stings all over him we counted later in the bath the black cat began to wash its face and whiskers in a manner that indicated increasing impatience coraline reached down and stroked the back of its head and neck the cat stood up walked several paces until it was out of her reach then it sat down and looked up at her again so said coraline later that afternoon my dad went back again to the wasteland to get his glasses back he said if he left it another day he wouldnt be able to remember where theyd fallen and soon he got home wearing his glasses he said that he wasnt scared when he was standing there and the wasps were stinging him and hurting him and he was watching me run away because he knew he had to give me enough time to run or the wasps would have come after both of us coraline turned the key in the door it turned with a loud clunk the door swung open there was no brick wall on the other side of the door only darkness a cold wind blew through the passageway coraline made no move to walk through the door and he said that wasnt brave of him doing that just standing there and being stung said coraline to the cat it wasnt brave because he wasnt scared it was the only thing he could do but going back again to get his glasses when he knew the wasps were there when he was really scared that was brave she took her first step down the dark corridor she could smell dust and damp and mustiness the cat padded along beside her and why was that asked the cat although it sounded barely interested because she said when youre scared but you still do it anyway thats brave the candle cast huge strange flickering shadows along the wall she heard something moving in the darkness beside her or to one side of her she could not tell it seemed as if it was keeping pace with her whatever it was and thats why youre going back to her world then said the cat because your father once saved you from wasps dont be silly said coraline im going back for them because they are my parents and if they noticed i was gone im sure they would do the same for me you know youre talking again how fortunate i am said the cat in having a travelling companion of such wisdom and intelligence its tone remained sarcastic but its fur was bristling and its brush of a tail stuck up in the air coraline was going to say something like sorry or wasn t it a lot shorter walk last time when the candle went out as suddenly as if it had been snuffed by someones hand there was a scrabbling and a pattering and coraline could feel her heart pounding against her ribs she put out one hand and felt something wispy like a spiders web brush her hands and her face at the end of the corridor the electric light went on blinding after the darkness a woman stood silhouetted by the light a little ahead of coraline coraline darling she called mum said coraline and she ran forward eager and relieved darling said the woman why did you ever run away from me coraline was too close to stop and she felt the other mothers cold arms enfold her she stood there rigid and trembling as the other mother held her tightly where are my parents coraline asked were here said her other mother in a voice so close to her real mothers that coraline could scarcely tell them apart were here were ready to love you and play with you and feed you and make your life interesting coraline pulled back and the other mother let her go with reluctance the other father who had been sitting on a chair in the hallway stood up and smiled come on into the kitchen he said til make us a midnight snack and youll want something to drink hot chocolate perhaps coraline walked down the hallway until she reached the mirror at the end there was nothing reflected in it but a young girl in her dressing gown and slippers who looked like she had recently been crying but whose eyes were real eyes not black buttons and who was holding tightly to a burnedout candle in a candlestick she looked at the girl in the mirror and the girl in the mirror looked back at her i will be brave thought coraline no i am brave she put down the candlestick on the floor then she turned round the other mother and the other father were looking at her hungrily i dont need a snack she said i have an apple see and she took an apple from her dressinggown pocket then bit into it with relish and an enthusiasm that she did not really feel the other father looked disappointed the other mother smiled showing a full set of teeth and each of the teeth was a tiny bit too long the lights in the hallway made her blackbutton eyes glitter and gleam you dont frighten me said coraline although they did frighten her very much i want my parents back the world seemed to shimmer a little at the edges whatever would i have done with your old parents if they have left you coraline it must be because they became bored with you or tired now i will never become bored with you and i will never abandon you you will always be safe here with me the other mothers wetlooking black hair drifted around her head like the tentacles of a creature in the deep ocean they werent bored of me said coraline youre lying you stole them silly silly coraline they are fine wherever they are coraline simply glared at the other mother til prove it said the other mother and brushed the surface of the mirror with her long white fingers it clouded over as if a dragon had breathed on it and then it cleared in the mirror it was daytime already coraline was looking at the hallway all the way down to her front door the door opened from the outside and coralines mother and father walked inside they carried suitcases that was a fine holiday said coralines father how nice it is not to have coraline any more said her mother with a happy smile now we can do all the things we always wanted to do like go abroad but were prevented from doing by having a little daughter and said her father i take great comfort in knowing that her other mother will take better care of her than we ever could the mirror fogged and faded and reflected the night once more see said her other mother no said coraline i dont see and i dont believe it either she hoped that what she had just seen was not real but she was not as certain as she sounded there was a tiny doubt inside her like a maggot in an apple core then she looked up and saw the expression on her other mothers face a flash of real anger which crossed her face like summer lightning and coraline was sure in her heart that what she had seen in the mirror was no more than an illusion coraline sat down on the sofa and ate her apple please said her other mother dont be difficult she walked into the drawing room and clapped her hands twice there was a rustling noise and a black rat appeared it stared up at her bring me the key she said the rat chittered then it ran through the open door that led back to coralines own flat the rat returned dragging the key behind it why dont you have your own key on this side asked coraline there is only one key only one door said the other father hush said the other mother you must not bother our darling coralines head with such trivialities she put the key in the keyhole and twisted the lock was stiff but it clunked closed she dropped the key into her apron pocket outside the sky had begun to lighten to a luminous grey if we arent going to have a midnight snack said the other mother we still need our beauty sleep i am going back to bed coraline i would strongly suggest that you do the same she placed her long white fingers on the shoulders of the other father and she walked him out of the room coraline walked over to the door at the far corner of the drawing room she tugged on it but it was tightly locked the door of her other parents bedroom was now closed she was indeed tired but she did not want to sleep in the bedroom she did not want to sleep under the same roof as her other mother the front door was not locked coraline walked out into the dawn and down the stone steps she sat down on the bottom step it was cold something furry pushed itself against her side in one smooth insinuating motion coraline jumped then breathed a sigh of relief when she saw what it was oh its you she said to the black cat see said the cat it wasnt so hard recognising me was it even without names well what if i wanted to call you the cat wrinkled its nose and managed to look unimpressed calling cats it confided tends to be a rather overrated activity might as well call a whirlwind what if it was dinnertime asked coraline wouldnt you want to be called then of course said the cat but a simple cry of dinner would do nicely see no need for names why does she want me coraline asked the cat why does she want me to stay here with her she wants something to love i think said the cat something that isnt her she might want something to eat as well its hard to tell with creatures like that do you have any advice asked coraline the cat looked as if it were about to say something else sarcastic then it flicked its whiskers and said challenge her theres no guarantee shell play fair but her kind of thing loves games and challenges what kind of thing is that asked coraline but the cat made no answer simply stretched luxuriantly and walked away then it stopped and turned and said td go inside if i were you get some sleep you have a long day ahead of you and then the cat was gone still coraline realised it had a point she crept back into the silent house past the closed bedroom door beyond which the other mother and the other father what she wondered slept waited and then it came to her that should she open the bedroom door she would find it empty or more precisely that it was an empty room and it would remain empty until the exact moment that she opened the door somehow that made it easier coraline walked into the green and pink parody of her own bedroom she closed the door and hauled the toybox in front of it it would not keep anyone out but the noise somebody would make trying to dislodge it would wake her she hoped the toys in the toybox were still mostly asleep and they stirred and muttered as she moved their box and then they went back to sleep coraline checked under her bed looking for rats but there was nothing there she took off her dressing gown and slippers and climbed into bed and fell asleep with barely enough time to reflect as she did so on what the cat could have meant by a challenge coraline was woken by the midmorning sun full on her face for a moment she felt utterly dislocated she did not know where she was she was not entirely sure who she was it is astonishing just how much of what we are can be tied to the beds we wake up in in the morning and it is astonishing how fragile that can be sometimes coraline would forget who she was while she was daydreaming that she was exploring the arctic or the amazon rainforest or darkest africa and it was not until someone tapped her on the shoulder or said her name that coraline would come back from a million miles away with a start and all in a fraction of a second have to remember who she was and what her name was and that she was even there at all now there was sun on her face and she was coraline jones yes and then the green and pinkness of the room she was in and the rustling of a large painted paper butterfly as it fluttered and beat its way about the ceiling told her where she had woken up she climbed out of the bed she could not wear her pyjamas dressing gown and slippers during the day she decided even if it meant wearing the other coralines clothes there were no proper clothes in the cupboard though they were more like dressingup clothes or the kind of clothes she would love to have hanging in her own wardrobe at home there was a raggedy witch costume a patched scarecrow costume a futurewarrior costume with little digital lights on it that glittered and blinked a slinky evening dress all covered in feathers and mirrors finally in a drawer she found a pair of black jeans that seemed to be made of velvet night and a grey sweater the colour of thick smoke with faint and tiny stars in the fabric which twinkled she pulled on the jeans and the sweater then she put on a pair of brightorange boots she found at the bottom of the cupboard she took her last apple out of the pocket of her dressing gown and then from the same pocket the stone with the hole in it she put the stone into the pocket of her jeans and it was as if her head had cleared a little as if she had come out of some sort of a fog she went into the kitchen but it was deserted still she was sure that there was someone in the flat she walked down the hall until she reached her fathers study and discovered that it was occupied wheres the other mother she asked the other father he was sitting in the study at a desk which looked just like her fathers but he was not doing anything at all not even reading gardening catalogues as her own father did when he was only pretending to be working out he told her fixing the doors there are some vermin problems he seemed pleased to have somebody to talk to the rats you mean no the rats are our friends this is the other kind big black fellow with his tail high the cat you mean thats the one said her other father he looked less like her true father today there was something slightly vague about his face like bread dough that had begun to rise smoothing out the bumps and cracks and depressions really i mustnt talk to you when shes not here he said but dont you worry she wont be gone often i shall demonstrate our tender hospitality to you such that you will not even think about ever going back he closed his mouth and folded his hands in his lap so what am i to do now asked coraline the other father pointed to his lips silence if you wont even talk to me said coraline i am going exploring no point said the other father there isnt anywhere but here this is all she made the house the grounds and the people in the house she made it and she waited then he looked embarrassed and he put one finger to his lips again as if he had just said too much coraline walked out of his study she went into the drawing room over to the old door and she pulled it rattled and shook it no it was locked fast and the other mother had the key she looked around the room it was so familiar that was what made it feel so truly strange everything was exactly the same as she remembered there was all her grandmothers strangesmelling furniture there was the painting of the bowl of fruit hanging on the wall there was the low wooden table with the lions feet and the empty fireplace which seemed to suck heat from the room but there was something else something she did not remember seeing before a ball of glass up on the mantelpiece she went over to the fireplace went up on tiptoes and lifted it down it was a snowglobe with two little people in it coraline shook it and set the snow flying white snow that glittered as it tumbled through the water then she put the snowglobe back on the mantelpiece and carried on looking for her true parents and for a way out she went out of the flat past the flashinglights door behind which the other misses spink and forcible performed their show for ever and set off into the woods where coraline came from once you were through the patch of trees you saw nothing but the meadow and the old tennis court in this place the woods went on further the trees becoming cruder and less treelike the further you went pretty soon they seemed very approximate like the idea of trees a greyishbrown trunk below a greenish splodge of something that might have been leaves above coraline wondered if the other mother wasnt interested in trees or if she just hadnt bothered with this bit properly because nobody was expected to come out this far she kept walking and then the mist began it was not damp like a normal fog or mist it was not cold and it was not warm it felt to coraline like she was walking into nothing im an explorer thought coraline to herself and i need all the ways out of here that i can get so i shall keep walking the world she was walking through was a pale nothingness like a blank sheet of paper or an enormous empty white room it had no temperature no smell no texture and no taste it certainly isnt mist thought coraline although she did not know what it was for a moment she wondered if she might have gone blind but no she could see herself plain as day there was no ground beneath her feet just a misty milky whiteness and what do you think youre doing said a shape to one side of her it took a few moments for her eyes to focus on it properly she thought it might be some kind of lion at first some distance away from her and then she thought it might be a mouse close beside her and then she knew what it was tm exploring coraline told the cat its fur stood straight out from its body and its eyes were wide while its tail was down and between its legs it did not look a happy cat bad place said the cat if you want to call it a place which i dont what are you doing here tm exploring nothing to find here said the cat this is just the outside the part of the place she hasnt bothered to create she the one who says shes your other mother said the cat what is she asked coraline the cat did not answer just padded through the pale mist beside coraline something began to appear in front of them something high and towering and dark you were wrong she told the cat there is something there and then it took shape in the mist a dark house which loomed at them out of the formless whiteness but thats said coraline the house you just left agreed the cat precisely maybe i just got turned around in the mist said coraline the cat curled the high tip of its tail into a question mark and tipped its head on to one side you might have done it said certainly would not wrong indeed but how can you walk away from something and still come back to it easy said the cat think of somebody walking around the world you start out walking away from something and end up coming back to it small world said coraline its big enough for her said the cat spiders webs only have to be large enough to catch flies coraline shivered he said that shes fixing all the gates and the doors she told the cat to keep you out she may try said the cat unimpressed oh yes she may try they were standing under a clump of trees now beside the house these trees looked much more likely theres ways in and ways out of places like this that even she doesnt know about did she make this place then asked coraline made it found it whats the difference asked the cat either way shes had it a very long time hang on and it gave a shiver and a leap and before coraline could blink the cat was sitting with its paw holding down a big black rat its not that i like rats at the best of times said the cat conversationally as if nothing had happened but the rats in this place are all spies for her she uses them as her eyes and hands and with that the cat let the rat go it ran for almost a metre and then the cat with one bound was upon it batting it hard with one sharpclawed paw while holding it down with the other i love this bit said the cat happily want to see me do that again no said coraline why do you do it youre torturing it mm said the cat it let the rat go the rat stumbled dazed for a few steps then it began to run with a blow of its paw the cat knocked the rat into the air and caught it in its mouth stop it said coraline the cat dropped the rat between its two front paws there are those it said with a sigh in tones as smooth as oiled silk who have suggested that the tendency of a cat to play with its prey is a merciful one after all it permits the occasional funny little running snack to escape from time to time how often does your dinner get to escape and then it picked the rat up in its mouth and carried it off into the woods behind a tree coraline walked back into the house all was quiet and empty and deserted even her footsteps on the carpeted floor seemed loud dust motes hung in a beam of sunlight at the far end of the hall was the mirror she could see herself walking towards the mirror looking reflected a little braver than she actually felt there was nothing else there in the mirror just her in the corridor a hand touched her shoulder and she looked up the other mother stared down at coraline with big blackbutton eyes coraline my darling she said i thought we could play some games together this morning now youre back from your walk hopscotch monopoly happy families you werent in the mirror said coraline the other mother smiled mirrors she said are never to be trusted now what game shall we play coraline shook her head i dont want to play with you she said i want to go home and be with my real parents i want you to let them go to let us all go the other mother shook her head very slowly sharper than a serpents tooth she said is a daughters ingratitude still the proudest spirit can be broken with love and her long white fingers waggled and caressed the air i have no plans to love you said coraline no matter what you cant make me love you lets talk about it said the other mother and she turned and walked into the sitting room coraline followed her the other mother sat down on the big sofa she picked up a brown handbag from beside the sofa and took out a white rustling paper bag from inside it she extended the hand with the paper bag in it to coraline would you like one she asked politely expecting it to be a toffee or a butterscotch ball coraline looked down the bag was halffilled with large shiny blackbeetles crawling over each other in their efforts to get out of the bag no said coraline i dont want one suit yourself said her other mother she carefully picked out a particularly large and black beetle pulled off its legs and popped the beetle into her mouth she crunched it happily yum she said and took another youre sick said coraline sick and evil and weird is that any way to talk to your mother her other mother asked with her mouth full of blackbeetles you arent my mother said coraline her other mother ignored this now i think you are a little overexcited coraline perhaps this afternoon we could do a little embroidery together or some watercolour painting then dinner and then if you have been good you may play with the rats a little before bed and i shall read you a story and tuck you in and kiss you goodnight her long white fingers fluttered gently like a tired butterfly and coraline shivered no said coraline the other mother sat on the sofa her mouth was set in a line her lips were pursed she popped another blackbeetle into her mouth and then another like someone with a bag of chocolatecovered raisins her big blackbutton eyes looked into coralines hazel eyes her shiny black hair twined and twisted about her neck and shoulders as if it were blowing in some wind that coraline could not touch or feel they stared at each other for over a minute then the other mother said manners she folded the white paper bag carefully so no blackbeetles could escape and she placed it back in the shopping bag then she stood up and up and up she seemed taller than coraline remembered she reached into her apron pocket and pulled out first the black door key which she frowned at and tossed into her handbag then a tiny silvercoloured key she held it up triumphantly there we are she said this is for you coraline for your own good because i love you to teach you manners manners makyth man after all she pulled coraline back into the hallway and advanced upon the mirror at the end of the hall then she pushed the tiny key into the fabric of the mirror and she twisted it the mirror opened like a door revealing a dark space behind it you may come out when youve learned some manners said the other mother and when youre ready to be a loving daughter she picked coraline up and pushed her into the dim space behind the mirror a fragment of beetle was sticking to her lower lip and there was no expression at all in her blackbutton eyes then she swung the mirrordoor closed and left coraline in darkness somewhere inside her coraline could feel a huge sob welling up and then she stopped it before it came out she took a deep breath and let it go she put out her hands to touch the space in which she was imprisoned it was the size of a broom cupboard tall enough to stand in or to sit in not wide or deep enough to lie down in one wall was glass and it felt cold to the touch she went around the tiny room a second time running her hands over every surface that she could reach feeling for doorknobs or switches or concealed catches some kind of way out and found nothing a spider scuttled over the back of her hand and she choked back a shriek but apart from the spider she was alone in the cupboard in the pitch dark and then her hand touched something that felt for all the world like somebodys cheek and lips small and cold and a voice whispered in her ear hush and shush say nothing for the beldam might be listen ing coraline said nothing she felt a cold hand touch her face fingers running over it like the gentle beat of a moths wings another voice hesitant and so faint coraline wondered if she were imagining it said art thou art thou alive yes whispered coraline poor child said the first voice who are you whispered coraline names names names said another voice all faraway and lost the names are the first things to go after the breath has gone and the beating of the heart we keep our memories longer than our names i still keep pictures in my mind of my governess on some may morning carrying my hoop and stick and the morning sun behind her and all the tulips bobbing in the breeze but i have forgotten the name of my governess and of the tulips too i dont think tulips have names said coraline theyre just tulips perhaps said the voice sadly but i have always thought that these tulips must have had names they were red and orangeandred and redandorangeandyellow like the embers in the nursery fire of a winters evening i remember them the voice sounded so sad that coraline put out a hand to the place where it was coming from and she found a cold hand and she squeezed it tightly her eyes were beginning to get used to the darkness now coraline saw or imagined she saw three shapes each as faint and pale as a moon in the daytime sky they were the shapes of children about her own size the cold hand squeezed her hand back thank you said the voicec are you a girl asked coraline or a boy there was a pause when i was small i wore skirts and my hair was long and curled it said doubtfully but now that you ask it does seem to me that one day they took my skirts and gave me britches and cut my hair taint something we give a mind to said the first of the voices a boy perhaps then continued the one whose hand she was holding i believe i was once a boy and it glowed a little more brightly in the darkness of the room behind the mirror what happened to you all asked coraline how did you come here she left us here said one of the voices she stole our hearts and she stole our souls and she took our lives away and she left us here and she forgot about us in the dark you poor things said coraline how long have you been here so very long a time said a voice aye time beyond reckoning said another voice i walked through the scullery door said the voice of the one that thought it might be a boy and i found myself back in the parlour but she was waiting for me she told me she was my other mamma but i never saw my true mamma again flee said the very first of the voices another girl coraline fancied flee while theres still air in your lungs and blood in your veins and warmth in your heart flee while you still have your mind and your soul im not running away said coraline she has my parents i came to get them back ah but shell keep you here while the days turn to dust and the leaves fall and the years pass one after the next like the ticktickticking of a clock no said coraline she wont there was silence then in the room behind the mirror peradventure said a voice in the darkness if you could win your mama and your papa back from the beldam you could also win free our souls has she taken them asked coraline shocked aye and hidden them that is why we could not leave here when we died she kept us and she fed on us until now were nothing left of ourselves only snakeskins and spiderhusks find our secret hearts young mistress and what will happen to you if i do asked coraline the voices said nothing and what is she going to do to me she said the pale figures pulsed faintly she could imagine that they were nothing more than afterimages like the glow left by a bright light in your eyes after the lights go out it doth not hurt whispered one faint voice she will take your life and all you are and all you carest for and she will leave you with nothing but mist and fog shell take your joy and one day youll awake and your heart and your soul will have gone a husk youll be a wisp youll be and a thing no more than a dream on waking or a memory of something forgotten hollow whispered the third voice hollow hollow hollow hollow hollow you must flee sighed a voice faintly i dont think so said coraline i tried running away and it didnt work she just took my parents can you tell me how to get out of this room if we knew then we would tell you poor things said coraline to herself she sat down she took off her sweater and rolled it up and put it behind her head as a pillow she wont keep me in the dark for ever said coraline she brought me here to play games games and challenges the cat said im not much of a challenge here in the dark she tried to get comfortable twisting and bending herself to fit the cramped space behind the mirror her stomach rumbled she ate her last apple taking the tiniest bites making it last as long as she could when she had finished she was still hungry then an idea struck her and she whispered when she comes to let me out why dont you three come with me we wish that we could they sighed to her in their barelythere voices but she has our hearts in her keeping now we belong to the dark and to the empty places the light would shrivel us and burn oh said coraline she closed her eyes which made the darkness darker and she rested her head on the rolledup sweater and she went to sleep and as she fell asleep she thought she felt a ghost kiss her cheek tenderly and a small voice whisper into her ear a voice so faint it was barely there at all a gentle wispy nothing of a voice so hushed that coraline could almost believe she was imagining it look through the stone it said to her and then she slept the other mother looked healthier than before there was a little blush to her cheeks and her hair was wriggling like lazy snakes on a warm day her blackbutton eyes seemed as if they had been freshly polished she had pushed through the mirror as if she were walking through nothing more solid than water and had stared down at coraline then she had opened the door with the little silver key she picked coraline up just as coralines real mother had when coraline was much younger cradling the halfsleeping child as if she were a baby the other mother carried coraline into the kitchen and put her down very gently upon the countertop coraline struggled to wake herself up conscious only for the moment of having been cuddled and loved and wanting more of it then realising where she was and who she was with there my sweet coraline said her other mother i came and fetched you out of the cupboard you needed to be taught a lesson but we temper our justice with mercy here we love the sinner and we hate the sin now if you will be a good child who loves her mother be compliant and fairspoken you and i shall understand each other perfectly and we shall love each other perfectly as well coraline scratched the sleepgrit from her eyes there were other children in there she said old ones from a long time ago were there said the other mother she was bustling between the pans and the fridge bringing out eggs and cheeses butter and a slab of sliced pink bacon yes said coraline there were i think youre planning to turn me into one of them a dead shell her other mother smiled gently with one hand she cracked the eggs into a bowl with the other she whisked them and whirled them then she dropped a pat of butter into a frying pan where it hissed and fizzled and spun as she sliced thin slices of cheese she poured the melted butter and the cheese into the egg mixture and whisked it some more now i think youre being silly dear said the other mother i love you i will always love you nobody sensible believes in ghosts anyway thats because theyre all such liars smell the lovely breakfast im making for you she poured the yellow mixture into the pan cheese omelette your favourite coralines mouth watered you like games she said thats what ive been told the other mothers black eyes flashed everybody likes games was all she said yes said coraline she climbed down from the counter and sat at the kitchen table the bacon was sizzling and spitting under the grill it smelled wonderful wouldnt you be happier if you won me fair and square asked coraline possibly said the other mother she had a show of unconcernedness but her fingers twitched and drummed and she licked her lips with her scarlet tongue what exactly are you offering me said coraline and she gripped her knees under the table to stop them from shaking if i lose ill stay here with you for ever and ill let you love me ill be a most dutiful daughter ill eat your food and play happy families and ill let you sew your buttons into my eyes her other mother stared at her black buttons unblinking that sounds very fine she said and if you do not lose then you let me go you let everyone go my real father and mother the dead children everyone youve trapped here the other mother took the bacon from under the grill and put it on a plate then she slipped the cheese omelette from the pan on to the plate flipping it as she did so letting it fold itself into a perfect omelette shape she placed the breakfast plate in front of coraline along with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and a mug of frothy hot chocolate yes she said i think i like this game but what kind of game shall it be a riddle game a test of knowledge or of skill an exploring game suggested coraline a findingthings game and what is it you think you should be finding in this hideandgoseek game coraline jones coraline hesitated then my parents said coraline and the souls of the children behind the mirror the other mother smiled at this triumphantly and coraline wondered if she had made the right choice still it was too late to change her mind now a deal said the other mother now eat up your breakfast my sweet dont worry it wont hurt you coraline stared at the breakfast hating herself for giving in so easily but she was starving how do i know youll keep your word asked coraline i swear it said the other mother i swear it on my own mothers grave does she have a grave asked coraline oh yes said the other mother i put her in there myself and when i found her trying to crawl out i put her back swear on something else so i can trust you to keep your word my right hand said the other mother holding it up she waggled the long fingers slowly displaying the clawlike nails i swear on that coraline shrugged okay she said its a deal she ate the breakfast trying not to wolf it down she was hungrier than she had thought as she ate the other mother stared at her it was hard to read expressions into those blackbutton eyes but coraline thought that her other mother looked hungry too she drank the orange juice but even though she knew she would like it she could not bring herself to taste the hot chocolate where should i start looking asked coraline where you wish said her other mother as if she did not care at all coraline looked at her and coraline thought hard there was no point she decided in exploring the garden and the grounds they didnt exist they werent real there was no abandoned tennis court in the other mothers world no bottomless well all that was real was the house itself she looked around the kitchen she opened the oven peered into the freezer poked into the salad compartment of the fridge the other mother followed her about looking at coraline with a smirk always hovering at the edge of her lips how big are souls anyway asked coraline the other mother sat down at the kitchen table and leaned back against the wall saying nothing she picked at her teeth with a long crimsonvarnished fingernail then she tapped the finger gently taptaptap against the polished black surface of her blackbutton eyes fine said coraline dont tell me i dont care it doesnt matter if you help me or not everyone knows that a soul is the same size as a beach ball she was hoping the other mother would say something like nonsense theyre the size of ripe onions or suitcases or grandfather clocks but the other mother simply smiled and the taptaptapping of her fingernail against her eye was as steady and relentless as the drip of water droplets from the tap into the sink and then coraline realised it was simply the noise of the water and she was alone in the room coraline shivered she preferred the other mother to have a location if she were nowhere then she could be anywhere and after all it is always easier to be afraid of something you cannot see she put her hands into her pockets and her fingers closed around the reassuring shape of the stone with the hole in it she pulled it out of her pocket held it in front of her as if she were holding a gun and walked out into the hall there was no sound but the taptap of the water dripping into the metal sink she glanced at the mirror at the end of the hall for a moment it clouded over and it seemed to her that faces swam in the glass indistinct and shapeless and then the faces were gone and there was nothing in the mirror but a girl who wassmall for her age holding something that glowed gently like a green coal coraline looked down at her hand surprised it was just a pebble with a hole in it a nondescript brown stone then she looked back into the mirror where the stone glimmered like an emerald a trail of green fire blew from the stone in the mirror and drifted towards coralines bedroom hmm said coraline she walked into the bedroom the toys fluttered excitedly as she came in as if they were pleased to see her and a little tank rolled out of the toybox to greet her its treads rolling over several other toys it fell from the toybox on to the floor tipping as it fell and it lay on the carpet like a beetle on its back grumbling and grinding its treads before coraline picked it up and turned it over the tank fled under the bed in embarrassment coraline looked around the room she looked in the cupboards and the drawers then she picked up one end of the toybox and tipped all the toys in it out on to the carpet where they grumbled and stretched and wiggled awkwardly free of each other a grey marble rolled across the floor and clicked against the wall none of the toys looked particularly soullike she thought she picked up and examined a silver charmbracelet from which hung tiny animal charms which chased each other around the perimeter of the bracelet the fox never catching the rabbit the bear never gaining on the fox coraline opened her hand and looked at the stone with the hole in it hoping for a clue but not finding one most of the toys that had been in the toybox had now crawled away to hide under the bed and the few toys that were left were the kind of things you find in the bottoms of toyboxes in the real world forgotten objects abandoned and unloved she was about to leave and look elsewhere and then she remembered a voice in the darkness a gentle whispering voice and what it had told her to do she raised the stone with the hole in it and held it in front of her right eye she closed her left eye and looked at the room through the hole in the stone through the stone the world was grey and colourless like a pencil drawing everything in it was grey no not quite everything something glinted on the floor something the colour of an ember in a nursery fireplace the colour of a scarletandorange tulip nodding in the may sun coraline reached out her left hand scared that if she took her eye off it it would vanish and she fumbled for the burning thing her fingers closed about something smooth and cool she snatched it up and then lowered the stone with the hole in it from her eye and looked down the grey glass marble from the bottom of the toybox sat dully in the pink palm of her hand she raised the stone to her eye once more and looked through it at the marble once again the marble burned and flickered with a red fire a voice whispered in her mind indeed lady it comes to me that i certainly was a boy now i do think on it oh but you must hurry there are two of us still to find and the beldam is already angry with you for uncovering me if im going to do this thought coraline im not going to do it in her clothes she changed back into her pyjamas and her dressing gown and her slippers leaving the grey sweater and the black jeans neatly folded up on the bed the orange boots on the floor by the toy box she put the marble into her dressinggown pocket and walked out into the hall something stung her face and hands like sand blowing on a beach on a windy day she covered her eyes and pushed forward the sandstings got worse and it got harder and harder to walk as if she were pushing into the wind on a particularly blustery day it was a vicious wind and a cold one she took a step backwards the way she had come oh keep going whispered a ghostvoice in her ear for the beldam is angry she stepped forward in the hallway into another gust of wind which stung her cheeks and face with invisible sand sharp as needles sharp as glass play fair shouted coraline into the wind there was no reply but the wind whipped about her one more time petulantly and then it dropped away and was gone as she passed the kitchen coraline could hear in the sudden silence the dripdrip of the water from the leaking tap or perhaps the other mothers long fingernails tapping impatiently against the table coraline resisted the urge to look in a couple of strides she reached the front door and she walked outside coraline went down the steps and around the house until she reached the other miss spink and miss forcibles flat the lamps around the door were flickering on and off almost randomly now spelling out no words that coraline could understand the door was closed she was afraid it was locked and she pushed on it with all her strength first it stuck then suddenly it gave and with a jerk coraline stumbled into the dark room beyond coraline closed one hand around the stone with the hole in it and walked forward into blackness she expected to find a curtained anteroom but there was nothing there the room was dark the theatre was empty she moved ahead cautiously something rustled above her she looked up into a deeper darkness and as she did so her feet knocked against something she reached down picked up a torch and clicked it on sweeping the beam around the room the theatre was derelict and abandoned chairs were broken on the floor and old dusty spiders webs draped the walls and hung from the rotten wood and the decomposing velvet hangings something rustled once again coraline directed her light beam upwards towards the ceiling there were things up there hairless jellyish she thought they might once have had faces might even once have been dogs but no dogs had wings like bats or could hang like spiders like bats upsidedown the light startled the creatures and one of them took to the air its wings whirring heavily through the dust coraline ducked as it swooped close to her it came to rest on a far wall and it began to clamber upsidedown back to the nest of the dogbats upon the ceiling coraline raised the stone to her eye and she scanned the room through it looking for something that glowed or glinted a telltale sign that somewhere in this room was another hidden soul she ran the beam of the torch about the room as she searched the thick dust in the air making the light beam seem almost solid there was something up on the back wall behind the ruined stage it was greyishwhite twice the size of coraline herself and it was stuck to the back wall like a slug coraline took a deep breath tm not afraid she told herself tm not she did not believe herself but she scrambled on to the old stage fingers sinking into the rotting wood as she pulled herself up as she got closer to the thing on the wall she saw that it was some kind of a sac like a spiders eggcase it twitched in the light beam inside the sac was something that looked like a person but a person with two heads with twice as many arms and legs as it should have the creature in the sac seemed horribly unformed and unfinished as if two plasticine people had been warmed and rolled together squashed and pressed into one thing coraline hesitated she did not want to approach the thing the dogbats dropped one by one from the ceiling and began to circle the room coming close to her but never touching her perhaps there are no souls hidden in here she thought perhaps i can just leave and go somewhere else she took a last look through the hole in the stone the abandoned theatre was still a bleak grey but now there was a brown glow as rich and bright as polished cherrywood coming from inside the sac whatever was glowing was being held in one of the hands of the thing on the wall coraline walked slowly across the damp stage trying to make as little noise as she could afraid that if she disturbed the thing in the sac it would open its eyes and see her and then but there was nothing that she could think of that was as scary as having it look at her her heart pounded in her chest she took another step forward she had never been so scared but still she walked forward until she reached the sac then she pushed her hand into the sticky clinging whiteness of the stuff on the wall it crackled softly like a tiny fire as she pushed and it clung to her skin and clothes like a spiders web clings like white candyfloss she pushed her hand into it and she reached upward until she touched a cold hand which was she could feel closed around another glass marble the creatures skin felt slippery as if it had been covered in jelly coraline tugged at the marble at first nothing happened it was held tight in the creatures grasp then one by one the fingers loosened their grip and the marble slipped into her hand she pulled her arm back through the sticky webbing relieved that the things eyes had not opened she shone the light on its faces they resembled she decided the younger versions of miss spink and miss forcible but twisted and squeezed together like two lumps of wax that had melted and melded together into one ghastly object without warning one of the creatures hands made a grab for coralines arm its fingernails scraped her skin but it was too slippery to grip and coraline pulled away successfully and then the eyes opened four black buttons glinting and staring down at her and two voices that sounded like no voice that coraline had ever heard began to speak to her one of them wailed and whispered the other buzzed like a fat and angry bluebottle at a windowpane but the voices said as one person thief give it back stop thief the air became alive with dogbats coraline began to back away she realised then that terrifying though the thing on the wall was the thing that had once been the other misses spink and forcible it was attached to the wall by its web encased in its cocoon it could not follow her the dogbats flapped and fluttered about her but they did nothing to hurt coraline she climbed down from the stage and shone the torch about the old theatre looking for the way out flee miss wailed a girls voice in her head flee now you have two of us flee this place while your blood still flows coraline dropped the marble into her pocket beside the other she spotted the door ran to it and pulled on it until it opened outside the world had become a formless swirling mist with no shapes or shadows behind it while the house itself seemed to have twisted and stretched it appeared to coraline that it was crouching and staring down at her as if it were not really a house but only the idea of a house and the person who had had the idea she was certain was not a good person there was sticky webstuff clinging to her arm and she wiped it off as best she could the grey windows of the house slanted at strange angles the other mother was waiting for her standing on the grass with her arms folded her blackbutton eyes were expressionless but her lips were pressed tightly together in a cold fury when she saw coraline she reached out one long white hand and she crooked a finger coraline walked towards her the other mother said nothing tve found two said coraline one soul still to go the expression on the other mothers face did not change she might not have heard what coraline said well i just thought youd want to know said coraline thank you coraline said the other mother coldly and her voice did not just come from her mouth it came from the mist and the fog and the house and the sky she said you know that i love you and despite herself coraline nodded it was true the other mother loved her but she loved coraline as a miser loves money or a dragon loves its gold in the other mothers button eyes coraline knew that she was a possession nothing more a tolerated pet whose behaviour was no longer amusing i dont want your love said coraline i dont want anything from you not even a helping hand asked the other mother you have been doing so well after all i thought you might want a little hint to help you with the rest of your treasure hunt im doing fine on my own said coraline yes said the other mother but if you wanted to get into the flat in the front the empty one to look around you would find the door locked and then where would you be oh coraline pondered this for a moment then she said is there a key the other mother stood there in the papergrey fog of the flattening world her black hair drifted about her head as if it had a mind and a purpose all of its own she coughed suddenly in the back of her throat and then she opened her mouth the other mother reached up her hand and removed a small brass frontdoor key from her tongue here she said youll need this to get in she tossed the key casually towards coraline who caught it onehanded before she could think about whether she wanted it or not the key was still slightly damp a chill wind blew about them and coraline shivered and looked away when she looked back she was alone uncertainly she walked round to the front of the house and stood in front of the door to the empty flat like all the doors it was painted bright green she does not mean you well whispered a ghostvoice in her ear we do not believe that she would help you it must be a trick coraline said yes youre right i expect then she put the key in the lock and turned it silently the door swung open and silently coraline walked inside the flat had walls the colour of old milk the wooden boards of the floor were uncarpeted and dusty with the marks and patterns of old carpets and rugs on them there was no furniture in there only places where furniture had once been nothing decorated the walls there were discoloured rectangles on the walls to show where paintings or photographs had once hung it was so silent that coraline imagined that she could hear the motes of dust drifting through the air she found herself to be quite worried that something would jump out at her so she began to whistle she thought it might make it harder for things to jump out at her if she was whistling first she walked through the empty kitchen then she walked through an empty bathroom containing only a castiron bath and in the bath a dead spider the size of a small cat the last room she looked at had she supposed once been a bedroom she could imagine that the rectangular dustshadow on the floorboards had once been a bed then she saw something and smiled grimly set into the floorboards was a large metal ring coraline knelt and took the cold ring in her hands and she tugged upward as hard as she could terribly slowly stiffly heavily a hinged square of floor lifted it was a trapdoor it lifted and through the opening coraline could see only darkness she reached down and her hand found a cold switch she flicked it without much hope that it would work but somewhere below her a bulb lit and a thin yellow light came up from the hole in the floor she could see steps heading down but nothing else coraline put her hand into her pocket and took out the stone with the hole in it she looked through it at the cellar but saw nothing she put the stone back into her pocket up through the hole in the floor came the smell of damp clay and something else an acrid tang like sour vinegar coraline let herself down into the hole looking nervously at the trapdoor it was so heavy that if it fell she was sure she would be trapped down in the darkness for ever she put up a hand and touched it but it stayed in position and then she turned towards the darkness below and she walked down the steps set into the wall at the bottom of the steps was another light switch metal and rusting she pushed it until it clicked down and a naked bulb hanging from a wire from the low ceiling came on it did not give out enough light even for coraline to make out the things that had been painted on to the flaking cellar walls the paintings seemed crude there were eyes she could see that and things that might have been grapes and other things below them coraline could not be sure that they were paintings of people there was a pile of rubbish in one corner of the room cardboard boxes filled with mildewed papers and decaying curtains in a heap beside them coralines slippers crunched across the cement floor the bad smell was worse now she was ready to turn and leave when she saw the foot sticking out from beneath the pile of curtains she took a deep breath and pulled away the damp cloth to reveal something more or less the size and shape of a person in that dim light it took her several seconds to recognise it for what it was the thing was pale and swollen like a grub with thin sticklike arms and feet it had almost no features on its face which had puffed and swollen like risen bread dough the thing had two large black buttons where its eyes should have been coraline made a noise a sound of revulsion and horror and as if it had heard her and awakened the thing began to sit up coraline stood there frozen the thing turned its head until both its blackbutton eyes were pointed straight at her a mouth opened in the mouthless face strands of pale stuff sticking to the lips and a voice that no longer even faintly resembled her fathers whispered coraline well said coraline to the thing that had once been her other father at least you didnt jump out at me the creatures twiglike hands moved to its face and pushed the pale clay about making something like a nose it said nothing im looking for my parents said coraline or a stolen soul from one of the other children are they down here there is nothing down here said the pale thing indistinctly nothing but dust and damp and forgetting the thing was white and huge and swollen monstrous thought coraline but also miserable she raised the stone with the hole in it to her eye and looked through it nothing the pale thing was telling her the truth poor thing she said i bet she made you come down here as a punishment for telling me too much the thing hesitated then it nodded coraline wondered how she could ever have imagined that this grublike thing resembled her father tm so sorry she said shes not best pleased said the thing that was once the other father not best pleased at all youve put her quite out of sorts and when she gets out of sorts she takes it out on everybody else its her way coraline patted its hairless head its skin was tacky like warm bread dough poor thing she said youre just a thing she made and then threw away the thing nodded vigorously as it nodded the left buttoneye fell off and clattered on to the concrete floor the thing looked around vacantly with its one eye as if it had lost her finally it saw her and as if making a great effort it opened its mouth once more and said in a wet urgent voice run child leave this place she wants me to hurt you to keep you here for ever so that you can never finish the game and she will win she is pushing me so hard to hurt you i cannot fight her you can said coraline be brave she looked around the thing that had once been the other father was between her and the steps up and out of the cellar she started edging along the wall heading towards the steps the thing twisted bonelessly until its one eye was again facing her it seemed to be getting bigger now and more awake alas it said i cannot and it lunged across the cellar towards her then its toothless mouth opened wide coraline had a single heartbeat in which to react she could only think of two things to do either she could scream and try to run away and be chased around a badly lit cellar by the huge grubthing be chased until it caught her or she could do something else so she did something else as the thing reached her coraline put out her hand and closed it around the things remaining buttoneye and she tugged as hard as she knew how for a moment nothing happened then the button came away and flew from her hand clicking against the brickwork before it fell to the cellar floor the thing froze in place it threw its pale head back blindly and opened its mouth horribly wide and it roared its anger and frustration then all in a rush the thing swept towards the place where coraline had been standing but coraline was not standing there any longer she was already tiptoeing as quietly as she could up the steps that would take her away from the dim cellar with the crude paintings on the walls she could not take her eyes from the floor beneath her though across which a pale thing flopped and writhed hunting for her then as if it was being told what to do the creature stopped moving and its blind head tipped to one side its listening for me thought coraline i must be extra quiet she took another step up and her foot slipped on the step and the thing heard her its head tipped towards her for a moment it swayed and seemed to be gathering its wits then fast as a serpent it slithered for the steps and began to flow up them towards her coraline turned and ran wildly up the last halfdozen steps and she pushed herself up and on to the floor of the dusty bedroom without pausing she pulled the heavy trapdoor towards her and let go of it it crashed down with a thump just as something large banged against it the trapdoor shook and rattled in the floor but it stayed where it was coraline took a deep breath if there had been any furniture in that flat even a chair she would have pulled it on to the trapdoor but there was nothing she walked out of that flat as fast as she could without actually ever running and she locked the front door behind her she left the doorkey under the mat then she walked down on to the drive coraline had halfexpected that the other mother would be standing there waiting for her to come out but the world was silent and empty coraline wanted to go home she hugged herself and told herself that she was brave and she almost believed herself and then she walked around to the side of the house in the grey mist that wasnt a mist and she made for the stairs to go up coraline walked up the steps outside the building to the topmost flat where in her world the crazy old man upstairs lived she had gone up there once with her real mother when her mother was collecting for charity they had stood in the open doorway waiting for the crazy old man with the big moustache to find the envelope that coralines mother had left and the flat had smelled of strange foods and pipe tobacco and odd sharp cheesysmelling things which coraline could not name she had not wanted to go any further inside than that im an explorer said coraline out loud but her words sounded muffled and dead on the misty air she had made it out of the cellar hadnt she and she had but if there was one thing that coraline was certain of it was that this flat would be worse she reached the top of the steps the topmost flat had once been the attic of the house but that was long ago she knocked on the greenpainted door it swung open and she walked in we have eyes and we have nerveses we have tails we have teeth youll all get what you deserveses when we rise from underneath whispered a dozen or more tiny voices in that dark flat with the roof so low where it met the walls that coraline could almost reach up and touch it red eyes stared at her little pink feet scurried away as she came close darker shadows slipped through the shadows at the edges of things it smelt much worse in here than in the real crazy old man upstairss flat that smelled of food this place smelled as if all the exotic foods in the world had been left out to go rotten little girl said a rustling voice in a far room yes said coraline pm not frightened she told herself and as she thought it she knew that it was true there was nothing here that frightened her these things even the thing in the cellar were illusions things made by the other mother in a ghastly parody of the real people and real things on the other end of the corridor she couldnt truly make anything decided coraline she could only twist and copy and distort things that already existed and then coraline found herself wondering why the other mother would have placed a snowglobe on the drawingroom mantelpiece a place that in her world was quite bare and once she had asked herself the question she began to understand the answer then the voice came again and her train of thought was gone come here little girl i know what you want little girl it was a rustling voice scratchy and dry it made coraline think of some kind of enormous dead insect which was silly she knew how could a dead thing especially a dead insect have a voice she walked through several rooms with low slanting ceilings until she came to the final room it was a bedroom and the other crazy old man upstairs sat at the far end of the room in the neardarkness bundled up in his coat and hat as coraline entered he began to talk nothings changed little girl he said his voice sounding like the noise dry leaves make as they rustle across a pavement and what if you do everything you swore you would what then nothings changed youll go home youll be bored youll be ignored no one will listen to you not really listen to you youre too clever and too quiet for them to understand they dont even get your name right stay here with us said the voice from the figure at the end of the room we will listen to you and play with you and laugh with you your other mother will build whole worlds for you to explore and tear them down every night when you are done every day will be better and brighter than the one that went before remember the toybox how much better would a world be built just like that and all for you and will there be grey wet days where i just dont know what to do and theres nothing to read or to watch and nowhere to go and the day drags on forever asked coraline from the shadows the man said never and will there be awful meals with food made from recipes with garlic and tarragon and broad beans in asked coraline every meal will be a thing of joy whispered the voice from under the old mans hat nothing will pass your lips that does not entirely delight you and could i have dayglo green gloves to wear and yellow wellington boots in the shape of frogs asked coraline frogs ducks rhinos octopuses whatever you desire the world will be built new for you every morning if you stay here you can have whatever you want coraline sighed you really dont understand do you she said i dont want whatever i want nobody does not really what kind of fun would it be if i just got everything i ever wanted just like that and it didnt mean anything what then i dont understand said the whispery voice of course you dont understand she said raising the stone with the hole in it to her eye youre just a bad copy she made of the crazy old man upstairs there was a glow coming from the raincoat of the man at about chest height through the hole in the stone the glow twinkled and shone bluewhite as any star she wished she had a stick or something to poke him with she had no wish to get any closer to the shadowy man at the end of the room not even that any more said the dead whispery voice coraline took a step closer to the man and he fell apart black rats leapt from the sleeves and from under the coat and hat a score or more of them red eyes shining in the dark they chittered and they fled the coat fluttered and fell heavily to the floor the hat rolled into one corner of the room coraline reached out her hand and pulled the coat open it was empty although it was greasy to the touch there was no sign of the final glass marble in it she scanned the room squinting through the hole in the stone and caught sight of something that twinkled and burned like a star at floor level by the doorway it was being carried in the forepaws of the largest black rat as she looked it slipped away the other rats watched her from the corners of the room as she ran after it now rats can run faster than people especially over short distances but a large black rat holding a marble in its two front paws is no match for a determined girl moving at a run smaller black rats ran back and forth across her path trying to distract her but she ignored them all keeping her eyes fixed on the one with the marble who was heading straight out of the flat towards the front door they reached the steps on the outside of the building coraline had time to observe that the house itself was continuing to change becoming less distinct and flattening out even as she raced down the stairs it reminded her of a photograph of a house now not the thing itself then she was simply racing pellmell down the steps in pursuit of the rat with no room in her mind for anything else certain she was gaining on it she was running fast too fast she discovered as she came to the bottom of one flight of steps and her foot skidded and twisted and she went crashing on to the concrete landing her left knee was scraped and skinned and the palm of one hand she had thrown out to stop herself was a mess of scraped skin and grit it hurt a little and it would she knew soon hurt much more she picked the grit out of the palm and climbed to her feet and as fast as she could knowing that she had lost and it was already too late she went down the final set of steps to ground level she looked around for the rat but it was gone and the marble with it her hand stung where the skin had been scraped and there was blood trickling down her ripped pyjamaleg from her knee it was as bad as the summer that her mother had taken the training wheels off coralines bicycle but then back then in with all the cuts and scrapes she had a feeling of achievement she was learning something doing something she had not known how to do before now she felt nothing but cold loss she had failed the ghostchildren she had failed her parents she had failed herself failed everything she closed her eyes and wished that the earth would swallow her up there was a cough she opened her eyes and saw the rat it was lying on the brick path at the bottom of the steps with a surprised look on its face which was now several centimetres away from the rest of it its whiskers were stiff its eyes were wide open its teeth visible and yellow and sharp a collar of wet blood glistened at its neck beside the decapitated rat a smug expression on its face was the black cat it rested one paw on the grey glass marble i think i once mentioned said the cat that i dont like rats at the best of times it looked like you needed this one however i hope you dont mind my getting involved i think said coraline trying to catch her breath i think you may have said something of the sort the cat lifted its paw from the marble which rolled towards coraline she picked it up in her mind a final voice whispered to her urgently she has lied to you she will never give you up now she has you she will no more give any of us up than she can change her nature the hairs on the back of coralines neck prickled and coraline knew that the girls voice told the truth she put the marble in her dressinggown pocket with the others she had all three marbles now all she needed to do was to find her parents and coraline realised that was easy she knew exactly where her parents were if she had stopped to think she might have known where they were all along the other mother could not create she could only transform and twist and change and the mantelpiece in the drawing room back home was quite empty but knowing that she knew something else as well the other mother she plans to break her promise she wont let us go said coraline i wouldnt put it past her admitted the cat like i said theres no guarantee shell play fair and then he raised his head hello did you see that what look behind you said the cat the house had flattened out even more it no longer looked like a photograph more like a drawing a crude charcoal scribble of a house drawn on grey paper whatevers happening said coraline thank you for helping with the rat i suppose im almost there arent i so you go off into the mist or wherever you go and ill well i hope i get to see you at home if she lets me go home the cats fur was on end and its tail was bristling like a chimneysweeps brush whats wrong asked coraline theyve gone said the cat they arent there any more the ways in and out of this place they just went flat is that bad the cat lowered its tail swishing it from side to side angrily it made a low growling noise in the back of its throat it walked in a circle until it was facing away from coraline and then it began to walk backwards stiffly one step at a time until it was pushing up against coralines leg she put down a hand to stroke it and could feel how hard its heart was beating it was trembling like a dead leaf in a storm youll be fine said coraline everythings going to be fine ill take you home the cat said nothing come on cat said coraline she took a step back towards the steps but the cat stayed where it was looking miserable and oddly much smaller if the only way out is past her said coraline then thats the way were going to go she went back to the cat bent down and picked it up the cat did not resist it simply trembled she supported its bottom with one hand and rested its front legs on her shoulder the cat was heavy but not too heavy to carry it licked at the palm of her hand where the blood from the scrape was welling up coraline walked up the steps one at a time heading back to her own flat she was aware of the marbles clicking in her pocket aware of the stone with the hole in it aware of the cat pressing itself against her she got to her front door now just a smallchilds scrawl of a door and she pushed her hand against it halfexpecting that her hand would rip through it revealing nothing behind it but blackness and a scattering of stars but the door swung open and coraline went through once inside in her flat or rather in the flat that was not hers coraline was pleased to see that it had not transformed into the empty drawing that the rest of the house seemed to have become it had depth and shadows and someone who stood in the shadows waiting for coraline to return so youre back said the other mother she did not sound pleased and you brought vermin with you no said coraline i brought a friend she could feel the cat stiffening under her hands as if it were anxious to be away coraline wanted to hold on to it like a teddy bear for reassurance but she knew that cats hate to be squeezed and she suspected that frightened cats were liable to bite and scratch if provoked in any way even if they were on your side you know i love you said the other mother flatly you have a very funny way of showing it said coraline she walked down the hallway then turned into the drawing room steady step by steady step pretending that she could not feel the other mothers blank black eyes on her back her grandmothers formal furniture was still there and the painting on the wall of the strange fruit the lionpawed table raked the carpet with its clawed wooden feet as if it were impatient for something at the end of the room in the corner stood the wooden door which had once in another place opened on to a plain brick wall coraline tried not to stare at it the window showed nothing but mist this was it coraline knew the moment of truth the unravelling time the other mother had followed her in now she stood in the centre of the room between coraline and the mantelpiece and looked down at coraline with blackbutton eyes it was funny coraline thought the other mother did not look anything at all like her own mother she wondered how she had ever been deceived into imagining a resemblance the other mother was huge her head almost brushed the ceiling of the room and very pale the colour of a spiders belly her hair writhed and twined about her head and her teeth were sharp as knives well said the other mother sharply where are they coraline leaned against an armchair adjusted the cat with her left hand put her right hand into her pocket and pulled out the three glass marbles they were a frosted grey and they clinked together in the palm of her hand the other mother reached her white fingers out for them but coraline slipped them back into her pocket she knew it was true then the other mother had no intention of letting her go or of keeping her word it had been an entertainment and nothing more hold on she said we arent finished yet are we the other mother looked daggers but she smiled sweetly no she said i suppose not after all you still need to find your parents dont you yes said coraline i must not look at the mantelpiece she thought i must not even think about it well said the other mother produce them would you like to look in the cellar again i have some other interesting things hidden down there you know no said coraline i know where my parents are the cat was heavy in her arms she moved it forward unhooking its claws from her shoulder as she did so where it stands to reason said coraline ive looked everywhere youd hide them they arent in the house the other mother stood very still giving nothing away lips tightly closed she might have been a wax statue even her hair had stopped moving so coraline continued both hands wrapped firmly around the black cat i know where they have to be youve hidden them in the passageway between the houses havent you they are behind that door she nodded her head towards the door in the corner the other mother remained statuestill but a hint of a smile crept back on to her face oh they are are they why dont you open it said coraline theyll be there all right it was her only way home she knew but it all depended on the other mother needing to gloat needing not only to win but to show that she had won the other mother reached her hand slowly into her apron pocket and produced the black iron key the cat stirred uncomfortably in coralines arms as if it wanted to get down just stay there for a few moments longer she thought at it wondering if it could hear her get us both home i said i would i promise she felt the cat relax eversoslightly in her arms the other mother walked over to the door and pushed the key into the lock she turned the key coraline heard the mechanism clunk heavily she was already starting as quietly as she could step by step to back away towards the mantelpiece the other mother pushed down on the door handle and pulled open the door revealing a corridor behind it dark and empty there she said waving her hands at the corridor the expression of delight on her face was a very bad thing to see youre wrong you dont know where your parents are do you they arent there she turned and looked at coraline now she said youre going to stay here for ever and always no said coraline tm not and hard as she could she threw the black cat towards the other mother it yowled and landed on the other mothers head claws flailing teeth bared fierce and angry fur on end it looked half again as big as it was in real life without waiting to see what would happen coraline reached up to the mantelpiece closed her hand around the snowglobe then pushed it deep into the pocket of her dressing gown the cat made a deep ululating yowl and sank its teeth into the other mothers cheek she was flailing at it blood ran from the cuts on her white face not red blood but a deep tarry black stuff coraline ran for the door she pulled the key out of the lock leave her come on she shouted to the cat it hissed and swiped its scalpelsharp claws at the other mothers face in one wild rake which left black ooze trickling from several gashes on her nose then it sprang down towards coraline quickly she said the cat ran towards her and they both stepped into the dark corridor it was colder in the corridor like stepping down into a cellar on a warm day the cat hesitated for a moment then seeing the other mother was coming towards them it ran to coraline and stopped by her legs coraline began to pull the door closed it was heavier than she imagined a door could be and pulling it closed was like trying to close a door against a high wind and then she felt something from the other side starting to pull against her shut she thought then she said out loud come on please and she felt the door begin to move to pull closed to give against the phantom wind suddenly she was aware of other people in the corridor with her she could not turn her head to look at them but she knew them without having to look help me please she said all of you the other people in the corridor three children two adults were somehow too insubstantial to touch the door but their hands closed about hers as she pulled on the big iron door handle and suddenly she felt strong never let up miss hold strong hold strong whispered a voice in her mind pull girl pull whispered another and then a voice that sounded like her mothers her own mother her real wonderful maddening infuriating glorious mother just said well done coraline and that was enough the door started to slip closed easily as anything no screamed a voice from beyond the door and it no longer sounded even faintly human something snatched at coraline reaching through the closing gap between the door and the doorpost coraline jerked her head out of the way but the door began to open once more were going to go home said coraline we are help me she ducked the snatching fingers they moved through her then ghosthands lent her strength that she no longer possessed there was a final moment of resistance as if something were caught in the door and then with a crash the wooden door banged closed something dropped from coralines head height to the floor it landed with a sort of a scuttling thump come on said the cat this is not a good place to be in quickly coraline turned her back on the door and began to run as fast as was practical through the dark corridor dragging her hand along the wall to make sure she didnt bump into anything or get turned around in the darkness it was an uphill run and it seemed to her that it went on for a longer distance than anything could possibly go the wall she was touching seemed warm and yielding now and she realised it felt as if it was covered in a fine downy fur it moved as if it were taking a breath she snatched her hand away from it winds howled in the dark she was scared she would bump into something and she put out her hand for the wall once more this time what she touched felt hot and wet as if she had put her hand in somebodys mouth and she pulled it back with a small wail her eyes had adjusted to the dark she could halfsee as faintly glowing patches ahead of her two adults three children she could hear the cat too padding in the dark in front of her and there was something else which suddenly scuttled between her feet nearly sending coraline flying she caught herself before she went down using her own momentum to keep moving she knew that if she fell in that corridor she might never get up again whatever that corridor was was older by far than the other mother it was deep and slow and it knew that she was there then daylight appeared and she ran towards it puffing and wheezing almost there she called encouragingly but in the light she discovered that the wraiths had gone and she was alone she did not have time to wonder what had happened to them panting for breath she staggered through the door and slammed it behind her with the loudest most satisfying bang you can imagine coraline locked the door with the key and put the key back into her pocket the black cat was huddled in the farthest corner of the room the pink tip of its tongue showing its eyes wide coraline went over to it and crouched down tm sorry she said tm sorry i threw you at her but it was the only way to distract her enough to get us all out she would never have kept her word would she the cat looked up at her then it rested its head on her hand licking her fingers with its sandpapery tongue it began to purr then were friends said coraline she sat down on one of her grandmothers uncomfortable armchairs and the cat sprang up into her lap and made itself comfortable the light that came through the picture window was daylight real golden lateafternoon daylight not a white mistlight the sky was a robinsegg blue and coraline could see trees and beyond the trees green hills which faded on the horizon into purples and greys the sky had never seemed so sky the world had never seemed so world coraline stared at the leaves on the trees and at the patterns of light and shadow on the cracked bark of the trunk of the beech tree outside the window then she looked down at her lap at the way that the rich sunlight brushed every hair on the cats head turning each white whisker to gold nothing she thought had ever been so interesting and caught up in the interestingness of the world coraline barely noticed that she had wriggled down and curled catlike in her grandmothers uncomfortable armchair nor did she notice when she fell into a deep and dreamless sleep her mother shook her gently awake coraline she said darling what a funny place to fall asleep and really this room is only for best we looked all over the house for you coraline stretched and blinked im sorry she said i fell asleep i can see that said her mother and wherever did the cat come from he was waiting by the front door when i came in shot out like a bullet as i opened it probably had things to do said coraline then she hugged her mother so tightly that her arms began to ache her mother hugged coraline back dinner in fifteen minutes said her mother dont forget to wash your hands and just look at those pyjama bottoms what did you do to your poor knee i tripped said coraline she went into the bathroom and she washed her hands and cleaned her bloody knee she put ointment on her cuts and scrapes she went into her bedroom her real bedroom her true bedroom she pushed her hands into the pockets of her dressing gown and she pulled out three marbles a stone with a hole in it the black key and an empty snowglobe she shook the snowglobe and watched the glittery snow swirl through the water to fill the empty world she put it down and watched the snow fall covering the place where the little couple had once stood coraline took a piece of string from her toybox and she strung the black key on to it then she knotted the string and hung it around her neck there she said she put on some clothes and hid the key under her tshirt it was cold against her skin the stone went into her pocket coraline walked down the hallway to her fathers study he had his back to her but she knew just on seeing him that his eyes when he turned around would be her fathers kind grey eyes and she crept over and kissed him on the back of his balding head hello coraline he said then he looked round and smiled at her what was that for nothing said coraline i just miss you sometimes thats all oh good he said he put the computer to sleep stood up and then for no reason at all he picked coraline up which he had not done for such a long time not since he had started pointing out to her she was much too old to be carried and he carried her into the kitchen dinner that night was pizza and even though it was homemade by her father and even though he had put slices of green pepper on it along with little meatballs and of all things pineapple chunks coraline ate the entire slice she had been given well she ate everything except for the pineapple chunks and soon enough it was bedtime coraline kept the key around her neck but she put the grey marbles beneath her pillow and in bed that night coraline dreamed a dream she was at a picnic under an old oak tree in a green meadow the sun was high in the sky and while there were distant fluffy white clouds on the horizon the sky above her head was a deep untroubled blue there was a whitelinen cloth laid on the grass with bowls piled high with food she could see salads and sandwiches nuts and fruit jugs of lemonade and water and thick chocolate milk coraline sat on one side of the tablecloth while three other children took a side each they were dressed in the oddest clothes the smallest of them sitting on coralines left was a boy with redvelvet kneebritches and a frilly white shirt his face was dirty and he was piling his plate high with boiled new potatoes and with what looked like cold whole cooked trout this is the finest of picnics lady he said to her yes said coraline i think it is i wonder who organised it why i rather think you did miss said a tall girl sitting opposite coraline she wore a brown rather shapeless dress and had a brown bonnet on her head which tied beneath her chin and we are more grateful for it and for all than ever words can say she was eating slices of bread and jam deftly cutting the bread from a large goldenbrown loaf with a huge knife then spooning on the purple jam with a wooden spoon she had jam all around her mouth aye this is the finest food i have eaten in centuries said the girl on coralines right she was a very pale child dressed in what seemed to be spiders webs with a circle of glittering silver set in her blonde hair coraline could have sworn that the girl had two wings like dusty silver butterfly wings not bird wings coming out of her back the girls plate was piled high with pretty flowers she smiled at coraline as if it had been a very long time since she had smiled and she had almost but not quite forgotten how coraline found herself liking this girl immensely and then in the way of dreams the picnic had ended and they were playing in the meadow running and shouting and tossing a glittering ball from one to another coraline knew it was a dream then because none of them ever got tired or winded or out of breath she wasnt even sweating they just laughed and ran in a game that was partly tag partly piggyinthemiddle and partly just a magnificent romp three of them ran along the ground while the pale girl fluttered a little over their heads swooping down on butterfly wings to grab the ball and swinging up again into the sky before she tossed the ball to one of the other children and then without a word about it being spoken the game was over and the four of them went back to the picnic cloth where the lunch had been cleared away and there were four bowls waiting for them three of icecream one of honeysuckle flowers piled high they ate with relish thank you for coming to my party said coraline if it is mine the pleasure is ours coraline jones said the winged girl nibbling another honeysuckle blossom if there were but something we could do for you to thank you and to reward you aye said the boy with the redvelvet britches and the dirty face he put out his hand and held coralines hand with his own it was warm now its a very fine thing you did for us miss said the tall girl she now had a smear of chocolate icecream all around her lips im just pleased its all over said coraline was it her imagination or did a shadow cross the faces of the other children at the picnic the winged girl the circlet in her hair glittering like a star rested her fingers for a moment on the back of coralines hand it is over and done with for us she said this is our staging post from here we three will set out for uncharted lands and what comes after no one alive can say she stopped talking theres a but isnt there said coraline i can feel it like a rain cloud the boy on her left tried to smile bravely but his lower lip began to tremble and he bit it with his upper teeth and said nothing the girl in the brown bonnet shifted uncomfortably and said yes miss but i got you three back said coraline i got mum and dad back i shut the door i locked it what more was i meant to do the boy squeezed coralines hand with his she found herself remembering when it had been her trying to reassure him when he was little more than a cold memory in the darkness well cant you give me a clue asked coraline isnt there something you can tell me the beldam swore by her good right hand said the tall girl but she lied mmy governess said the boy used to say that nobody is ever given more to shoulder than he or she can bear he shrugged as he said this as if he had not yet made his own mind up whether or not it was true we wish you luck said the winged girl good fortune and wisdom and courage although you have already shown that you have all three of these blessings and in abundance she hates you blurted out the boy she hasnt lost anything for so long be wise be brave be tricky but its not fair said coraline in her dream angrily its just not fair it should be over the boy with the dirty face stood up and hugged coraline tightly take comfort in this he whispered thart alive thou livest and in her dream coraline saw that the sun had set and the stars were twinkling in the darkening sky coraline stood in the meadow and she watched as the three children went away from her across the grass silver in the light of the huge moon the three of them came to a small wooden bridge over a stream they stopped there and turned and waved and coraline waved back and what came after was darkness coraline woke in the early hours of the morning convinced she had heard something moving but unsure what it was she waited something made a rustling noise outside her bedroom door she wondered if it was a rat the door rattled coraline clambered out of bed go away said coraline sharply go away or youll be sorry there was a pause then the whateveritwas scuttled away down the hall there was something odd and irregular about its footsteps if they were footsteps coraline found herself wondering if it was perhaps a rat with an extra leg it isnt over is it she said to herself then she opened the bedroom door the grey predawn light showed her the whole of the corridor completely deserted she went towards the front door sparing a hasty glance back at the wardrobedoor mirror hanging on the wall at the other end of the hallway seeing nothing but her own pale face staring back at her looking sleepy and serious gentle reassuring snores came from her parents room but the door was closed all the doors off the corridor were closed whatever the scuttling thing was it had to be here somewhere coraline opened the front door and looked at the grey sky she wondered how long it would be until the sun came up wondered whether her dream had been a true thing while knowing in her heart that it had been something she had taken to be part of the shadows under the hall couch detached itself from beneath the couch and made a mad scrabbling rush on its long white legs heading for the front door coralines mouth dropped open in horror and she stepped out of the way as the thing clicked and scuttled past her and out of the house running crablike on its toomany tapping clicking scurrying feet she knew what it was and she knew what it was after she had seen it too many times in the last few days reaching and clutching and snatching and popping blackbeetles obediently into the other mothers mouth fivefooted crimsonnailed the colour of bone x it was the other mothers right hand it wanted the black key coralines parents never seemed to remember anything about their time in the snowglobe at least they never said anything about it and coraline never mentioned it to them sometimes she wondered whether they had ever noticed that they had lost two days in the real world and came to the eventual conclusion that they had not then again there are some people who keep track of every day and every hour and there are people who dont and coralines parents were solidly in the second camp coraline had placed the marbles beneath her pillow before she went to sleep that first night home in her own room once more she went back to bed after she saw the other mothers hand although there was not much time left for sleeping and she rested her head back on the pillow something scrunched gently as she did do she sat up and lifted the pillow the fragments of the glass marbles that she saw looked like the remains of eggshells one finds beneath trees in springtime like empty broken robins eggs or even more delicate wrens eggs perhaps whatever had been inside the glass spheres had gone coraline thought of the three children waving goodbye to her in the moonlight waving before they crossed that silver stream she gathered up the eggshellthin fragments with care and placed them in a small blue box which had once held a bracelet that her grandmother had given her when she was a little girl the bracelet was longlost but the box remained miss spink and miss forcible came back from visiting miss spinks niece and coraline went down to their flat for tea it was a monday on wednesday coraline would go back to school a whole new school year would begin miss forcible insisted on reading coralines tea leaves well looks like everythings mostly shipshape and bristol fashion lovey said miss forcible sorry said coraline everything is coming up roses said miss forcible well almost everything im not sure what that is she pointed to a clump of tea leaves sticking to the side of the cup miss spink tutted and reached for the cup honestly miriam give it over here let me see she blinked through her thick spectacles oh dear no i have no idea what that signifies it looks almost like a hand coraline looked the clump of leaves did look a little like a hand reaching for something hamish the scottie dog was hiding under miss forcibles chair and he wouldnt come out i think he was in some sort of fight said miss spink he has a deep gash in his side poor dear well take him to the vet later this afternoon i wish i knew what could have done it something coraline knew would have to be done that final week of the holidays the weather was magnificent as if the summer itself were trying to make up for the miserable weather they had been having by giving them some bright and glorious days before it ended the crazy old man upstairs called down to coraline when he saw her coming out of miss spink and miss forcibles flat hey hi you caroline he shouted over the railing its coraline she said how are the mice something has frightened them said the old man scratching his moustache i think maybe there is a weasel in the house something is about i heard it in the night in my country we would have put down a trap for it maybe put down a little meat or hamburger and when the creature comes to feast then bam it would be caught and never bother us more the mice are so scared they will not even pick up their little musical instruments i dont think it wants meat said coraline she put her hand up and touched the black key that hung about her neck then she went inside she bathed herself and kept the key round her neck the whole time she was in the bath she never took it off any more something scratched at her bedroom window after she went to bed coraline was almost asleep but she slipped out of bed and pulled open the curtains a white hand with crimson fingernails leapt from the windowledge on to a drainpipe and was immediately out of sight there were deep gouges in the glass on the other side of the window coraline slept uneasily that night waking from time to time to plot and plan and ponder then falling back into sleep never quite certain where her pondering ended and the dream began one ear always open for the sound of something scratching at her windowpane or at her bedroom door in the morning coraline said to her mother im going to have a picnic with my dolls today can i borrow a sheet an old one one you dont need any longer as a tablecloth i dont think we have one of those said her mother she opened the kitchen drawer that held the napkins and the tablecloths and she prodded about in it hold on will this do it was a foldedup disposable paper tablecloth covered with red flowers left over from some picnic they had been on several years before thats perfect said coraline i didnt think you played with your dolls any more said mrs jones i dont admitted coraline theyre protective coloration well be back in time for lunch said her mother have a good time coraline filled a cardboard box with dolls and several plastic dolls teacups she filled a jug with water then she went outside she walked down to the road just as if she were going to the shops before she reached the supermarket she cut over a fence into some wasteland and along an old drive then she crawled under a hedge she had to go under the hedge in two journeys in order not to spill the water from the jug it was a long roundabout looping journey but at the end of it coraline was satisfied that she had not been followed she came out behind the dilapidated old tennis court she crossed over it to the meadow where the long grass swayed she found the planks on the edge of the meadow they were astonishingly heavy almost too heavy for a girl to lift even using all her strength but she managed she didnt have any choice she pulled the planks out of the way one by one grunting and sweating with the effort revealing a deep round bricklined hole in the ground it smelled of damp and the dark the bricks were greenish and slippery she spread out the tablecloth and laid it carefully over the top of the well she put a plastic dolls cup every twenty centimetres or so at the edge of the well and she weighed each cup down with water from the jug she put a doll in the grass beside each cup making it look as much like a dolls tea party as she could then she retraced her steps back under the hedge along the dusty yellow drive around the back of the shops back to her house she reached up and took the key from around her neck she dangled it from the string as if the key were just something she liked to play with then she knocked on the door of miss spink and miss forcibles flat miss spink opened the door hello dear she said i dont want to come in said coraline i just wanted to find out how hamish was doing miss spink sighed the vet says that hamish is a brave little soldier she said luckily the cut doesnt seem to be infected we cannot imagine what could have done it the vet says some animal he thinks but has no idea what mister bobo says he thinks it might have been a weasel mister bobo the man in the top flat mister bobo fine old circus family i believe romanian or slovenian or livonian or one of those countries bless me i can never remember them any more it had never occurred to coraline that the crazy old man upstairs actually had a name she realised if shed known his name was mr bobo she would have said it every chance she got how often do you get to say a name like mister bobo aloud oh said coraline to miss spink mister bobo right well she said a little louder im going to go and play with my dolls now over by the old tennis court round the back thats nice dear said miss spink then she added confidentially make sure you keep an eye out for the old well mister lovat who was here before your time said that he thought it might go down for half a mile or more coraline hoped that the hand had not heard this last remark and she changed the subject this key said coraline loudly oh its just some old key from our house its part of my game thats why im carrying it around with me on this piece of string well goodbye now what an extraordinary child said miss spink to herself as she closed the door coraline ambled across the meadow towards the old tennis court dangling and swinging the black key on its piece of string as she walked several times she thought she saw something the colour of bone in the undergrowth it was keeping pace with her about ten metres away she tried to whistle but nothing happened so she sang out loud instead a song her father had made up for her when she was a little baby and which had always made her laugh it went oh my twitchy witchy girl i think you are so nice i give you bowls of porridge and i give you bowls of icecream i give you lots of kisses and i give you lots of hugs but i never give you sandwiches with bugs in that was what she sang as she sauntered through the woods and her voice hardly trembled at all the dolls tea party was where she had left it she was relieved that it was not a windy day for everything was still in its place every waterfilled plastic cup weighed down the paper tablecloth as it was meant to she breathed a sigh of relief now was the hardest part hello dolls she said brightly its teatime she walked close to the paper tablecloth i brought the luck key she told the dolls to make sure we have a good picnic and then as carefully as she could she leaned over and gently placed the key on the tablecloth she was still holding on to the string she held her breath hoping that the cups of water at the edges of the well would weigh the cloth down letting it take the weight of the key without collapsing into the well the key sat in the middle of the paper picnic cloth coraline let go of the string and took a step back now it was all up to die hand she turned to her dolls who would like a piece of cherry cake she asked jemima pinky primrose and she served each doll a slice of invisible cake on an invisible plate chattering happily as she did so from the corner of her eye she saw something bone white scamper from one tree trunk to another closer and closer she forced herself not to look at it jemima said coraline what a bad girl you are youve dropped your cake now ill have to go over and get you a whole new slice and she walked around the tea party until she was on the other side of it to the hand she pretended to clean up spilled cake and then to get jemima another piece and then in a skittering chittering rush it came the hand running high on its fingertips scrabbled through the tall grass and up on to a tree stump it stood there for a moment like a crab tasting the air and then it made one triumphant nailclacking leap on to the centre of the paper tablecloth time slowed for coraline the white fingers closed around the black key and then the weight and the momentum of the hand sent the plastic dolls cups flying and the paper tablecloth and the key and the other mothers right hand went tumbling down into the darkness of the well coraline counted slowly under her breath she got up to forty before she heard a muffled splash coming from a long way below someone had once told her that if you look up at the sky from the bottom of a mineshaft even in the brightest daylight you see a night sky and stars coraline wondered if the hand could see stars from where it was she hauled the heavy planks back on to the well covering it as carefully as she could she didnt want anything to fall in she didnt want anything ever to get out then she put her dolls and the cups back in the cardboard box she had carried them out in something caught her eye while she was doing this and she straightened up in time to see the black cat stalking towards her its tail held high and curling at the tip like a question mark it was the first time she had seen the cat in several days since they had returned together from the other mothers place the cat walked over to her and jumped up on to the planks that covered the well then slowly it winked one eye at her it sprang down into the long grass in front of her and rolled over on to its back wiggling about ecstatically coraline scratched and tickled the soft fur on its belly and the cat purred contentedly when it had had enough it rolled over on to its front once more and walked back towards the tennis court like a tiny patch of midnight in the midday sun coraline went back to the house mr bobo was waiting for her in the driveway he clapped her on the shoulder the mice tell me that all is good he said they say that you are our saviour caroline its coraline mister bobo said coraline not caroline coraline coraline said mr bobo repeating her name to himself with wonderment and respect very good coraline the mice say that i must tell you that as soon as they are ready to perform in public you will come up to watch them as the first audience of all they will play tumpty umpty and toodle oodle and they will dance and do a thousand tricks that is what they say i would like that very much said coraline when theyre ready she knocked at miss spink and miss forcibles door miss spink let her in and coraline went into their parlour she put her box of dolls down on the floor then she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out the stone with the hole in it here you go she said i dont need it any more im very grateful i think it may have saved my life and saved some other peoples deaths she gave them both tight hugs although her arms barely stretched around miss spink and miss forcible smelled like the raw garlic she had been cutting then coraline picked up her box of dolls and went out what an extraordinary child said miss spink no one had hugged her like that since she had retired from the theatre that night coraline lay in bed all bathed teeth cleaned with her eyes open staring up at the ceiling it was warm enough that now the hand was gone she had opened her bedroom window wide she had insisted to her father that the curtains not be entirely closed her new school clothes were laid out carefully on her chair for her to put on when she woke normally on the night before the first day of term coraline was apprehensive and nervous but she realised there was nothing left about school that could scare her any more she fancied she could hear sweet music on the night air the kind of music that can only be played on the tiniest silver trombones and trumpets and bassoons on piccolos and tubas so delicate and small that their keys could only be pressed by the tiny pink fingers of white mice coraline imagined that she was back again in her dream with the two girls and the boy under the oak tree in the meadow and she smiled as the first stars came out coraline finally allowed herself to drift into sleep while the gentle upstairs music of the mouse circus spilled out on to the warm evening air telling the world that the summer was almost over
