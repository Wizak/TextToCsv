 chapter one rashid street was sunny and full of dust it was busy with the sound of car horns and the shouts of men and children selling sweets oranges bananas bath towels combs and all sorts of things carried on trays added to this were the warning cries of men leading donkeys and horses amongst the cars and crowds it was eleven in the morning in baghdad the great capital city of iraq a short man with a red face and a moustache looking pleased with himself turned off rashid street he walked along an alley and into a courtyard here he pushed open an office door with a sign iraqi iranian oil company a young iraqi clerk left his typewriter and came forward smiling good morning captain crosbie what can i do for you is mr dakin in his room good ill go through he went up some stairs along a passage and knocked at the end door come in the light was on and there was no daylight in the room behind a desk was a man with a tired face dakin said hello crosbie back from the north crosbie nodded he shut the door carefully it was an old door but it had one unexpected quality it was soundproof with the closing of the door both men changed captain crosbie became less pleased with himself mr dakin less tired any news sir asked crosbie yes in front of him dakin had a paper which he had been decoding he lit a match set light to the paper and watched it burn the conference is in baghdad the twentieth of next month time and place must be kept secret theyve been talking about it in the souk for three days said crosbie the tall man smiled his tired smile no secrets in the east are there no sir if you ask me there arent any secrets anywhere during the war i often noticed that any barber in london knew more than the high command it doesnt matter in this case the conference will soon have to be made public do you think it will take place sir asked crosbie doubtfully does stalin really intend to come i think he does said dakin thoughtfully and if the conference happens it might save everything if an understanding could be reached he stopped crosbie still looked doubtful forgive me sir is any agreement possible probably not if it were only the leaders of russia and america i believe the conference would end as usual in more suspicion and misunderstanding bad enough but no worse than things are now but there is a third force acting here that fantastic story of carmichaels surely sir it cant be true dakin was silent he was remembering a worried face hearing a quiet voice telling him fantastic and unbelievable stories of huge underground laboratories built in a remote valley far from civilization of a group of people who wanted total war total destruction and who hoped to build a new world from the ruins of the old either my most reliable man has gone mad crosbie or else this thing is true and if carmichael is in baghdad on the twentieth with his proof proof said crosbie sharply dakin nodded yes hes got proof the coded message came from salah hassan as agreed carmichael got what he went to get he has the proof on microfilm but theyre following him and theyll have people waiting for him here they have agents in every country some in very high positions there have even been security leaks from our own people thats our worst danger how can i be sure that one of our people hasnt already told our enemies about our plans to get carmichael safely into baghdad crosbie looked worried but we go on yes what about crofton lee hes agreed to come everyones coming to baghdad said crosbie even stalin but if anything should happen to the american president while hes here we will be in the very worst trouble nothing must happen said dakin thats our business to see that it doesnt when crosbie had gone dakin said quietly they came to baghdad he drew a spiders web in the middle of the web he wrote a name anna scheele and a big question mark anna scheele was a platinum blonde her blue eyes looked out from behind strong glasses her face had neat small features however she had made her way in the world not by charm but by efficiency otto morganthal head of morganthal international bank trusted anna scheele completely her memory her judgement her good sense were extremely valuable that is why he paid her a large salary he would have been amazed if someone had told him anna had any interests apart from his bank so he was surprised to hear her say i would like three weeks off work mr morganthal he said nervously youre not ill are you he couldnt imagine miss scheele being ill even illnesses respected anna scheele and kept out of her way oh no mr morganthal i want to go to london to see my sister your sister i never knew you had a sister miss scheele smiled oh yes mr morganthal she is married to an englishman connected with the british museum she is to have a serious operation and she wants me to be with her chapter two victoria jones was sitting in fitzjames gardens telling herself there really was a wrong moment for everything victoria was generous kind and brave and telling lies was irresistible to her victoria lied easily and with artistic skill if victoria was late which she often was the excuse of a delayed bus was not enough victoria preferred an exciting robbery in which she had helped the police to victoria with her desire for adventure a satisfying world was one in which there were tigers and dangerous criminals a slim girl with lovely legs victorias features were small and neat but she could twist them to look like almost anybody and that was her present trouble employed as a typist victoria had been entertaining the other typists with a performance of the bosss foreign wife visiting her husbands office why you say we cant have that sofa darling victoria demanded in a high complaining voice you say there is no money but then why you take that blonde girl dancing ah you think i not know and if you take that girl then i have a sofa and a very nice fur coat when the delighted typists suddenly returned to work victoria turned quickly to discover that her boss was standing in the doorway he had heard everything so with only a weeks salary in her bag victoria was sitting in fitzjames gardens and only now noticing the young man at the other end of the seat he was as goodlooking as an angel fairhaired with very blue eyes and those eyes victoria thought were admiring her victoria was not shy about making friends with young men in public she smiled and the young man smiled back happily hello this is a nice place do you often come here nearly every day just my luck that i never came here before he sighed my names edward whats yours victoria why did your parents name you after a railway station theres queen victoria as well miss jones said mm yes whats your other name jones victoria jones edward shook his head they dont go together youre right said victoria if i were jenny it would be nice jenny jones but victoria needs something with a bit more style this pleasant moment was interrupted by edward looking at his watch and making a horrified noise i must rush back to my boss er what about you i lost my job this morning oh i am sorry said edward well dont be ill easily get another and i had fun and delaying edwards return to work even more she gave him an energetic repeat of the mornings performance to edwards great enjoyment you are marvellous victoria you ought to be an actress victoria accepted this with a smile and said that edward had better be going if he didnt want to be dismissed himself and i would not get another job as easily as you it must be wonderful to be a good typist said edward im not a good typist victoria admitted but fortunately even the worst typists can get a job now whats your job i suppose youre out of one of the services raf good guess fighter pilot right again theyre very good about getting us jobs but the trouble is that were not particularly clever i mean we didnt need to be clever in the raf they put me in an office with files and figures and it all seemed pointless made me sad victoria nodded sympathetically edward went on unhappily it was all right during the war we all knew what we had to do but not now in the world of im no good at all well id better be going i say would you mind if to victorias surprise edward produced a small camera she turned pink i really would like a photo of you you see im going to baghdad tomorrow to baghdad victoria said disappointed yes i wish i wasnt now earlier i was very pleased i took the job to get out of this country what sort of job is it poetry that sort of thing dr rathbone is my boss hes very interested in culture and he wants everyone to share it hes opening a bookshop in baghdad he gets shakespeare translated into arabic kurdish and persian what do you actually do asked victoria well just about everything dr rathbone needs doing then in baghdad im supposed to get everyone joining in its a kind of youth movement all nations united in peace actually its all rather serious and a bit boring so if you wouldnt mind oh i say thats wonderful the camera clicked twice and victoria almost purred like a cat with pleasure but its terrible having to go now ive met you said edward and the thing is ive got a feeling theres something not right somewhere not right yes i mean rathbone is very respectable and wise and best friends with all types of important people but its just a feeling well time will tell i wish you were coming too so do i said victoria what are you going to do find another job said victoria miserably goodbye edward good luck they heard a clock in the distance and edward said oh dear i must fly and he was gone lost among the london crowds victoria remaining behind was thinking about romeo and juliet she and edward she felt were like that unhappy couple meeting instant attraction frustration two romantic hearts separated forever victoria rose and walked quickly out of fitzjames gardens she had come to two decisions the first was that like juliet she loved this young man and was going to have him the second was that as edward would soon be in baghdad she must go there too chapter three a small dark man entered a public telephone box at high street kensington station and made a phone call valhalla gramophone company sanders here reporting on anna scheele arrived this morning from new york went to flower shop asked for flowers to be delivered at a private hospital in portland place ordered coat and skirt at bolford and avorys neither of these firms known to have any suspicious contacts scheeles room at savoy hotel was searched nothing suspicious found scheele took small suitcase and went to sister at elmsleigh gardens sister is entering hospital in portland place this evening for operation visit of anna scheele seems justified no sign she knew she was being followed understand she is spending tonight at hospital has kept her room at the savoy return ticket to new york booked for twentythird chapter four somehow or other victoria intended to get to baghdad so first she went into a travel agency there was no difficulty in travelling to baghdad you could go by air by sea by train boat and car but only if you had between sixty and a hundred pounds victoria had eight pounds she asked about an air stewardess job but found there was a waiting list victoria next visited the employment agency where the manager welcomed her as one of those people who passed through the office regularly dear me miss jones out of a job again is there any chance asked victoria of a job in baghdad baghdad said the manager in great surprise victoria saw she might as well have said the south pole i very much want to get to baghdad as a nurse or cook or looking after children any way at all the manager shook her head i cant offer much hope there was a lady in yesterday with two little girls who was offering a ticket to australia victoria didnt want to go to australia if you hear of anything id even go just for the price of a ticket out thats all i need everything now seemed to bring baghdad to victorias attention the evening paper noted that dr pauncefoot jones the wellknown archaeologist had started work at an ancient city near baghdad the thief of baghdad was on at the cinema and a new history of baghdad was in the bookshop window victoria believed that if you wanted to do a thing there was always some way of doing it so she wrote a list of possible ways try foreign office advertisement iraqi embassy companies that sell dates and transport firms british council she added to the list somehow get my hands on a hundred pounds the following morning victoria was combing her wild dark hair when the telephone rang it was the agency manager who said excitedly my dear the most amazing thing yes cried victoria a mrs hamilton clipp travelling to baghdad in three days has broken her arm she needs someone to help her i rang you at once i dont know if other agencies im on my way cried victoria where is she the savoy shes an american mr and mrs hamilton clipp victoria hurried out and got on a number bus on the bus she noticed a useful item in the newspaper that a woman was reading she got off at green park and entered the ritz hotel using ritz notepaper victoria wrote herself words of praise from lady cynthia bradbury who had just left england for east africa excellent at dealing with illness and capable in every way leaving the ritz she walked to another big hotel a favourite of church leaders in different handwriting on the hotels special notepaper she wrote words of praise from the bishop of llangow now fully prepared victoria went on to the savoy hotel explaining that she had come from the employment agency she asked for mrs hamilton clipp it was mr hamilton clipp a tall greyhaired american with a kindly manner who welcomed her now miss jones youd better come up and see mrs clipp i believe shes with another young lady but she may have gone by now victoria panicked was she to get so near only to be disappointed at the last moment as they walked along the corridor a young woman came out of a door at the far end victoria had a strange sensation that it was herself who was approaching the young woman passed them and mr hamilton clipp turned round to look at her in surprise well now he said that was anna scheele he stopped as he spoke opened a door and stood aside for victoria to enter mrs hamilton clipp was sitting on a chair near the window she was a little birdlike woman and her broken arm was in a hard covering of white plaster her husband introduced victoria oh its been most unfortunate miss jones cried mrs clipp here we were enjoying london and all our plans were made im going to visit sadie my married daughter in iraq then i fell down some steps in westminster abbey its not too uncomfortable but how id manage travelling i dont know and george here cant get away from his business for another three weeks once im out there i dont need a nurse sadie can do all thats needed so i thought i would see if i could find someone who would be willing to come along for the price of a ticket out ive done a lot of nursing said victoria offering her references i was with lady cynthia bradbury and if you need any letters writing i was my uncles secretary for some months my uncle said victoria modestly is the bishop of llangow the hamilton clipps were victoria thought most impressed and so they should be after the trouble she had taken its wonderful said mrs hamilton clipp an answer to our prayers exactly thought victoria you have a job out there or are you joining a relative asked mrs hamilton clipp caught unprepared victoria thought quickly im joining my uncle dr pauncefoot jones she explained oh the archaeologist yes im very interested in his work but i have no qualifications so the expedition could not pay for my ticket but if i can get there on my own i can join them and make myself useful what a nice direct girl said mr hamilton clipp we really are in luck at that victoria could not stop her face from blushing red chapter five for two days the boat had been moving slowly along the shatt el arab many times the old arab man had come down the river like this to basrah the other man in the boat was wearing the black and white keffiyah the traditional arab head dress over his long robe he wore an old brown coat with a red scarf he was a man who looked like thousands of others in this country there was nothing to show he was an englishman and that he carried a secret that could destroy him his mind went back over the last weeks the attack as he came over the mountains the caravan of camels four days walking across the desert with two men carrying their cinema then travelling on with old friends of the aneizeh tribe hiding again and again from the men sent to kill him henry carmichael british agent thirty brown hair dark eyes fivefootten speaks many languages friend of the tribesmen dangerous carmichael had been born in kashgar china and yes he had friends in all the wild places of the middle east it was only in the cities that his contacts failed him in every town in iraq agents were ready with plans to help him get to baghdad but these plans made months before had failed the first had been an aeroplane but his enemies had found out someone had betrayed him so his sense of danger was at its highest as the boat turned into the waterway that ran through basrah hundreds of boats were tied up and other boats were coming in the old man said softly may allah make your path straight and lengthen the years of your life inshallah it is as allah wishes carmichael said getting out of the boat all around him there was the usual noisy waterside crowd of people on the opposite side of the street passing by the shops and banks were busy young iraqi men in european suits there were europeans too no one was showing any interest in him carmichael walked to the bridge at the top of the canal crossed it and went into the souk here there was noise and movement everywhere energetic arabs marching along between loaded donkeys and shouting children running after the europeans all normal and yet carmichael felt a growing sense of fear no one was following him yet he was certain he was in danger he turned into a narrow alley then stepped through a doorway into a courtyard with shops all round it he went to one where ferwahs were hanging the sheepskin coats of the north he stood there touching them besh hadha he called to the owner seven dinars too much there are cheaper fetwahs in the inner room the shopkeeper said a white ferwah from the north is what i need i have one the shopkeeper pointed to a door in the inner wall as carmichael passed across the room he looked at the owners face though he looked very much like him this was not the right man he stopped where is salah hassan he was my brother he died three days ago his business is mine now yes it was possible that this was the brother also employed by the department his passwords had been correct however it was with great care that carmichael went into the inner room here were shelves full of goods and a white ferwah lay on a small table if they had chosen a gun as the weapon carmichaels mission would have failed there and then but it had been a knife on the shelf in front of carmichael there was a big copper coffee pot the knife and the mans reflection showed in the shining surface in another moment that knife would have been stabbed into carmichaels back as quick as a flash carmichael turned and knocked the man to the ground the knife fell carmichael ran back into the crowded souk turning first one way then another betrayed again he was on the run once more without money without help he came out of the souk at last and walked on until he saw the familiar sign he was looking for british consulate he looked up the street and down no one seemed to be paying the least attention to him nothing it appeared would be easier than to walk into the safety of the consulate but he thought of an open mousetrap with a lovely piece of cheese that too was easy for the mouse well the risk had to be taken he went through the doorway chapter six richard baker came ashore from the indian queen in basrah the main port in the south of iraq as small cargo boats were often delayed he had given himself some spare time so he now had two days before he must go on via baghdad to join dr pauncefoot jones this was a good opportunity to visit some very interesting ancient ruins across the border in kuwait a plane left at ten the next morning of course a visa for kuwait was needed but it would be pleasant to meet the consulgeneral again the british consulate in basrah had a small gate from its garden to the road beside the shatt el arab river and a business entrance in the main street richard went in and was taken to a waiting room off the corridor which ran straight through to the garden there were several people in the waiting room richard hardly looked at them his thoughts happily in the year bc it would be hard to say what made him pay attention to the other human beings it was first a nervousness a sense of tension which reminded him of the war of a time when he and two others had parachuted and then waited in the cold of early morning for the moment to act a time of dread and it was this same smell that was in the air the smell of fear someone in this room was in fear of his life he looked around an arab in a ragged brown coat his fingers playing with the beads he held a fat englishman a thin darkskinned man who was sitting back his face peaceful an iraqi clerk an elderly iranian in white robes they all seemed quite relaxed the sound made by the beads had a pattern that seemed strangely familiar short long long short that was morse code richard could read it easily owl eton what yes it was being repeated the sounds made by the ragged arab owl eton owl owl had been richards nickname at eton he looked at the arab seeing the traditional black and white keffiyah around his head the striped robe the old khaki coat and a ragged handknitted red scarf there were hundreds of men like him down by the river the eyes met his but showed no sign of recognition but the beads continued to click fakir here get ready trouble fakir of course fakir carmichael a boy hed known at school who had been born out here in turkestan afghanistan richard took out his pipe looked into it and then tapped it on an ashtray message received fakir carmichael got up and crossed towards the door he almost fell as he was passing and caught hold of richard to steady himself he apologized and moved on after that things happened very fast the fat englishman pulled a gun from his pocket and richard knocked it out of his hand as it came up the gun fired and a bullet buried itself in the floor carmichael had passed through the doorway and turned towards the consuls office but he stopped suddenly then quickly ran the other way into the busy street the consulate police officer ran in richard was holding the fat mans arm the iraqi clerk was dancing excitedly the dark skinned thin man was staring and the elderly iranian was not interested richard cried what the hell are you doing there was a moments pause then the fat man replied sorry a silly accident nonsense you were going to shoot that arab no no not shoot him just give him a fright i recognized him suddenly as a man who had cheated me richard felt it was best to accept the explanation after all what could he prove and would carmichael thank him for starting an argument that would bring public attention if he were on secret business he would not richard let go of the mans arm the officer was still excited it is not allowed he was saying to bring guns into the british consulate the consul will be very angry i am sorry said the fat man little accident thats all id better get out of here he pushed a card suddenly at richard im at the airport hotel if theres any problem but it was an accident just a joke richard watched him walk out hoping he had done the right thing but it was difficult to know mr clayton is free now said the officer richard followed the man along the corridor towards the sunlight the consuls room was at the end of the passage mr clayton was sitting behind his desk a quiet greyhaired man with a thoughtful face i dont know if you remember me said richard we met in tehran two years ago of course you were with dr pauncefoot jones are you joining him again this year yes im on my way there now but ive got some time to spare so i wanted to fly down to kuwait theres no difficulty i suppose oh no ill telegram archie gaunt at the consulate you can stay there and wed be delighted to have you here tonight at the moment let me see weve got crosbie of the oil company and some young man of dr rathbones whos down here trying to get some cases of books through customs come upstairs and see rosa he took richard out into the sunny garden some steps led up to the private rooms of the consulate gerald clayton pushed open the door at the top and showed his guest into a cool hallway clayton called rosa and mrs clayton whom richard remembered as a cheerful woman full of energy came out of an end room you remember richard baker dear he came to see us with dr pauncefoot jones in tehran of course said mrs clayton shaking hands we went to the bazaars together and you bought some lovely rugs the best buys ive ever made said richard all due to your excellent bargaining baker wants to fly to kuwait tomorrow said gerald clayton ive said that he can stay with us tonight now i must get back theres been some trouble in the office somebody fired a gun one of the local sheikhs i suppose said mrs clayton they do so love guns no said richard it was an englishman who wanted to shoot an arab clayton took a card out of his pocket i have his card robert hall seems to be his name achilles works enfield i dont know what he wanted to see me about he wasnt drunk was he he said it was a joke said richard and that he had fired the gun by accident clayton raised his eyebrows salesmen dont usually carry guns i must get back he hurried away mrs clayton took richard into the sitting room and gave him a deliciously iced beer she asked why he was going to kuwait and he told her she asked why he hadnt got married yet and richard said he didnt think he was the marrying kind to which mrs clayton said nonsense archaeologists make splendid husbands and are there any young women coming out to the dig this season one or two richard explained and mrs pauncefoot jones of course mrs clayton asked hopefully if they were nice girls who were coming out and richard said he didnt know because he hadnt met them yet they were very inexperienced for some reason this made mrs clayton laugh richard found his room very comfortable and his opinion of mrs clayton rose still higher feeling in the pocket of his coat he took out a folded piece of dirty paper he looked at it with surprise then he remembered how carmichael had held on to him when he fell he unfolded the paper a major john wilberforce had written that ahmed mohammed was a good and willing worker able to drive a lorry and do minor repairs and completely honest it was the usual type of chit or reference given in the east frowning richard thought about the events of the morning carmichael had been afraid for his life he had run into the consulate to find safety but instead the enemy had been waiting for him and willing to risk shooting him in front of other people it must therefore be very urgent and carmichael had managed to pass this chit to his old school friend it must therefore be very important and carmichaels enemies would look for it what then should richard do with it he would keep it until carmichael came for it but first he must make it safe tearing half a sheet from an old letter baker sat down to write a chit for a lorry driver but using different words if this message was a code that would be the end of that then he covered the new chit with dust from his shoes and folded and refolded it until it looked old and dirty he looked at the original message for some time finally with a smile he folded it small then covered it in plasticine taken from his workbag then he took something else from his workbag something he had found on a dig he pressed it firmly into the plasticine he studied the result with satisfaction he had just made a beautiful design of the sun god shamash finally he put the copy of the new chit he had made in his coat pocket later that evening when he checked as he expected it had gone chapter seven travelling by air victoria thought was like being taken on a school trip kind but firm air hostesses like teachers dealing with children ordered you around at what seemed like every step they were now waiting in a large room opening directly on to heathrow airport outside the loud noise of a plane gave the perfect background to mrs hamilton clipp who victoria had realised was a nonstop talker were all here why cant they hurry up theyre running late what are we waiting for her question seemed to be answered almost before the words were out of her mouth the door from the customs and passport department swung open and a tall man came through in a very dramatic manner air officials were all around him and two large sacks were being carried by a boac officer mrs clipp sat up straight hes certainly somebody important she remarked and he knows it thought victoria the late travellers appearance was calculated to cause a sensation he wore a darkgrey travelling cloak on his head was a very large wide hat he had silvergrey curly hair worn rather long and a beautiful large silvergrey moustache yes he certainly knew how to be dramatic victoria who disliked theatrical men looked at him with disapproval the air officials were she saw with displeasure most attentive yes sir rupert of course sir rupert the plane is leaving immediately sir rupert my dear said mrs clipp excitedly thats sir rupert crofton lee the great traveller youve heard of him of course yes victoria remembered now she had seen pictures in the newspapers sir rupert was a great expert on china he was one of the few people who had been to tibet and travelled through the unknown parts of kurdistan his books had sold well because they had been written with humour and in an exciting style sir rupert was an excellent advertisement for himself he said nothing that was not true with a swing of his great cloak sir rupert passed through the door to the airport now then please said the air hostess take your seats in the plane this way as quickly as you can please victoria helped mrs clipp into her seat and sat next to her in front of them was the great man the doors closed the plane began to move were really going thought victoria with delight oh isnt it frightening what if it never gets off the ground really i dont see how it can the engines were making a terrifying noise louder and louder the aeroplane moved faster faster still they were rushing along it will never go up thought victoria well be killed faster more smoothly no bumps they were flying she could see a silly little train below dolls houses toy cars on roads higher still and suddenly the earth below was just a flat map people undid their safetybelts opened magazines victoria was in a new world below her were white clouds the plane was in the sun in front of her sir rupert stood up carelessly threw his large hat up with the hand luggage and relaxed into his seat what a showoff thought victoria irritated she saw with some pleasure that sir rupert had a boil starting on the back of his neck it made the great man seem more human stopping first in cairo en route for baghdad mrs hamilton clipp said that she was going to sleep until six and suggested that victoria might like to see the pyramids ive arranged a car for you miss jones victoria was very grateful and said so with warmth the afternoon at the pyramids was so enjoyable that victoria wished she could stay a week in cairo perhaps go up the nile and what would you use for money she thought as she sleepily lay down on her bed and what are you going to do once you land in baghdad with only a few pounds in your pocket victoria decided to ignore that thought too why worry her eyes tired from the strong sunlight closed gently a knock on the door woke victoria she got off the bed and opened it but the knock had been at the next door it was another air hostess darkhaired and formal in her uniform sir rupert crofton lee opened the door just as victoria looked out im so sorry sir rupert the air hostess was charming but would you mind coming to the boac office just a detail about the flight to baghdad tomorrow victoria went back into her room less sleepy now she looked at her watch an hour and a half until mrs clipp would need her she decided to go for a walk walking at least needed no money she came out of her room three doors down she passed the boac office it had a card hanging on the door just as she passed sir rupert came out walking fast he passed her quickly and went on ahead his cloak swinging mrs clipp was in a difficult mood when victoria reported for duty im worried about the excess baggage miss jones my ticket to baghdad is paid for but it seems the excess baggage was only paid for to cairo with boac we go on tomorrow by iraqi airways perhaps you could find out victoria could not find the boac office at first but finally she found it in a corridor at the other side of the hotel it was quite a big office the other office she supposed had been a small one only used during the afternoon mrs clipps fears about the excess baggage were justified which annoyed her very much chapter eight in an office in london a man picked up the ringing telephone he said quietly valhalla gramophone company sanders here weve lost anna scheele there was a moments silence then the quiet voice became hard how she went into that private hospital where her sister was having an operation that went well and we expected anna scheele to return to the savoy she didnt we were sure she hadnt left the hospital weve just found out she left in an ambulance the day after the operation but im sure she didnt know she was being followed we were very careful never mind the excuses where did the ambulance take her university college hospital a nurse came in with a patient it must have been anna scheele theyve no idea where she went check all bookings to baghdad by plane for the next two weeks the other interrupted she wont be using her own name check all passengers of suitable age her baggage is still at the savoy perhaps shell come back for it she wont you may be a fool she isnt check those bookings shes got to get to baghdad and by air is the only way she can do it in time chapter nine from baghdad airport to the tio hotel victorias ears had been attacked nonstop by noise horribly loud car horns people shouting whistles blowing and the neverending sound of mrs hamilton clipp talking as well as that there was a thick brown dust storm in progress palm trees houses humans were all covered victoria was not impressed she arrived at the tio hotel feeling terrible an alley led from rashid street towards the tigris river at the entrance of the hotel they were greeted by a fat young man with a very big smile this was marcus tio the owner of the tio hotel his words of welcome were interrupted as he shouted orders to servants about their baggage here you are once more mrs clipp but what has happened to your poor arm you fools do not carry that case like that idiots but my dear what a day to arrive and you have brought a young lady with you it is nice always to see a new young lady in baghdad but my dear you must have a drink at once sometime later her head spinning from a large whisky which marcus had insisted she drank victoria found herself in a white room containing a large bed a dressingtable a wardrobe and two comfortable chairs the dust had changed victorias hair from black to redbrown and her face was sore she pulled aside the curtain and looked out onto a wide balcony above the river but there was nothing to be seen of the tigris only thick dust after a bath lunch and a long sleep victoria stepped out on to the balcony and looked with approval across the tigris the dust storm had passed and she could see palm trees and houses in the pale light voices came up from the garden below mrs hamilton clipp was talking with one of those suntanned englishwomen who can always be found in any foreign city and i really dont know what id have done without her mrs clipp was saying shes the sweetest girl you can imagine and very well connected a niece of the bishop of llangow bishop of llangow nonsense theres no such person said the other woman victoria frowned she recognized the type of englishwoman who is unlikely to be tricked by false bishops perhaps i got the name wrong mrs clipp said doubtfully but she certainly is a very charming and capable girl ha the voice said victoria decided to avoid this lady and started to consider her situation she was sure the tio hotel was expensive and mrs clipp would not be paying for her travelling expenses to baghdad were what mrs clipp had offered the contract was completed mrs hamilton clipp would leave on the evening train to kirkuk and that was the end of that what then must victoria do the answer came immediately find edward of course and edward must find her a job with some irritation she realized that she did not know edwards last name but he had come to baghdad as the secretary of a dr rathbone an important man victoria went downstairs in search of information going through the hall she went out on to the terrace by the river somebody spoke from behind her i must introduce myself im mrs cardew trench i believe you arrived with mrs hamilton clipp it was the englishwoman she had the loud voice of someone used to giving orders she was drinking whisky yes said victoria wishing to escape quickly i did she told me you were the niece of the bishop of llangow victoria collected her strength did she really she asked with a polite smile got it wrong i suppose victoria smiled americans do get some of our names wrong it does sound like llangow my uncle is the bishop of languao languao yes in the pacific hes a colonial bishop of course oh a colonial bishop said mrs cardew trench that explains it victoria thought with pride that it explained it very well and what are you doing here continued mrs cardew trench looking for a young man i talked to for a few moments in a public square in london was not really an answer that victoria could give remembering what she had told mrs clipp she said im joining my uncle dr pauncefoot jones oh so thats who you are mrs cardew trench was delighted at having found out who victoria was connected to hes a charming little man though hes always forgetting things i heard him talk last year in london excellent speaker i couldnt understand a word though yes he passed through baghdad about two weeks ago i think he mentioned some girls were coming out later on now it was clear that she was respectable victoria asked do you know if dr rathbone is here he just arrived said mrs cardew trench world brotherhood what nonsense all this poetry and translating shakespeare and wordsworth into arabic a primrose by the rivers brim whats the good of that to people who have never seen such a flower where is he staying do you know at the babylonian palace hotel i believe but his offices are up near the museum the olive branch silly name full of young women in trousers she said clearly shocked at such a modern style of dress i know his secretary slightly said victoria oh yes that young man edward nice boy too good for that longhaired crowd of people he did well in the war i hear still a jobs a job i suppose goodlooking boy those serious young women are interested in him i imagine victoria began to feel rather jealous the olive branch she said where did you say it was up past the second bridge off rashid street not far from the copper bazaar and hows mrs pauncefoot jones continued mrs cardew trench coming soon i hear shes been in poor health but victoria had what she wanted and was taking no more risks she looked at her wristwatch and cried oh dear i promised to wake mrs clipp and help her prepare for the journey i must fly chapter ten victoria woke to a morning of bright sunshine and went out on to the balcony sitting a little way along was a man with grey hair curling down on to his redbrown neck with surprise victoria recognized sir rupert crofton lee why she was surprised she could not say perhaps because she thought an important man such as sir rupert would have been staying at the embassy but here he was staring at the tigris after breakfast victoria went to look for the olive branch baghdad was completely different from her idea of it people shouting and a main road filled with cars sounding their horns angrily in the shop windows there was a strange mixture of european goods babies shoes and woollen clothes toothpaste and face creams electric torches and china cups and saucers all shown together most people wore poor quality western clothes bits of old army uniforms and there were a few figures with long black clothes their faces covered who went almost unnoticed women with dirty babies in their arms asking for money came up to her the road was in poor condition with the occasional large hole she felt lost and far from home here there was no beauty only confusion she came to the first bridge passed it and went on and slowly a kind of delight came over her the pleasure of seeing all sorts of goods coming from all over the world to satisfy the desires of so many different people and then she heard a great hammering on metal looking along an alley victoria saw the copper bazaar for the next hour she forgot the olive branch the copper bazaar delighted her the blowlamps the redhot metal the whole process of making things with copper was wonderful she walked slowly through the souk came out of the copper bazaar and saw bright striped horse blankets cotton bedcovers and huge rolls of cheap cottons in pretty colours occasionally with its owner shouting balek balek a loaded donkey pushed past her or men carrying heavy loads on their backs little boys carrying trays round their necks pushed their goods towards her with loud calls to buy victoria walked in a happy dream at every turn under the large cool arches and in the alleys you came to something unexpected men sitting sewing a line of watches and cheap jewellery expensive and richly coloured cloth balek a donkey carrying a huge load made victoria step aside into a dark alley that turned and twisted between tall houses there by chance she looked into a courtyard and at its far side was a doorway with a huge sign the olive branch happily victoria ran across the courtyard and through the open door she found herself in a poorlylit room with tables covered with books and magazines and more books on shelves and groups of chairs here and there out of the darkness a young woman said in careful english can i help you she wore trousers and an orange shirt and had dull black hair she had large sad dark eyes and a heavy nose is is dr rathbone here victoria asked it was maddening not to know edwards last name yes dr rathbone the olive branch you wish to join us yes that will be very nice well perhaps can i see dr rathbone please the young woman smiled in a tired way we do not interrupt i have a form i tell you all about everything then you write your name it is two dinars please im not sure yet that i want to join said victoria worried about the money id like to see dr rathbone or his secretary his secretary would be fine i explain to you everything we all are friends here friends together friends for the future reading very fine educational books speaking poems to each other dr rathbones secretary said victoria loudly and clearly he particularly told me to ask for him a growing determination to win the argument showed on the young womans face not today she said we do not interrupt unhappily instead of the olive branch creating friendly feelings it seemed to be having the opposite effect i have just arrived from england victoria insisted please take me to dr rathbone at once at once the young woman turned and led victoria to the back of the room up a staircase and along a passage she knocked at a door come in victorias guide opened the door it is a lady from england for you from behind a large desk covered with papers an important looking whitehaired man of about sixty got up he looked kind and charming and welcomed victoria with a warm smile they shook hands so youve just come out from england he said yes im a friend of edwards why what a lovely surprise for him when he gets back said dr rathbone back said victoria yes edwards at basrah i had to send him down there to see about some books there have been the most annoying problems with customs edwards good at that sort of thing hes a fine young man his eyes twinkled but i dont suppose i need to sing edwards praises to you young lady when when will edward be back from basrah asked victoria hopefully not till hes finished the job and you cant hurry things in this country tell me where you are staying and ill make sure he gets in touch as soon as hes here i was wondering if i could do some work here victoria spoke urgently thinking of her money troubles yes of course you can be most valuable said dr rathbone warmly our work is going very well but theres lots more to do ive got thirty volunteers already all of them very enthusiastic volunteering would not help victoria i really wanted a paid job she said oh dear dr rathbone lost his smile thats difficult our paid staff is very small and with the volunteers its enough i really must find a job explained victoria my dear young lady i hope youll help us in your spare time most of our workers have their own jobs youll find it a great experience to help us there must be an end to all the violence in the world the wars the misunderstandings a common meeting ground thats what we need drama art poetry the great things of the heart no room there for jealousy or hatred nno said victoria doubtfully ive had a midsummer nights dream translated into forty languages said dr rathbone forty different groups of young people all reading the same wonderful literature young people thats the secret its the young who must get together for example that girl catherine who brought you up here shes a syrian from damascus normally you and she would never have met but at the olive branch you and she and many others all meet and like each other thats how the world is meant to be victoria could not help thinking that dr rathbone was fooling himself she and catherine for instance had not liked each other at all and victoria strongly suspected that the more they saw of each other the greater their dislike would grow edwards excellent said dr rathbone friends with everybody all the girls admire edward theyll do anything for him he and catherine get on particularly well indeed said victoria coldly her dislike of catherine grew even stronger well said dr rathbone smiling come and help us if you can he shook her hand warmly downstairs catherine was talking to a girl who had just come in with a suitcase she was a goodlooking darkhaired girl and victoria thought she had seen her before but the girl looked at her without any recognition forcing herself to say goodbye politely to catherine victoria went out she returned to the hotel trying not to think about her own problems a girl in baghdad without any money instead she considered dr rathbone and the olive branch edward had an idea that there was something not right about dr rathbone but victoria thought that he was just one of those people who are so sure of what they believe that they cannot see what the world is really like chapter eleven victoria arrived back at the hotel tio with sore feet marcus who was sitting out on the terrace overlooking the river and talking to a thin rather tiredlooking middleaged man called out to her enthusiastically come and have a drink with us miss jones this is mr dakin now then my dear what will you have victoria said she would have a cocktail and she suggested hopefully some of those lovely nuts mr dakin said in a sad voice that he would have a lemonade and marcus gave the order in rapid arabic ah cried marcus here is mrs cardew trench you know mr dakin what will you have gin and lime said mrs cardew trench nodding to dakin you look hot she added to victoria ive been walking around seeing the city when the drinks came victoria ate a large plateful of nuts and some potato chips after a while a short solidlooking man came up the steps and marcus introduced him to victoria as captain crosbie just arrived he asked her yesterday i didnt think i had seen you before she is very nice and beautiful is she not said marcus joyfully oh yes it is very nice to have miss victoria i will give a very nice party for her oh it is very good we will have a long dinner that goes on for hours that will be lovely said victoria feeling quite weak with hunger i thought youd gone to basrah said mrs cardew trench to crosbie i got back yesterday said crosbie he looked up at the balcony whos that he asked the man in the big hat that my dear is sir rupert crofton lee said marcus he came last night from the british embassy he is a very nice man a great traveller he rides on camels over the sahara and climbs up mountains it is very uncomfortable and dangerous that kind of life i would not like it myself oh hes that man is he said crosbie ive read his book i came over on the plane with him said victoria both men or so it seemed to her looked at her with interest hes very pleased with himself said victoria i knew his aunt in india said mrs cardew trench the whole family is like that they are terribly clever but they cant help telling everyone another drink marcus demanded not for me said victoria quickly thanking marcus for the drink victoria went up and lay down on her bed to do some serious thinking how long would it be before marcus presented her bill she had no idea when would edward get back from basrah perhaps she thought horrified edward would have forgotten all about her why on earth had she come rushing out to baghdad in this silly way she must get a job any job if not they would take her to a consul and she would be sent back to england and never see edward again at this point exhausted from all the emotion victoria fell asleep she woke hours later and decided its no good worrying anymore so going down to the restaurant she ate the entire menu when she had finished she felt very very full but much happier before going to bed she went out on to the terrace one of the waiters was standing beside the railing looking down into the water he jumped guiltily when victoria appeared and hurried back into the hotel by the service door victoria was delighted by the tigris in the moonlight well anyway ive got here said victoria to herself feeling much happier and ill manage somehow everything will be alright in the end as she went up to bed the waiter came quietly out again and finished what he had been trying to do which was to tie a rope so that it hung down to the river having done this mr dakin went back into the shadows where he changed from the waiters white coat back into his own blue suit soon another man joined him dakin asked in a low voice everything alright yes sir nothing suspicious to report crosbie said quietly whos the girl she says shes the niece of the archaeologist pauncefoot jones but she came on the same plane as crofton lee yes we must be careful said dakin crosbie replied do you really think its best to move from the embassy to here in spite of the whole thing being planned to the smallest detail it was planned to the smallest detail in basrah and that ended with salah hassan poisoned and a shooting at the consulate if our plans are known its easy for the other side to act i doubt carmichael could get near the embassy and even if he did he shook his head here only you and i and crofton lee know whats going on theyll know crofton lee moved here from the embassy of course but crosbie whatever the enemy does theyve got to do it quickly and without planning they couldnt possibly have put someone into the tio six months ago to be ready and waiting the tios never been part of the plan until now he looked at his watch ill go up and see crofton lee now sir ruperts door opened silently to let dakin in there was only one small lamp on and the traveller had placed his chair beside it as he sat down again he put a small gun onto the table whats your opinion dakin do you think carmichael will come yes sir rupert then he said youve never met him have you no sir rupert looked at him sharply youve got the place guarded crosbies on the balcony and i shall be watching the stairs when carmichael reaches you knock on the wall and ill come in crofton lee nodded dakin went quietly out of the room chapter twelve victoria having slept most of the afternoon didnt feel sleepy at all so she sat down and wrote several advertisements to find work a telegram asking for help from her only living relative a very old and unpleasant gentleman who had never helped anybody in his life then she tried out a new hair style and finally with a sudden sigh she was ready for bed at that moment her bedroom door opened a man came in locked the door and said to her urgently please hide me quickly victorias reactions were never slow in a second she had noted the painful breathing the weak voice and the desperate way the man held an old red knitted scarf against his chest she responded immediately to the adventure the bed was large and memories of playing hideandseek as a child made victoria say quick she pushed off the pillows and opened the sheet and blanket the man lay across the top of the bed victoria pulled the sheet and blanket over him and put the pillows on top almost immediately there was a knock at the door open the door please it is the police said a mans voice as victoria crossed the room she noticed the red knitted scarf on the floor she picked it up and put it into a drawer then opening the door a little she looked out nervously a darkhaired young man in a striped suit was outside and behind him was a man in police uniform whats the matter victoria asked in alarm the young man smiled brightly i am so sorry miss to trouble you at this hour but a criminal has escaped he has run into this hotel we must look in every room he is very dangerous oh dear victoria stepped back opening the door wide how frightening look in the bathroom please oh and the wardrobe and under the bed he might have been there all evening the search was very quick no he is not here youre sure thank you miss the young man bowed and they left victoria relocked the door and turned to the bed she had probably been very foolish letting her romantic nature put her on the side of the hunted against the hunter she said abruptly theyve gone you can get up now there was no movement under the pillows impatiently victoria threw them off the young man lay as she had left him but now his face was grey his eyes were closed and a bright red mark was spreading on the blanket oh no said victoria oh no the wounded man opened his eyes and looked at her as though from very far away his lips opened the sound was so quiet that victoria had to move very close what with great difficulty the young man said two words lucifer basrah his eyes closed he said one word more then he lay still victorias heart was beating violently she was filled with pity and anger a sound made her turn the key had fallen out of her door she heard the lock turning the door opened and mr dakin came in closing the door behind him he walked across to her saying quietly nice work my dear you think quickly how is he with a break in her voice victoria said hes hes dead she saw the others face change saw a flash of violent anger then it was gone only now it seemed to her that the tiredness she had seen in his face yesterday had gone too and that something quite different was in its place he gently opened the dead mans jacket he was stabbed through the heart said dakin as he stood up carmichael was a brave man and a clever one victoria managed to say the police came they said he was a criminal no he wasnt a criminal were they really the police they may have been said dakin did he say anything before he died yes lucifer and then basrah and then he said i think it was a french name it sounded like lefarge what does it all mean and what must i do i dont want you connected with this if thats possible said dakin ill come back later and tell you what its all about the first thing to do is to get hold of marcus just do something about your appearance before i bring him in marcus will always help a beautiful woman in distress he left the room as though in a dream victoria combed back her hair made up her face so it seemed white with shock and fell on to a chair as dakin came in behind him came marcus tio this time there was not the usual smile on his face now marcus said mr dakin you must do what you can about this its been a terrible shock to this poor girl the man ran in shes got a very kind heart and she hid him from the police and now hes dead of course she did said marcus nobody likes the police i do not like the police but i have to keep good relations with them because of my hotel you want me to give them money we want you to take the body away quietly that is very nice i agree i too i do not want a body in my hotel but it is not so easy to do i think it could be said dakin youve got a doctor in your family havent you yes paul my sisters husband but i do not want him in trouble he wont be said dakin listen marcus we move the body into my room that way miss jones is no longer involved then i use your telephone in ten minutes a young man comes into the hotel he is very drunk he holds his side he shouts for me he walks into my room and falls i come out and ask you for a doctor your brotherinlaw sends for an ambulance and goes in it with this drunken friend of mine before they get to the hospital my friend is dead he has been stabbed in the street before coming into your hotel that is all right for you and the young man who plays the drunk he goes away quietly and there is no body found in my hotel and miss jones does not get any worry i think that is a very good idea chapter thirteen victoria lay in bed listening she heard loud drunken arguing heard a voice insisting i had a fight with a man outside she heard bells ring more voices and a lot of movement then silence she heard the gentle opening of her door and sat up in bed and switched on the lamp dakin brought a chair up to the bed sat down and looked at her as if he was a doctor tell me what its all about demanded victoria suppose said dakin that you tell me all about yourself first why did you come to baghdad victoria thought afterwards that it was something in dakins personality but for once she simply told him everything her meeting with edward her determination to get to baghdad and the wonderful luck of mrs hamilton clipp i see said dakin when she had finished the point is you are involved in this whether i like it or not so you might as well work for me youve got a job for me victoria said hopefully this job victoria is dangerous oh thats all right said victoria happily she added doubtfully its not dishonest is it i know i tell an awful lot of lies but i wouldnt like to do anything dishonest dakin smiled strangely enough your ability to invent a good lie quickly is one of your qualifications for the job no its not dishonest in fact you will be working for law and order have you thought much about world politics i know everybody says theres going to be another war sooner or later between russia and america exactly said mr dakin therefore everything depends on them agreeing with each other instead the opposite is happening every time there is a chance of agreement something happens to create more distrust or hysterical fear these things are not accidents victoria they are deliberate a group is working undercover to cause this destruction a group that wants to take control but how do you know money victoria money is always the clue to what is happening in the world its the key to any plan a group of people are cleverly moving very large sums of money around and using that money to create conflict but who are these people idealists who intend i fear to make the world better to think that you can force perfection on the human race is one of the most dangerous ideas in existence the belief that some men are supermen and therefore good enough to rule the world that victoria is the most evil of all beliefs for when you say i am not like other men you have lost the two most valuable qualities humility and brotherhood he sighed well i mustnt preach a sermon what we know is that in the past two years many of the best young scientists have disappeared the same has happened with engineers and other people with valuable skills and we are beginning to guess what they are doing victoria listened with increasing concern there is a remote part of the world protected by mountains and deserts that is only visited by exceptional travellers it can be reached from china or the himalayas but the journey is hard and long machines and people from all over the world are being sent there one man followed that route what he found was so incredible that when he got back to civilization only two people believed his story one was myself and because he had been to these remote regions the other was sir rupert crofton lee it was from one of these journeys that sir rupert brought back some uraniumrich rock the result was that carmichael a man who works for us in the intelligence service decided to go on a desperate journey we heard nothing for nine months then news came hed got what he went to get proof but the other side knew about him and their agents were already inside our whole system some at a very high level somehow or other carmichael got through safely until tonight then that was the dead man in my room yes my dear a very brave young man but what about the proof did they get it a slow smile showed on dakins tired face knowing carmichael im sure they didnt but he died without being able to tell us where that proof is i think he tried to give us a clue he repeated slowly lucifer basrah lefarge hed been in basrah he tried to report at the consulate and was very nearly shot its possible that he left the proof in basrah what i want you to do victoria is to go there and try to find out me id love to go to basrah said victoria with enthusiasm dakin smiled it suits you because your young man is there eh what a very good reason for going there nothing could seem more natural you go to basrah and look for what lucifer and lefarge mean what do i use for money said victoria in a businesslike way i did some reading on the plane and its about three hundred and forty miles to basrah dakin handed her a roll of paper money talk to mrs cardew trench tomorrow morning say you want to visit basrah before you go off to this dig youre pretending to work at shell tell you at once that you must stay at the consulate and will send a telegram to mrs clayton youll probably find your edward there everyone who passes through stays with the claytons apart from that i give you one warning if er anything unpleasant happens if youre asked what you know dont try and be a hero tell them everything at once thank you said victoria im rather afraid of pain and if anyone were to torture me im afraid i wouldnt be brave they wont torture you said mr dakin tortures very old fashioned theyll put a drug in your arm and youll answer every question truthfully thats why i didnt want you to get grand ideas of secrecy what about edward do i tell him dakin thought for a moment that would put him in danger too but i understand he had a good record in the air force i dont suppose danger will worry him two heads are often better than one and he thinks theres something suspicious about this olive branch hes working for thats interesting why because we think so too said dakin then he added and keep your ears open for any mention of a young woman called anna scheele we would really like to know much more about her chapter fourteen a car met victoria at the station she was driven to the consulate and in through big gates into a delightful garden the car stopped in front of steps leading up to a balcony surrounding the house mrs clayton a smiling energetic woman came through a door at the top of the steps to meet her were so pleased to see you she said basrahs really delightful at this time of year though theres no one here now except dr rathbones young man whos quite charming what would you like first a bath or some coffee a bath please said victoria gratefully if possible victoria hoped to meet edward alone with this in mind when she had bathed and put on a summer dress she went quietly out to sit on the balcony the first to arrive was a tall thin man with a thoughtful face and as he came up the steps victoria went to stand out of sight round the corner of the balcony as she did so she saw edward entering through a garden gate that opened on to the river victoria called out quietly up here edward who was victoria thought more attractive than ever turned quickly and complete surprise appeared on his face my goodness victoria quiet wait for me im coming down victoria ran round the balcony down the steps and along to where edward stood confusion still on his face i cant be drunk so early in the day said edward it is you yes its me said victoria happily but its unbelievable how did you get here i flew i mean what wonderful chance brought you to basrah the train said victoria youre doing it on purpose you little witch i am so pleased to see you but how did you get here really i came out with an american woman whod broken her arm i was offered the job the day after i met you and youd talked about baghdad so i thought why not see the world you really are great fun victoria but what are you doing now im still seeing the world said victoria but ive had to do a few tricks the idea is that i am miss pauncefoot jones my uncle is a famous archaeologist who is working out here and i am joining him soon oh excellent thats a good story but what will happen if you and jones come face to face i dont think that is likely from what i hear once archaeologists start to dig they go on digging like mad and dont stop i say you really are wonderful victoria said edward admiringly ive never met anyone like you edwards admiring look caused victoria great satisfaction if she had been a cat she would have purred and you will actually want a job wont you said edward yes said victoria i actually went into your olive branch and asked dr rathbone for a job but he wasnt helpful the old man is tight with his money said edward he wants everybody to work for love do you think hes a fake edward i dont know exactly what i think he doesnt make any money so far as i can see all that enthusiasm is real and yet you know i dont believe hes a fool wed better go in said victoria we can talk later id no idea you and edward knew each other said mrs clayton oh were old friends laughed victoria only wed lost contact id no idea edward was here mr clayton who was the man victoria had seen coming up the steps asked how did you get on this morning edward any progress oh the books are there sir but the forms to get them are unending the person you need always seems to be away that day everyone is very willing only nothing seems to happen everyone laughed and mrs clayton said youll get them in the end it was very wise of dr rathbone to send someone down personally as everything was closed during the midday hours edward and victoria went out after lunch to see the sights victoria was delighted with the shatt el arab river and the palm trees beside it she loved the arab boats tied up in the canal in the town they walked slowly into the souk when they turned towards the consulate and edward was preparing to leave for work victoria asked suddenly edward whats your last name i dont know it edward stared at her dont you no i suppose you dont its goring edward goring youve no idea what a fool i felt going into that olive branch place and wanting to ask for you and not knowing anything but edward was there a darkskinned girl there with rather long hair yes thats catherine if you said edward shed know i am sure she would said victoria without enthusiasm shes a very nice girl didnt you think so oh very kind is she victorias voice was now as cold as ice but edward did not seem to notice i dont know what i would have done without her im sure you and she will be great friends i dont think well have the chance oh yes you will im going to get you a job there how are you going to manage that i dont know but i shall manage it somehow if not next thing i know youll be heading for burma no young victoria im not going to take any chances i dont want you running away from me youre too fond of seeing the world you sweet fool thought victoria to herself dont you know that nothing would drive me away from baghdad now aloud she said well it would be fun to have a job at the olive branch i wouldnt describe it as fun the organization means well but its all a bit silly too and do you still think theres something wrong about it oh that was only a wild idea of mine no said victoria thoughtfully i think its true edward turned on her quickly what makes you say that something i heard from a friend of mine who was it just a friend girls like you have too many friends edward complained you are a devil victoria i love you madly and you dont care a bit oh yes i do said victoria just a little bit then hiding her delighted satisfaction she asked edward is there anyone called lefarge connected with the olive branch lefarge edward looked doubtful no i dont think so or anyone called anna scheele this time edwards reaction was very different he caught her arm what do you know about anna scheele ow edward let go i dont know anything about her i just wanted to know if you did where did you hear about her what made you think this anna scheele had anything to do with the olive branch has she edward said slowly i dont know its all so so unclear he looked at his watch i must go he said but weve got to get together victoria theres a lot i want to know that evening edward and victoria walked together in the consulate garden the sunset was beautiful but neither of the young people noticed it it began simply said victoria with a man coming into my room at the tio hotel and getting stabbed it was not perhaps most peoples idea of a simple beginning edward said getting what stabbed said victoria anyway she added he was dead how could he come into your room if he was dead oh edward dont be stupid for some mysterious reason victoria could never tell the truth in a simple way her story was uncertain and incomplete and it sounded as if she was telling a terrible lie when she came to the end edward looked at her doubtfully and said you do feel alright victoria dont you i mean you havent had a dream or anything of course not because i mean it seems such an impossible thing to have happened well it did happen victoria insisted and all that dramatic stuff about world powers and mysterious secrets things like that simply dont happen honest victoria are you making this up no cried victoria annoyed and youve come down here looking for someone called lefarge and someone called anna scheele whom youve heard of victoria added yes but i dont know if it means anything it was just odd you see victoria im not as clever as you you see things and you understand what those things mean i just sort of feel that things are well wrong but i dont know why i feel like that sometimes too said victoria like seeing sir rupert on the balcony of the tio hotel whos sir rupert sir rupert crofton lee he was on the plane coming out a famous man and when i saw him sitting on the balcony at the tio i had that strange feeling like youve just said that something was wrong but i didnt know what it was rathbone asked him to come and give a talk at the olive branch i believe but he couldnt come well go on about anna scheele oh anna scheele it was one of the girls catherine said victoria immediately i believe it was now i think of it well catherine said to one of the other girls when anna scheele comes we can move forward then well get our orders from her and her alone thats really important edward didnt you think it was strange at the time no of course i didnt i thought it was just some woman who was coming out perhaps a new boss are you sure youre not imagining all this victoria as soon as he saw the look his young friend gave him he was immediately sorry all right all right he said quickly only youll admit the whole story just doesnt seem real and you are very good at making things up the bishop of llangow and all that oh that was just girlish fun said victoria this is serious but look here edward how do you know a call from the balcony interrupted her come in you two drinks waiting coming called victoria victoria went to bed that night with strangely mixed feelings her journey had ended and she had found edward then she shuddered in spite of everything she had a feeling of disappointment words floated through her head something she had meant to ask edward in the garden but mrs clayton had called and it had gone out of her head she must remember because it was important something was wrong if only she could remember before sleep victoria dreamed she dreamed of a woman coming towards her along a hotel corridor it was herself but when the woman got near she saw the face was catherines edward and catherine how silly come with me she said to edward we will find mr lefarge and suddenly edward had gone and she was alone in the dark with evil all around her and she was holding a brown coat covered with blood she was running in terror down a hotel corridor and they were coming after her victoria woke suddenly from her dream her heart beating wildly chapter fifteen you found your young man asked mr dakin victoria nodded yes and edward thinks he can get me a job at the olive branch and they know something about anna scheele there victoria repeated what edward had told her now thats very interesting said mr dakin who is anna scheele asked victoria shes secretary to the head of an international bank she disappeared in london about ten days ago is she coming to baghdad if we can believe this young woman catherine then yes she is mr dakin said thoughtfully perhaps i can find out more at the olive branch perhaps but be very careful victoria i would prefer not to have your body floating in the river victoria shuddered like sir rupert crofton lees that was horrible mrs clayton got the awful news at breakfast thats when we heard it a report from cairo announcing that the body of sir rupert has been taken out of the nile first carmichael and now sir rupert all the people who know about this business are being killed you know that morning when sir rupert was here at the hotel there was something strange about him in what way strange well different she shook her head annoyed i will remember it sometime anyway there is something i want to ask you who stabbed carmichael was it someone who followed him here no said dakin slowly he came in one of those arab boats and he wasnt followed i had someone watching the river then it was someone in the hotel yes i was watching the stairs and no one came up yet all the people in the hotel are unlikely for one very good reason what is that carmichael was on his guard he had a very strong instinct for danger so he must have been stabbed by someone he trusted somehow edward had persuaded dr rathbone to offer victoria a very lowpaid job she spent most of her time typing or encouraging good feeling amongst visitors who mostly looked at one another with dislike the olive branch was full of that sort of international peace the meetings were held with orange juice to drink and boring food to go with it as far as victoria could see everything was respectable and very dull she was now living with some other young female workers in a house by the river it seemed to victoria that catherine watched her in an unfriendly way it was known that edward had helped victoria get her job and several pairs of jealous eyes looked at her unkindly though the olive branch seemed respectable victoria had a strong feeling that dr rathbone was not once or twice she noticed his dark eyes looking at her and though she returned her most innocent and sweet expression she felt a sudden shock of fear she rarely saw edward since he was always being sent to far off places by dr rathbone he had only just come back from iran really thought victoria i see so little of edward i might as well have stayed in england soon afterwards however edward brought her some papers dr rathbone would like these typed at once please victoria a tiny note in edwards handwriting was pinned to the top sheet the tigris riverbank past the house of king ali tomorrow morning about eleven the following day was friday the weekly holiday victoria s spirits rose high she really must get her hair washed it really needs it she said aloud what did you say catherine at work on a pile of leaflets raised her head suspiciously from the next table victoria said my hair needs washing most of these hairdressing places look so dirty i dont know where to go yes they are dirty but i know a girl who washes hair very well and the towels are clean i will take you there thats very kind of you catherine we will go tomorrow thank you said victoria thats very kind but not tomorrow chapter sixteen the old car bumped madly over the rough road the driver turned and smiled at them where are we going to babylon said edward its time we had a day out to babylon cried victoria how lovely really to babylon yes but dont expect too much babylon isnt as impressive as it was the road isnt very good is it gasped victoria bouncing in her seat it gets worse later on said edward they bounced along happily the dust rose in clouds large lorries full of arabs raced along in the middle of the road paying no attention to the other drivers they passed walled gardens and groups of women and children and donkeys and to victoria it was all delightful they reached babylon in two hours and were happy to get out of the car the pile of mud and ruins was a disappointment to victoria who had expected columns and arches but her disappointment disappeared as their guide led them along the processional way to the ishtar gate with their pictures of unbelievable animals high on the walls a sudden sense of a grand history came to victoria and a wish to know something about this huge proud city that now lay dead and empty after a while they sat down by the babylonian lion to eat the picnic lunch that edward had brought the guide moved away smiling and telling them firmly that they must see the museum later must we said victoria dreamily things in glass cases dont seem real somehow i went to the british museum once it was very tiring for the feet the past is always boring said edward the futures much more important this isnt boring said victoria waving a sandwich towards the ruins theres a feeling of of greatness here a city of great kings would you have liked to be a king of babylon edward edward took a deep breath yes i would they understood how to be kings in those days thats why they could rule the world and put everything in order how strange thought victoria to be sitting in the ruins of babylon talking like this the sun was very hot and bright and the ruins were pale and shimmering in the heat with a background of dark palm trees how very nicely edwards hair grew down with a little curl into his neck victoria found herself thinking and what a nice neck brown from the sun with no marks on it suddenly victoria sat up straight wildly excited ive just remembered about sir rupert crofton lee edward looked at her blankly he sat in front of me in the plane and i saw it a boil on his neck why shouldnt he have a boil painful but lots of people get them yes yes of course but the point is that morning on the balcony he didnt have one one what a boil oh edward do try and understand in the aeroplane he had a boil and on the balcony at the tio he didnt his neck was unmarked so you see what it means the man at the tio wasnt sir rupert she nodded violently edward stared at her youre mad victoria it must have been sir rupert no dont you see edward i never looked at him properly only at the general effect the hat the cloak the whole appearance how easy to copy that but why because of carmichael of course carmichael was coming to baghdad to tell him what he had discovered and carmichael wouldnt be on his guard with him of course it was the false rupert crofton lee who stabbed carmichael i dont believe a word of it its madness dont forget sir rupert was killed too afterwards in cairo oh edward how awful i saw it happen you saw it happen victoria are you completely mad no not at all just listen edward there was a knock on my door in the hotel in cairo at least i thought it was on my door and i looked out but it was actually next door to mine on sir rupert crofton lees it was one of the air hostesses she asked him if he could go to the boac office dont you see edward it was a trap an impersonator was waiting all ready and as soon as sir rupert went into the office they hit him on the head and the other man came out and took his place they killed the real sir rupert when the impersonator came back to cairo its a wonderful story said edward but you know victoria there is no evidence theres the boil oh forget the boil and there are one or two other things what the boac notice on the door it wasnt there later i remembered being surprised when i found the boac office was on the other side of the building and the air stewardess ive seen her since here in baghdad at the olive branch the first day i went there she came in and spoke to catherine i thought then that id seen her before after a silence edward said slowly it all comes back to the olive branch and to catherine victoria youve got to get closer to catherine be nice to her somehow or other get to know who her friends are and where she goes and who she meets outside the olive branch what about mr dakin asked victoria ought i to tell him about this yes of course but wait a day or two we may have a lot more to tell him excited by her discoveries victoria found it easy to speak to catherine kindly the following day when they left the olive branch together that evening the two girls were much more like friends catherine led her in and out of narrow alleys and finally knocked on a door where a young woman welcomed them in english she invited victoria to sit by a clean basin with shining taps and bottles of shampoo placed round it catherine left and victoria relaxed in the care of an expert hairdresser soon her hair was covered in lovely creamy shampoo and now please said the young hairdresser victoria moved her head over the basin water flowed over her hair and suddenly there was a sweet sickly hospital smell a wet cloth was pressed over her nose and mouth she fought wildly but her thoughts were losing focus a loud noise filled her ears then blackness chapter seventeen victoria woke with confused memories a bumping car arabs arguing a horrible feeling that she would be sick then she remembered lying on a bed and an injection then more darkness something had happened that horrible smell chloroform of course and then a sleeping drug well they hadnt killed her so that was all right she was lying on a hard bed in a small room with a floor of hard earth there was an old table with a basin on it and a bucket underneath it and a window with wooden bars outside victoria got off the bed slowly feeling headachy and went to the window she could see through the bars into a garden with palm trees beyond it she turned to the door which was large and locked she went back and sat on the bed where was she not in baghdad that was certain and what was she going to do next even more important what was someone going to do to her she heard footsteps and then there was the noise of a very large key in an old lock the door opened slowly an arab carried in a tray he spoke some arabic put down the tray and left locking the door behind him on the tray was a large bowl of rice some cabbage leaves and a big piece of arab bread also a jug of water and a glass victoria drank some water and then started eating hungrily when she had finished everything she felt much better she also felt that it would be much better if by tomorrow she was somewhere else but was that possible she went to examine the door but there was nothing she could do this wasnt the kind of lock you could open easily the window she could break the wooden bars but the noise would attract attention damn said victoria she approached the old table for another drink of water and some fell on the floor at once it turned into mud an idea formed in miss victoria jones always active brain the sun was setting very soon it would be dark what she needed was something to push with she looked round on the table was a large spoon that might be useful she went back to the door and pushed vigorously through the large keyhole until the key fell out now victoria thought i must hurry before the light goes completely she picked up the jug of water and poured some at the bottom of the door near where she thought the key had fallen on the other side then using the spoon she began to dig out the wet part little by little pouring more water she dug a hole under the door lying down she could get her arm through it she felt about and found the key pulling it back to her side of the door holding the key in her muddy hand victoria waited until some dogs started barking loudly then she turned the key in the lock the door opened showing her another room with an open door at the other end it led out to the garden a piece of ragged black material lay near the outside door it was an old aba the large loose dress that arab women wore it would be useful for covering her western clothes victoria would wait until the village went to sleep and then she would go it seemed to victoria that she waited for hours but at last the human noises stopped she heard only the distant barking of dogs the moon was low in the sky it gave enough light to see her way to the opening in the mud wall around the garden she walked quickly through some trees and came out into an alley between mudbrick walls victoria ran along it as fast as she could now dogs began to bark loudly victoria turned a corner and came into the main street narrow and rough it ran through a village of mudbrick houses all pale in the moonlight palms hung over walls dogs barked victoria ran soon she came out to a muddy river with an old stone bridge over it and a track heading out into the desert victoria ran until she was out of breath the village was far behind her now the moon was high to her left and right and front was open stony ground without any sign of people and victoria had no idea in what direction the track led but it was impossible to turn back she started walking towards the unknown morning came at last victoria was exhausted and her feet were sore she saw that she was heading southwest and to the side of the road ahead of her was a low flattopped hill victoria left the track and went towards it climbing to the top with a feeling of panic she looked at the country all around everywhere there was nothing the scene was beautiful in the early morning light the ground and horizon were coloured with faint shades of orange and cream on which were patterns of shadows it was beautiful but frightening i know what it means now thought victoria when someone says they are alone in the world suddenly she heard a car it was coming towards the village so it was not someone chasing her it was still only a small black dot far off on the track but suppose this was the enemy victoria went down the hill as quickly as she could and then lay down she watched the car come nearer there was an arab driver and beside him a man in european clothes now thought victoria ive got to decide should she stop the car how could she be sure the track was deserted nothing had passed not even a donkey perhaps this car was going to the village she had left last night if it was the enemy it was the end but it might be her only hope of survival what should she do as she lay there considering the car slowed then it came off the road towards the hill it had seen her victoria crawled round the back of the hill she heard the car stop and the bang of a door then somebody said something in arabic suddenly a man came into view he was walking round the hill halfway up his eyes were on the ground and from time to time he bent down and picked something up whatever he was looking for it was not a girl called victoria jones and even better he was definitely an englishman with a cry of relief victoria stood up he lifted his head and looked at her in surprise im so glad youve come said victoria he still stared who on earth he began are you english but with a little laugh victoria threw off the old aba of course im english she said and please can you take me back to baghdad im not going to baghdad ive just come from there what on earth are you doing alone out here in the middle of the desert i was kidnapped said victoria quickly i went to have my hair shampooed and they gave me chloroform and when i woke up i was in an arab house in a village over there she pointed towards the horizon in mandali i dont know its name i escaped and walked all through the night and then i hid behind this hill in case you were an enemy her rescuer was staring at her with a very strange expression he was a man of about thirtyfive fairhaired with a sort of superior expression he was very polite and correct he now put on a pair of glasses and stared at her through them in a very superior way victoria decided that this man did not believe a word she was saying she was immediately extremely angry its perfectly true she said every word of it the stranger looked more disbelieving than ever incredible he said coldly victoria was frustrated how unfair it was that she could always make a lie sound believable but when telling the truth she didnt have the power to make people believe her well if you havent got anything to drink with you i shall die of thirst she said abdul the stranger called sahib the driver appeared and was sent for a large bottle of water victoria drank thankfully oh she said thats better my names richard baker said the englishman im victoria jones and then in an effort to change the disbelief she saw into respectful attention she added im joining my uncle dr pauncefoot jones on his dig how amazing said baker im on my way to the dig myself its only about fifteen miles from here im just the right person to have rescued you arent i victoria was completely shocked quite unable to say another word silently she followed richard to the car i suppose youre the anthropologist said richard as she sat down in the back seat i didnt expect you so soon he stood for a moment sorting through various pieces of broken pottery which he removed from his pockets victoria now realized that this was what he had been picking up on the hill most of it is late assyrian he said pointing towards the hill he smiled as he added im glad to see that in spite of your troubles your archaeological instincts led you to examine a tell victoria opened her mouth and then shut it again what after all could she say fortunately for a short time she had been a typist at the archaeological institute in london so at least she knew that a tell was a hill made by people rebuilding their houses again and again in the same place they just levelled the ruins of old buildings and built on top of them over time this made a special kind of hill so when people like richard baker dug into a tell the deeper they dug the older the buildings they discovered it was also true that he would discover she was a liar as soon as they reached the dig but it would be much much better to be sorry there than to confess the truth to mr richard baker in the middle of nowhere and anyway thought victoria perhaps before i get there i will have thought of something her busy imagination got to work immediately after a while mr baker said something to abdul and the car turned off the track and into the desert with nothing to guide him as far as victoria could see richard baker directed abdul soon richard said with satisfaction going the right way now victoria could not see any way at all but sometimes she saw vague tyre marks then they crossed a slightly clearer collection of tyre marks and richard called out for abdul to stop heres an interesting sight for you he said to victoria two men were coming towards them one man carried a short wooden seat the other a big round wooden object they welcomed richard warmly he produced cigarettes and soon a party atmosphere developed then richard turned to her do you like the cinema then you shall see a performance he spoke to the men and they smiled with pleasure they set up the seat for victoria and richard to sit on then they set up the round wooden box on a stand it had two little holes covered with glass and as victoria put her eyes to them one man began to turn a handle and the other began to sing richard translated come near and prepare yourself for much delight prepare to see ancient wonders victoria could see a coloured picture the wife of the great shah of the western world said richard then the empress eugenie touched one of her long curls next came a picture of the kings palace in montenegro another of the great exhibition a strange collection of pictures followed all different and sometimes announced with the strangest of descriptions people skating on ice completed this strange collection of old photographs when the show ended victoria smiled with pleasure that was marvellous the owners of the travelling cinema smiled proudly richard gave them some money richard and victoria got into the car and calling goodbye to them the men walked away into the desert where are they going asked victoria to kerbela but they travel all over the country i first met them coming up the road from the dead sea the car still appeared to be going nowhere with complete confidence where are we going victoria asked to the dig at tell aswad youll see it soon but now look over to your left are they clouds asked victoria they cant be mountains ah but they are the snowcovered mountains of kurdistan a great feeling of contentment came over victoria if only she could drive on like this forever if only she wasnt such a terrible liar she felt as nervous as a child at the thought of the unpleasant meeting ahead there you are said richard victoria could just see a small shape on the far horizon the small shape developed very quickly into a very large tell on one side of this great hill was a long low building of mudbrick this is where we archaeologists stay said richard they stopped the car in the middle of a group of barking dogs servants in white clothes rushed out with welcoming smiles after an exchange of greetings in arabic richard explained they werent expecting you so soon but theyll get your bed ready and bring you some hot water i expect youd like to have a wash and a rest dr pauncefoot jones is up on the tell im going up to him ibrahim will look after you he walked away and victoria followed ibrahim into the house it seemed dark at first coming in out of the sun they passed through a livingroom with some big tables and a few old armchairs then round a courtyard and into a small room with one window there was a bed a chest of drawers a chair and a table with a jug and basin on it ibrahim smiling and nodding brought her a large jug of hot water a towel and a small mirror which he fixed to a nail on the wall victoria was beginning to think how tired she was and how very dirty i suppose i look terrible she said to herself and went to the mirror for some moments she stared at her reflection without understanding this was not victoria jones though her features were the small neat features of victoria jones her hair was now platinum blonde chapter eight richard found dr pauncefoot jones at the dig on his knees carefully using a small tool on a length of wall hello richard my boy i thought you were arriving on tuesday this is tuesday said richard is it really now said dr pauncefoot jones without interest just come down here and see what you think of this perfectly good walls are coming out already and were only down three feet it looks very promising richard jumped down into the long hole and the two archaeologists enjoyed themselves in a highly technical manner for a quarter of an hour by the way said richard ive brought a girl says shes your niece with an effort dr pauncefoot jones brought his mind back from mudbrick walls i dont think i have a niece he said doubtfully shes coming to work here i understand oh dr pauncefoot jones face relaxed of course that will be venetia victoria she said yes yes victoria a very able girl i understand an anthropologist theres nothing for her yet of course were only just beginning actually i understood she wasnt coming for another two weeks but i didnt read her letter very carefully and then i lost it my wife arrives next week or the week after and i thought venetia was coming out with her well well i am sure we can make her useful theres a lot of pottery coming up theres nothing strange about her is there strange dr pauncefoot jones looked closely at him in what way well she told me the most extraordinary story she said shed gone to have her hair shampooed and they chloroformed her and carried her off to mandali and imprisoned her and shed escaped in the middle of the night the silliest nonsense you ever heard shes obviously one of those very emotional girls oh i expect shell calm down said dr pauncefoot jones without concern where is she now i left her to have a wash he hesitated she hasnt got any luggage with her hasnt she that is difficult you dont think shell expect me to lend her pyjamas ive only got two pairs and one of them is torn victoria waiting nervously saw that dr pauncefoot jones was a small round man with a twinkle in his eye to her confusion he came towards her with open arms well well venetia i mean victoria this is a surprise i didnt think you were arriving until next month but im delighted to see you delighted victoria recovered quickly which wasnt easy richard tells me your luggage is lost said dr pauncefoot jones how are you going to manage we cant send the lorry in to town before next week i can manage said victoria smiling no signs of any human bones for you dr pauncefoot jones warned her some nice walls are coming up and lots of pottery well keep you busy i forget if you do photography i know something about it said victoria happy at the mention of something that she did in fact know how to do good good thats a help though the laboratory is rather basic i dont mind said victoria she was still trying to understand it all clearly he thought she was an anthropologist called venetia who was joining the expedition very well then until the lorry went into baghdad victoria would try to be venetia but she would have to be very careful luckily thought victoria men were always so superior about women that any mistake she made would be treated as proof of how silly women were and spending time here would give her a rest which she very much needed she had hated the horrible fight against the chloroform and she had been very frightened waking up in that room here she would be well hidden richards car had not passed through mandali so nobody could guess she was now at tell aswad no from the enemy point of view victoria would have disappeared they might decide that she had got lost in the desert and died well let them think so unhappily of course edward would think so too very well edward must suffer in fact he would not have to suffer long before she was back from the dead only as a blonde instead of a brunette and that brought her back to the mystery of why they whoever they were had dyed her hair there must be some reason never mind thought victoria im alive and i will enjoy myself for a week it will be great fun to be on an archaeological dig and see what it is like she did not find it easy the names of people of publications the styles of architecture and types of pottery had to be treated carefully fortunately a good listener is always popular victoria was an excellent listener and she began to learn the technical language she read all the time she was alone in the house there was a good library of archaeological books and magazines and unexpectedly she found the life very enjoyable tea was brought to her in the early morning then she went out on the dig to help richard with camera work to put pottery back together to watch as the walls of a palace were slowly dug out to see how carefully the men worked richard baker still looked at her thoughtfully sometimes but he was friendly and amused by her enthusiasm its all new to you he said one day i remember how excited i was my first season how long ago was that he smiled rather a long time ago fifteen years you talk arabic very well if you were dressed as one could you pass as an arab he shook his head oh no the only man i know who could pass as one is a man who was actually born here his father was consul in lots of wild places we were at school together in fact i saw him only the other day at basrah first time in years and in rather strange circumstances strange yes i didnt recognize him he was dressed as an arab with a string of those beads they carry and he started making little clicking noises with it only you see he was actually using morse code he was clicking out a message to me what did it say my school nickname and his then he made a signal to expect trouble and was there trouble yes an englishman with a gun i knocked his arm up and carmichael got away carmichael he turned his head quickly do you know him yes she said i knew him knew him why is he victoria nodded yes hes dead he was killed in baghdad in the tio hotel it was kept quiet nobody knows he nodded slowly i see it was that kind of business but you he looked at her how did you know i got mixed up in it by accident he gave her a long considering look victoria asked suddenly your nickname at school wasnt lucifer was it he looked surprised lucifer no i was owl because i had to wear glasses you dont know anyone who is called lucifer in basrah richard shook his head lucifer son of the morning the fallen angel he watched her closely as he spoke but victoria was frowning where were you when all this happened at basrah she asked it was in the waiting room of the consulate there were a couple of others and this englishman and carmichael and you stopped the man with the gun and carmichael got out how he turned first towards the consuls office its at the other end of a passage with a garden she interrupted i know i stayed there for a day or two once again he watched her closely but victoria didnt notice she was seeing the long passage at the consulate with the door opening on to green trees and sunlight well carmichael went that way first then he turned and ran the other way into the street what about the englishman richard shook his head he told some story about having been robbed by an arab i didnt hear any more because i flew on to kuwait who was staying at the consulate just then victoria asked a man called crosbie one of the oil people oh yes i believe there was someone else from baghdad but i didnt meet him i cant remember his name victoria remembered captain crosbie and that he had been back in baghdad the night carmichael came to the tio hotel could carmichael have seen crosbie at the end of the passage standing against the sunlight was that why he had turned and run towards the street instead of trying to reach the consul generals office she jumped rather guiltily when she looked up to find richard baker watching her closely any more questions do you know anybody called lefarge victoria asked no man or woman i dont know she was wondering about crosbie was crosbie lucifer chapter nineteen the night before the lorry was going to take them into baghdad richard found victoria alone in the living room sitting with a book what are you reading you dont have much fiction here its a tale of two cities i always thought dickens would be boring but im finding it most exciting where have you got to he looked over her shoulder and read out and the knitting women count one i think shes very frightening said victoria madame defarge yes though i have always doubted that you could work a list of names into your knitting but then i cant knit oh i think you could said victoria considering how she would manage it by making lots of deliberate mistakes with the stitches yes it could be done suddenly two things came together in her mind with the force of an explosion the man with the handknitted red scarf and that name lefarge not lefarge carmichael had not said lefarge it was defarge and of course he meant madame defarge she was brought back to reality by richard saying is anything wrong no no that is i just thought of something i see richard raised his eyebrows in his most superior way your last name perhaps i know my own name victoria said annoyed thats not quite true said richard smiling its no good victoria youve been very clever youve studied your subject and you know something about it but ive laid traps for you ive said some completely ridiculous things about archaeology and youve accepted them he paused youre not venetia savile who are you i told you the first time i met you said victoria im victoria jones dr pauncefoot jones niece no but my name is jones you told me a lot of other things yes i did and they were all true but you didnt believe me and that made me mad because though i do tell lies what i told you then wasnt a lie and so i said my name was pauncefoot jones ive said that before out here and its always worked very well how could i have known you were actually coming to this place it must have been a shock said richard seriously but you did very well inside i was absolutely terrified said victoria but i felt that if i waited until i got here to explain at least i would be safesafe look here victoria was that wild story you told me about being chloroformed really true of course it was true if i wanted to invent a story i could make up a much better one than that and tell it better knowing you as i do now i can see that so why are you willing to think its possible now richard said slowly because if as you say you were mixed up in carmichaels death well then it might be true thats how it all began said victoria she told him of the night of carmichaels death of her talk with mr dakin of her journey to basrah of her job in the olive branch of catherines dislike of dr rathbone and the very strange business of the dyed hair the only things she left out were the red scarf and madame defarge richard sat back and looked at her is this real are you real and are you the heroine in danger or the evil adventurer victoria said in a practical manner the real point is what are we going to say to dr pauncefoot jones about me nothing said richard chapter twenty victoria richard and dr pauncefoot jones started for baghdad early it took nearly three uncomfortable hours in the bumping lorry before it left them at the tio hotel a lot of mail was waiting for dr pauncefoot jones and richard marcus appeared smiling his usual friendly welcome for victoria you do not come to my hotel for two weeks why is that you lunch here today clearly the kidnapping of victoria had not been noticed possibly edward had not been to the police is mr dakin in baghdad do you know marcus she asked mr dakin ah yes very nice man of course he is a friend of yours he was here yesterday do you know where his office is sure i know everybody knows the iraqi iranian oil company well i want to go there now in a taxi marcus immediately shouted at a servant to get a taxi then marcus took victoria out and instructed the driver and can i have a room victoria asked yes yes i can give you a beautiful room and i order you a big steak very special and before that we can have a little drink lovely said victoria oh marcus can you lend me some money of course my dear here you are the taxi started off suddenly with a noisy honk of its horn and victoria fell back on the seat holding coins and notes five minutes later victoria entered the offices of the iraqi iranian oil company mr dakin rose from his desk and shook her hand as she was shown in miss er miss jones isnt it bring coffee abdullah as the door closed behind the clerk victoria said quietly theres something ive got to tell you at once before anything more happens to me happens to you has anything happened to you dont you know asked victoria hasnt edward told you no that jealous catherine pardon i bet she told edward some silly story and the idiot believed her well lets hear about it said mr dakin er if i may say so his eye went to victorias blonde head i prefer you as a brunette thats only part of it said victoria there was a knock at the door and abdullah entered with little cups of sweet coffee when he had gone victoria began the story of her adventures she finished by telling him about the red scarf carmichael had dropped and how she connected it with madame defarge and the idea that a message was knitted into the scarf i think said dakin his eyes shining with excitement that this is the first real success weve had where is the scarf with the rest of my things when i packed i put everything in and you never mentioned to anyone that that scarf belonged to carmichael no id forgotten about it then it ought to be all right even if theyve searched your things they wont have seen any importance in an old scarf all weve got to do is have your things collected ive booked a room at the tio but do you want me to go back to the olive branch dakin looked at her with interest are you scared victoria lifted her head she had to earn her pay and show a brave face ill go if you like she said with a determination she did not feel no someone learned why you were there youd better stay away he smiled otherwise you may be a redhead next time i see you thats what i want to know most of all cried victoria why did they dye my hair i cant see any reason can you only so your dead body might be less easy to identify but if they wanted me dead why didnt they kill me immediately thats the question i wish we could answer most of all victoria and i havent got a clue talking of clues said victoria do you remember my saying that there was something about sir rupert crofton lee that didnt seem right that morning at the tio yes you didnt know him personally did you no i thought not because you see the man you met wasnt sir rupert crofton lee and she began another story starting with the boil on sir ruperts neck so that was how it was done said dakin carmichael got safely to crofton lee but it was the crofton lee impersonator who stabbed him victoria i want you to write to edward now say youre at the tio and ask him to bring your luggage im going to see dr rathbone this morning about one of his meetings it will be easy for me to quietly pass a note to his secretary personally so there will be no danger of your enemy catherine losing it chapter twenty one victoria sat on the balcony of the tio hotel once more in the role of a modern juliet waiting for romeo and soon enough romeo appeared below looking around edward victoria called edward looked up oh there you are a moment later he came out upon the balcony and stared at her in a puzzled way i say victoria havent you done something to your hair victoria gave a troubled sigh i liked it better as it was said edward tell catherine so catherine what has she got to do with it everything said victoria you told me to make friends with her and i did and i dont suppose youve any idea what trouble it got me into well catherine said youd told her to tell me that youd gone off to mosul it was very important and good news and i would hear from you as soon as you could manage and you believed that said victoria how could he be so silly you didnt think that catherine might be lying and that id been knocked on the head what edward stared chloroformed good lord edward looked quickly around i dont think we should talk out here cant we go to your room all right did you bring my luggage yes i left it with the porter because i havent had a change of clothes for two weeks victoria what has been happening i know ive got the car here lets go out to devonshire devonshire victoria stared in surprise oh its just a name for a place not far out of baghdad its lovely this time of year come on i havent been alone with you for so long they ran down the stairs and out to where edwards car was parked edward drove south along a wide road then he turned off and they bumped through the fields of palm trees and over little bridges finally they came to some fruit trees which were just beginning to flower it was beautiful and beyond the woods was the tigris they got out and walked through the flowering trees this is lovely said victoria sighing deeply the air was soft and warm after a while they sat down on a fallen tree with pink flowers above their heads now darling said edward tell me whats been happening to you ive been so horribly miserable have you she smiled dreamily then she told him of the hairdresser the chloroform and waking up of how she had escaped and her lucky meeting with richard baker and pretending to be an anthropologist arriving from england at this point edward shouted with laughter you are marvellous victoria the things you think of and invent i know said victoria my uncles dr pauncefoot jones and before him the bishop and she suddenly remembered what she had been going to ask edward at basrah when mrs clayton had called them in for drinks i meant to ask you before she said how did you know about the bishop she felt his hand go tense he said quickly why you told me didnt you it was strange victoria thought afterwards that one silly mistake should have done what it did for he was taken by surprise he had no story ready his face was suddenly unguarded and his hidden lies were so easy to read as she looked at him everything changed and she saw the truth perhaps it was not really sudden perhaps pushed deep down in her mind beneath all the excitement and glamour the question had been worrying her how did edward know about the bishop and she had been slowly arriving at the only answer edward had not learned about the bishop of llangow from her and the only other person he could have learned it from was mr or mrs hamilton clipp but they had not seen edward since her arrival in baghdad because edward had been in basrah so he must have learned it from them before he left england he must have known all the time that victoria was coming out to baghdad with them and the whole wonderful coincidence was not after all a coincidence it had been planned and as she stared at edwards face she knew suddenly what carmichael had meant by lucifer she knew what he had seen that day as he looked along the passage to the consulate garden he had seen that young beautiful face that she was looking at now for it was beautiful just like lucifer son of the morning was also beautiful not dr rathbone it had been edward edward playing the part of the secretary but controlling and planning and directing everything using rathbone as a coverup as she looked at that beautiful evil face all her silly childish love slowly disappeared and she knew that what she felt for edward had never been love it had been attraction and excitement and edward had never loved her he had used his charm deliberately he had chatted to her that day using his charm so easily so naturally that she had believed him immediately she had been a fool it was extraordinary how much could flash through your mind in just a few seconds you didnt have to think about it it just came full and immediate knowledge perhaps because really underneath you had known it all along suddenly victoria knew instinctively that she was in great danger there was only one thing that could save her only one thing she could say you knew all the time that i was coming out here you must have arranged it oh edward you are wonderful her face showed one emotion adoration and she saw the scorn the relief she could almost feel edward saying to himself the little fool shell believe anything i can do what i like with her but how did you arrange it she said you must be very powerful you must be quite different from what you pretend to be youre youre like a king of babylon she saw the pride in his face she saw the power and strength and beauty and cruelty that had been hidden behind his mask of a modest likeable young man she said quickly and anxiously as a final artistic touch but you do love me dont you his scorn was clear to see now this little fool all women were fools it was so easy to make them think you loved them and that was all they cared about they had no idea of greatness of a new world they just wanted love they were slaves and you used them as slaves of course i love you he said but what is it all about edward its a new world victoria a new world that we can create from the ruins of the old tell me he told her the dream how the old powers must destroy each other how the fat capitalists holding on to all their money and the stupid communists who hated all ideas but their own must destroy each other there must be total war between america and russia total destruction of both and then the new heaven and the new earth would appear the small chosen group of superior beings the scientists the agricultural experts the administrators the young men like edward the young men of the new world all young all believing in their rule as supermen when the destruction was complete they would step in and take control it was madness but think said victoria of all the people who will be killed that doesnt matter said edward but surely victoria thought all the ordinary people working quietly bringing up families and laughing and crying they were the people who did matter not these angels with evil faces who didnt care who they hurt and carefully for she knew that death might be very near victoria said you are wonderful edward but what can i do you want to help you believe in it she had to be careful a sudden change would be too much i think i just believe in you she said anything you tell me to do edward ill do good girl why did you arrange for me to come out here there must have been a reason of course do you remember i took a photo of you that day i remember said victoria i couldnt believe how much you look like a woman whos been causing us a lot of trouble i took that photo to make sure who is it anna scheele victoria stared at him in surprise whatever she had expected it was not this you mean anna scheele looks like me quite remarkably so and youre alike in height and size though shes five years older than you the real difference is the hair youre a brunette and shes a blonde your eyes are a darker blue but that wouldnt matter with sunglasses and thats why you wanted me to come to baghdad because i looked like her yes so you arranged the whole thing the clipps who are the clipps theyre not important they just do as theyre told something in edwards voice made victoria shudder edward she thought believes he is god thats whats so frightening anna scheele is incredibly good with finances edward was saying shes found out about our financial operations she knows how we are moving our money and what we are using it for three people have been dangerous to us rupert crofton lee and carmichael well theyre both dead anna scheele is the only one left she said she would be in baghdad for the conference in three days time but shes disappeared disappeared where weve an idea said edward weve got someone watching every entry into this country we know she wont use her own name but there is a passage booked by boac in the name of grete harden weve checked on grete harden and theres no such person the name and the address are fake we think that grete harden is anna scheele he added her plane will land at damascus the day after tomorrow and then edwards eyes looked suddenly into hers youll take her place victoria like rupert crofton lee victoria thought and he had died and when victoria took her place anna scheele would die and if for one moment edward doubted her loyalty then victoria would die she must agree and then find a way to report to mr dakin she took a deep breath oh edward id be discovered my voice wont sound the same as hers anna scheele will be suffering from a serious throat infection our doctor will say so then what would i have to do victoria asked fly from damascus to baghdad as grete harden go to bed immediately then the doctor will give you permission to get up just in time to go to the conference there before the worlds leaders you will present our papers in place of anna scheeles what will the documents say edward smiled details that prove the most terrifying and huge communist plot in america victoria thought how well theyve planned it victoria asked what about dr rathbone edward smiled in cruel amusement rathbone has been stealing most of the money which comes to him from all over the world hes dishonest and completely in our control all things work towards our new order victoria thought to herself edward is mad you get mad perhaps if you try and act the part of god humility is what keeps you human edward got up time to go weve got to get you to damascus in the suburbs of baghdad edward drove into a side street of modern europeanstyle villas with balconies and gardens round them in front of one house a big car was standing edward stopped behind it a thin darkskinned woman came out to meet them and edward spoke to her in french it seemed that victorias clothes must be changed at once the woman turned to her and said politely in french come with me please she led victoria into a bedroom where lying on a bed were the long black clothes of a nun the woman made a sign and victoria undressed and put them on the french woman put a string of wooden beads over her head then victoria was sent out to edward you look all right he said in approval keep your eyes down when there are men about the frenchwoman joined them dressed in the same way the two nuns got into the car which now had a tall european in the drivers seat do exactly as you are told now victoria said edward there was danger behind the words arent you coming edward victoria begged he smiled at her youll see me in three days then in his charming way he said quietly dont fail me darling only you can do this i love you victoria its too dangerous to kiss a nun but id like to victoria dropped her eyes like a good nun should but actually it was to hide her anger horrible traitor she thought dont worry edward added your new name is sister marie sister therese here has all the papers for the syrian border he stepped back waved cheerfully and the car started off victoria had noticed that sister therese had hidden a small gun in her sleeve but there would be a moment victoria could no longer be controlled when she was standing with her fake documents in front of the conference and edward would not be there no one could stop her then from saying i am not anna scheele and these papers are untrue she wondered why edward did not fear her doing just that the big aeroplane made a perfect landing the passengers going on from london to basrah were separated from those who were catching a connecting plane to baghdad there were four of these a richlooking iraqi businessman a young english doctor and two women a darkskinned woman with a tired face answered the airport officers questions first mrs pauncefoot jones british yes to join your husband in baghdad please what money have you a thin fairhaired young woman wearing dark glasses took her turn next grete harden yes nationality danish from london purpose of visit nurse at hospital what money have you the passengers were told that the baghdad plane would leave that afternoon they would be driven now to a hotel for a rest and lunch grete harden was sitting on her bed when a knock came on the door she opened it and found a tall darkhaired young woman wearing a boac uniform im so sorry miss harden would you come with me to the boac office there is a difficulty with your ticket this way please grete harden followed her guide down the passage on a door was a large board lettered in gold boac office the air hostess opened the door and directed her inside as grete harden went through she closed the door and quickly took down the board as soon as grete harden entered the room two men put a cloth over her head forced a ball of cloth into her mouth and one of them a doctor gave her an injection her body relaxed immediately the doctor said cheerfully that will keep her unconscious for about six hours now then you two hurry up he nodded towards two other people in the room they were nuns the men went out and the elder of the two nuns went to grete harden and began to take the clothes off her still body the younger nun shaking a little started to undress soon she was wearing grete hardens clothes the two men came in again and now they were smiling grete harden looks just like anna scheele one said and she had the papers in her luggage to prove it now then miss harden he bowed to victoria laughing at her come with me the baghdad plane left at three oclock the flight was short and for the second time victoria saw the city below her the tigris dividing it in a line of gold in two days the two great powers of the world russia and america would meet to discuss the future and she would have a part to play chapter twenty two you know said richard baker im worried about that girl dr pauncefoot jones said what girl victoria victoria dr pauncefoot jones looked about my goodness we came back without her yesterday didnt we i wondered if you had noticed said richard very wrong of me didnt she know where to find the lorry she wasnt planning to come back here said richard frowning but she went off in a car with a young man it seems and she didnt come back whats more she hadnt opened her luggage that seems very strange to me and we had agreed to meet for lunch i hope nothings happened to her oh im sure shes fine said dr pauncefoot jones comfortably theyve kidnapped her once said richard whats to prevent them kidnapping her again would you mind sir if i went into baghdad again tomorrow im worried about that girl i really am dr pauncefoot jones suddenly gave his colleague his full attention dear me richard i had no idea that you had that kind of interest in her of course victoria is most attractive youve got good taste richard i will admit that theres nothing of that kind said richard going red and looking even more superior than usual im just er worried about her i must go back to baghdad you said victoria with dislike taken up to her room in the babylonian palace hotel in baghdad the first person she saw was catherine dressed as a nurse catherine nodded with equal hatred yes it is i you stupid english girl edward has never cared for you she continued full of scorn it is me edward loves looking at her hard fanatical face victoria said anybody could do your hospital nurse act the whole thing depends on me doing mine im indispensable catherine whispered with hatred nobody is indispensable the telephone rang and was quickly answered american embassy how can i help this is dr smallbrook the caller repeated as soon as a suitably important embassy official had been called to the phone i am looking after miss scheele who has a serious throat infection miss scheele has some important papers with her and would like some responsible person from the embassy to come to the babylonian palace hotel and collect them immediately thank you i will be waiting for you victoria turned from the mirror she was wearing an expensive wellmade suit every blonde hair was carefully styled she felt nervous but excited as she turned she caught a nasty look in catherines eyes and was suddenly on her guard what are you so pleased about soon you will see catherines hatred was ugly you think you are so clever you think everything depends on you pah you are a fool a knock came on the door now you will see cried catherine the door opened and a man came in he was dressed in the uniform of the international police he locked the door behind him then he turned towards victoria as he looked at her she saw that the heavy wooden stick carried by the police was already in his hand she knew then what catherine meant what the real plan was they had never intended her to play the part of anna scheele at the conference how could they risk that no the plan had always been that anna scheele would be killed at the last moment killed in such a way that her face would not be recognizable only the fake papers would remain victoria screamed and with a smile the man came towards her there was the crash of a breaking window a heavy hand sent victoria down on to the floor she saw stars and blackness then out of the blackness a wonderful english voice said are you all right miss the telephone rang and dakin picked it up an english voice said operation victoria was successful good said dakin weve got catherine and the doctor the other man was fatally injured no news still of the real anna scheele no news at all dakin put down the phone he was very glad to hear that victoria was all right but anna herself dakin thought must be dead she had refused all help had gone her own way though she had repeated that she would be in baghdad without fail on the th today was the th and there was no anna scheele perhaps she had been right not to trust the official organization but apparently her own intelligence had been no better and without anna scheele the evidence was not complete a messenger came in with a note mr richard baker and mrs pauncefoot jones are here to see you about carmichael show them in said dakin richard baker and mrs pauncefoot jones came in baker said i was at school with a man i knew as henry fakir carmichael when i was at basrah a few weeks ago i met him in the consulate waiting room dressed as an arab does this interest you very much said dakin carmichael was attacked and ran away but before he went he slipped something into my pocket the other day i learnt from victoria jones that he was dead and you were the right person to deliver this to he placed the dirty chit on dakins desk dakin sighed deeply this means more than you can possibly imagine he got up im very grateful to you baker forgive me but there is a lot i have to do without wasting a minute he shook hands with mrs pauncefoot jones saying i suppose you are joining your husband at the dig i hope you have a good season its a good thing pauncefoot jones didnt come into baghdad with me said richard he would probably have noticed the difference between his wife and his wifes sister mrs pauncefoot jones said in a low pleasant voice my sister elsie is still in england i dyed my hair black and came out on her passport my sisters name before she married was elsie scheele my name mr dakin is anna scheele chapter twenty three baghdad had been transformed american and russian police lined the streets as the news went round the president of the united states and the russian leader were in baghdad they were in the regents palace at last the great conference had begun what makes me sad said victoria sitting on the terrace overlooking the river at the tio hotel is that poor woman who got killed in my place in damascus oh shes all right said mr dakin cheerfully as soon as your plane had taken off we arrested the french woman and took grete harden to hospital she was one of our people of course was she yes when anna scheele disappeared we thought it might be a good idea to give the other side something to think about so we booked a ticket for grete harden and gave her false papers showing she was anna scheele and the real anna scheele came out as mrs pauncefoot jones yes anna is a very clever young woman i really thought i was going to die said victoria but your people were watching over me all the time your edward wasnt quite so clever as he thought actually we had been watching edward goring for some time when you told me your story the night carmichael was killed i was very worried about you the best thing i could think of was to send you in as a spy if your edward knew that you were in touch with me youd be reasonably safe youd be too valuable to kill because hed be using you to find out what we were doing and he could also pass on false information to us through you but then you told him you knew about the false rupert crofton lee and edward decided it would be better to keep you safely out of the way until you were needed for the impersonation of anna scheele yes victoria youre very lucky to be sitting where you are now i know i am victoria looked at him steadily next time i fall in love it wont be for excitement and good looks id like a real man not one who says pretty things to me i dont mind if hes bald or wears glasses id like him to be interesting and know about interesting things about thirtyfive or fiftyfive asked mr dakin victoria looked surprised oh thirtyfive i am so happy i thought for a moment you were offering to marry me victoria laughed and was there a message knitted into the scarf there was a name the scarf and the chit were the two halves of the clue the scarf gave us the name of sheikh hussein el ziyara of kerbela he and carmichael had been friends since they were children the chit when treated with chemicals gave us the code words to persuade the sheikh to give us carmichaels proof a packet of microfilms and it was carried through the country by those two wandering cinema men the ones we actually met yes they met him when he came down from the mountains he spent four days crossing the desert in their company simple wellknown men nothing political about them just carmichaels friends he had a lot of friends he must have been very nice im sorry hes dead if theres another life after this and i fully believe that there is said mr dakin hell have the satisfaction of knowing that his courage has saved this sad old world from a fresh attack of war and misery all the evidence that he and sir rupert and anna scheele collected is now before the president of america and the premier of the ussr its strange isnt it said victoria thoughtfully that richard had one half of the secret and i had the other it almost seems as though as though it were meant to be finished mr dakin with a twinkle in his eye and what are you going to do next may i ask i will have to find a job said victoria i must start looking dont look too hard said mr dakin i think a job is coming towards you he walked away to make room for richard baker look here victoria said richard venetia savile cant come out to the dig after all apparently shes ill you were quite useful out there would you like to come back we can only offer to pay for your food im afraid and probably your passage back to england but well talk about that later well what do you say oh do you really want me cried victoria for some reason richard baker went very pink in the face i think he said we could find you er very useful id love that replied victoria the end
