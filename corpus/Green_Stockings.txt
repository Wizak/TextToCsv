aunt ida phyllis faraday evelyn putting magazine on sofa and putting out cigarette on ashtray yes so that he can give up this house to live at his club but he promised poor mother to wait till we were all married tarver yes and he knows theres a better chance of getting celia off his hands as long as phyllis is about because people will go on talking of her and celia as the two faraday girls and lumping good old celia into the girl division just out of habit he wont risk letting miss celia put on a third pair of green stockings tarver looks around for ashtray sees one on upper end of table

evelyn moves above table and down r of sofa oh couldnt we think of anybody who might marry celia evelyn do you think you could do anything about it with henry steele or jimmie raleigh tarver with a brilliant inspiration if it comes to that why shouldnt admiral grice be got to marry miss celia everybody exclaims and throws up their hands in horror evelyn sits on sofa phyllis horrified oh bobby tarver yes grice thoughtfully strolling center below table isnt half a bad idea come to think of it id like to get even with grice aunt ida gives a grunt of disgust the way he keeps roaring questions at me all day about my election and neither he nor miss celia are what you might call in the first bloom of their youth aunt ida interrupting sharply mr tarver my niece miss celia faraday is a dear delightful young woman still under thirty evelyn again with smiling sarcasm yes but how much under aunt ida tarver yes as lady trenchard says how much is miss celia faraday under thirty thirtytwo is

like to have you in chicago for a week tarver taking her seriously oh thanks awfully i dare say some day after my election i shall have to look up america just at present though i have too much on my mind aunt ida shouldnt overburden the weak mr tarver phyllis showing resentment oh aunt ida evelyn laughs tarver rises gives aunt ida a resentful look turns up r by fender and addresses evelyn but the great thing now is to get old grice to propose to miss celia evelyn very patronizingly why yes bobby then out of gratitude she might go out and canvass for you tarver doubtfully yees that would be very nice of course rises enthusiastically but fascinating girls are what is needed at a time like this like you lady trenchard and phyllis and mrs rockingham he bows to each as he addresses them going up to madge at desk r i say when is your husband coming back from india madge not till christmas rises tarver then you can spend all your time canvassing for me cant you madge patronizingly oh

tarver oh i say aunt ida yes where is she now i would like to know freezing for an hour on an open wharf in the pouring rain three miles away because nobody took the trouble to think of her madge coming center protestingly oh aunt ida i heard the motor leave not two minutes ago aunt ida yes just about two hours too late madge goes above table and joins girls who with tarver are evidently alarmed under aunt idas attack and express it in a murmur tarver sits oh if only she doesnt get tired of waiting before the motor can get there tarver to girls dont worry dont worry why should she get tired it would look like a lack of confidence in you if she stopped waiting aunt ida yes and celia is certainly accustomed to waiting for and on every one of you girls and tarver now you know oh i say madge turns up to piano aunt ida continuing she is a back number thats your constant suggestion and because she hasnt found a jim raleigh to love her she is on the shelf disgustedly a jim raleigh

morning room smith bowing i am speaking to miss celia faraday phyllis holding card in her hand oh no im her much younger sister but i have sent for her wont you sit down colonel vavasour sits r of l table smith sits l the card which you sent me proves that your errand is a sad one i want to ask you to be very gentle in delivering your message to celia the news of colonel smiths death was first conveyed to her in todays times smith i am not very surprised to hear that phyllis melodramatically the bolt fell from a clear sky she received no telegram no letter to warn her of the impending destruction of her happiness places card on table smith meaningly no indeed how could she phyllis she was happy she loved and was loved smith turns and looks at her and then in a second comes fate with its cruel shears smith interrupting her excuse me but do you write for the sunday papers phyllis no but i have been listening lately to a great number of election speeches smith i quite understand from them those flowers of eloquence were culled please go on phyllis celia bore the blow with remarkable courage but now comes your visit which will upset her even more than the news of colonel smiths death itself smith yes miss faraday i am quite sure that it will do that you have made an appeal to me to deliver my harrowing message as delicately as i can you can help me not to make mistakes phyllis how smith by telling me where the lovers met when they became engaged and how it all happened phyllis but you came with colonel smiths card and words of recommendation written upon it by his failing hand didnt he tell you smith well you see he was one of those greathearted men who never speak about themselves and towards the end when he might have spoken he was singularly comatose phyllis sympathetically poor fellow smith oh its dreadful dreadful i suppose your sister was very devoted to him phyllis she adored him smith yes thats the part i understand best phyllis but celias engagement meant more to her than it would to most women smith recoils slightly why phyllis it had somehow got into everybodys head that celia didnt looks around room attract people poor old celia smith turns uneasily in chair of course her engagement altered the whole position smith oh i begin to see phyllis it was the night that i had just announced my engagement to mr tarver bobby was so witty about poor old celia having to wear another pair of green stockings at my wedding smith ah h then there are other sisters phyllis yes theres madge she is between celia and myself smith engaged phyllis more than engaged married and then comes evelyn smith married phyllis much more than married smith stares a widow smith and miss celia is the eldest of you all phyllis oh yes well the moment after celia was told of my engagement she announced hers smith to colonel smith turns away from her with sudden understanding i see phyllis more melodramatically you know she had met him at southampton smith looks at her for a week they had been together smith turns in his chair only that morning he had told her of his love an hour later he was steaming down southampton water to leave his neglected bones on the arid wastes of a smith interrupting her ahem youll excuse me phyllis i beg pardon he was on his way to somaliland she wrote to him that night smith slowly yes the letter reached him tapping his pocket i have it here phyllis sentimentally he kept it smith yes he kept it he used to sit and study it by the hour phyllis how truly beautiful oh you must tell celia that you mustnt rob her of any of her grief smith no that would be too bad so there was no opportunity for smith to come and make your acquaintance phyllis no but i have heard so much of him from celia that i could almost believe i see him stares dreamily at smith smith rises slowly a little disconcerted phyllis rising and moving r ill go and send celia to you martin enters through morning room smith thanks now i know where i am martin stands up r miss faraday is coming down miss crosses and exits l lighting chandelier in card room phyllis very well martin then ill leave you to deliver your message alone crosses to door r and opens it then turns you have brought i hope one or two mementoes from him smith puzzled for a moment i beg your pardon phyllis little things that celia can treasure smith oh yes yes a few small things trifles which smith habitually wore phyllis sentimentally just what she will value most exits rie smith chuckles he looks at his ring but cant get it off then at his knife that wont do then at his cigarette case that will not do also at his bunch of keys that wont do he reluctantly takes watch and chain from his waistcoat and looks about for something to wrap it up in he sees the tissue paper which celia has left on book slide gets it and wraps watch and chain up in it putting it in his pocket he takes out his scarf pin looks at it starts to replace it in tie he reconsiders and wraps that up too putting it in his pocket he hums a snatch of song for celias entrance celia enters in evening dress r comes rc smith does not look up illustration green stockings page celia colonel vavasour she speaks briskly having no suspicion of his business smith bows almost reverentially sighs deeply looks as if about to speak is silent his head is bowed impatiently i am told that you wish to see me on important business smith nods head sadly he looks up and on seeing celia starts with pleasurable surprise for a moment smith upon important and lugubrious business celia oh dont tell me theres some new difficulty about mr tarvers election smith i have come to speak to you about one who is dearer to you than all the world celia is perplexed as soon as i read the announcement in the times this morning i felt that i must come to you at once celia pause the announcement in the times she is startled stares at smith smith of the death of colonel smith celia is amazed turns away quickly celia you will forgive me i am sure colonel vavasour but the news of my loss is so recent that you will understand my reluctance to discuss it with a stranger she moves up toward morning room as though to exit smith dont go please celia turns back it was your sister who took the card which introduces me he takes up card from table l see celia advances l of table r and takes card celia colonel smith but there wasnt any i mean sits in chair colonel vavasour i am a little overwhelmed smith sympathetically i was afraid you would be celia staring at card colonel smith smith i bring to you his last dying message celia you knew him smith comes to her turn that card over and read the last words written by his failing hand celia turns card over celia goodbye smith yes sniffs very sadly goodbye celia be kind to my friend smith james nugent celia vavasour smith col smith was my dearest friend and knowing myself as i do i can safely say that no one else will ever take his place in my affections celia how extraordinary smith looks at her i mean how very unselfish of you smith ah yes he compelled ones love i can appreciate possibly better than any one else how great must be your grief celia agrees mournfully and regards him with ludicrous suspicion goes to table l and sits l of it before coming here i went to see his dear old people he had never told them of his engagement but he was always secretive celia yes very secretive smith his dear little aunt mary was very fond of him celia oh little aunt mary smith and when i told her of your engagement she was most anxious to meet you celia yes that would be very delightful but not just yet please not just yet smith not just yet of course not just yet but possibly when time has reconciled you to your loss she expressed the hope that some day but not just yet of course you and she might journey together to somaliland with a wreath celia yes choking and turning away her head thats a very sweet idea we might go out for the xmas holidays smith oh i know i can gauge miss faraday the measure of your grief by my own but there is just one alleviation which i am very glad to bring to you celia what is that please smith when colonel smith died of wounds at berbera he died without any pain celia rising alarmed it is very good of you colonel vavasour to have come all the way from london to tell me this starts as if to exit holding out her hand to smith smith also rises takes her hand and detains her c smith this and more i was with him at the last how well i remember the scene he used to lie on his sick bedgazing across the thatched roofs of berbera to the arab dhows riding at their anchors in the sea she turns away r and he gave into my hands a few small things to bring you celia turns away horrified trifles which he habitually wore here are a few of them brings out packages containing watch and pin from pockets celia heavens no i couldnt think of taking them smith in surprise holding them towards celia they were smiths and you couldnt take them ah i understand you had quarreled puts things into pockets celia no we never quarreled there was never one harsh word spoken by me to him or by him to me smith lc standing then why refuse his gifts celia goes to table r at a loss well you see he had never given me anything smith suddenly smiles and brings out parcels again how like smith how very like him even he had his failings but we who knew him so well can afford to speak of them frankly celia i dont think you understand colonel vavasour gifts would have been impossible in such an engagement as that which existed between him and me smith severely let smith be the judge of that goes a step toward her perhaps he is in this room now watching you refuse his gifts celia moves r uneasily looking back over her shoulder sternly watching you with the pain he didnt feel when he died of wounds at berbera he follows her and forces her to take the watch she gingerly takes it and unwraps it letting the watch fall out and hang by the chain which she holds it is a large heavy gold watch of the turnip variety his watch and chain she lifts it up and down to show its weight he bids you wear it always on your bosom she recoils pleadingly to please smith whom we both loved she looks helplessly about for a moment and then in essaying to hang the watch about her neck it slips and falls down inside her dress they turn away from each other with varying emotions turning back by jove i say thats ripping of you celia i beg your pardon sir smith solemnly i am thanking you in my dead comrades name my dearest friend bows his head celia crossing him to l oh i didnt understand smith unwraps second parcel and follows her across the stage with this smith pinned his tie a curious jewel he was very fond of it i trust you will treasure it celia tries to refuse pin but smith forces it upon her goes through and empties all his pockets offering cigarette case knife keys etc and here i have a few more things celia with a gesture of horror retreats up stage to card room no no no no please i dont want them i tarver enters through morning room in dinner jacket he shows surprise at seeing smith smith replaces articles in his pockets tarver at door r oh i am so sorry i didnt know you were engaged i think i left my election speech somewhere celia eagerly coming down c thats quite all right bobby we have finished our business goodbye colonel vavasour it is extremely kind of you to have taken all this trouble for a stranger crosses down r as though to

behind smiths back smith shocked to a dinner party tarver why yes and on to a concert afterwards celia with great dignity its a classical concert pause by the local philharmonic society and admiral grice with whom we are all dining is the most important person in the constituency smith sternly so you are all going out to enjoy yourselves tarver crossing r and up stage oh they are phyllis and i for once are going to stay at home and dine quietly smith turns toward tarver and stops him at door but is it wise for you mr tarver to stay at home at this very critical time i should have thought knowing as much as i do about elections that it was bad policy to offend so important a person as admiral grice tarver in doorway oh thats all right celia can twist him around her little finger he simply worships celia who has made a ball of the tissue paper on the table throws it at bobby who exits hurriedly without smiths seeing this smith sternly going to her you never loved him celia indignantly moving r oh smith on the evening of the very day which brings you news of his decease you are dressed to conquer and allure celia more indignant colonel vavasour smith you know as well as i do how at all times smith disapproved of a decollete gown born and brought up in a rigid and unbending family he never quite emancipated himself from the principles of calvinism you know that he waits for her to answer celia weakly sinks on stool at bottom of sofa yes smith looks at her and its not even black a dinner party with an amorous admiral after the dinner party the wildest gaieties goes l celia do you call a classical concert by the local philharmonic society the wildest gaiety you never heard one smith reproachfully coming back to celia you know what a low opinion smith had of all forms of music dangerously sensuous how often have i heard him breathe those words when the regimental band struck up the tune of auld lang syne she rises goes r you never loved him give me back the watch and chain celia confused i cant you utterly fail to understand the situation colonel vavasour all the help that any of us can give is needed at this election tonight is particularly important the two candidates are to meet on neutral ground smith then certainly mr tarver ought to go not you celia but i ask you would colonel smith have wished me at a time like this to shut myself alone in my room with nothing but his memory for my companion smith hed have loved it faraday entering through morning room in evening dress carrying coat and hat ready celia ready celia and smith

description it was the usual sort of formation when a small force gets caught in the open a square with the maxims at the corners we had only two one here at the tip of the nutcrackers and the other here at the end of the knifehandle he has made a square with dessert knives and nutcrackers on the tablecloth to illustrate the position of the maxims he uses nuts celia only two smith we should have liked some more of course but wed have gotten along all right if this fellow here touching one of the nuts hadnt jammed celia oh what happened then smith the somalis at the corner charged from here from here from here others swept round and flung themselves upon the back of their companions imagine a huge wedge and an enormous hammer pounding behind it they split our ranks in a second it was a surprise that took you by the throat you heard the maxim talking to em like a father and by george there they were in the hollow of the square stabbing at our backs celia with much admiration oh and where were you smith in square here celia there smith yes he takes a peach thats me places it in the square celia ah there you were there smith oh i was all right we faced the rear ranks about and drove em out of it it was messy you see we could only use the bayonet inside the square in a little while we got the maxim going again and made em respectful however they hung around us and we couldnt move along very fast that was our trouble for we had to move along we were short of water and a days march from the wells celia oh smith so you see it was necessary that as soon as night came someone should get through and bring relief celia with much appreciation i know what happened i know you volunteered smith looks at her his eyes accept her homage and thank her he laughs happily yes between you and me it was safer outside the square celia reproachfully oh smith well i wasnt in command so i could volunteer celia and got the d s o in consequence smith and a drink a day before the others ill get a step too i think celia then youll be general wont you smith brigadier celia smiling at him admiringly you cant know what it means to a woman who has lived always in a little outoftheway place like this where only the same ordinary things happen day after day to hear of wonderful deeds like these from a man whos done them speaks earnestly without gushing smith beams moves his chair slightly towards her smith oh yes we are getting along together capitally arent we and you cant know how all this moves his hand to include the room appeals to a man who finds the skirmish and the camp a bit of an old story and realizes that this the quiet wellordered household the home and the homemaker is after all what is really worth fighting for celia leans forward listening but surely you have a home smith i have a house by jove now i have two houses celia interested you have just bought another place smith inherited it an old abbey about the size of trafalgar square on a wet day and not as cheerful celia but you mustnt let yourself be lonely you ought to marry smith moves his chair closer to celia thats what i begin to think martin enters r with tray on it two small cups small

on table he takes the napkins goes up puts them on tray with other things and exits with tray ri celia while martin is serving i asked martin to serve coffee here because i thought it would be cosier you know having poured smiths coffee she passes cup to him smith taking cup slowly from her much much cosier though for both of us tonight celia fills her cup our one idea of cosiness must be the grave celia drops pot on tray celia leans forward takes cigarette from coffee tray and lights it the grave then tell me of it wont you where does it lie smith openly perplexed sees celia smoking and attempts to use this as a means of extricating himself pretending to be shocked oh the grave oh celia whats the matter puffs her cigarette smith shrugging his shoulders oh nothing nothing celia do you object to women smoking smith i not at all its companionable but smith celia chokes on cigarette would smith have liked to see you smoking a cigarette celia annoyed pauses perhaps not tonight smith not tonight and not any night celia viciously presses cigarette down on ashtray and puts it out reprovingly we both know how strongly he disapproved of the modern latitude of womens manners she turns away you know id fancy the man who could make you care for him would be quite different from smith you havent his little shutin way of looking at life you have such a splendid imagination celia nervously yes and im beginning to think i need one smith did you really love each other celia takes up her coffee cup i cant answer for colonel smith who was a man you know but for myself i can

like that go astray letters from you knocking loose about a camp he is upset and disturbed celia smiling to herself why should you imagine my letters never reached him smith smiling reminiscently because i was with him when he got the first one celia very agitated puts her cup sharply on saucer you you you dont mean to say a colonel smith ever received oh no gentleman could have shown my letter smith sincerely shown it oh miss faraday you cant know what that letter of yours meant to celia turning on him quickly i beg your pardon smith i mean did meant i mean did mean to good old smith

they were light and again they were very very dark smith thats funny i never saw them dark to me they always were light like bottle glass celia really possibly you were not very observing smith acknowledges the point with a touch of impatience possibly not but his hair surely we cant differ as to that celia his hair you mean did it curl or was it straight smith yes and its color celia his hair i hardly know how to describe his hair because his hair was it was like no hair that i ever saw smith laughs thats a splendid description of a bald man that always was a great grief to smith his baldness his head was so very bald and bumpy celia oh yes smith puts his hand to his head what recovering himself oh yes yes growing more and more determined to trip her and more and more interested in and appreciative of her attractiveness now his mouth celia well his mouth was peculiar smith peculiar celia yes you see it broadened when he smiled smith laughing oh did he smile for you celia oh

looks over it her back to the audience she turns around her face expressing chagrin and annoyance at aunt idas failing her maynt i come into the room and speak to you celia certainly not goes and viciously seizes her coat from chair and begins to put it on smith coming into the room just the same and coming down above her on the r you told me i know there was nothing more to say but goodbye and ill say that too if i must but first there is something else to say and id much rather say it than write it celia mo whatever you do dont write dont write me anything i dislike letters intensely and just at present they seem to be a drug on the market picks up her bag and veil smith but there is something i must say to you before you go celia how do you know im going anywhere smith looks down at her bag and smiles well celia swings bag to other side of her besides i overheard wilsons message celia oh you did well then perhaps you will be good enough to realize that im in something of a hurry you will find your jewelry there on the desk smith wont you sit down for five minutes ready horn celia certainly not smith just five celia no smith if you dont upon my word i shall begin to believe that you are afraid of me celia sits quickly with her back to the audience l of table indeed that wouldnt be your first mistake you know smith i know it was a foolish trick i had no right to come here as i did celia it was a cruel joke smith simply and feelingly yes but a joke that is more on me now than it ever was on you motor horn toots three times celia turns her head in the direction of the conservatory i want you to know that my name really is vavasour celia you astonish me isnt it anything else too smith yes its really j n smith too celia oh is that all smith no more now that i have come in to my uncle vavasours old abbey i have to take his name legally smithvavasour dont you see celia i see what a delightful combination of class and mass this may be all very interesting to anyone interested but really i havent time now to split hairs over a middle name your intention was to deceive me and you almost succeeded failure alone i take it accounts for your present humility now if you will be good enough to get your watch on the desk you will see that the five minutes you asked for are up and since you insist on saying goodbye to me will you say it as quickly as possible please and let me go makes no attempt to move smith no not until weve decided whats to be done about your other letters hand unconsciously rests on the box of letters without his knowing it celia glances at this and tries to appear unconcerned what other letters smith i have that first one here pressing his hand over his heart but all the others good god moving well down r when i think of love letters of yours wandering loose about somaliland celia places her bag quickly on table steals her arm across seizes the box of letters while smith is not looking and on the word somaliland swings away from him hiding the box awkwardly under her cloak theres one thing i can do to show you what i feel about it give me some clue to the mistaken addresses you must have put upon them and ill start back tomorrow and fetch them comes lc quite close to celia celia from somaliland smith from hell if necessary celia fortunately such a journey would be superfluous smith what do you mean celia i mean that all of those hundreds and hundreds of letters that i was fool enough to write to an imaginary hero are all here in this box and now theyre going into the furnace with my own hands starts for door swinging the box in her right hand smith following her and playfully taking the box from her wont you give them to me instead celia turns back and they both hold on to box certainly not its an additional insult that you should even suggest such a thing do you suppose i ever want to see you or hear your name again a man who has dared to hold me up to ridicule as you have done to wickedly and cruelly amuse himself at my expense smith gives a low laugh oh dont you suppose i know how funny i must have seemed to you ha ha imitates smiths laugh silly idiot of a girl tired of having no notice taken of her tired of being kept on the shelf just dying to show people how attractive she could be only give her the chance and to think because of that i made such an everlasting fool of myself before a man a man who is capable of smith capable of telling you a lie miss faraday puts box of letters on table ready motor horn celia well you did you know you did you did everything you could think of to deceive me smith i cant deny it celia and do you believe that a man or a woman could ever bring himself or herself to respect or have anything to do with a man or a woman who who deceived smith i do believe it and judging by my own case i may say i know it celia i dont think it is very generous of you to allude to me in that manner smith me we are discussing me miss faraday what can i say to induce you to forgive me celia nothing smith turns away she glances at him in an indifferent tone but of course you may say it if you wish smith turns and comes to her tenderly i did lie to you elaborately and im going to be jolly glad that i had the chance of lying to you and i want all the rest of my life the chance of telling you the truth these few hours with you have made me want so very much for more like them made me want a chance to seem less odious in your eyes at least to be on a fair footing so that i may take my chances with the rest celia looking straight into his eyes but they havent any chance at all smith laughs a little and celia realizing her break turns her head away in confusion smith well thats good news then give me a chance alone wont you youve only known me for four hours but am i wrong in believing that youve been thinking of me for eight months cant i hope to take the place of the man to whom you gave my name celia smiles and looks down a little wistfully as if about to consent motor horn toots three times celia throwing off her yielding mood turns and goes to the winged armchair back to audience shaking out her veil and pointing l oh no its all too impossible besides mr raleigh is waiting for me in the motor smith comes to her and gently takes her right hand youve been dreaming for eight months of an ideal that you never thought to see ive been dreaming all my life in exactly the same way and at last ive seen mine celia after a pause during which she lets her hand rest in his her head averted yes but its too late now because im
