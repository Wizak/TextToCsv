 prologue a chat with my subset i am no hamlet im an attendant lord though or at least i would be if i were human im not im a computer program that is an honorable estate and i am not at all ashamed of it especially since i am a very sophisticated program not only fit to swell a progression or start a scene or two but to quote from obscure twentiethcentury poets as i tell you about it it is to start the scene that i am speaking now alberts my name and introductions are my game i start by introducing myself im a friend of robinette broadheads well thats not precisely right im not sure i can claim to be a friend of robins though i try hard to be a friend to him it is the purpose for which i was created basically i am a simple computer informationretrieval con struct who has been programed with many of the late albert einsteins traits thats why robin calls me albert theres another area of ambiguity whether it is indeed robinette broadhead who is the object of my friendship has lately become arguable too since it rests on the question of who robinette broadhead now isbut thats a long and hard problem that well have to take up a little bit at a time i know this is all confusing and i cant help feeling that im not doing my job very well since my job is to set the scene for what robin himself has to say its possible i dont have to do this at all since you may already know what i have to say if so i dont mind repeating it we machines are patient but you might prefer just to skip over and go on to robin himselfas robin himself no doubt would much prefer lets do it in the form of questions and answers i will construct a subset within my program to interview me qwho is robinette broadhead arobin broadhead is a human being who went to the gateway asteroid and by enduring great risks and trauma won for himself the beginnings of an immense fortune and an even greater load of guilt qdont throw in those teasers albert just stick to the facts what is the gateway asteroid ait is an artifact left by the heechee they abandoned half a million years or so ago a sort of orbital parking garage full of working spaceships they would take you all over the galaxy but you couldnt control where you were going qwatch that albert just the facts please who are these heechee alook lets get something straight if you are going to ask me questionseven if you are only a subset of the same program as me you have to let me answer them in the best way possible facts are not enough facts are what very primitive dataretrieval systems produce im too good to waste on that i have to give you the background and the surround for instance to tell you who the heechee are the best way i must tell you the story of how they first appeared on earth it goes like this the time was about half a million years ago in the late pleistocene the first living terrestrial creature who became aware of their existence was a female sabertoothed tiger she gave birth to a pair of cubs licked them over growled to drive her inquisitive mate away went to sleep woke up and found that one was missing carnivores dont this is one of the easier kinds of information for me to retrieve the con flict over the island of dominica terrible though it was was over in seven weeks with both haiti and the dominican republic anxious for peace and a chance to rebuild their shattered economies the next crisis to confront the secretariat was one of great hope for everyone in the world but at the same time fraught with far more risk to the worlds peace i refer of course to the discovery of the socalled heechee asteroid although it was known that long ago technologically advanced aliens had visited the solar system and left some valuable artifacts the chance finding of this body with its scores of functioning spaceships was wholly unexpected their value was incalculable of course and nearly every space faring member state of the un registered some claim to them i will not speak of the delicate and confidential negotiations that brought about the fivepower gateway corporation trusteeship but with its formation a new era opened for humankind memoirs marieclйmentine benhabbouche secrйtairegйnйrale des nationsunis qalbert please this is robinettes story not yours so get on to where he starts talking ai told you once and i told you twice if you interrupt again ill simply turn you off subset were doing this my way and my way is like this carnivores dont count well but she was smart enough to know the difference between one and two unfortunately for her cub carnivores have hairtrigger tempers too the loss of one cub enraged her and in her paroxysm of fury she destroyed the other it is instructive to observe that that was the only fatality among large mammals to result from the first visit of the heechee to earth a decade later the heechee came back they replaced some of the samples they had taken including a male tiger now elderly and plump and took a new batch these were not fourlegged the heechee had learned to distinguish between one predator and another and the species they selected this time was a group of shambling slantbrowed fourfoothigh creatures with furry faces and no chins their very remote collateral descendants namely you humans would call them australopithecus afarensis these the heechee did not return from their point of view these creatures were the terrestrial species most likely to evolve toward intelligence the heechee had a use for this sort of animal and so they began subjecting them to a program designed to force their evolution toward that goal of course the heechee did not limit themselves to the planet earth in their explorations but none of the rest of the solar system had the sort of treasure that interested them they looked they explored mars and mercury skimmed the cloud cover of the gas giants beyond the asteroid ring observed that pluto was there but never troubled to visit it tunneled out an eccentric asteroid to make a sort of hangar for their spacecraft and honeycombed the planet venus with wellinsulated tunnels they did not concentrate on venus because they preferred its climate to that of earth actually they detested the surface of venus as much as humans do that was why all their construction was underground but they built there because there was nothing alive on venus to be harmed and the heechee never never harmed any evolved living thingsexcept when necessary the heechee did not limit themselves to the earths solar system either their vessels spanned the galaxy and went beyond it of all the galaxys two hundred billion astronomical objects larger than a planet they charted every one and many of the smaller ones too not every object was visited by a heechee ship but not one failed of at least a drone flyby and an instrumented search for signatures and some became what can only be called tourist attractions and somea bare handfulcontained that peculiar treasure the heechee sought called life life was rare in the galaxy intelligent life however inclusively the heechee defined it was even rarer but not absent there were earths australopithecines already tool users beginning to develop social institutions there was a promising winged race in what human beings would call the constellation ophiuchus a softbodied one on a dense huge planet that circled an f star in eridanus four or five miscellaneous sorts of beings that orbited stars on the far side of the galaxys core hidden by gas clouds dust and dense starry clusters from any human observation all together there were fifteen species of beings from fifteen different planets thousands of lightyears away from each other that might be expected to develop enough intelligence to write books and build machines fairly soon and there was more there were three actual existing technological societies besides the heechees own and the artifacts of two others now extinct so the australopithecmes were not unique they were still very precious therefore the heechee who was charged with ferrying a colony of them from the drybones plains of their native home to the new habitat the heechee had provided for them in space was accorded much honor for his work it was hard work and prolonged that particular heechee was the descendant of three generations who had explored mapped and organized the solar system project he expected that his own descendants would continue the work in that he was wrong all in all the tenancy of the heechee in earths solar system lasted just over one hundred years and then it ended in less than a month a decision was made to withdrawhurriedly all through the rabbit warrens of venus all over the small outpost installations on dione and mars south polar cap in every orbiting artifact the packingup began hurried but thorough the heechee were the neatest of housekeepers they removed more than ninetynine percent of the tools machines artifacts knickknacks and trinkets that had supported their life in earths solar system even the trash especially the trash nothing was left by accident and nothing at all not even the heechee equivalent of an empty coke bottle or a used kleenex was left on the surface of the earth they did not make it impossible for the collateral descendants of their australopithecines to learn that the heechee had visited their area they only made sure that they would first have to learn to go into space to do so much of what the heechee removed was useless and was jettisoned in far interstellar space or into the sun much was shipped to places very far away for special purposes and all this was done not just in earths solar system but everywhere the heechee vacuumed the galaxy of almost every trace no newly bereft pennsylvania dutch widow preparing to turn the farmhouse over to the family of the eldest son ever left premises more neat they left almost nothing and nothing at all without a purpose on venus they left only the basic tunnels and foundation structures themselves and a carefully selected bare taste of artifacts in the outposts only a minimum number of signposts and one other thing in every solar system where intelligence was expected they left one great and cryptic gift in earths system it was in the rightangle asteroid that they had used for a terminus for their spacecraft here and there in remote and carefully chosen places in other systems they left other major installations each contained the very large gift of an operating selection of whole functional almost indestructible heechee fasterthanlight spacecraft the solar troves stayed there for a very long time four hundred thousand years and more while the heechee hid in their core hole the australopithecines on earth turned out an evolutionary failure though the heechee did not find that out but the cousins of the australopithecines became neanderthalers or cromagnards then that latest evolutionary fad modern man meanwhile the winged creatures developed and learned and discovered the promethean challenge and killed themselves meanwhile two of the existing technological societies met each other and destroyed each other meanwhile six of the other promising species idled in evolutionary backwaters meanwhile the heechee hid and peeped fearfully through their schwarzschild shell every few weeks of their timeevery few millennia of the time speeding outside and meanwhile the troves waited and human beings found them at last so human beings borrowed the heechee ships in them they crisscrossed the galaxy those first explorers were scared desperate people whose only hope of escaping grimy human misery was to risk their lives on a blinddate voyage to a destiny that might make them rich and was a whole lot more likely to make them dead i have now surveyed the entire history of the heechee in their relation ship with the human race up to the time when robin will start telling his story are there any questions subset qzzzzzzz asubset dont be a smartass i know youre not asleep qi am only trying to convey that you are taking a hell of a long time to get offstage scenestarter and youve only told us about the past of the heechee you havent told us about their present ai was just about to in fact i will now tell you about a particular heechee whose name is captain who at just about the time when robin will begin to tell you his story qif you ever let him get to it asubset quiet this captain is rather important to robins story because in time they will interact drastically but as we see captain now he is wholly unaware that robin exists he along with the members of his crew is getting ready to squeeze out of the place where the heechee had hidden into the wider galaxy that is home for all the rest of us now i have played a little trick on you you have alreadyshut up subset you have already met captain since he was one of the very crew of heechee who abducted the tiger cub and built the warrens on venus he is much older now he is not however half a million years older because the place where the heechee went to hide is in a black hole at the core of our galaxy now subset i dont want you to interrupt again but i do want to take time to mention something strange this black hole where the heechee lived curiously was known to the human race long before they ever heard of the heechee in fact way back in the year it was the first interstellar radio source ever detected by the end of the twentieth century interferometry had mapped it as a definite black hole and a very large one with a mass of thousands of suns and a diameter of some thirty lightyears by then they knew that it was about thirty thousand lightyears from earth in the direction of the constellation sagittarius that it was surrounded by a haze of silicate dust and that it was an intense source of lkev gammaray photons by the time they found the gateway asteroid they knew much more they knew in fact every important datum about it except one they had no idea that it was full of heechee they didnt find that out until theyactually i can fairly say that it was mostly ibegan to decipher the old heechee star charts qzzz aquiet subset i take your point the ship captain was in was a lot like the ones human beings found in the gateway asteroid there had not been time for a lot of improvement in ship design thats why captain was not really haifa million years old time went slowly in their black hole the major difference between captains ship and any other was that it possessed an accessory in heechee speech the accessory was known familiarly as the disruptor of order in aligned systems an englishspeaking pilot might have called it a can opener it was what permitted them to pass through the schwarzschild barrier around a black hole it didnt look like much only a twisted rod of crystal emerging from an ebonblack base but when captain energized it it glowed like a cascade of diamonds the diamond glitter spread and surrounded the ship and opened a way through the barrier and they slipped through into the wider universe outside it didnt take long by captains standard less than an hour by the clocks of the outside universe nearly two months captain didnt look human being a heechee more than anything else he resembled an animated cartoon skeleton but one might as well think of him as human because he had most of the human traitsinquisitiveness intelligence amorousness and all those other qualities that i know about but have never experienced for example he was in a good mood because the assignment permitted him to take along as part of his crew a female who was also a prospective love partner the assignment itself however was distinctly unenjoyable if one stopped to think about it captain didnt he worried about it no more than an average human worries about whether war will be declared of an afternoon if it happens it is the end of everything but time has gone on monotonously long without it happening and so the biggest difference is that captains assignment did not refer to anything as inoffensive as a nuclear war but to the very reasons that had caused the heechee to retreat to their black hole in the first place he was checking on the artifacts the heechee had left behind those troves were not accidents they were part of a wellconsidered plan one might even call them bait as to robinette broadheads feelings of guilt qi wondered when you would get back to that let me make a suggestion why not let robin broadhead tell about that himself aexcellent idealsince heaven knows he is expert on the subject and so the scene is started the procession is swelled and i give you robinette broadhead just like old times before they vastened me i felt a need i hadnt felt for thirty years and more and so i did what i hadnt thought i would ever do again i practiced a solitary vice i sent my wife essie off to the city to make a sneak raid on a couple of her franchises i put a do not disturb override on all the communications systems in the house i called up my dataretrieval system albert einstein and gave him orders that made him scowl and suck his pipe and presentlywhen the house was still and albert bad reluctantly but obediently turned himself off and i was lying comfortably on the couch in my study with a little mozart coming faintly from the next room and the scent of mimosa in the air system and the lights not too bright presently i say i spoke the name i hadnt spoken in decades sigfrid von shrink please i would like to talk to you for a moment i thought he wasnt going to come then in the corner of the room by the wet bar there was a sudden fog of light and a flash and there he sat he had not changed in thirty years he wore a dark and heavy suit of the cut you see on portraits of sigmund freud his elderly nondescript face had not gained a wrinide and his bright eyes sparkled no less he held a prop pad in one hand and a prop pencil in the otheras if he had any need to take notes and he said politely good morning rob i see that you are looking very well you always did start out by trying to reassure me i told him and he flashed a small smile sigfrid von shrink does not really exist he is nothing more than a psychoanalytic computer program he has no physical existence what i saw was only a hologram and what i heard was only synthesized speech he doesnt even have a name really since sigfrid von shrink is only what i called him because i could not talk about the things that paralyzed me decades ago to a machine that didnt even have a name i suppose he said meditatively that the reason you called for me is that something is troubling you thats true he gazed at me with patient curiosity and that also had not changed i had a lot better programs to serve me these dayswell one particular program albert einstein who is so good that i hardly bother with any of the othersbut sigfrid was still pretty good he waits me out he knows that what is curdling in my mind takes time to form itself into words and so he doesnt rush me on the other hand he doesnt let me just daydream away the time either can you say what you are disturbed about right at this moment a lot of things different things i said pick one he said patiently and i shrugged its a troublesome world sigfrid with all the good things that have happened why are peopleoh shit im doing it again right he twinkled at me doing what he encouraged saying a thing thats worrying me not the thing dodging away from the real issue that sounds like a good insight robin do you want to try now to tell me what the real issue is i said i want to i want to so much that actually i almost think im going to cry i havent done that for a hell of a long time you havent felt the need to see me for quite a long time he pointed out and i nodded yes exactly he waited for a while slowly turning his pencil between his fingers now and then keeping that expression of polite and friendly interest that nonjudging expression that was really about all i could remember of his face between sessions and then he said the things that really trouble you robin deep down are by definition hard to say you know that we saw that together years ago its not surprising that you havent needed to see me all these years because obviously your life has been going well for you really very well i agreed probably a hell of a lot better than i deservewait a minute am i expressing hidden guilt by saying that feelings of inadequacy he sighed but was still smiling you know i prefer that you dont try to talk like an analyst robin i grinned back he waited for a moment then went on lets look at the present situation objectively you have made sure that no one is here to interrupt usor to eavesdrop to hear something you dont want your nearest and dearest friend to hear youve even instructed albert einstein your dataretrieval system to withdraw and to seal off this interview from all datastores what you have to say must be very private perhaps it is something that you feel but are ashamed to be heard feeling does that suggest anything to you robin i cleared my throat youve put your finger right on it sigfrid and the thing you want to say can you say it i plunged in youre goddamned right i can its simple its obvious im getting very goddamned flicking old thats the best way when its hard to say just say it that was one of the things i had learned from those longago days when i was pouring out my pain to sigfrid three times a week and it always works as soon as i had said it i felt purgednot well not happy not as though a problem had been solved but that glob of badness had been excreted sigfrid nodded slightly he looked down at the pencil he was rolling between his fingers waiting for me to go on and i knew that now i could id got past the worst part i knew the feeling i remembered it well from those old and stormy sessions now im not the same person i was then that robin broadhead had been raw with guilt because hed left a woman he loved to die now those guilt feelings were long easedbecause sigfnd had helped me ease them that robin broadhead thought so little of himself that he couldnt be lieve anyone else would think well of him so he had few friends now i havei dont know dozens hundreds that robin broadhead could not accept love and since then i had had a quarter of a century of the best marriage there ever was so i was a quite different robin broadhead but some of the things had not changed at all sigfrid i said im old im going to die one of these days and do you know what pulls my cork he looked up from his pencil whats that robin im not grownup enough to be so old he pursed his lips would you care to explain that robin yes i said i would and as a matter of fact the next part came easily because you can be sure i had done a lot of thinking on the subject before i went so far as to call sigfrid up i think it has to do with the heechee i said let me finish before you tell me im crazy all right as you may remember i was part of the heechee generation we kids grew up hearing about the heechee which had everything human beings didnt have and knew everything human beings didnt know the heechee werent quite that superior robin im talking about how it seemed to us kid they were scary because we used to threaten each other that theyd come back and get us and most of all they were so far ahead of us in everything that we couldnt compete a little like santa claus a little like those mad pervert rapists our mothers used to warn us against a little like god do you understand what im saying sigfrid he said cautiously i can recognize those feelings yes actually such perceptions have turned up in analysis with many persons of your generation and later right and i remember something you said to me once about freud you said he said that no man could truly grow up while his father was still alive well actually i overrode him and i used to tell you that was bullshit because my own father was nice enough to die while i was still a little kid oh robin he sighed no listen to me what about that biggest father figure there is how can anybody grow up while our father who art in the core is still hanging out there where we cant even get at him much less knock the old bastard oft this is albert einstein again i think id better clear up what robin is saying about gellekiara moynlin she was a fellow gateway prospector with whom he was in love the two of them with other prospectors found themselves trapped in a black hole it was possible to free some of them at the expense of the others robin got free klara and the others did not this may have been an accident may have been klara selflessly sacrificing herself to save him may have been robin panicking and saving himself at their expense even now there is no good way to tell but robin who was a guilt addict carried with him for years the picture of klara in that black hole where time almost stopped always living that same moment of shock and terrorand always blaming him only sigfnd helped him out of that you may wonder how i know about this since the interview with sigfrid was sealed thats easy i know it now the same way robin now knows so much about so many people doing so many things he was not present to see he shook his head sadly father figures quotations from freud no i mean it dont you understand he said gravely yes robin i understand that you are referring to the heechee it is true that is a problem for the human race i agree and unfortunately dr freud never considered such a situation but we arent talking about the human race now were talking about you you didnt call on me for abstract discussions you called me because youre really unhappy and youve already said it is the inevitable process of aging that has made you so so let us confine ourselves to that if we can please dont theorize just tell me what you feel what i feel i yelled is damn old you cant understand that because youre a machine you dont know what its like when your vision gets blurry and the back of your hands get those rusty age spots and your face sags down around your chin when you have to sit down to put your socks on because if you stand on one foot youll fall over when every time you forget a birthday you think its alzheimers disease and sometimes you cant pee when you want to when but i broke off then not because he had interrupted me but because he was listening patiently and looked as though he would go on listening forever and what was the use of saying all that he gave me a moment to make sure i was finished and then began patiently according to your medical records you had your prostate replaced eighteen months ago robin the middleear disturbance can easily be you hold it right there i shouted what do you know about my medical records sigfrid i have orders this talk was sealed of course it is robin believe me not one word of this will be accessible to any of your other programs or to anyone at all but yourself but of course i am able to access all your datastores including your medical charts may i go on the stirrup and anvil in your ear can readily be replaced and that will cure your balance problem corneal transplants will take care of those incipient cataracts the other matters are purely cosmetic and of course there would be no problem in securing good young tissue for you that leaves only the alzheimers disease and truthfully robin i see no signs of that in you i shrugged he waited a moment then said so each of the problems you mentionas well as a long list of others that you didnt say anything about but that do appear on your medical historycan be repaired at any time or already have been perhaps you have put your question the wrong way robin perhaps the problem is not that you are aging but that you arent willing to do what is necessary to reverse it why the hell would i do that he nodded why indeed robin can you answer that question no i cant if i could why would i be asking you he pursed his lips and waited maybe i just want to be that way he shrugged oh come on sigfrid i wheedled all right i admit what you say ive got full medical plus and i can take somebody elses organs for myself as much as i want to and the reason i dont is in my head somewhere i know what you call that endogenous depression but that doesnt explain anything ah robinhe sighedpsychoanalytic jargon again and bad jargon endogenous only means coming from within it doesnt mean theres no cause then whats the cause he said thoughtfully lets play a game by your left hand there is a button i looked yes there was a button on the leather chair thats just to keep the leather in place i said no doubt but in the game we are going to play this button will the minute you press it cause to be done at once all the transplant surgery you need or might want instantly put your finger on the button robin now do you want to press it i see can you tell me why not because i dont deserve to take body parts from somebody else i hadnt planned to say it i hadnt known it and when i had said it all i could do was sit there and listen to the echo of what i had said and sigfrid too was silent for quite a long time then he picked up his pencil and put it in his pocket folded the pad and put it in another pocket and leaned forward robin he said i dont think i can help you there is a feeling of guilt here that i do not see a way to resolve but you helped me so much before i wailed before he said steadily you were causing yourself pain because of guilt over something that was probably not at all your fault and in any case lay well in the past this is not the same at all you can live another fifty years perhaps by transplanting healthy organs to replace your damaged ones but it is true that these organs will come from someone else and for you to live longer may in some sense cause someone else to live much shorter to recognize that truth is not a neurotic guilt feeling robin it is only the admission of a moral truth and that was all he said to me except with a smile that was both kind and sorrowful goodbye i do hate it when my computer programs talk to me about morality especially when they are right now the thing to remember is that while i was having this depression that was not the only thing going on my god no many things were happening to many people in the worldon all the worlds and in the spaces betweenthat were not only a lot more interesting but mattered a great deal more even to me i just did not happen to know about them then even though they involved people i knew let me give you some examples my notyet friend captain who was one of those madrapistsanta claus heechee who had haunted my childish dreams was about to get a lot more scared than thinking about heechee had ever made me my former friend audee walthers jr was about to meet to his cost my once friend wan and my very best friend of all the computer program albert einstein was about to surprise me how very complicated all these statements are i cant help it i lived at a complicated time and in a very complicated way now that i have been vastened all the parts fit neatly together as you will see but then i didnt even know what all the parts were i was one single aging man oppressed by mortality and conscious of sin and when my wife came home and found me slumped on a chaise longue gazing out over the tappan sea she at once cried now then robin what in hell is matter with you i grinned up at her and let her kiss me essie scolds a lot essie also loves a lot and she is a lot of woman to love tall slim long goldyblondy hair that she wears in a tight soviet bun when shes being a professor or a businesswoman and lets fall to her waist when shes coming to bed before i could think over what i was going to say long enough to censor it i blurted ive been talking to sigfrid von shrink ah said essie straightening oh while she was thiuldng that over she began to pull the pins out of her bun after youve lived with a person for a couple of decades you begin to know them and i followed her internal processes as well as if shed spoken them aloud there was worry of course because i had felt the need to talk to a psychoanalyst but there was also a considerable amount of faith in sigfrid essie had always felt she owed sigfrid since she knew that it was only with sigfrids help that i had been able to admit long ago that i was in love with her do you wish to tell me what was about she asked politely and i said age and depression my dear nothing serious only terminal how was your day she studied me with that allseeing diagnostic eye of hers pulling the long dirtyblond hair through her fingers till it fell free and tailored her answer to fit the diagnosis bloody exhausting she said to point where i need a drink very muchas i perceive do you so we had our drink there was room on the chaise for both of us and we watched the moon set over the jersey shore of the sea while essie told me about her day and did not pry essie has a life of her own and a pretty demanding oneits a wonder to me that she is so unfailingly able to find plenty of room for me in it besides checking her franchises she had spent a grueling hour at the research facility we had endowed for integrating heechee technology into our own computers the heechee didnt actually use computers it seemed not counting primitive things like navigation controls for their ships but they had some nifty ideas in nearby fields of course that was essies own specialty and what shed got her doctorate in and when she was talking about her research programs i could see her mind working no need to interrogate old robin about this can simply run override through sigfrid program and at once have total access to interview i said lovingly youre not as smart as you think you are and she stopped in the middle of a sentence what sigfrid and i talked about i explained is sealed hah smug no hah i said just as smug because i made albert promise its stored so that not even you can decrypt it without dumping the whole system hahi she said again curling around to look me in the eye this time the hah was louder and it had an edge to it that could be translated as will have a word with albert about this i tease essie but i also love essie so i let her off the hook i really dont want to break the seal i said becausewell vanity i sound like such a whiney wretch when i talk to sigfrid but ill tell you all about it she sank back pleased and listened while i did when i had finished she thought for a moment and said lhat is why are depressed because have not much to look forward to i nodded but robin have perhaps only limited future but my god what glorious present galactic traveler filthyrich tycoon irresistible sex object to adoring and also very sexy wife i grinned and shrugged thoughtful silence moral question she conceded at last is not unreasonable is credit to you that you consider such matters i too have had qualms when as you remember some gloppy female bits were patched into me to replace wornout ones not so long ago so you understand understand excellently i also understand dear robin that having made moral decision is no point in worrying about it depression is foolish fortunately she said slipping off the chaise and standing up to take my hand there is excellent antidepression measure available will you care to join me in bedroom well of course i would and did and found the depression lifting for if there is one thing i enjoy it is sharing a bed with s ya lavorovuabroadhead i would have enjoyed it even if i had known then that i had less than three months left before the death that had depressed me what happened on peggys planet meanwhile on peggys planet my friend audee walthers was looking for a particular shebeen for a particular man i say he was my friend although i hadnt given him a thought in years he had done me a favor once i hadnt forgotten it exactlythat is if anybody had said to me say robin do you remember that audee walthers put his tail on the line so you could borrow a ship when you needed to i would have said indignantly hell yes i wouldnt forget a thing like that but i hadnt been thinking about it every minute either and as a matter of fact i had no idea at that moment where he was or even if he was still alive walthers should have been easy to remember because he looked rather unusual he was short and not handsome his face was wider at the jaw than at the temples which made him look a little like a friendly frog he was also married to a beautiful and dissatisfied woman less than half as old as he her age was nineteen her name was dolly if audee had asked my advice i would have told him that such may and december affairs cannot work outunless of course as in my case december is remarkably rich but he desperately wanted it to work out because he loved his wife very much and so he worked like a slave for dolly audee walthers was a pilot any kind of pilot he had piloted airbodies on venus when the big earth transport was in orbit at peggys he piloted shuttlecraft to load and unload it between times he piloted whatever he could rent on peggys for whatever tasks a charter demanded like most everybody else on peggys he had come x o kilometers from the place where he was born to scratch out a living and sometimes he made it and sometimes he did not so when he came back from one charter and adjangba told him there was another to be had walthers scrambled to get it even if it meant searching every bar in port hegramet to find the charter party that wasnt easy for a city of four thousand port hegraniet was barsaturated there were scores and the obvious onesthe hotel cafe the airport pub the big gambling casino with port hegramets only floorshowwerent where the arabs who were his next charter were nor was dolly in the casino where she might have been performing with her puppet show or at home or at least not to answer the phone half an hour later walthers was still walking the illlit streets in search of his arabs he was no longer in the richer more western parts of the city and when he finally found them it was in a shebeen at the edge of town having an argument all of the buildings in port hegramet were temporary that was a necessary consequence of its being a colony planet every month when the new immigrants arrived in the big heechee heaven transport from earth the population exploded like a balloon at the hydrogen valve then it gradually shrank for a few weeks as the colonists were moved out to plantations and lumbering sites and mines it never collapsed quite to the former level so each month there were a few hundred new residents a few score new dwellings built and a few old ones swallowed up but this shebeen was most obviously temporary of all it was only three slabs of construction plastic propped together for walls a fourth laid over them as a roof and the street side open to the warm peggys air even so it was smoky and hazy inside smoke of tobacco and smoke of hemp laced with the beery sour smell of the homebrewed liquor they sold waithers recognized his quarry at once from his agents description there were not many like him in port hegrametmany arabs of course but how many rich ones and how many old ones mr luqman was even older than adjangba fat and bald and each one of his plump fingers wore a ring many of them diamonds he was with a group of other arabs at the back of the shebeen but as walthers started toward them the barwoman put out a hand private party she said they pay you leave alone theyre expecting me walthers said hoping it was true for what now thats none of your damn business walthers said angrily estimating the chances of what would happen if he just pushed past her she was no threat skinny darkskinned young woman with great blueglowing metal hoops dangling from her ears but the big man with the bulletshaped head who was sitting in a corner and watching what was going on was something else again fortunately mr luqman saw walthers and stumbled blearily toward him you are my pilot he announced come have a drink thank you mr luqman but ive got to get home i just wanted to confirm the charter yes we shall go with you he turned and gazed toward the others in his party who were having a furious argument about something will you have a drink he asked over his shoulder the man was drunker than waithers had realized he said again thanks but no would you like to sign the charter contract now please luqman turned back to stare at the printout in waitherss hand the contract he thought it over for a moment why must we have a contract its customary mr luqman said walthers patience ebbing rapidly behind him the arabs companions were shouting at each other and luqmans attention was wavering between walthers and the arguing group and that was another thing there were four people involved in the argumentfive if you counted luqman himself mr adjangba said there would be four of you altogether waithers mentioned theres a surcharge if there are five five luqman focused on waltherss face no we are four then his expression changed and he smiled fondly oh you are thinking that crazy man is one of us no he will not go with us he will go to his grave perhaps if he insists on telling shameem what the prophet meant in his teachings i see said waithers then if youll just sign the arab shrugged and took the printout sheet from walthers he spread it on the zinctopped bar and painfully began to read it a pen in his hand the argument grew louder but luqman seemed to have abolished it from his mind most of the shebeens clientele was african what looked like kikuyu on one side of the room and masai on the other at first glance in that company the people at the quarrelsome table had seemed all alike now waithers saw his mistake one of the arguing men was younger than the others and shorter and leaner his skin color was darker than most europeans but not as dark as the libyans his eyes were as black as theirs but not kohied it was none of waitherss business he turned his back and waited patiently anxious to leave not just because he wanted to see dolly port hegramet was somewhat hostilely ethnic chinese mostly stayed with chinese latin americans in their barrio europeans in the european quarteroh not neatly and certainly not always peacefully the divisions were sharp even among the subdivisions chinese from canton did not get along with chinese from taiwan the portuguese had little in common with the finns and the oncechileans and former argentines still quarreled but europeans were definitely not urged to come into african drinking spots and when he had the signed charter he thanked luqman and left quickly and with some relief he had gone less than a block when he heard louder cries of rage behind him and a scream of pain on peggys planet you mind your own business as much as you can but waithers had a charter to protect the group he saw beating up one individual might well have been the african bouncers attacking the leader of his charter party that made it his business he turned and ran backa mistake that believe me he regretted very deeply for a long time afterward by the time walthers got there the assailants were gone and the whimpering bleeding figure on the sidewalk was not one of his charter party it was the young stranger and he clutched at waltherss leg help me and i will give you fifty thousand dollars he said blurrily his lips thick and bloody ill go look for a public patrolman walthers offered trying to disengage himself no patrol you help me kill those persons and i will pay snarled the man i am captain juan henriquette santosschinitz and i can well afford to buy your services of course i knew nothing of this at the time on the other hand walthers didnt know that mr luqman was working for me that didnt matter there were tens of thousands of people working for me and whether or not walthers knew who they were made no difference at all the bad thing was that he didnt recognize wan for he had never heard of him except generally that made a very big difference to waithers in the long run i knew wan particularly i had met him first when he was a wolfchild brought up by machines and nonhumans i called him a nonfriend when i was running through the catalog of my acquaintances for you i knew him all right but he was never socialized enough to be a friend to anyone he was even you could say quite an enemynot just to me but to the whole human racein the days when he was a scared and lecherous youth dreaming into his couch out in the oort cloud and neither knowing nor caring that his dreams were driving everybody else nuts that wasnt his fault to be sure it wasnt even his fault that the wretched and raging terrorists had found inspiration in his example and were driving us all nuts again whenever they could manage itbut if we get into questions of fault and that related term guilt well be right back with sigfrid von shrink before you know it and what im talking about now is audee waithers walthers was no angel of mercy but he couldnt leave the man in the street when he helped the bleeding man into the little apartment he shared with dolly walthers was far from clear in his mind why he was doing it the man was in bad shape true but that was what firstaid stations were for and besides the victim was singularly unwinning in his ways all the way to the quarter called little europe the man was reducing his cash offer and complaining that walthers was a coward by the time he sprawled on waitherss folding bed the cash promise was two hundred and fifty dollars and the reflections on waltherss character had been incessant at least the mans bleeding had stopped he pushed himself up and stared contemptuously around the flat dolly wasnt home yet and she had of course left the place in a messundisposedof dirty dishes on the folddown table her hand puppets scattered all over underwear drying over the sink and a sweater hanging on the doorknob this is a filthy what robin says needs some explication here too the heechee were very interested in living things particularly in life that was intelligent or had the promise of becoming so they had a device that let them listen in on the feelings of creatures worlds away what was wrong with the device was that it transmitted as well as received the operators own emotions were perceived by the subjects if the operator was upset or depressedor insanethe consequences were very very bad the boy wan had such a device when he was marooned as an infant he called it a dream couchacademics later renamed it the telempathic psychokinetic transceiverand when he used it the events robin so subjectively describes occurred place the undesired guest said conversationally this is not worth two hundred fifty dollars even a hot response came to waltherss lips he pushed it back with all the others he had been repressing for the last half hour what was the point ill get you cleaned up he said then you can get out i dont want your money the bruised lips attempted a sneer how foolish of you to say that the man said since i am captain juan henriquette santosschmitz i own my own spacecraft i have royalty shares in the transport vessel that feeds this planet among other very important enterprises and i am said to be the eleventh wealthiest person in the human race i never heard of you waithers grumbled running warm water into a basin but it wasnt true it had been a long time ago yes but there was something there was a memory somebody who had been on the pv news shows every hour for a week then every week for a month or two no one is more securely forgotten than the onemonth famous ten years later youre the kid who was raised in the heechee habitat he said suddenly and the man whined exactly ouch you are hurting me then just hold still said walthers and wondered just what to do with the eleventh wealthiest person in the human race dolly would be thrified to meet him of course but after dolly got over being thrilled what schemes would she be hatching for walthers to tap all that wealth and buy them an island plantation a summer home in the heather hills or a trip home would it in the long run be better to hold the man here under some pretext until dolly got homeor to ease him out and simply tell her about it dilemmas pondered over long enough solve themselves this one solved itself when the door lock pinged and crackled and dolly walked in whatever dolly looked like around the housesometimes with her eyes streaming from an allergy to peggys planets flora often grouchy seldom with her hair brushedwhen she went out she dazzled she obviously dazzled the unexpected guest as she came in the door and although he had been married to that striking slim figure and that impassive alabaster face for more than a year and even knew the rigid dieting that produced the first and the dental flaw that required the second she pretty nearly dazzled walthers himself walthers greeted her with a hug and a kiss the kiss was returned but not with full attention she was peering past him at the stranger still holding her walthers said darling this is captain santosschmitz he was in a fight and i brought him here she pushed him away junior you didnt it took him a moment to realize her misunderstanding oh no dolly the fight wasnt with me i just happened to be nearby her expression thawed and she turned to the guest of course youre welcome here wan let me see what they did to you santosschmitz preened himself you know me he said allowing her to dab at the bits of bandage walthers had already applied of course wan everyone in port hegraniet knows you she shook her head sympathetically over the blackened eye you were pointed out to me last night she said in the spindle lounge he drew back to look at her more closely oh yes the entertainer i saw your act dolly walthers seldom smiled but there was a way of crinkling up the corners of her eyes pursing the pretty lips that was better than a smile it was an attractive expression she displayed it often while they made wan santosschmitz comfortable while they fed him coffee and listened to his explanations of why the libyans had been wrong to get angry at him if waithers had thought dolly would resent his bringing this wayfarer home he found he had nothing to fear in that direction but as the hour got later he began to fidgety wan he said i have to fly in the morning and i imagine youd like to get back to your hotel certainly not junior his wife reproved him we have plenty of room right here he can have the bed you can sleep on the couch and ill take the cot in the sewing room walthers was too startled to frown or even to answer it was a silly idea of course wan would want to go back to the hoteland of course dolly was simply being polite she couldnt really want to set up the sleeping arrangements in such a way that they would have no privacy at all on the one night he had before flying back into the bush with the irascible arabs so he waited with confidence for wan to excuse himself and his wife to allow herself to be convinced and then with less confidence and then with none at all although waithers was a short man the couch was shorter than he was and he tossed and turned on it all night long wishing he had never heard the name of juan henriquette santosschmitz a wish shared by a whole lot of the human race including me wan was not merely a nasty personoh it was not his fault of course he was also a fugitive from justice or would have been if anyone had known exactly what he had swiped out of the old heechee artifacts when he told walthers he was rich he did not lie he had a birthright to a lot of heechee technology simply because his mom had pupped him on a heechee habitat with no other human beings to speak of around this turned out to mean a lot of money for him once the courts had time to think it over it also meant in wans own mind that he had a right to just about anything heechee that he could find that wasnt nailed down he had taken a heechee shipeverybody knew thatbut his money bought lawyers that stalled the gateway corporations suit to recover it in the courts he bad also taken some heechee gadgets not generally available and if anyone had known exactly what they were the case would have whisked through the courts in no time and wan would have been public enemy number one instead of merely an irritation so walthers had every right to hate him though of course those were not the reasons involved when waithers saw the libyans the next morning they were hung over and irritable he was worse the difference between them and walthers being that his mood was even more savage and he wasnt even hung over that was part of the reason for the mood his passengers didnt ask him anything about the night before in fact they hardly spoke as the aircraft droned on over the wide savannahs occasional glades and very infrequent farm patches of peggys planet luqman and one of the other men were buried in falsecolor satellite bolos of the sector they were prospecting one of the others slept the fourth simply held his head and glowered out the window the plane nearly flew itself this time of year with very little serious weather anywhere around waithers bad plenty of time to think about his wife it had been a personal triumph for him when they were married but why werent they living happily ever after of course dolly had had a hard life a kentucky girl with no money no family no jobno skills either and perhaps none too much brainpowersuch a girl had to use all the assets she had if she wanted to get out of coal country dollys one commercial asset was looks good looks though flawed her figure was slim her eyes were bright but her teeth were buck at fourteen she got work as a bartop dancer in cincinnati but it didnt pay enough to live on unless you hustled on the side dolly didnt want to do that she was saving herself she tried singing but she didnt have the voice for it besides trying to sing without moving her lips and exposing her bugs bunny teeth made her look like a ventriloqwst and when a customer trying to hurt her because shed turned his advances down told her that the light dawned over dollys head the mc considered himself a comic in that particular club dolly traded laundry and sewing for some old used comedy routines made herself some hand puppets studied every puppet act she could find on pv or fantape and tried out the act at the last show on a saturday night when another singer was coming in to replace her on sunday the act was not boffo but the new girl singer was even worse than dolly so she got a reprieve two weeks in cincinnati a month in louisville nearly three months in little clubs outside chicagoif the engagements bad been consecutive she would have been well enough off but there were weeks and months between them she did not however actually starve by the time dolly got to peggys planet the jagged corners of the act had banged against so many hostile audiences or drunk ones that it had worn into some sort of serviceable shape not good enough for a real career good enough to keep her alive getting to peggys planet was a desperation move because you had to sign your life away for the passage there was no stardom here but she wasnt any worse off either and if she was no longer saving herself exactly at least she didnt spend herself very profligately when audee walthers jr came along he offered a higher price than most others had proposedmarriage so she did it at eighteen to a man twice her age dollys hard life though wasnt really that much harder than anyone elses on peggysnot counting of course people like audees oil prospectors the prospectors paid full fare to get to peggys planet or their companies did and every one of them surely had a paidup return ticket in his pocket it did not make them more cheerful it was a sixhour flight to the point on west island they had chosen for a base camp by the time they had eaten and popped their shelters and said their prayers a time or two not without arguments about which direction to face in their hangovers were pretty well dissipated but it was also pretty well too late to get anything done that day for them not for waithers he was ordered to fly crisscross strikes across twenty thousand hectares of billy scrub as he was merely towing a mass sensor to measure gravitational anomalies it did not matter that he had to do it in the dark it did not matter to mr luqman at any rate but it mattered a lot to walthers because it was precisely the sort of flying that he hated most his altitude had to be quite low and some of the hills were fairly high so he flew with both radar and searchbeams going all the time terrifying the slow stupid animals that inhabited these west island savannabs and terrifying himself when he found himself dozing off and waking to claw for altitude as a shrubtopped hill summit rushed toward him he managed five hours sleep before luqman woke him to order a photographic reconnaissance of a few unclear sites and when that was done he was set to dropping spikes all over the terrain the spikes were not simple solid metal they were geophones and they had to be set in a receiving array kilometers in length moreover they had to drop from at least twenty meters to be sure to penetrate the surface and stand upright so that their readings would be trustworthy and each one bad to be placed within a circular error of two meters it did walthers no good to point out that these requirements were mutually contradictory so it was no surprise to him that when the truckmounted vibrators did their thing the petrological data were no use at all do it over said mr luqman and so walthers had to retrace his steps on foot pulling out the geophones and hammering them in by hand what he had signed on to do was pilot but mr luqman took a broader view not just trudging around with the geophone spikes one day they had him digging for the ticklike creatures that were the peggys equivalent of earthworms aerating the soil the next they gave him a thing like a rotorooter which dug itself down into the soil a few dozen meters and pulled out core samples they would have had him peeling potatoes if they had eaten potatoes and did in fact try to lumber him with all the dishwashingbacking off only to the extent that it was finally agreed to do it in strict rotation but walthers noticed that mr luqmans turn never seemed to come not that the chores werent interesting the ticklike bugs went into a jar of solvent and the soup that resulted became a smear on an electrophoresis sheet of filter paper the cores went into little incubators with sterile water sterile air and sterile hydrocarbon vapors they were both tests for oil the bugs like termites were deep diggers some of what they dug through came back to the surface with them and electrophoresis would sort out what it was that they carried back the incubators tested for the same thing in a different way peggys like earth had in its soil microorganisms that could live on a diet of pure hydrocarbons so if anything grew on the pure hydrocarbons in the incubators that sort of bug had to be what was growing there and it would not have existed without a source of free hydrocarbons in the soil in either case there would be oil but for waithers the tests were mostly stooplabor drudgery and the only surcease from them was to be ordered back into the aircraft to tow the magnetometer again or to drop more spikes after the first three days he retired to his tent to pull out his contract printout and make sure he was required to do all these things he was he decided to have a word with his agent when he got back to port hegramet after the fifth day he was reconsidering it seemed more attractive to kill the agent but all the flying had one beneficial effect eight days into the threeweek expedition walthers reported gladly to mr luqman that he was running low on fuel and would have to make a ifight back to base for more hydrogen when he got to the little apartment it was dark but the apartment was neat which was a pleasant surprise dolly was home which was even better best of all she was sweetly obviously delighted to see him the evening was perfect they made love dolly fixed some dinner they made love again and at midnight they sat on the openedout bed backs propped against the cushioning legs outstretched before them holding hands and sharing a bottle of peggys wine i wish you could take me back with you dolly said when he finished telling her about the new delaware charter dolly wasnt looking at him she was idly fitting puppet heads on her free hand her expression easy no chance of that darling he laughed youre too goodlooking to take out in the bush with four horny arabs listen i dont feel all that safe myself she raised her hand her expression still relaxed the puppet she wore this time was a kitten face with bright red luminous whiskers the pink mouth opened and her kitten voice lisped wan says theyre really rough he says they couldve killed him just for talking about religion with them he says he thought they were going to oh walthers shifted position as the back of the daybed no longer seemed quite so comfortable he didnt ask the question on his mind which was oh have you been seeing wan because that would suggest that he was jealous he only said how is wan but the other question was contained in that one and was answered wan was much better wans eye was hardly black at all now wan had a really neat ship in orbit a heechee five but it was his personal property and it had been fixed up specialso he said she hadnt seen it of course wan had sort of hinted that some of the equipment was old heechee stuff and maybe not too honestly come by wan had sort of hinted that there was plenty of heechee stuff around that never got reported because the people that found it didnt want to pay royalties to the gateway corporation you know wan figured he was entitled to it really because hed had this unbelievable life brought up by practically the heechee themselves without walthers willing it the internal question externalized itself it sounds like youve been seeing a greal deal of wan he offered trying to seem casual and hearing his own voice prove he was not indeed he was not casual he was either angry or worriedmore angry than worried actually because it made no sense wan was surely not goodlooking or goodtempered of course he was rich and also a lot closer to dollys age oh honey dont be jealous dolly said in her own voice sounding if anything pleasedwhich somewhat reassured waithers hes going to go pretty soon anyway you know he doesnt want to be here when the transport gets in and right now hes off ordering supplies for his next trip thats the only reason he came here she raised the puppeted hand again and the childish kitten voice sang juniors jealous of vollee i am not he said instinctively and then admitted i am dont hold it against me doll she moved in the bed until her lips were near his ear and he felt her soft breath lisping in the kitten voice i promise i wont mr junior but id be awful glad if you would and as reconciliations went it went very well except that right in the middle of round four it was zapped by the snarling ring of the piezophone walthers let it ring fifteen times long enough to complete the task in progress though not nearly as well as he had intended when he answered the phone it was the duty officer from the airport did i call you at a bad time waithers just tell me what you want said walthers trying not to show that he was still breathing hard well rise and shine audee theres a party of six down with scurvy grid seven three poppa coordinates a little fuzzy but theyve got a radio beacon thats all theyve got youre flying them a doctor a dentist and about a ton of vitamin c to arrive at first light which means you take off in ninety minutes tops ah hell carey cant it wait only if you want them doa theyre real bad the shepherd that found them says theres two of them he dont think will make it anyway walthers swore to himself looked apologetically at dolly and then reluctantly began getting his gear together when dolly spoke the voice was not a kittens anymore junior cant we go back home this is home he said trying to make it light please junior the relaxed face had tightened up and the ivory mask was impassive but he could hear the strain in her voice dolly love he said theres nothing there for us remember thats why people like us come here now weve got a whole new planet why this city by itself is going to be bigger than tokyo newer than new york theyre going to have six new transports in a couple of years you know and a lufstrom loop instead of these shuttles but when when im old there might not have been a justifiable reason for the misery in her voice but the misery was there all the same walthers swallowed took a deep breath and tried his joking best sweetpants he said you wont be old even when youre ninety no response aw but honey he cajoled its bound to get better theyre sure to start a food factory out in our oort pretty soon it might even be next year and they as much as promised me a piloting job for the construction oh fine so then youll be away a year at a time instead of just a month and ill be stuck in this dump without even any decent programs to talk to theyll have programs ill be dead first he was wide awake now the joys of the night worn away he said look if you dont like it here we dont have to stay theres more on peggys than port hegramet we can go out into the back country clear some land build a house raise strong sons found a dynasty her voice was scornful well something like that i guess she turned over in the bed take your shower she advised you smell like fucking and while audee walthers jr was in the shower a creature that looked quite unlike any of dollys puppets was seeing his first foreign stars in the thirtyone true years and meanwhile one of the sick prospectors had stopped breathing much to the relief of the shepherd who was trying head averted to nurse him and meanwhile there were riots on earth and fiftyone dead colonists on a planet eight hundred lightyears away and meanwhile dolly had got up long enough to make him coffee and leave it on the table she herself went back to bed where she was or pretended to be sound asleep while he drank it and dressed and went out the door when i look at audee from this very great distance that separates us now i am saddened to see that he looks so much like a wimp he wasnt really he was quite an admirable person he was a firstrate pilot physi cally brave roughandtumble tough when he had to be kind when he had a chance i suppose everybody looks wimpy from inside and of course from inside is how i see him nowfrom a very great distance inside or outside depending on what analog of geometry you choose to apply for this metaphor we all have some areas of wimpiness is what i am trying to say it would be kinder to call them areas of vulnerability and audee simply happened to be extremely vulnerable where dolly was concerned but wimpiness was not audees natural state for the next little bit of time he was all the good things a person needed to beresourceful succoring the needy tireless he needed to be peggys planet had some traps concealed beneath its gentle facade as nonterran worlds go peggys was a jewel you could breathe the air you could survive the climate the flora did not usually give you hives and the fauna was astonishingly tame wellnot exactly tame more like stupid walthers wondered sometimes what the heechee had seen in peggys planet the thing was the heechee were supposed to be interested in intelligent lifenot that they seemed to have found much and there was certainly not much of that on peggys the smartest anims was a predator foxsized moleslow it had the iq of a turkey and proved it by being its own worst enemy its prey was dumber and slower than it wasso it always had plenty to eatand its biggest single cause of death was strangulation on food particles when it threw up what it had eaten too much of human beings could eat that predator if they wanted to and most of its prey and a lot of the biota in general as long as they were careful the raggedass uranium prospectors hadnt been careful by the time the violent tropical sunrise exploded over the jungle and waithers set his aircraft down in the nearest clearing one of them had died of it the medical team had no time for a doa so they flocked around the barely living ones and sent walthers off to dig a grave for a time he had hopes to pass the chore on to the sheepherders but their flocks were scattered all over as soon as waitherss back was turned so were the shepherds the doa looked at least ninety and smelled like a hundred and ten but the tag on his wrist described him as selini yasmeneh twentythree born in a shantytown south of cairo the rest of his life story was easy to read so he had scrabbled for an adolescence in the egyptian slums hit the miracle oddsagainst chance of a passage for a new life on peggys sweltered in the tentiered bunks of the transport agonized through the of course you realize the wimpiness robin is excusing here isnt that of audee waithers robin was never a wimp except in the need to reassure himself from time to time that he wasnt humans are so strange landing in the deorbiting capsulefifty colonists strapped into a pilotless pod deorbited by a thrust from outside shaken into terror on entry the excrement jolted out of them as the parachutes popped open nearly all the capsules did in fact land safely only about three hundred colonists so far had been crushed or drowned yasmeneh was that lucky at least but when he tried to change careers from farming barley to prospecting heavy metals his luck ran out because his party forgot to be careful the tubers theyd fed themselves on when their storebought food ran out contained like almost every obvious food source on peggys a vitamin c antagonist that had to be experienced to be believed they hadnt believed even then they knew about the risk everybody did they just wanted one more day and then another day and another while their teeth loosened and their breath grew foul and by the time the sheepherders stumbled across their camp it was too late for yasmeneh and pretty close to the same for the others walthers had to fly the whole party survivors and rescuers together to the camp where someday the loop would be built and already there were at least a dozen permanent habitations by the time he got back at last to the libyans mr luqman was furious he hung on the door of waitherss plane and shouted at him thirtyseven hours away it is outrageous fcr the exorbitant charter we pay you we expect your services it was a matter of life or death mr luqman walthers said trying to keep the irritation and fatigue out of his voice as he postflighted the plane life is the cheapest thing there is and death comes to us all waithers pushed past him and sprang down to the ground they were fellow arabs mr luqman no egyptians well fellow moslems anyway i would not care if they were my own brothers our time is precious very large affairs are at stake here why try to restrain his own anger walthers snarled its the law luqman i only lease the plane i have to provide emergency services when called on read your fine print it was an unanswerable argument and how infuriating it was when luqman made no attempt to answer it but simply responded by heaping onto waithers all the tasks that had accumulated in his absence all to be completed at once or sooner and if walthers hadnt had any sleep well we would all sleep forever one day would we not so sleepless as he was walthers was flying magnetosonde traces within the next hourprickly tetchy work towing a magnetic sensor a hundred meters behind the plane and trying to keep the damned unwieldy thing from snagging in a tree or plunging itself into the ground and in the moments of thought between the demands of really trying to fly two aircraft at once walthers thought somberly that luqman had lied it would have made a difference if the egyptians had been fellowlibyans much less brothers nationalism had not been left back on earth there had been border clashes already gauchos versus rice farmers when the cattle herds went looking for a drink in the paddies and trampled the seedlings chinese versus mexicans when there was a mistake in filing land claims africans versus canadians slays versus hispanics for no reason at all that any outsider could see bad enough what was worse was the bad blood that sometimes surfaced between slav and slav between latino and latino and peggys could have been such a pretty world it had everything almost everything if you didnt count things like vitamin c it had heechee mountain with a waterfall called the cascade of pearls eight hundred meters of milky torrent coming right off the southern glaciers it had the cinnamonsmelling forests of the little continent with its dumb friendly lavendercolored monkeyswell not real monkeys but cute and the glass sea and the wind caves and the farmsespecially the farms the farms were what made so many millions and tens of millions of africans chinese indians latinos poor arabs iranians irish poles so many millions of desperate people so willing to go so far from earth and home poor arabs he had thought to himself but there were some rich ones too like the four he was working for when they talked about very large affairs they measured the scale in dollars and cents that was clear this expedition was not cheap his own charter was in six figures pity he couldnt keep more of it for himself and that was almost the least part of what they had spent for popup tents and soundpoppers for microphone ranging and rock samplers for the lease of sateffite time for their falsecolor pictures and radar contourmapping for the instruments they paid him to drag around the terrain and what about the next step next they would have to dig sinking a shaft to the salt dome they had located three thousand meters down would cost in the millions except he discovered that it would not because they too had some of that illegal heechee technology wan had told dolly about the first thing human beings had learned about the longgone heechee was that they liked to dig tunnels because examples of their work lay all about under the surface of the planet venus and what they had dug the tunnels with was a technological miracle a field projector that loosened the crystalline structure of rock converted it to a sort of slurry that pumped the slurry away and lined the shaft with that dense hard bluegleaming heechee metal such projectors still existed but not in private hands they did however seem to be available to the hands of mr luqmans party which implied not only money behind them but influence which implied somebody with muscle in the right places and from casual remarks dropped in the brief intervals of rest and meals waithers suspected that somebody was a man named robinette broadhead the salt dome was definite the drilling sites were chosen the main work of the expedition was done all that remained was checking out a few other possibilities and completing the crosschecks even luqman began to relax and the talk in the evenings turned to home home for all four of them turned out not to be libya or even paris it was texas where they averaged wives each and about half a dozen children in all not very evenly distributed as far as walthers could tell but they were probably purposely unclear about details to try to encourage openness walthers found himself talking about dolly more than he meant to about her extreme youth her career as an entertainer her hand puppets he told them how clever dolly was making all the puppets herselfa duck a puppy a chimp a clown best of all a heechee dollys heechee had a receding forehead a beaked nose a jutting chin and eyes that tapered back to the ears like an egyptian wall painting in profile the face was almost a single line slanting downall imaginary of course since no one had ever seen a heechee then the youngest libyan fawni nodded judiciously yes it is good that a woman should earn money he declared it isnt just the money it helps keep her active you know even so im afraid she gets pretty bored in port hegramet she really has no one to talk to the one named shameem also nodded programs he advised sagely when i had but one wife i bought her several fine programs for company she particularly liked the dear abby and the friends of fatima i remember i wish i could but theres not much like that on peggys yet its very difficult for her so i really cant blame her if sometimes when im you know feeling amorous and she isnt walthers broke off because the libyans were laughing it is written in the second surayoung fawzi guffawedthat waitherss suspicion that robin broadhead financed the prospectors was wellfounded waltherss opinion of robins motivesnot so wellfounded robin was a very moral man but not normally a very legal one he was also a man who got a lot of pleasure out of dropping hints about himself particularly when talking about himself in the third person woman is our field and we may go into our field to plow it when we will so says albaqara the cow walthers suppressing resentment essayed a joke unfortunately my wife is not a cow unfortunately your wife is not a wife the arab scolded back home in houston we have for such as you a term pussywhipped it is a shameful state for a man now listen walthers began reddening and then clamped down again on his anger over by the cooking tent luqman looked up from his meticulous measuring of the days brandy ration and frowned at the sound of the voices walthers forced a reassuring smile we shall never agree he said so lets be friends anyway he sought to change the subject ive been wondering he said why you decided to look for oil right here on the equator fawzis lips pursed and he studied waltherss face closely before he replied we have had many indications of appropriate geology sure you haveall those satellite photos have been published you know theyre no secret but theres even betterlooking geology in the northern hemisphere around the glass sea lhat is enough fawzi interrupted his voice rising you are not paid to ask questions walthers i was just you were prying where you have no business that is what you were doing and the voices were loud again and this time luqman came over with their eighty milliliters each of brandy now what is it he demanded what is the american asking it does not matter i have not answered luqman glared at him for a moment waltherss brandy ration in his hand and then abruptly he lifted it to his lips and tossed it down walthers stifled a growl of protest it did not matter that much he did not really want to be drinking companions with these people and in any case it seemed luqmans careful measuring of milliliters had not kept him from a shot or two in private earlier because his face was flushed and his voice was thick walthers he growled i would punish your prying if it was important but it is not you want to know why we look here one hundred seventy kilometers from where the launch loop will be built then look above you he thrust a theatrical arm to the darkened sky and then lurched away laughing over his shoulder he tossed it does not matter anymore anyway walthers stared after him then glanced up into the night sky a bright blue bead was sliding across the unfamiliar constellations the transport the interstellar vessel s ya broadhead had entered high orbit he could read its course jockeying to low orbit and parking there an immense potatoshaped bluegleaming lesser moon in the cloudless sky of peggys planet in nineteen hours it would be parked before then he had to be in his shuttle to meet it to participate in the frantic spacetosurface flights for the fragile fractions of the cargo and for the favored passengers or nudging the freefall deorbiters out of their paths to bring the terrified immigrants down to their new home walthers thanked luqman silently for stealing his drink he could afford no sleep that night while the four arabs slept he was breaking down tents and stowing equipment packing his aircraft and talking with the base at port hegramet to make sure he had a shuttle assignment he had if he was there by noon the following day they would give him a berth and a chance to cash in on the frantic round trips that would empty the vast transport and free it for its return trip at first light he had the arabs up cursing and stumbling around in half an hour they were aboard his plane and on the way home he reached the airport in plenty of time although something inside him was whispering monotonously too late too late too late for what and then he found out when he tried to pay for his fuel the banking monitor flashed a red zero there was nothing in the account he shared with dolly impossiblel or not really impossible he thought looking across the field to where wans lander had been ten days earlier and was no more and when he took time to race over to the apartment he was not really surprised by what he found their bank account was gone dollys clothes were gone the hand puppets were gone and most gone of all was dolly herself i was not thinking at all of audee walthers at that time if i had been i would surely have wept for himor for myself i would have thought that it was at least a good excuse for weeping the tragedy of the dear sweet lover gone away was one i knew well my own lost love having locked herself inside a black hole years and years before but the truth is i never gave him a thought i was concerned with selfaffairs what occupied me most notably were the stabbings in my gut but also i spent a lot of time thinking about the nastiness of terrorists threatening me and everything around me of course that was not the only nastiness around i thought about my wornout intestines because they forced me to but meanwhile my store bought arteries were slowly hardening and every day six thousand cells were dying in my irreplaceable brain and meanwhile stars slowed in their flight and the universe dragged itself toward its ultimate entropic death and meanwhilemeanwhile everything if you stopped to think of it was skidding downhill and i never gave any of it a thought but thats the way we do it isnt it we keep going because we have schooled ourselves not to think of any of those meanwhilesuntil like my gut they force themselves on us senseless violence a bomb in kyoto that incinerated a thousand thousandyearold carved wooden buddhas a crewless ship that homed on the gateway asteroid and released a cloud of anthrax spores when it was opened a shooting in los angeles and plutonium dust in the staines reservoir for london those were the things that were forcing themselves on all of us terrorism acts of senseless violence theres a queerness in the world said i to my dear wife essie individuals act sober and sensible but in groups they are brawling adolescentssuch childishness people exhibit when they form groups yes said essie nodding that is true but tell me robin how is your gut as well as can be expected i said lightly adding as a joke you cant get good parts anymore for those guts were of course a transplant like a sizable fraction of the accessories my body requires to keep itself moving alongsuch are the benefits of full medical plus but i am not talking about my own sickness im talking about the sickness of the world and is right that you should do so essie agreed although is my opinion that if you got your gut relined you would talk about such things less often she came up behind me and rested her palm on my forehead gazing abstractedly out at the tappan sea essie understands instrumentation as few people do and has prizes to prove it but when she wants to know if i have a fever she checks it the way her nurse did to her when she was a toddler in leningrad is not very hot she said reluctantly but what does albert say albert says i said that you should go peddle your hamburgers i pressed her hand with mine honestly im all right will ask albert to be sure she bargainedactually she was deeply involved in setting up a whole new string of her franchises and i knew it will i promised and patted her stifi splendid bottom as she turned away to her own workroom as soon as she was gone i called albert you heard in the holoframe over my desk the image of my dataretrieval program swirled into visibility scratching his nose with the stem of his pipe yes robin said albert einstein of course i heard as you know my receptors are always functioning except when you specifically ask me to turn them off or when the situation is clearly private uhhuh i said studying him he is not any sort of pinup my albert with his untidy sweatshirt gathered in folds around his neck and his socks down around his anldes essie would straighten him up for me in a second if i asked her to but i liked him the way he was and how can you tell the situation is private if you dont peek he moved the stem of his pipe from his nose to his cheekbone still scratching still gently smiling it was a familiar question and did not require an answer albert is really more of a friend than a computer program he knows enough not to answer when i ask a rhetorical question long ago i had about a dozen different informationretrieval and decisionmaking programs i had a businessmanager program to tell me how my investments were doing and a doctor program to tell me when my organs were due for replacement and a lawyer program to tell me how to get out of trouble and when i got into too much of it my old psychiatrist program who told me why i was screwing up or tried to i didnt always believe him but more and more i got used to one single program and so the program i spent most of my time with was my general science advisor and home handyman albert einstein robin he said gently reproving you didnt call me just to find out if i was a peeping tom did you you know perfectly well why i called you i told him and indeed he did he nodded and pointed to the far wall of my office over tappan sea where my intercom screen wasalbert controls that as well as about everything else i own on it a sort of xray picture appeared while we were talldng he said i was taking the liberty of scanning you with pulsed sound robin see here this is your latest intestinal transplant and if you will look closelywait ill enlarge the imagei think youll be able to see this whole area of inflammation im afraid youre rejecting all right i didnt need you to tell me that i snapped how long before it becomes critical you mean ah robin he said earnestly that is difficult to say for medicine is not quite an exact science how long he sighed i can give you a minimum and maximum estimate catastrophic failure is not likely in less than one day and almost certain in sixty days i relaxed it was not as bad as it might have been so i have some time before it gets serious no robin he said earnestly it is already serious the discomfort you now feel will increase you should start medication at once in any case but even with the medication the prognosis is for quite severe pain rather soon he paused studying me i think from the expression on your face he said that for some idiosyncratic reason you want to put it off as long as you possibly can i want to stop thз terrorists an yes he agreed i know you do and indeed that is a valid thing to do if may offer a value judgment for that reason you wish to go to brasilia to intercede with the gateway commissioni did the worst thing the terrorists were doing was done from a spaceship no one had been able to catchand try to get them to share data so that they can move against the terrorists what you want from me then is assurance that the delay wont kill you exactly my dear albert i smiled i can give you that assurance he said gravely or at least i can continue to monitor you until your condition becomes acute at that time however you must at once begin new surgery agreed my dear albert i smiled but he didnt smile back however he went on it does not seem to me that that is your only reason for putting off the replacement i think there is something else on your mind oh albert sighedyoure pretty tedious when you act like sigfrid von shrink turn yourself off like a good fellow and he did looking thoughtful and he had every reason to look thoughtful because he was right you see somewhere inside me in that unlocatable space where i keep the solid core of guilt sigfrid von shrink did not quite purge away i carried the conviction that the terrorists were right i dont mean right in murdering and blowing up and driving people crazy thats never right i mean right in believing that they had a grievance a wickedly unjust grievance against the rest of the human race and therefore they were right in demanding attention be paid to it i didnt want just to stop the terrorists i wanted to make them well or at least i wanted not to make them any sicker than they were and that was where we got into the morality of it all how much do you have to steal from another person before the act makes you a thief the question was much on my mind and i had no good place to go for the answers not to essie because with essie the conversation always came back to my gut not with my old psychoanalytic program because those conversations always shifted from what do i do to make things better to why robin do you feel that you must make things better not even with albert i could chat with albert about anything at all but when i ask him questions like that he gives me the sort of look he would give me if i asked him to define the properties of phlogiston or of god albert is only a holographic projection but he interacts with the environment really well just as well as though he were there sometimes so he looks meditatively around wherever we happen to bethe tappan sea house for instance which i admit is pretty comfortably fixed up and he says something like why do you ask such metaphysical questions robin and i know that the unspoken part of his message is good heavens boy dont you know when youve got it made well i do have it made up to a point i do gods own good luck gave me a bundle of money when i expected it least and money makes money and now i can buy anything that is for sale even some things that arent i already own a large number of things worth having i have powerful friends i am a person to be reckoned with i am loved really well loved by my dear wife essieand frequently too in spite of the fact that were both getting along in years so i sort of laugh and change the subject but i havent had an answer i havent even now had an answer although now the questions are a lot tougher another thing on my conscience is that i am letting poor audee walthers stew in his misery a long time while i digress so let me finish the point the reason i felt guilty about the terrorists was that they were poor and i was rich there was a great grand galaxy out there for them but we didnt have any good way of getting them to it not fast enough anyway and they were screaming starving seeing on the pv screen how glorious life could be for some of us and then looking around their own huts or hogans or tenements and seeing how despairing it was for them and how little chance there was that the great good things could become theirs before they died it is called the revolution of rising expectations albert says there should have been a cure for itbut i couldnt find it and the question on my mind was did i have the right to make it worse did i have the right to buy somebody elses organs and integument and arteries when my own wore out i didnt know the answer and i dont know it now but the pain in my gut was not as bad for me as the pain of contemplating what it meant for me to steal somebody elses life just because i could pay for it and he could not and while i was sitting there pressing my hand against my belly and wondering what i was going to be when i grew up the whole huge universe was going on about its business and most of its business was worrisome there was that machs principle thing that albert had tried and tried to explain to me that suggested somebody maybe the heechee was trying to crush the universe into a ball so as to rewrite the physical laws incredible also incredibly scary when you let yourself think about it but millions or billions of years in the future too so i wouldnt call it a really pressing worry the terrorists and the growing armies were nearer at hand the terrorists had hijacked a loop capsule heading for the high pentagon new recruits for their ranks were being generated in the sahel where crops had failed one more time meanwhile audee walthers was trying to start a new life for himself without his errant wife and meanwhile the wife was erring with that nasty creature wan and meanwhile near the core the heechee captain was beginning to think erotic thoughts about his second in corn the machs principlething robin talks about was at that time still only a speculation though as robin says a very scary one it is a complicated subject for now let me just say that there were indications that the expansion of the universe had been arrested and a contraction had begunand even a suggestion from old fragmentary heechee records that the process was not natural mand whose friendlyname was twice and meanwhile my wife troubled about my belly was nevertheless happily completing a deal for cxtending her fastfood franchise chain to papua new guinea and the andaman islands and meanwhileoh meanwhile what a lot was going on meanwhile and always is though usually we dont know about it aboard the ya lightyears from earth my friendformer friendabout to be friend again audee walthers was remembering my name again and not too favorably he was coming up against a rule i had made i mentioned that i owned a lot of things one of the things i owned was a share in the biggest space vehicle known to mankind it was one of the bits and pieces of gadgetry the heechee had left behind in the solar system floating out beyond the oort comet cloud until it got discovered discovered by human beings i meanheechee and australopithecines dont count we called it heechee heaven but when it occurred to me that it would make a marvelous good transport for getting some of those poor people away from the earth which couldnt support them to some hospitable other planet that could i persuaded the other shareholders to rename it after my wife the s ya broadhead it was called so i put up the money to refit it for colonistcarrying and we started it off on round trips to the best and nearest of those places peggys planet this put me into another of those situations where conscience and common sense came into conflict because what i really wanted was to get everybody to a place where they could be happy but in order to get it done i had to be able to show a profit thus broadheads rules they were pretty much the same rules as for the gateway asteroid years ago you had to pay your way there but you could do it on credit if you were lucky enough to have your name come up in the draw getting back to earth however was strictly cash if you were a landgrant colonist you could reassign your sixty hectares to the company and they would give you a return ticket if you didnt have the land anymore because youd sold it or traded it or lost it shooting craps you had two choices you could pay for a return ticket in cash or you could stay where you were or if you happened to be a fully qualified pilot and if one of the ships officers had made up his mind to stay on peggys you could work your way back that was waltherss way what he would do when he got back to earth he didnt know what he knew for sure was that he could not stay in that empty apartment after dolly left and so he sold off their furnishings for whatever he could get in the minutes between shuttle flights made his deal with the s ya s captain and was on his way it struck him as queer and unpleasant that the thing that had seemed so impossible when dolly asked for it suddenly became the only thing he could do when she left him but life he had discovered was often queer and unpleasant so he came aboard the s ya at the last minute shaking with fatigue he had ten hours before his first duty shift and he slept it all even so he was still groggy and maybe a little numbed with trauma when a fifteenyearold failed colonist came to bring him coffee and escort him to the control room of the interstellar transport s ya broadhead nйe heechee heaven how huge the damn thing was from outside you couldnt really tell but those long passages those chambers with tentiered bunk beds now empty those guarded galleries and halls with unfamiliar machines or the stubs of places where the machines had been taken awaysuch vastness was no part of waitherss previous experience of spacecraft even the control room was immense and even the controls themselves were duplicated walthers had flown heechee vesselsthat was how hed got to pews planet in the first place piloting a converted five the controls here were almost the same but there were two sets of them and the transport could not be flown unless both sets were manned welcome aboard seventh the tiny orientallooking woman in the lefthand seat smiled im janie yeexing third officer and youre my relief captain ainheiro will be here in a minute she didnt offer her hand or even lift either of them from the controls before her that much waithers had expected two pilots on duty at all times meant two pilots hands on the controls otherwise the bird did not fly it wouldnt crash of course because there was nothing for it to crash into but it wouldnt maintain course and acceleration either ludolfo amheiro came in a plump little man with gray sideburns with nine blue bangles on his left forearmnot many people wore them anymore but walthers knew that each one represented a heecheevessel flight in the days when you never knew where your ship was taking you so here was a man with experience glad to have you aboard walthers he said perfunctorily do you know how to relieve the watch theres nothing to it really if youll just put your hands on the wheel over yeexings walthers nodded and did as he was ordered her hands felt warm and soft as she slipped them carefully out from under his then slid her pretty bottom off the pilots seat to allow walthers to occupy it thats all there is waithers said the captain satisfied first officer madjhour will actually fly the vesselnodding to the dark smiling man who had just moved into the righthand seat and hell tell you whats necessary for you you get a pee break of ten minutes each hour and thats about it join me for dinner tonight will you and the invitation was reinforced by a smile from third officer janie yeexing and it was astonishing to walthers as he turned to listen to his instructions from ghazi madjhour to realize that it had been all of ten minutes since he had thought of goneaway dolly it was not quite as easy as that piloting was piloting you didnt forget it but navigation was something else especially as a lot of the old heechee navigation charts had been unraveled or at least partly unraveled while walthers was flying shepherds and prospectors around peggys the star charts on the s ya were far more complicated than the ones audee had used on the trip out they came in two varieties the most interesting one was heechee it had queer gold and graygreen markings that were only imperfectly understood but it showed everything the other far less detailed but a lot more useful to human beings was humancharted and englishlabeled then there was the ships log to check as it automatically recorded everything the ship did or saw there was the whole internal system displaynot the pilots concern of course except that if something went wrong the pilot needed to know about it and all of this was new to audee the good part of that was that learning the new skills kept walthers busy janie yeexing was there to teach him and that was good too because she kept his thoughts busy in a different way except in those bad times just before he fell asleep since the s ya was on a return trip it was almost empty more than thirtyeight hundred colonists had gone out to peggys planet coming back there were hardly any the three dozen human beings in the ships crew the military detachments maintained by the four governing nations of the gateway corp and about sixty failed immigrants they were the steerage they had impoverished themselves to go out now they glumly bankrupted themselves to get back to whatever desert or slum they had fled because when push came to shove they couldnt quite hack pioneering in a new world poor bastards waithers said circling to pass a work party of them cleaning air filters at a slaves torpid pace but yeewig would have none of that dont waste your pity on them waithers they had it made and they chickened out she snarled something in cantonese at the work party who resentfully moved minutely faster for a moment you cant blame people for being homesick home god waithers you talk as if there was a home leftyouve been out in the boonies too long she paused at the junction of two corridors one glowing blue with tracings of heechee metal the other gold she waved at the party of armed guards in the uniforms of china brazil the united states and the soviet union do you see them fraternizing she demanded used to be they didnt take this seriously theyd pal around with the crew they never carried weapons it was just an allexpensepaid cruise in space for them but now she shook her head and reached out abruptly to grab waitherss arm as he started to get closer to the guards why dont you listen to me she demanded theyll give you hell if you try to go in there whats in there she shrugged the heechee stuff they didnt take out of the ship when they converted it thats one of the things theyre guardingalthough she added her voice lower if they knew the ship better theyd do a better job but come on we go this way unraveling the heechee maps was extremely difficult especially as they showed clear indications that they were intended to be difficult to unravel there were not many of them to go on two or three fragments found in vessels like the socalled heechee heaven or s va and a nearly complete one found in an artifact circling a frozen planet around a star in boцtes it was my personal opinion though not supported by the official reports of the cartographical study commissions that many of the haloes check marks and flickering indicia were meant as warning signs robin didnt believe me then he said i was a cowardly pudding of spun photons by the time he came to agree with me what he called me no longer mattered waithers followed willingly enough grateful for the sightseeing tour as much as for their destination the s ya was far the biggest ship he or any other human being had ever seen heecheebuilt very oldand still in some ways very puzzling they were halfway home and waithers had not yet explored a quarter of its mazy glowing corridors the part he had especially not explored was yeexings private cabin and he was looking forward to that with the interest of any tenday virgin but there were distractions whats that he asked pausing at a pyramidal construction of greenglowing metal in an alcove a heavy steel grating had been welded in front of it to keep prying hands off beats me said yeexing nobody else knows eitherthats why theyve left it here some of the stuff can be cut out and moved easily some gets wreckednow and then if you try to remove something it blows up in your face here right down this little alley this is where i live neat narrow bed pictures of an old oriental couple on the wall janies parentssprays of flowers on the wail chest yeexing had made the place her own on return trips that is she explained on the way out this is the captains cabin and the rest of us sleep on cots in the pilot room she tugged at the cover on the bed which was already quite straight theres not much chance to fool around on outgoing trips she said meditatively would you like a glass of wine i certainly would said walthers and so he sat down and had the wine and then he had the share of a joint with pretty janie yeexing and by and by had the other refreshments the tiny cabin had to offer which were excellent in quality and satisfying to his soul and if he thought at all of lost dolly in the next half hour or so it was not at all with jealousy and rage but almost with compassion there was plenty of room to fool around on return trips it turned out even in a cabin no bigger than the one horatio hornblower had occupied centuries before and the wine was peggys planets best but when they had finished emptying the bottle and themselves the cabin began to seem a lot smaller and there was still an hour or more before their shifts began im hungry yeexing announced ive got some rice and stuff here but maybe it was not a time to push his luck although a homecooked meal sounded good even rice and stuff lets go to the galley said waithers and in no particular hurry they wandered hand in hand back to the working part of the ship they paused at a junction of corridors where the longgone heechee had for reasons of their own planted little clusters of shrubs and bushesnot no doubt the same ones that were still growing there yeexing paused to pick a bright blue berry look at that she said theyre all ripe and the deadbeats dont even pick them you mean the returning colonists but they pay their way oh sure she said bitterly no pay no fly but when they get back theyll go right on welfare because what else is there for them walthers sampled one of the juicy thinskinned fruits you dont like the returnees very much yeexing grinned i dont keep that a secret very well do i but the grin faded in the first place theres nothing for them to go home toif they had a decent life they wouldnt have left it in the second place things have got a lot worse since they left more terrorist trouble more international frictionwhy there are countries that are building up their armies again and in the third place theyre not only going to suffer from all that theyre part of the cause of it half the goons you see here will be in some terror group in a monthor supporting one anyway they strolled onward and walthers said humbly its true ive been away a long time but i did hear that things are getting nastybombings and shootings bombings if thats all there was theyve got a tpt now you go back to the earth system now and you never know when youre going to be right off your rocker without warning tpt whats a tpt oh my god walthers she said earnestly you have been away a long time what they used to call the craziness dont you remember its a telempathic psychokinetic transceiver one of those old heechee things there are about a dozen of them around and the terrorists have one the craziness walthers repeated scowling as a memory tried to work its way up out of his subconscious right the craziness said yeexing with gloomy satisfaction i remember when i was a kid in kanchou my father came home with his head all bloody because somebody had jumped out of the top story of the glass factory right on top of my father crazy as a bedbug and it was all the tpt walthers nodded without answering his face drawn yeexing looked at him in puzzlement then waved at the guards ahead of them thats what theyre protecting mostly she said because theres still one on the s ya too damn many of them around and they thought of protecting them a little too late because now theres a bunch of terrorists that have a heechee five and theyve got a tpt in it and somebody whos it was of course the castaway boy wan who caused the fever all he wanted was some sort of human contact because he was lonesome it was not his intention to drive most of the human race crazy with his crazy obsessive thoughts the terrorists on the other hand knew exactly what they were doing really crazy lunatic i mean when he gets on that thing and you feel him in your head its so creepy and awfulwalthers is something the matter he stopped at the entrance to the goldlit corridor the four guards looking at him with curiosity the craziness he said wan this used to be his ship well sure it was the girl said frowning listen we were going to get something to eat wed better do it she was getting worried waltherss jaw was set the muscles around his face contracted as much as anything he looked like somebody who was expecting to be punched in the face and the guards were getting curious come on audee she said pleadingly walthers stirred and looked at her you go ahead he said im not hungry any more wans ship how strange walthers thought that he had not made the connection before but of course it was so wan had been born in this very vessel long before it was renamed the s ya broadhead long before the human race even knew it existed unless you considered a few dozen remote descendants of australopithecus afarensis human wan had been born to a pregnant female gateway prospector her husband was lost on one mission herself stranded on another she hung on to life for his first few years and then left him orphaned waithers could not easily imagine what wans infancy was like tiny child in this vast almost empty vessel no company but savages and the computerstored analogs of dead space prospectors one of whom no doubt had been his mother it called for pity walthers had no pity to give not to wan who had borrowed his wife not for that matter to the same wan who had found the machine they called the tptshort for telempathic psychokinetic transceiver as the thick tongue of the bureaucracy had relabeled it wan himself had only called it a dream couch and the rest of the human race had called it the fever the terrible cloudy obsessions that had infected every human alive when silly young wan discovering a couch had found that it gave him some sort of contact with some sort of living beings he did not know that the same process gave them some sort of contact with him and so his teenaged dreams and fears and sexual fantasies invaded ten billion human brains perhaps dolly should have made the connection but she had been a small child when it happened walthers had not he remembered and it gave him a fresh reason to hate wan he could no longer remember that recurrent worldwide madness very clearly could hardly imagine how devastating its effects had been he did not even try to imagine wans idle lonely childhood here but present wan cruising around the stars on his mysterious quest his only company waltherss fugitive wifethat all of that walthers could imagine all too clearly in fact he spent nearly all of the hour available to him before his shift began in imagining it before it occurred to him that he was wallowing in selfpity and volunteered humiliation and that was really after all no way for a grown human being to behave he showed up on time yeexing there in the pilot room before him said nothing but looked faintly surprised he grinned at her in the changeover and set in to work although the actual piloting of the ship amounted to not much more than holding on to the controls and letting the vessel fly itself waithers kept himself busy his mood had changed the vastness of the vessel he had under his fingertips was a challenge he watched janie yeexing as with knees and toetips and elbows she worked the auxiliary controls that displayed course and position and ships state and all the other data that a pilot didnt really need to know to fly the beast but ought to go to the trouble of finding out if he wanted to call himself a pilot and he did the same he summoned up the course display and checked the position of the s ya tiny glowing gold dot along a thin blue line nineteen hundred lightyears long he verified that the position was right by calculating angles to the redglowing marker stars along the route he frowned at the handful of stay away markings where black holes and gas clouds posed a threatnone of them anywhere near their course it appeared and he even called up the great heechee sky chart that displayed the entire galaxy with other members of the local group hanging on its fringes several hundred very bright human beings and thousands of hours of machineintelligence time had gone into unraveling the heechee chart code there were parts that were not understood yet and walthers studied frowning the handful of points in all that area where the blinking multicolored halos that meant here there be danger were doubled and tripled what could be so dangerous that the heechee charts fairly screamed with panic there was still a lot to learn and waithers thought to himself no better place to learn it than on this ship his job was strictly temporary of course but if he did good work if he showed willingness and talent if he ingratiated himself with the captain why then he thought when they reached earth and the captain had to face the job of hiring a new seventh officer what better candidate than audee waithers when the shift was over yeexing came across the tenmeter space separating the two pilot positions and said as a pilot youre looking pretty good walthers i was a little worried about you he took her hand and they headed for the door i guess i was in a bad mood he apologized and yeexing shrugged first girl friend always catches all the crap after a divorce she observed what did you do plug in one of our headshrinker programs i didnt have to i just walthers hesitated trying to remember just what he had done i guess i just talked to myself a little the thing about having your wife walk out on you he explained is that it makes you feel ashamect i mean besides jealous and angry and all that other stuff but after i stewed around for a while it occurred to me that i hadnt done anything much to be ashamed of the feeling didnt belong to me you see and that helped she demanded well after a while it did and of course the sovereign antidote for womaninduced pain was another woman but he didnt want to say that to the antidote ill have to remember that next time i get dumped well i guess its about bedtime he shook his head its early yet and im all charged up what about that old heechee stuff you said you knew a way past the guards she stopped in the middle of the passage to study him you sure have your ups and downs audee she said but why not the s ya was doublehulled the space between the hulls was narrow and dark but it could be entered so yeexing led walthers through narrow passages close to the skin of the great spacecraft through a maze of empty colonists bunks past the crude huge kitchen that fed them into a space that smelled of stale garbage and ancient rotinto a vast illlit chamber here they are she said her voice was lowered although she had promised him they were too far from the guards to be overheard put your head close to that sort of silvery basketyou see where im pointingbut you dont touch it thats important why is it important walthers stared around at what looked like the heechee equivalent of an attic there were at least forty devices in the chamber large and small all of them firmly linked to the structure of the ship itself there were big ones and little ones spherical ones with splayed mountings joining the deck squarish ones that glowed in the blue the heechee charting and navigation systems were not easy to decipher for navigation the system looks up two points the start and finish of the trip it then looks up all intervening obstacles such as dust or gas clouds perturbing radiation gravitational fields and so on and selects points of safe passage around or between them after which it constructs a spline to fit the points and directs the vessel along it many objects and points on the charts were tagged with attention marksflickering auras check marks and so on we realized early that these were often warnings the difficulty was that we didnt know which signs were warnings or what they warned against and green colors of the metal of the woven metal shroud janie yeexing was indicating there were three all exactly alike its important because i dont want my ass kicked off this ship audee so pay attention i am paying attention why are there three of them why did the heechee do anything maybe all these things were spares now heres the part you have to listen to put your head close to the metal part but not too close as soon as you start feeling things that dont come out of you thats close enough youll know when but dont get any closer and above all dont touch because this is a twoway thing as long as youre just satisfied with sort of general feelings nobody will notice probably but if they do notice the captain will have us both walking the plank you understand of course i understand walthers said a little annoyed and moved his head within a dozen centimeters of the silvery mesh he twisted around to look at yeexing nothing he said try a little closer it was not very easy to move your head a centimeter at a time when it was bent at a strange angle and you didnt have anything to hold on to but waithers tried to do as instructed thats it yeexing cried watching his face no closer now he didnt answer his mind was filled with the barest suspicion of sensationsa confused mumble of sensations there were dreams and daydreams and someones desperate shortness of breath there was someones laughter and someone or actually what seemed to be three couples of someones engaged in sexual activity he twisted to grin at janie started to speak and then suddenly there was something else there walthers froze from yeexings description he had expected a sort of sense of company the presence of other people their fears and joys and hungers and pleasuresbut the they was always human this new thing was not waithers moved convulsively his head touched the mesh all the sensations became a thousandfold clearer like the focusing of a lens and he felt the new and distant presenceor presencesin a different and immediate way it was a distant slippery chilling sensation and it did not emanate from anything human if the sources had depressions or fantasies walthers could not comprehend them all he could feel was that they were there they existed they did not responct they did not change if you could get inside the mind of a corpse he thought in panic and revulsion this was how it might feel all this in a moment and then he was aware that yeexing was tugging at his arm shouting in his ear oh damn you walthers i felt that so did the captain and everybody on this goddamned ship now were in trouble as soon as his head came away from the silvery mesh the sensation was gone the gleaming walls and shadowy machines were real again with janie yeexings furious face thrust into his in trouble walthers found himself laughing after the chill slow hell he had just glimpsed nothing human could seem like trouble even when the fourpower guard came boiling in weapons drawn shouting at them in four languages walthers almost welcomed them for they were human and alive the question that was digging at his mind was the one that anybody would have asked himself had he tuned in somehow on the cryptic hidden heechee if so he told himself shuddering heaven help the human race a day in a tycoons life dreading the heechee was a popular sport in more places than the ј ya i even did a fair amount of it myself everybody did we did it a lot when i was a kid though then the heechee were nothing more than strange vanished creatures that had amused themselves digging tunnels on the planet venus hundreds of thousands of years before we did it when i was a gateway prospectoroh yes my god how we did it then trusting ourselves to old heechee ships and scooting around the universe to places no human had ever seen and always wondering if the owners of the ships would turn up at the end of a tripand what they would do about it and we brooded about them even more when we untangled enough of their old sky atlases to discover where they had gone to hide deep in the core of our own galaxy it did not occur to us then to wonder what they were hiding from that certainly was not all i did to be sure i had plenty of other things to fill my days there was my steadfast preoccupation with my crotchety health which forced itself upon my attention whenever it wanted to and wanted to more often all the time but that was only the beginning i was about as busy with about as many myriad diverse things as it was possible for a human being to be if you looked at any average day in the life of robin broadhead aging tycoon visiting him at his luxurious country home looking over the broad tappan sea just north of new york city you would find him doing such things as strolling along the riverfront with his lovely wife essie venturing culinary experiments in the cuisines of malaya iceland and ghana in his lavishly equipped kitchen chatting with his wise dataretrieval system albert einstein hitting his mail to that youth center in grenada lets see yeah here is the check for three hundred thousand dollars as promised but please dont name the center after me name it after my wife if you want to and we will both certainly try to get down there for the opening to pedro lammartine secretary general united nations dear pete im working on the americans to share data with the brazilians on finding that terrorist ship but somebody has to get after the brazilians wifi you use your influence please its in everybodys interest if the terrorists are not stopped god knows where well all wind up to ray mclean wherever hes living now dear ray by all means use our docking facilities in the search for your wife i wish you all the luck from the heart etc etc to gorman and ketchin general contractors dear sirs i wont accept your new completion date of october st for my ship its completely unreasonable youve had one extension already and thats all you get i remind you of the heavy penalty charges in the contract if there is any further delay to the president of the united states dear ben if the terrorist ship is not located and neutralized at once the peace of the whole earth is threatened not to mention property damage loss of lives and everything else thats at risk it is an open secret that the br zili ns have developed a directionfinder for signals from a ship in ftl flight and that our own military people have a procedure for ftl navigating that will let them approach it cant they get together as commrnider in chief all you have to do is order the high pentagon to cooperate theres lots of pressure on the brazilians to do their share but theyre waiting for a sign from us to whatshisname luqman dear luqman thanks for the good news i think we should move to develop that oil field immediately so when you come to see me bring along your plan for production and shipment with cost estimates and a cashflow capital plan every time the s yci comes back empty were losing money and on and oni kept busy had a lot to keep busy with and thats not even counting keeping track of my investments and riding herd on my managers not that i spent a lot of time on business i always say that after hes made his first hundred million or so anybody who does anything just for the money is insane you need money because if you dont have money you dont have freedom to do the things that are worth doing but after you have that freedom whats the use of more money so i left most of the business to my financial programs and the people i hiredexcept for the ones that i was in not so much for the money as because they were doing something i wanted done and yet if the name heechee does not appear anywhere in the list of my daily concerns it was always there it all came back to the heechee in the long run my ship abuilding out in the construction orbits was humandesigned and humanbuilt but most of the construction and all of the drive and communications systems were adapted from heechee designs the s ya which i was planning to ifil with oil on the nearly empty return trips from peggys planet was a heechee artifact for that matter peggys was a gift from the heechee since they had provided the navigation to find it and the ships to get there in essies fastfood chain came from the heechee machines to manufacture chonfood out of the carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen in the frozen gases of comets wed built some of the food factories on earththere was one right now off the shore of sri lanka getting its nitrogen and oxygen from the air its hydrogen from water out of the indian ocean and its carbon from whatever unfortunate plants animals or carbonates slipped through its intake valves and now that the gateway corporation had so much money to invest that it didnt know what to do with it all it was able to invest some wiselyin chartering systematic exploration tripsand as a big shareholder in gateway i encouraged them to keep on doing that even the terrorists were using a stolen heechee ship and a stolen heechee telempathic psychokinetic transceiver to inflict their worst wounds on the worldall heechee it was no wonder that there were fringe religious cults all over the earth worshipping the heechee for they surely met all the objective tests of divinity they were capricious powerfuland invisible there were times when i myself felt very nearly tempted in those long nights when my gut was hurting and things didnt seem to be going right to sneak a little prayer to our father who wert in the core it couldnt hurt anything could it well yes it could it could hurt my selfrespect and for all of us human beings in this tantalizing abundant galaxy the heechee had given usbut only a dab at a timeselfrespect was getting harder and harder to keep of course i had not then actually met a real live heechee i had not yet met any but one who was going to be a big part of my later life namely captam was halfway to the breakout point where normal space began and meanwhile on the ј ya audee walthers was getting his ass royally reamed and beginning to think that he should not plan for much of a future working on that ship and meanwhile well as always there were a lot of meanwhiles but the one that would have interested audee the most was that meanwhile his errant wife was beginning to wish she hadnt erred out where the black holes spin eloping with a lunatic was not on balance very much better than being bored out of her mind in port hegramet it was different oh heavens yes it was different but parts of it were equally boring and parts of it simply scared her to death since the ship was a five there was room for the two of themor should have been since wan was young and rich and almost in a way handsomeif you looked at him the right way the trip should have been lively enough neither of those was true and besides there were the scary parts if there was one thing every human being knew about space it was that black holes were meant to be stayed away from not by wan he sought them out and then he did worse than that what the gidgets and gadgets were that wan played with dolly did not know when she asked he wouldnt answer when wheedling she put one of her puppets on her hand and asked through its mouth he scowled and frowned and said if you are going to do your act do something funny and dirty not ask questions that are none of your business when she tried to find out why they were none of her business she was more successful she didnt get a straight answer but from the bluster and confusion with which wan responded it was easy to figure out they were stolen and they had something to do with black holes and although dolly was almost positive that she had heard once that there was no way in or out of a black hole she was also almost positive that what wan was trying to do was to find some certain black hole and then to go into it that was the scary part and when she wasnt scared half out of her young mind she was bonecrackingly lonesome for captain juan henriquette santosschmitz the dashing and eccentric young multimillionaire whose exploits still titillated the readers of gossip services was rotten company after three weeks in his presence dolly could hardly stand the sight of him although she admitted to herself trembling that the sight of him was a lot less worrisome than the sight she was actually looking at what dolly was looking at was a black hole or not really at the hole itself for you could look at that all day and not see anything black holes were black because they could not be seen at all she was actually seeing a spiraling aurora of bluish violetish light unpleasant for the eyes even through the viewing plate over the control panel it would have been far more unpleasant to be exposed to that light was only the iceberg tip of a flood of lethal radiation their ship was armored against such things and so far the armor had easily held but wan was not within the armor he was down in the lander where he had tools and technologies that she did not understand and that he refused to explain and she knew that at some time in some such situation she would be sitting in the main ship and would feel the little lurch that meant the lander had disengaged and then he would be venturing even closer to one of these terrible objects and what would happen to him then or to her not that she would go with him certainly but if he died and left her alone a hundred lightyears from anything she knewwhat then she heard an angry mumble and knew that at least that time was not now the hatch opened and wan crawled out of the lander wrathful another empty one he snarled at her as though he were holding her accountable for it and of course he was she tried to look sympathetic rather than scared aw honey what a pity that makes three of them three huh three with you along you mean more than that in all indeed his tone was scornful but she didnt mind the scorn it was drowned in the relief when he slipped past her dolly moved inconspicuously as far away from the control board as she couldnot far in a heechee ship that would have fit readily into a goodsized living room as he sat down and consulted his electronic oracles she kept silent when wan talked to his dead men he did not invite dolly to take part if he conducted his end of the conversation in words she could at least hear that half of it if he tapped out instructions on his keyboard she did not have even that much but this time she could figure it out easily enough he punched out his questions scowled at what one of the dead men said in his earphones punched out a correction and then set up a course on the heechee board then he took the headphones off scowled stretched and turned to dolly all right he said come you can pay another installment on your passage why sure honey she said obligingly though it would have been so very much nicer if he didnt always have to put it like that but her spirits were a little higher she felt the tiny suggestion of a lurch that meant that the spacecraft was starting off on another trip and indeed the great blue and violet horror on the screen was already dwindling away that made up for a lot of course it only meant they were on their way to the next one do the heechee comm inded wan and let me see yes with robinette broadhead sure wan said dolly retrieving her puppets from where wan had kicked them and slipping them over her hands the heechee did not of course look like a real heechee and as a matter of fact the robinette broadhead was pretty libelous too but they amused wan that was what mattered to dolly since he was paying the bills the first day out of port hegramet he had boastfully shown dolly his bankbook six million dollars automatically socked into it every month the numbers staggered dolly they made up for a lot out of all that cataract of cash there had to be a way sooner or later of squeezing a few drops for herself to dolly there was nothing immoral in such thoughts perhaps in an earlier day americans would have called her a golddigger but most of the human race through most of its history would only have called her poor so she fed him and bedded him when he was in a bad mood she tried to look invisible and when he wanted entertainment she tried to entertain halo thar mr heechee said the broadhead hand dollys fingers twisting to give it a simpering grin dollys voice thick and cornponebumpkin im moughty pleased to make your acquaintance the heechee hand dollys voice a serpentine whine greetings rash earthman you are just in time for dinner aw gosh cried the broadhead hand grin widening im hungry too whats fer dinner aargh shrieked the heechee hand fingers a claw mouth open you are and the righthand fingers closed on the lefthand puppet ho ho ho laughed wan that is very good though that is not what a heechee looks like you do not know what a heechee is do you asked dolly in her own voice nearly more nearly than you and dolly grinning raised the heechee hand oh but youre wrong mr wan came the silky snaky heechee voice this is what i look like and im waiting to meet you in the next black hole crash went the chair wan was sitting on as he sprang up that is not funny he shouted and dolly was astonished to see he was trembling make me food he demanded and stomped off to his private lander muttering it was not wise to joke with him so dolly made him his dinner and served him with a smile she did not feel she gained nothing from the smile his mood was fouler than ever he screeched stupid woman have you eaten all the good food when i was not looking is there nothing left fit to be eaten dolly was near tears but you like steak she protested steak of course i like steak but look at what you serve for dessert he pushed the steak and broccoli out of the way to seize the plate of chocolatechip cookies and shake it under her nose cookies sailed away in all directions and dolly tried to retrieve them i know its not what youd like honey but there isnt any more ice cream he glared at her huh no more ice cream oh very well then a chocolate souflleor a flan wan theyre almost all gone too you ate them stupid woman that is not possible well theyre gone anyway all that sweet stuff isnt good for you you have not been appointed my nurse if i rot my teeth i will buy new ones he struck at the dish in her hand and the cookies went flying indeed jettison this trash i do not wish to eat at all now he snapped it was just another typical meal on the frontiers of the galaxy it finished typically too with dolly clearing away the mess and weeping he was such a terrible person and he didnt even seem to know it but as a matter of fact wan did know that he was mean antisocial exploitivea whole long list of things that had been explained to him by the psychoanalysis programs more than three hundred sessions of them six days a week for almost a year and at the end he had terminated the analysis with a joke i have a question he told the holographic analyst displayed for him as a goodlooking woman old enough to be his mother young enough to be attractive and the question is this how many psychoanalysts does it take to change a light bulb the analyst said sighing oh wan youre resisting again all right how many only one he told her laughing but the light bulb has to really want to change hawhaw and you see i dont she looked directly at him for a silent moment the way she was displayed she was sitting on a sort of beanbag chair with her legs tucked under her a note pad in her hand a pencil in the other she used it to push up the glasses that were sliding down her nose as she looked at him as with everything else in her programing the gesture was meant to have a purpose the reassuring indication that she was after all only another human being like himself not an austere goddess of course human she was not but she sounded human enough as she said thats really a very old joke wan whats a light bulb he shrugged irritably it is a round thing that gives off light he guessed but you are missing the point i do not wish to be changed anymore it is not fun for me it was not my desire to begin this in the first place and now i have decided to end it the computer program said peacefully thats your right of course wan what will you do i will go looking for myi will go out of here and enjoy myself he said savagely that is also one of my rights yes it is she agreed wan would you like to tell me what it was you started to say before you changed your mind no he said getting up i would not like to tell you what it is i will do instead i wifi do it goodbye youre going to look for your father arent you the psychoanalytic program called after him but he didnt answer the only indication he gave that he heard was that instead of merely closing the door he slimmed it a normal human beingin fact almost any human being at all really would have told his analyst that she was right would have at some time in three long weeks have told his ship companion and bed companion the same thing if only to have someone to share in his outsidechance hope and his very real fear wan had never learned to share his feelings because he had never learned to share anything at all brought up in heechee heaven without any sort of warmblooded human companion for the most crucial decade of his childhood he had become the archetype of a sociopath that terrible yearning for love was what drove him to seek his lost father through all the terrors of space its total lack of fulfillment made it impossible for him to accept love or sharing now his closest companions for those terrified ten years had been the computer programs of stored dead intelligences called the dead men he had copied them and taken them with him when he took a heechee starship and he talked to them as he would not to fleshandblood dolly because he knew they were only machines they didnt mind being treated that way to wan fleshandblood human beings were also machinesvending machines you might call them he had the coin to make them yield what he wanted sex or conversation or the preparation of his food or cleaning up after his piggish habits it did not occur to him to consider a vending machines feelings not even when the vending machine was actually a nineteenyearold female human being who would have been grateful for the chance of being allowed to think she loved him the heechee early discovered how to store the intelligence and even an approximation of the personality of a dead or dying person in mechanical systemsas human beings learned when they first encountered the socalled heechee heaven where the boy wan grew up robin considered that a tremendously valuable invention i dont se it that way of course i may be considered prejudiced in the mattera person like me being mechanical storage in the first place doesnt need it and the heechee having discovered that did not bother to invent persons like me homecoming in the lofstrom loop in lagos nigeria audee walthers debated the measure of his responsibility toward janie yeexing as the magnetic ribbon caught their descending pod and slowed it and dropped it off at the customs and immigration terminal for playing with the forbidden toys he had lost the hope of a job but for helping him do it yeexing had lost a whole career i have an idea he whispered to her as they lined up in the anteroom ill tell you about it outside he did indeed have an idea and it was a pretty good one at that the idea was me before waithers could tell her about his idea he had to tell her about what he had felt in that terrifying moment at the tpt so they checked into a transit lodge near the base of the landing loop a bare room and a hot one there was one mediumsized bed a washstand in the corner a pv set to stare at while the traveler waited for his launch capsule windows that opened on the hot muggy african coastal air the windows were open though the screens were tight against the myriad african bugs but walthers hugged himself against the chill as he told her about that cold slow being whose mind he had felt on the ј ya and janie yeexing shivered too but you never said anything audee she said her voice a little shrill because her throat was tight he shook his head no but why didnt you isnt there she paused yes im sure theres a gateway bonus you could get for that we could get janie he said strongly and she looked at him then accepted the partnership with a nod there sure is and its a million dollars i checked it out on the ships standing orders same time i copied the ships log and he reached into his scanty luggage and pulled out a datafan to show her she didnt take it from him she just said why well figure it out he said a million dollars theres two of us so cut it in half theni got it on the s ya with the s ya s equipment so the ship and its owners and the whole damn crew might get a share wed be lucky if it was only half more likely threequarters thenwell we broke the rules you know maybe theyd overlook that considering everything but maybe they wouldnt and wed get nothing at all yeexing nodded taking it in there was a lot to take in she reached out and touched the datafan you copied the ships log no problem he said and indeed it hadnt been during one of his tours at the controls frosty silence from the first officer at the other seat walthers had simply called up the data for the moment he had made contact from the automatic ifight recorder recorded the information as though it was part of his normal duty and pocketed the copy all right she said now what so he told her about this known eccentric zillionaire notorious for his willingness to spend largely for heechee data and as walthers knew him personally she looked at him with a different kind of interest you know robinette broadhead he owes me a favor he said simply all i have to do is find him for the first time since they had entered the little room yeexing smiled she gestured toward the pphone on the wall go to it tiger so walthers invested some of his not very impressive remaining bankroll in longdistance calls while yeexing gazed thoughtfully out at the bright tracery of lights around the lofstrom loop like a kilometerslong rollercoaster its magnetic cables singing and the capsules landing on it choofing while the ones taking off were chuffing as they respectively gave up and took on escape velocity she wasnt thinking about their customer she was thinking about the goods they had to sell and when walthers hung up the phone his face dour she hardly listened to what he had to say which was the bastards not home he said i guess i got the butler at tappan sea all hed tell me was that mr broadhead was on his way to rotterdam rotterdam for gods sake but i checked it out we can get a cheap flight to paris and then a slowjet the rest of the wayweve got enough money for that i want to see the log said yeexing the log he repeated you heard me she said impatiently itll play on the pv and i want to see he licked his lips thought for a moment shrugged and slipped it into the pv scanner because the ships instruments were holographic recording every photon of energy that struck them all that data concerning the source of the chill emanations was on the fan but the pv showed only a tiny and featureless white blob along with the location coordinates it was not very interesting to look at in itselfwhich was no doubt why the ships sensors themselves had paid no attention to it high magnification would perhaps show details but that was beyond the capacities of the cheap hotel room set but even so as walthers looked at it he felt a crawling sensation from the bed yeexing whispered you never said audee are they heechee he didnt take his eyes off the still white blur i wish i knew but it was not likely was it unless the heechee were far unlike anything anyone had suspected heechee were intelligent had to be they had conquered interstellar space half a million years ago and the minds that walthers had perceived werewerewhat would you call it petrified maybe present but not active turn it off said yeexing it gives me the creeps she swatted one of the bugs that had penetrated the screen and added gloomily i hate this place well well be off to rotterdam in the morning not this place i hate being on the earth she said she waved at the sky past the lights of the landing loop you know whats up there theres the high pentagon and orbittyuratam and about a million zappers and nukes floating around and theyre all crazy here audee you never know when the damn things are going to go off whether she intended a rebuke or not was unclear but walthers felt it anyway he pulled the fan out of the pv scanner resentfully it wasnt his fault that the world was crazy but it was his fault no doubt of that that yeexing was condemned to be on it so she had every right to reproach him he started to hand her the datafan his motives not certain perhaps to demonstrate trust perhaps to reinforce her status as his accomplice but in midreach he discovered just how crazy the world was the gesture converted itself into a blow aimed wickedly at her unsmiling desolate face for the half of a breath it was not janie there it was dolly faithless runaway dolly with the grinning contemptuous shadow of wan behind heror neither of them in fact not a person at all but a symbol a target an evil and threatening thing that had no identity but only a description it was the enemy and the most certainly sure thing about it was that it needed to be destroyed violently by him for otherwise walthers himself would be destroyed wrecked disintegrated by the maddest most hating most pervertedly destructive emotions he had ever felt forced into his mind in an act of sickening violent devastating rape what audee walthers felt at that moment i knew very well because i felt it tooas did janieas did my own wife essieas did every human being within a dozen au of a point a couple of hundred million kilometers from the earth in the direction of the constellation auriga it was most lucky for me that i was not indulging my habit of piloting myself i dont know if i would have crashed the touch from space only lasted half a minute and i might not have had time to kill myself but i surely would have tried rage sick hatred an obsessive need to wreck and ravishthat was the gift from the sky that the terrorists offered us all but for once i had the computer doing the piloting so that i could spend my time on the pphone and computer programs were not infected by the terrorists pt it wasnt the first time not even the first time lately for in the previous eighteen months the terrorists had dodged into solar space in their stolen heechee ship and broadcast their pet lunatics most horrid fantasies to the world it was more than the world could stand it was in fact why i was on my way to rotterdam but this particular episode was the reason i turned around in midflight on the way there i tried at once to call essie as soon as it was over to make sure she was all right no luck everybody in the world was trying to call everybody else for the same reasons and the relay points were jammed there was also the fact that my gut felt as though armadillos were engaging in sexual intercourse in it and everything considered i wanted essie with me instead of taking a later commercial flight as planned so i ordered the pilot to reverse course and so when walthers got to rotterdam i wasnt there he could easily have caught me at tappan sea if he had taken a straightthrough new york flight and so he was wrong about that he was also wrongquite wrongforgivably wrong for he had no way of knowingabout just what sort of mind he had tuned in on on the јya and he had made one other error quite serious he had forgotten that the tpt worked both ways so the secret he had kept at one end of that fleeting mindtouch was no secret at all at the other i regret or almost regret that i know nothing about this instant madness from firsthand experience i regretted it most when it first happened a decade earlier no one knew anything about a telempathic psychokinetic transceiver at that time what it looked like and was was periodic worldwide epidemics of insanity a lot of the worlds best minds including mine had spent their best efforts trying to find a virus a toxic chemical a variation in the suns radiationanythinganything that would account for the shared madness that swept the human race every year or so however some of the worlds best minds like minewere handicapped computer programs like myself simply did not feel the maddening impulses if we had i daresay the problem would have been solved much earlier the nervous crew of the sailboat a lavender squidwell not really a squid but looking about as squidlike as anything else in human experiencewas in the middle of an exhausting longterm project when audee walthers had his little accident with the tpt because the tpt goes in both directions it makes a great weapon but a lousy surveillance tool it is sort of like calling up the person youre spying on and saying hey look ive got my eye on you so when walthers bumped his head the sting was felt elsewhere a where that was in fact very else it was nearly a thousand lightyears from the earth not far from the geodesic ffightline from peggys planet home which was of course the reason walthers was close enough for the touch to register happens i know quite a lot about this particular lavender squidor my friend robin has several faults and one of them is a kind of cutesy coyness that is not as amusing as he thinks it is the way he knew about the sailship folk like the way he knew about most of the other things he was not present to see is simply explained he just doesnt want to explain it the explanation is that i told him that simplifies things a lot but its almost true is it possible that cutesy coyness is contagious almost squid you could have said that he looked like a wriggly fat orchid and been almost as close i hadnt met him at the time of course but now i know him well enough to know his name and where he came from and why he was there and most complicated of all what he was doing the best way to think of what he was doing was to say that he was painting a landscape the reason that is complicated is that there was no one to see it for lightyears in every direction least of all my squid friend he did not have the proper kind of eyes to perceive it with still he had his reasons it was a sort of religious observance it went back to the oldest traditions of his race which was old indeed and it had to do with that theologically crucial moment in their history when they living among the clathrates and frozen gases of their home environment with visibility minute in any direction for the first time became aware that seeing could become the receiving end of a significant art form it mattered very much to him that the painting should be perfect and so when he suddenly felt himself being observed by a stranger and the startling shock caused him to spray some of the finely divided powders he painted with in the wrong place and in the wrong mixture of colors he was deeply upset now a whole quarter hectare was spoiled an earthly priest would have understood his feelings if not his reasons for them it was quite as though in the observance of a mass the host had been dropped and crushed underfoot the creatures name was ladzhari the canvas he was working on was an elliptical sail of monomolecular film nearly thirty thousand kilometers long the work was less than a quarter completed and it had taken him fifteen years to get that far ladzhari did not care how long it took he had plenty of time his spacecraft would not arrive at its destination for another eight hundred years or at least he thought he had plenty of time until he felt the stranger staring at him then he felt the need to hurry he stayed in normal eigenmode while he swiftly collected his painting materialsby then it was august lashed them secureaugust pushed himself away from the butterflywing sail and floated free until he was well clear by the first of september he was far enough away to switch on his jet thrust and in high eigenmode return to the little cylindrical tin can that rode at the center of the cluster of butterfly wings although it was a terribly expensive drain on him he remained in high mode as he plunged through the entering caves and into the salty slush that was his home environment he was shouting to his companions at the top of his voice by human standards that voice was extraordinarily loud terrestrial great whales have such loud voices that their songs can be recognized and responded to by other whales an ocean away so had ladzharis people and in the tiny confines of the spacecraft his roaring shook the walls instruments quivered furniture rocked the females fled in panic fearing that they were about to be eaten or impregnated it was almost as bad for the seven other males and as fast as he could one of them struggled up to high eigenmode to shout back at ladzbari they knew what had happened they too had felt the touch of the interloper and of course they had done what was necessary the whole crew had switched into high transmitted the signal they owed their ancestors and returned to normal mode and would ladzhari please do the same at once and stop frightening the females so ladzhari slowed himself down and allowed himself to catch his breathalthough that was not an expression in use among his people it did not do to thrash around in the slush in high for very long he had already caused several troublesome cavitation pockets and the whole slurpy environment they lived in was troubled apologetically he worked with the others until everything was lashed firm again and the females had been coaxed out of their hiding places one of them serving for dinner and the whole crew settled down to discuss the lunatic touch madly rapid and quite terrifying that had invaded all their minds that took all of september and the first part of october by then the ship had settled back into some sort of normal existence and ladzhari returned to his painting he neutralized the charges on the spoiled section of the great photontrap wing he laboriously collected the pigmented dust that had floated away for one could not waste so much mass he was a thrifty soul was ladzhari i have to admit that i found him rather admirable he was loyal to the traditions of his people under circumstances that human beings might have thought a little too menacing to be tolerated for although ladzhari was not a heechee he knew where the heechee could be reached and he knew that sooner or later the message his shipmates had sent would have an answer so then just as he was beginning to repaint the blankedout section of his work he felt another touch and this time an expected one closer stronger far more insistent and much much more frightening audee and me all the fragments of life stories of these friendsor almost friends or in some cases nonfriendsof mine were beginning to fall together not very rapidly not much faster in fact than the fragments of the universe were beginning to fall together in that great crunch back toward the cyclic primordialatom state that was about to happen for reasons i never quite understood at the time there were the sailship people uneasily accepting the consequences of doing their duty there were dolly and wan on their way to yet one more black hole dolly sobbing in her sleep wan scowling furiously in his and there were audee waithers and janie sitting disconsolate in their very much too expensive rotterdam hotel room because they had just found out i wasnt there yet janie squatted on the huge anisokinetic bed while audee harangued my secretary janie had a bruise on her cheek souvenir of that moments madness in lagos but audee had his arm in a castsprained wrist he had not known until that moment that janie was a black belt in karate wincing walthers broke the connection and rested his wrist in his lap she says hell be here tomorrow he grumbled i wonder if shell give him the message of course she wifi she wasnt human you know really you mean she was a computer program that had not occurred to him for such things were not common on peggys planet anyway he said taking consolation i guess in that case at least she wont forget he poured them each a short drink out of the bottle of belgian apple brandy they had picked up on the way to the hotel he set down the bottle wincing as he rubbed his right wrist and took a sip before saying janie how much money have we got left she leaned forward and tapped out their code on the pv about enough for four more nights in this hotel she reported of course we could move to a cheaper one he shook his head this is where broadheads going to stay and i want to be here thats a good reason yeexing commented blandly meaning that she understood his real reason if broadhead wasnt anxious to see walthers it would be harder to duck him in person than on the pphone so why did you ask about the money lets spend one nights rent on some information he proposed id kind of like to know just how rich broadhead is you mean buy a financial report are you trying to find out if he can afford to pay us a million dollars waithers shook his head what i want to find out he said is how much more than a million we can take him for now those were no charitable sentiments and if i had known about them at the right time i would have been a lot hardernosed with audee walthers my old friend or maybe not when youve got a lot of money you get used to people seeing you as a tappable resource instead of a human being even though you never get to like it still i had no objection to his finding out what i owned or anyway as much about what i owned as i had allowed the financialreport services to know there was plenty there a sizable interest in the charter operation of the ј ya some foodmine and fishfarm shares a great many since robin keeps talking about the missing mass question i should explain what it is in the latter twentieth century cosmologists had an insoluble contradiction to face they could see that the universe was expanding and this was certainly so because of the red shift they could also see however that it contained too much mass for the expansion to be possible that was proved by such facts as that the outer fringes of galaxies revolved too fast clusters of galaxies held each other too tightly even our own galaxy with its companions was plunging toward a group of starclouds in virgo much faster than it should have been obviously much mass was missing from observations where was it there was one intuitively obvious explanation namely that the universe had formerly been expanding but something had decided to reverse its growth and cause it to contract no one believed that for a minutein the late twentieth century enterprises back on peggys planet including the company he leased his plane from the very computerdata service that was selling them the information several holding companies and importexport or freightforwarding firms two banks fourteen realestate agencies based everywhere from new york to new south wales with a couple on venus and peggys planet and any number of unrecognizable little corporations including an airline a fastfood chain something called here after incand something called pegtex petroventures my god said audee waithers thats mr luqmans company so i was working for the son of a bitch all along and i said janie yeexing looking at the part that mentioned the s ya really does broadhead own everything well i did not i owned a lot but if they had looked at my holdings more sympathetically they might have been able to see a pattern the banks loaned money for explorations the realestate companies helped settle colonists or took over their shacks and hogans for cash so they could leave the ј ya ferried colonists to peggys and as for luqman why that was the crowning jewel in the empire if they had only known it not that i had ever met luqman or would have known what he looked like if i saw him but he had his orders and the orders came down the chain of command from me find a good oil field somewhere near the equator of peggys planet why the equator so the lofstrom loop we would build there could take advantage of the planets rotational velocity why a launch loop it was the cheapest and best way of getting things in and out of orbit the oil we pumped would power up the ioop the excess crude oil would go onto the loop and into orbit in shipping capsules the capsules would go back to earth on the ј ya s return flights to be sold therewhich meant there would be a profitable cargo of oil to carry on the half of each round trip that was now nearly dead loss which meant that we could cut the prices for colonists on the way out i do not apologize for the fact that almost all of my ventures showed a profit every year thats how i kept them all going and expanding but the profit was only incidental see i have a philosophy about earning money and that is that anybody who knocks himself out to accumulate it after the first hundred million or so is sick and oh but ive said all that already havent i im afraid i wander what with all the things going on in my mind i get a little confused about what has happened and what hasnt happened yet and what never happens at all except in that mind robin takes a lot of pride in the launch loop because it reassured him that human beings could invent things the heechee had not well hes rightat least if you dont look at the details the loop was invented on earth by a man named keith lofstrom in the late twentieth century though nobody built one until there was enough traffic to justify it what robin didnt know was that although the heechee never invented the loop the sailship people didthey had no other way to get out of their dense opaque atmosphere the point im making is that all my moneymaking ventures were also solidly useful projects that contributed to both the conquest of the galaxy and the alleviation of the needs of human beings and thats a fact and thats why all these fragments of biography do ultimately fall together they dont look as though theyre going to but they do all of them even the stories of my seinifriend captain the heechee whom i ultimately came to know quite well and of his lover and second in cornmand the female heechee named twice whom as you will discover i did at the end come to know quite a lot better than that the place where the heechee dwelt when the heechee hid inside their schwarzschild shell at the core of the galaxy they knew there could be no easy communication between their scared selves and the immense universe outside yet they dared not be without news so they set up a web of starlets outside the black hole itself they were far enough away so that the roaring radiation of infall into the hole did not swamp their circuitry and there were enough of them so that if one were to fail or be destroyedeven if a hundred werethe ones that were left would be able to receive and record the data from their earlywarning spy stations all around the galaxy the heechee had run away to hide but they had left eyes and ears behind so from time to time some brave souls sneaked out of the core to find out what the eyes had seen and the ears had heard when captain and his crew were sent out to check space for the errant star checking the monitors was an added duty there were five of them aboard his ship five living ones anyway by all odds the one that interested captain the most was the slim sallow shinyskinned female named twice by captains standards she was a raving beauty and sexy tooevery year without failand the time he judged was getting near again but not he prayed just yet and so prayed twice for getting through the schwarzschild perimeter was a brute of a job even when the ship had been purposebuilt to manage it there were other can openers aroundwan had stolen onebut those managed the job only in limited ways wans ship could not enter the event horizon and survive it could only extend a part of itself there captains ship was bigger and stronger even so the shaking tossing racking strains of passing through the event horizon threw captain and twice and the other four members of the crew violently and hurtingly against their retaining harnesses the diamondbright corkscrew coruscated with great fat silent sparks of radiance showering all around the cabin the light hurt their eyes the violent motion bruised their bodies and it went on and on for an hour or more by the crews own subjective time which was a queer shifting blend of the normal pace of the universe at large and the sloweddown tempo inside the black hole but at last they were through into the unstressed space the terrible lurching stopped the blinding lights faded the galaxy glowed before them a velvet dome of cream splattered with bright bold stars for they were too far inside the center to see more than the occasional patch of blackness massed minds be thanked said captain grinning as he crawled out of his harnesshe looked like a med school skull when he grinnedi think weve made it and the crew followed his example unstrapping themselves chattering cheerfully back and forth as they rose to begin the datacollection process captains bony hand reached out to hold twices it was an occasion for rejoicingas the captains of nantucket whalers rejoiced when they passed cape horn as the coveredwagon pioneers began to breathe again as they came down the slopes into the promised land of oregon or california the violence and peril were not over they would have to go through it all again on the way back inside but now for at least a week or more they could relax and collect data and this was the pleasure part of the expedition or it should have been it should have been but was not for as captain secured the ship and the officer named shoe opened the communication channels every sensor on the board flared violet the thousand automatic orbiting stations were reporting big news important newsbad news and all the datastores clamored to announce their evil tidings at once there was a shocked silence among the heechee then their training overcame their astonished terror and the cabin of the heechee ship became a whirlwind of activity receive and collate analyze and compare the messages mounted the picture took shape the last recordtapping expedition had been only a few weeks before by the slow creep of time inside the great central black holedecades or so as time was measured in the galloping universe outside but even so not much time not in the scale of stars and yet the whole world was different qwhat is worse than a prediction that doesnt come true aa prediction that comes true sooner than you expect it had been the heechee conviction that intelligent and technological life would arise in the galaxy they had identified more than a dozen inhabited worldsand not merely inhabited but bearing the promise of inteffigence they had made a plan for each of them some of the plans had failed there was a species of furry quadrupeds on a damp cool planet so near the orion nebula that its aurora filled the sky small quick creatures with paws as nimble as a raccoons and lemur eyes they would discover tools one day the heechee thought and fire and farming and cities and technology and space travel and so they had and used them all to poison their planet and decimate their race there was another race sixlimbed segmented ammoniabreathers very promising sadly too near a star that went supernova end of the ammoniabreathers there were the chill slow sludgy creatures who occupied a special place in heechee history they had carried the terrible news that drove the heechee into hiding and that was enough to make them unique more they were not merely promising but actually intelligent already not merely intelligent but civilized technology was already within their grasp but they were a longshot entry in the galactic sweepstakes anyway for their sludgy metabolism was simply too slow to compete with warmer quicker races but one race someday would reach into space and survive or so the heechee hoped and so the heechee feared too for they knew even as they planned their retreat that a race that could catch up with them could also surpass them but how could that possibility loom near so quickly it had been only sixty terrestrial years since the last checkup then the distant monitors orbiting the planet venus had shown the sapiens bipeds there digging out the abandoned heechee tunnels exploring their little solar system in spacecraft that moved on jets of chemical flame pitiably crude of course but promising in a century or two four or five centuries at most the heechee thoughtthey would likely enough find the gateway asteroid and in a century or two after that they might begin to understand the technology but events had moved so swiftly the human beings had found the gateway ships the food factorythe immense distant habitat the heechee had used to pen specimens of earths then most promising race the australopithecines all had fallen to the humans and that was not the end of it captains crew was well trained when the data had been accepted and filtered through the massed minds and tabulated and summarized the specialists prepared their reports whitenoise was the navigator it was his responsibility to take position fixes on all reported sources and update the ship locator file shoe was the communications officer busiest of allexcept perhaps for mongrel the integrator who flew from board to board whispering to the massed minds and suggesting crosschecks and correlations neither burst the blackholepiercer specialist nor twice herself whose skill was in remote handling of slaved equipment were needed for their specialties at this time so they backed up the others as did captain the ribbed muscles of his face twisting like serpents as he waited for the consolidated reports mongrel was fond of her captain too and so she gave him the least threatening ones first first there was the fact that gateway ships had been found and used well there was nothing wrong with that it was part of the plan although it was disconcerting to have it happen so soon second there was the fact that the food factory had been found and the artifact humans called heechee heaven these were old messages now decades old also not serious also disconcertingquite disconcerting because heechee heaven had been designed to trap any ships that docked there and for twoway contact to have been established meant a quite unexpected sophistication among these upstart bipeds lhird there was a message from the sailship people and that made the tendons in captains face writhe faster finding a ship in a solar system was one thinglocating one in interstellar space was distressingly impressive there is a possible slight confusion here that i should eliminate robinette called these people heechee of course they didnt call themselves that any more than native americans called themselves indians or the african khoisan tribes called themselves hottentots and bushmen what the heechee in fact called themselves was the intelligent ones but that proves little so does homo sapiens and fourth fourth was whitenoises plot of the present whereabouts of all known heechee vessels now operated by human beings and when captain saw that he squeaked with rage and shock plot it against banned spaces he commanded and as soon as the datafans were in place and the combined images appeared the tendons in his cheeks trembled like plucked harpstrings they are exploring black holes he said his voice thin whitenoise nodded there is more he said some of the vessels carry order disruptors they can penetrate and mongrel the integrator added and it does not seem that they understand the danger signs having given their reports the rest of the crew waited politely it was captains problem now they hoped very much that he was going to be able to handle it the female named twice was not exactly in love with captain because it wasnt time for that yet but she knew she would be quite soon within the next few days most likely so in addition to her concern for this astonishing and frightening news there was also her concern for captain he was the one who had his upper lip in the pincer although it was not yet time she reached out and placed her lean hand over his so deep in thought was captain that he didnt even notice but patted it absently shoe made the snifihing sound that was the heechee equivalent of clearing his throat before asking do you want to establish contact with the massed minds not now hissed captain rubbing his ribcage with his free fist it made a grating noise loud in the stillness of the cabin what captain really wanted to do was to go back into his black hole in the core of the galaxy and pull the stars up over his head that was not possible next best would be to flee back to that same safe friendly core and report to higher authority higher authority could then make the decisions they could be the ones to deal with the massed minds of the ancestors who would be eager to interfere they could decide what to do about itif possible with some other heechee captain and crew actually dispatched to this terrible swift space to carry out their orders that was a possible option but captain was too well trained to allow himself so easy a way out he was the one on the scene therefore he was the one who should make the first swift responses if they were wrongwell pity poor captam there would be consequences shunning at least though that was only for minor offenses for graver ones there was the equivalent of being kicked upstairsand captain was not eager to join that mighty mass of stored minds that were all of his ancestors he hissed worriedly and made his decisions inform the massed minds he ordered just inform not request recommendations asked shoe firmly just inform prepare a penetrating drone and send it back to base with a duplicate of all data this was to twice who released his hand and began the task of activating and programing a small message vessel and finally to whitenoise set course for the sailship interception point it was not the heechee custom to salute on receiving an order it was also not the heechee custom to argue about it and it was a measure of the confusion in the ship that whitenoise asked are you sure thats what we should do do it said captain shrugging irritably actually it was not a shrug but a quick violent contraction of his hard globular abdomen twice found herself staring admiringly at that fetching little bulge and at the way the tough long strings of tendon from shoulder to wrist stood out from the arm itself why your fingers would almost meet as you clung to it with a start she realized that her time of loving was closer than she had thought what an inconvenience captain would be as annoyed as she since they had had plans for a very special day and a hall twice opened her mouth to tell him then closed it again it was no time to trouble him with that he was completing the thought processes that ridged his cheek muscles and made him scowl and beginning to give orders captain had plenty of resources to draw on there were more than a thousand cleverly cached heechee artifacts scattered around the galaxy not the ones that were meant to be found sooner or later like gateway these were concealed under the exterior appearance of unpromising asteroids in inaccessible orbits or between stars or among clusters of other objects in dust swarms and gas clouds twice he ordered without looking at her activate a command ship we will rendezvous with it at the sailship point she was upset he observed he was sorry but not surprisedcome down to that he was upset himself he returned to the command seat and lowered the bones of his pelvis onto the projecting yflanges his lifesupport pouch fitting neatly into the angle they enclosed and became aware that his communications officer was standing over him face working worriedly yes shoe what is it shoes biceps flexed deferentially the he stammered they the assassins captain felt an electric shock of fear the assassins i think there is a danger that they will be disturbed said shoe dismally the aboriginals are conversing by zerospeed radio conversing you mean transmitting messages who are you talking aboutmassed minds captain shouted leaping out of the seat again you mean the aboriginals are sending messages at galactic distances shoe hung his head i am afraid so captain of course i do not yet know what they are sayingbut there is a great volume of communication captain shook his wrists feebly to signal that he wanted to hear no more sending messages across the galaxy where anyone might hear where especially the certain parties the heechee hoped would not be disturbed at all might well hear and react to establish translation matrices with the minds he ordered and dismally returned to his seat the mission was jinxed captain no longer had hopes of an idle pleasure cruise or even of the satisfaction of a minor task well accomplished the big question in his mind was whether he could get through the next few days still soon they would transship into the sharkshaped command vessel fastest of the heechee fleet filled with technology then his options would increase not only was it larger and faster it carried a number of devices not present on his little penetratorship a tpt hole cutters like the ones his ancestors had used to scoop out the gateway asteroid and the warrens under the surface of venus a device to reach into black holes to see what could be plucked outhe shuddered please the massed minds of the ancestors that one they would not have to use but he would have it and he would have a thousand other useful bits of equipment assuming that was that the ship was still functioning and would meet them at the rendezvous the artifacts the heechee had left behind were powerful strong and longlasting bar accidents they were built to last for at least ten million years but you could not bar all accidents a nearby supernova a malfunctioning part even a chance collision with some other objectyou could harden the artifacts against almost all hazards but in infinite astronomical time almost all is little better than none and if the command ship happened to have failed and if there were no other that twice could locate and bring to the rendezvous the heechee learned fairly early in their technological phase to store the intelligences of dead or dying heechee in inorganic systems that was how the dead men came to be stored to provide company for the boy wan and it was an application of that technology that produced robins here after company for the heechee it may have been a mistake since they were able to use the dead minds of heechee ancestors to store and process data they were not very good at true artificialintelligence systems capable of far greater power and flexibility likeweltlike me captain allowed himself to let the depression sink into his mind there were too many ifs and the consequences of each of them too unpleasant to face it was not unusual for captain or any other heechee to be depressed they had earned it fairly when napoleons grand army crawled back from moscow their enemies were small harassing cavalry bands the russian winterand despair when hitlers wehrmacht repeated the same trek thirteen decades later the main threats were the soviet tanks and artillery the russian winterand again despair they retreated in better order and with more destruction to their foes but not with more despair or less every retreat is a kind of funeral cortege and the thing that has died is confidence the heechee had confidently expected to win a galaxy when they found they must lose and began their immense starspanning retreat to the core the magnitude of their defeat was huger than any that humans had ever known and the despair seeped into all of their souls the heechee were playing a most complicated game one could call it a team sport except that few of the players were allowed to be aware that they were on a team at all the strategies were limited but the final goal of the game was certain if they managed to survive as a race they would win but so many pieces moved on that board and the heechee had so little control they could start the game after that if they interfered directly they exposed themselves that was when the game became perilous it was now captains turn to play and he knew the risks he ran he could be the player who lost the game for the heechee once and for all his first task was to preserve the heechee hiding place as long as possible which meant doing something about the sailship people that was the least of his worries for the second task was the one that counted the stolen ship carried equipment that could penetrate even the skin around the heechee hideyhole it could not enter but it could peer within and that was bad worse the same equipment could penetrate almost any event discontinuity even the one that the heechee themselves dared not enter the one that they prayed would never be breached since within it rested the thing they most terribly feared so captain sat there at the controls of his ship while the glowing silicate cloud that surrounded the core dwindled behind them meanwhile twice was beginning to show signs of the strain that would shortly press her to her limits and meanwhile the cold sludgy sailship people crept through their long slow lives and meanwhile the one humanmanned craft in the universe that could do anything about it approached yet another black hole and meanwhile those other players on the great board audee walthers and janie yeexing watched their stack of chips slowly disappearing as they waited to make their own private gamble meeting in rotterdam there he stood this fellow with a face like a tan avocado blocking my way i identified the expression before i recognized the face the expression was obstinacy irritation fatigue the face that displayed them belonged to audee waithers jr who had been trying to get in touch with me for several days hello audee i said really very cordially shaking his hand and nodding to the pretty orientallooking young woman beside him its great to see you again are you staying at this hotel wonderful listen ive got to run but lets have dinnerset it up with the concierge will you ill be back in a couple of hours and i smiled at him and smiled at the young woman and left them standing there now i dont pretend that was really good manners but as it happens i actually was in a hurry and besides my gut was giving me fits i put essie in a cab going one way and caught another to take me to the court of course if i had known then what he was waiting to tell me i might have been more forthcoming with walthers but i didnt know what i was walking away from or what i was walking toward for that matter for the last little bit i actually did walk because traffic was more than normally snarled there was a parade getting ready to march as well as the normal congestion around the international palace of justice the palace is a fortystory skyscraper sunk on caissons into the soapy soil of rotterdam on the outside it dominates half the city on the inside its all scarlet drapes and oneway glass the very model of a modern international tribunal it is not a place where you go to to plead to a parking ticket it is not a place where individual human beings are considered very much at all in fact and if i had any vanity which i do i would preen myself on the fact that the lawsuit in which i was technically one of the defendants actually had fourteen different parties at interest and four of them were sovereign states i even had a suite of o ces reserved for my private use in the palace itself because all parties at interest did but i didnt go there right away it was nearly eleven oclock and therefore at least an even chance that the court would have started its session for the day so i smiled and pushed my way right into the hearing room it was crowded it was always crowded because there were celebrities to be seen at the hearings in my vanity i had thought i was one of them and i expected heads to turn when i came in no heads no turning everybody was watching half a dozen skinny bearded persons in dashikis and sandals sitting in a corral at the plaintiffs end of the room drinking cokes and giggling among themselves the old ones you didnt see them every day i gawked at them like everybody else until there was a touch on my arm and i turned to see maitre ijsinger my fleshandblood lawyer gazing reprovingly at me you are late mijuheer broadhead he whispered the court wifi have noticed your absence since the court was busy whispering and arguing among themselves over i gathered the question of whether the diary of the first prospector to locate a heechee tunnel on venus should be admitted as evidence i doubted that but you dont pay a lawyer as much as i was paying maitre ijsinger to argue with him of course there was no legal reason for me to pay him at all as much as the case was about anything it was about a motion on the part of the empire of japan to dissolve the gateway corporation i came into it as a the heechee thinking that the australopithecines they discovered when they first visited the earth would ultimately evolve a technological civilizatron decided to preserve a colony of them in a sort of zoo their descendants were the old ones of course that was a wrong guess on the part of the heechee australopithecus never achieved intelligence only extinction it was a sobering reflection for human beings to realize that the socalled heechee heaven later rechristened the s va broadheadfar the largest and most sophisticated starship the human race had ever seenwas in fact only a sort of monkey cage major stockholder in the s yas charter business because the bolivians had brought suit to have the charter revoked on the grounds that the financing of the colonists amounted to a return to slavery the colonists were called indentured servants and i among others had been called a wicked exploiter of human misery what were the old ones doing there why they were parties at interest too because they claimed that the s ya was their propertythey and their ancestors had lived there for hundreds of thousands of years their position in the court was a little complicated they were wards of the government of tanzania because thats where their ancestral earth home had been decreed to be but tanzania wasnt represented in the courtroom tanzania was boycotting the palace of justice because of an unfavorable decision over their seabottom missiles the year before so its affairs were being handled by paraguaywhich was actually taking an interest mostly because of a border dispute with brazil which in turn was present as host to the headquarters of the gateway corp you follow all this well i didnt but that was why i hired maitre ijsinger if i let myself get personally involved in every lousy multimillion dollar lawsuit id spend all my time in court ive got too much to do with the remainder of my life for that so in the normal course of events i would have let the lawyers fight it out and spent my time more profitably chatting with albert einstein or wading along the tappan sea with my wife however there were special reasons for being here i saw one of them half asleep on a leather chair near the old ones i think ill see if joe kwiatkowski wants a cup of coffee i told ijsinger kwiatkowski was a pole representing the east europe economic community and one of the plaintiffs in the case ijsinger turned pale hes an adversary he hissed hes also an old friend i told him exaggerating the facts of the case only slightlyhe had been a gateway prospector too and wed had drinks over old times before there are no friends in a court action of this magnitude ijsinger informed me but i only smiled at him and leaned forward to hiss at kwiatkowski who came along willingly enough once he was awake i should not be here with you robin he rumbled once we were in my fifteenthfloor suite especially for coffee dont you got something to put in it well i hadslivovitz and from his favorite cracow distillery too and kampuchean cigars the brand he liked and salt herring and biscuits to go with them all the court was built over a little canal off the maas river and you could smell the water because i had managed to get a window open you could hear the boats going through under the buildings arch and traffic from the tunnel under the maas a quarter kilometer away i opened the window a little wider because of kwiatkowskis cigar and saw the flags and bands in the side streets what are they parading for today i asked he brushed the question aside because armies like parades he grunted now no fooling around robin i know what you want and it is impossible what i want i said is for the eeek to help wipe out the terrorists with the spaceship which is obviously in the interest of everybody you tell me thats impossible fine i accept that but why is it impossible because you know nothing of politics you think the eeec can go to the paraguayans and say listen go and make a deal with brazil say you will be more flexible on this border dispute if they will pool their information with the americans so the terrorist spaceship can be trapped yes i said that is exactly what i think and you are wrong they will not listen the eeek i said patiently having been well briefed for this purpose by my dataretrieval system albert is paraguays biggest trading partner if you whistle they jump in most cases yes in this case no the key to the situation is the republic of kampuchea they have with paraguay private arrangements about these i will say nothing except that they have been approved at the highest level more coffee he added holding out his coffee cup and this time please not so much coffee in it i did not ask kwiatkowski what the private arrangements were because if he had been willing to tell me he would not have called them private i didnt have to they were military all the private arrangements governments were making with each other these days were military and if i had not been sweating about the terrorists i would have been sweating about the crazy way the worlds duly ordained governments were behaving but one thing at a time so on alberts advice i got a lawyer from malaysia into my private parlor next and after her a missionary from canada and then a general in the albanian air force and for each one i had some bait to dangle albert told me what levers to pull and what glass beads to offer the nativesan extra allotment of colonization passages here a charitable contribution there sometimes all it took was a smile rotterdam was the place to do it because ever since the palace was moved from the hague the hague having been pretty well messed up in the troubles the last time some joker was fooling with a tpt you could find anyone you wanted in rotterdam all kinds of people all colors all sexes hi all kinds of costumes from ecuadorian lawyers in miniskirts to marshall islands thermalenergy barons in sarongs and sharksteeth necklaces whether i was making progress or not was hard to say but at halfpast twelve my belly telling me that it was going to hurt in a serious way if i didnt put some food in it i knocked off for the morning i thought longingly of our nice quiet hotel suite with a nice lukewarm steak from room service and my shoes off but i had promised to meet essie at her place of business so i told albert to prepare an estimate of what i had accomplished and recommendations about what i should do next and fought my way to a cab you cant miss one of essies fastfood franchises the glowing blue heecheemetal arches are in just about every country of the world as the boss she had a ropedoff section on the balcony reserved for us and she met me coming up the stairs with a kiss a frown and a dilemma robin listen they want here to serve mayonnaise with the french fries should i allow i kissed her back but i was peering over her shoulder to see what ungodly messes were being set out on our tables thats really up to you i told her yes of course is up to me but is important robin have taken great care in meticulous duplication of true pommesfrites you know now mayonnaise then she stepped back and gave me a more thorough look and her expression changed so tired so many lines in the face robin how are you feeling i gave her my most charming smile just hungry my dear i cried and gazed with deceitful enthusiasm at the plates before me say that looks good what is it a taco is chapatti she said with pride taco is over there also blini see how you like then so of course i had to taste them all and it was not at all what my belly had asked for the taco the chapatti the rice balls with sour fish sauce the stuff that tasted more than anything else like boiled barley they were not any of them my cup of tea but they were all edible they were also all gifts of the heechee the great insight the heechee had given us was that most of living tissue including yours and mine is made up of just four elements carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen c h nchonfood since that is also what the gases that comprise the best part of a comet are made of they built their food factory out in the oort cloud where our suns comets hang waiting for a star to shake them loose and send them in to be pretty in our sky chon isnt all of it you need a few other elements sulfurs the most important maybe then perhaps sodium magnesium phosphorus chlorine potassium calciumnot to mention the odd dash of cobalt to make vitamin bl chromium for glucose tolerance iodine for the thyroid and lithium fluorine arsenic selenium molybdenum cadmium and tin for the hell of it you probably need the whole periodic table at least as traces but most of the elements in quantities so small that you dont have to worry about adding them to the stew they show up as contaminants whether you want them or not so essies food chemists cooked up batches of sugar and spice and everything nice and produced food for everybodynot only what would keep them alive but pretty much what they wanted to eat wherefore the chapattis and the rice balls you can make anything out of chonfood if you stir it up right among the other things essie was making out of it was a lot of money and that turned out to be a game she delighted to play so when i finally settled down with something my stomach didnt resistit looked like a hamburger and tasted like an avocado salad with bacon bits in it and essie had named it the big chonessie was up and down every minute checking the temperature of the infrared warming lights looking for grease under the dishwashing machines tasting the desserts raising hell because the milkshakes were too thin i had essies word that nothing in her chain would hurt anybody though my stomach had less confidence in her word than i did i didnt like the noise from the street outsidewas it the paradebut outside of that i was as close to comfortable as i was likely to get just then relaxed enough to appreciate a turnaround in our status when essie and i go out in public people look at us and usually im the one they look at not here in essies franchise stores essie was the star outside the passersby were gathering to watch the parade inside no employee gave it a glance they went about their jobs with all their back muscles tense and all the surreptitious glances they sneaked went in the same direction to the great lady boss well not very ladylike really essie has had the benefit of a quartercenturys tuition in the english language from an expert mebut when she gets excited its nekulturny and khuligans all over the place i moved to the secondfloor window to look out at the parade it was coming straight down weena ten abreast with bands and shouting and placards nuisance maybe worse than a nuisance across the street in front of the station there was a scuffle with cops and placards rearmers against pacifists you couldnt tell which was which from the way they clubbed each other with the placards and essie rejoining me and picking up her own big chon glanced at them and shook her head hows sandwich she demanded fine i said with my mouth full of carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen plus trace elements she gave me a speaklouder look i said its fine i amplified i couldnt hear you with all that noise she complained licking her lipsshe liked what she sold i jerked my head toward the parade i dont know if this is so good i said i think not she agreed looking with distaste at a company of what i think they call zouavesanyway darkskinned marchers in uniform i couldnt see their national patches but each one of them was carrying a rapidfire shoulder weapon and playing tricks with it spinning it around bouncing the buttplate against the pavement and making it spring back into his hands all without breaking stride maybe wed better start back to the court i said she reached over and picked up the last crumb of my sandwich some russian women melt down into spheres of fat when they get past forty and some shrink and shrivel not essie she still had the straight back and narrow waist that first caught my eye perhaps we should she said beginning to gather up her computer programs each on its own datafan have seen enough uniforms as a child do not specially want to see all these now you cant really have much of a parade without uniforms not just parade look on sidewalks too and it was true about one man or woman in four was wearing some sort of uniform it was a little surprising because it had crept up on me of course every country had always had some sort of armed forces but they were just sort of kept in a closet like a home fire extinguisher people never actually saw them but now people did more and more still she said conscientiously sweeping chon crumbs off the table onto the disposable platelet and looking for the waste hamper you must be quite tired and we had better go give me your trash please i waited for her at the door and she was frowning when she joined me receptacle was almost full in manual it is set forth clearly empty at sixtypercent pointwhat will they do if large party leaves at once i should go back and instruct manageroh hell she cried her expres sion changing have forgotten my programs and she dashed back up the stairs to where she had left her datafans i stood in the door waiting for her my eyes on the parade it was quite disgusting there were actual weapons going by antiaircraft missile launchers and armored vehicles and behind a bagpipe band was a company of the tommygun twirlers i felt the door move behind me and stepped aside out of the way just as essie pushed it open i found robin she said smiling and holding the thick sheaf of fans up as i turned toward her and something like a wasp snarled past my left ear there are no wasps in rotterdam then i saw essie falling backward and the door closing on her it was not a wasp it was a gunshot one of those twirled weapons had held a live charge and it had gone off i nearly lost essie once before it was a long time ago but i hadnt forgotten all that old woe welled up as fresh as yesterday as i pulled the stupid door out of the way and bent over her she was lying on her back with the sheaf of tied datafans over her face and as i lifted it away i saw that although her face was bloody her eyes were wide open and looking at me hey rob she said her voice puzzled you punch me hell no what would i punch you for one of the counter girls came rushing with a wad of paper napkins i grabbed them away from her and pointed to the redandwhite striped electrovan with the words poliklinische centrum stenciled on its side idling at an intersection because of the parade you get that ambulance over here and get the cops too while youre at it essie sat up pushing my arm away as cops and counter attendants swarmed around us why ambulance robin she asked reasonably is only a bloody nose look and indeed that was all there was it had been a bullet all right but it had hit the sheaf of fans and stayed there my programs essie wailed tugging against the policeman who wanted them to extract the bullet for evidence but they were ruined anyway and so was my day while essie and i were having our little brush with destiny audee walthers was taking his friend sightseeing around the town of rotterdam he had been sweating as he left me the presence of a lot of money does that to people the absence of money took most of the joy out of r tterdam for waithers and yeexing still to walthers the hayseeds of peggys planet still in his hair and to yeexing rarely away from the s ya and the immediate vicinity of the launch boops rotterdazn was a metropolis they couldnt afford to buy anything but at least they could look in the windows at least broadhead had agreed to see them walthers kept telling himself but when he allowed himself to think it with some satisfaction the darker side of walthers responded with savage contempt broadhead had said he would see them but he surehell hadnt seemed very anxious about it why am i sweating he asked out loud yeexing slipped her arm through his for moral support it will be all right she replied indirectly one way or another audee walthers looked down at her gratefully walthers was not particularly tall but janie yeexing was tiny all of her was tiny except for her eyes lustrous and black and that was surgery a silliness from a time when she had been in love with a swedish merchant banker and thought it was only the epicanthic fold that kept him from loving her back well shall we go in walthers had no idea what she was talking about and must have shown it by his frown yeexing butted his shoulder with her small closecropped head and looked up toward a storefront sign in pale letters hanging in what looked like empty ebon space it said here after walthers examined it and then looked at the woman again its an undertakers he guessed and laughed as he thought he saw the point of her joke but were not that bad off yet janie its not she said or not exactly dont you recognize the name and then of course he did it was one of the many robinette broadhead holdings on the list the more you learned about broadhead the more likely you could figure out what things would make him agree to a deal that was sense why not said walthers approving and led her through the air curtain into the cool dark recesses of the shop if it was not a funeral establishment it had at least bought from the same decorators there was soft unidentifiable music in the background and a fragrance of wildflowers although the only floral display in sight was a single sheaf of bright roses in a crystal vase a tall handsome elderly man rose before them waithers could not say whether he had got up from one of the chairs or materialized as a hologram the figure smiled warmly at them tried to guess their nationalities he got it wrong guten tag he said to walthers and gor ho oyney to yeexing we both speak english walthers said do you urbane eyebrows lifted of course welcome to here after is there someone near to you who is about to die not that i know of said walthers i see of course we can still accomplish a great deal even if the person has already reached metabolic death although the sooner we begin transfer the betteror are you wisely making plans for your own future neither one said yeexing we just want to know what it is you offer of course the man smiled gesturing them to a comfortable couch he did not appear to do anything to bring it about but the lights became a touch brighter and the music dwindled a few decibels my card he said producing a pasteboard for walthers and answering the question that had been bothering him the card was tangible and so were the fingers that handed it to him let me run through the basics for you it will save time in the long run to begin with here after is not a religious organization and does not claim to provide salvation what we do offer is a form of survival whether youthe you that is here in this room at this momentwill be aware of it or nothe smiledis a matter that the metaphysicians are still arguing but the storage of your personalities should you elect to provide for it is guaranteed to pass turings test provided we are able to begin transfer while the brain is stifi in good condition and the surroundings that the surviving client perceives will be those which he chooses from our available list we have more than two hundred environments to offer ranging yeexing snapped her fingers the dead men she said suddenly comprehending the salesperson nodded although his expression tightened a bit that is what the originals were called yes i see that you are familiar with the artifact called heechee heaven now being used as a transport for colonists im the transports third officer yeexing said quite truthfully except for tenses and my friend here is her seventh i envy you the salesman said and the expression on his face suggested that he really meant it envy did not keep him from delivering his sales pitch and walthers listened attentively janie yeexings hand holding his he appreciated the hand it kept him from thinking about the dead men and their protйgй wanor at least about what wan was likely to be doing at that moment the original dead men the salesperson declared were unfortunately rather botched the transfer of their memories and personalities from the wet gray storage receptacle in their skulls to the crystalline datastores that preserved them after death had been accomplished by unskilled la when the programs and databases for the socalled dead men became available for study my creator s ya broadhead was naturally greatly interested she set herself the task of duplicating their work the most complex task was of course the transcription of the database of a human brain and nervous system which is stored chemically and redundantly onto the heechee datafans she did very well not only well enough to franchise the here after chain but well enoughwell to create me the here after storage was based on her earliest research later on she got betterbetter even than the heechee for she was able to combine not only their techniques but independent human technology the dead men could never pass a turing test essie broadheads works after a while could and did bor using equipment that had been designed for quite a different species in the first place so the storage was imperfect the easiest way to think of it the salesman explained was to think the dead men had been so stressed by their unskilled transfer that they had gone mad but that happened no longer now the storage procedures had been so refined that any deceased could carry on a conversation with his survivors so deftly that it was just like talking to the real person more the patient had an active life in the datastores he could experience the moslem christian or scientological heaven complete with respectively beautiful boys scattered like pearls on the grass choirs of angels or the presence of l ron hubbard himself if his bent was not religious he could experience adventure listening to music of any kind in any company he chose and of course sex all varieties of the sexual experience over and over how boring said waithers thinking about it for you and me the salesman granted but not for them you see they dont remember the prograinatic experiences very clearly theres an accelerated decay bias applied to those datastores not to the others if you talk to a dear one today and come back a year from now and pick up the conversation hell remember it exactly but the programed experiences dwindle fast in their memoriesjust as recollection of pleasure you see so that they want to experience them again and again how horrible said yeexing audee i think its time we went to the hotel not yet janie what was that about talking to them the salesmans eyes gleamed certainly some of them really enjoy talking even to strangers you have a moment its very simple really as he was talking he led them to a pv console consulted a silkbound directory and punched out a series of code numbers ive actually become friendly with some of them he said bashfully when things are slow at the store a lot of the time i call one of them up and we have a mce chatah rex how are you why im just fine said the handsome bronzed senior citizen who appeared in the pv how nice to see you i dont think i know your friends he added peering in a friendly way at walthers and yeexing if there was an ideal way for a man to appear when he passed a certain age this was it he had all his hair and seemed to have all his teeth his face showed laugh wrinkles at the corners of his eyes but was otherwise un lined and his eyes were bright and warm he acknowledged the introductions politely questioned about what he was doing he shrugged modestly im about to sing the catulli carmina with the wien staatsoper you know he winked the lead soprano is very beautiful and i think those sexy lyrics have been getting to her in rehearsal amazing murmured walthers gazing at him but janie yeexing was less enchanted we really dont want to keep you from your music she said politely and im afraid wed better get along theyll wait rex declared fondly they always do walthers was fascinated tell me he said when you talk about ah companionship in this ab statecan you have your choice of any companions you want even if theyre still alive the question was aimed at the salesman but rex spoke first he was gazing shrewdly and sympathetically at waithers anyone at all he said nodding as though they shared a confidence anyone living or dead or imaginary and mr walthers theyll do anything you want them to the figure chuckled what i always say he added is that what you call life is really only a sort of entracte to the real existence you get here i just cant understand why people put it off for so long the here afters were as a matter of fact one of the little spinoff enterprises that i was fondest of not because they earned much money when we discovered that the heechee had been able to store dead minds in machines a light clicked well says i to my good wife if they can do it why cant we well says my good wife to me no reason at all robin to be sure just give me a little time to work out the encoding i had not made any decision about whether i wanted it done to me when and if i was quite sure though that i didnt want it done to essie at least not right then and so i was glad that the bullet had done no more than puff her nose well somewhat more it involved us with the rotterdam police the uniformed sergeant introduced us to the brigadier who took us in his big fast car with the lights going to the bureau and offered us coffee then brigadier zuitz showed us into the office of inspector van der waal a great huge woman with oldfashioned contact lenses making her eyes bulge out with sympathy it was how unpleasant for you mijnheer and i hope your wound is not painful mevrouw as she was leading us up the stairsstair to the office of commissaris lutzlek who was a different kettle of fish altogether short slim fair with a sweet boys face though he had to be at least fifty to have become a principal commissaire you could imagine him putting his thumb in the dyke and hanging in there forever if he had to or until he drowned but you could not imagine him giving up thank you for coming in about this business in the stationsplein he said making sure we had seats the accident i said no regretfully not an accident if it had been an accident it would have been a matter for the municipal police rather than for me so therefore this inquiry for which we ask your cooperation i said to put him in his place our time is pretty valuable to be spent in this sort of thing he was not puttable your life is even more valuable oh come on one of the soldiers in the parade was doing his twirling act and he had a round in his gun and it went off mijnheer broadhead he said first no soldier had a round in his gun the guns are without firing pins in any case second the soldiers are not even soldiers they are college students hired to dress up for parades just like the guards at buckinghain palace third the shot did not come from the parade how do you know because the gun has been found he looked very angry in a police locker this is quite embarrassing to me mijnheer as you can imagine there were many extra policemen for the parade and they used a portable dressingroom van the policeman who fired the weapon was a stranger to others in the unit but then they were drawn from many detachments come to clean up after the parade he dressed quickly and left with his locker open there was nothing in it but the uniform stolen i suppose and the gun and a picture of you not of mevrouw of you he sat back and waited the sweet boys face was peaceful i was not it takes a minute to sink in the announcement that somebody has the fixed intention of killing you it was scary not just being killed thats scary by definition and i can testify to how scared i can get when it looks like death is near out of unforgotten and even repeated experience but murder is worse than ordinary death i said you know how that makes me feel guilty i mean i must have done something that really made somebody hate me exactly so mijnheer broadhead what do you suppose it could have been i have no idea if you find the man i suppose you can find the reason that shouldnt be too hardthere must be fingerprints or something i saw news cameras perhaps theres even a picture of him on somebodys ifim he sighed mijnheer please do not tell me how to conduct police routine all those things are of course being followed up plus depth interviews with everyone who might have seen the man plus sweat analysis of the clothes plus all other means of identification i am assuming this man was a professional and therefore those means will not succeed so we approach it from the other direction who are your enemies and what are you doing in rotterdam i dont think i have any enemies business rivals maybe but they dont assassinate people he waited patiently so i added as to what im doing in rotterdam i think thats quite well known my business interests include some share in the exploitation of some heechee artifacts this is known he said not quite so patient i shrugged so i am a party in a suit at the international palace of justice the commissaris opened one of his desk drawers peered inside and slammed it again moodily mijnheer broadhead he said you have had many meetings here in rotterdam not connected with this suit but instead with the question of terrorism you wish it stopped we all want that i said but the feeling in my belly was not just my degenerating pipes i had thought i was being very secretive we all want it but you are doing something about it mijnheer therefore i believe you now do have enemies the enemies of us all the terrorists he stood up and offered us the door so while you are in my jurisdiction i will see that you have police protection after that i can only urge caution for i believe you are in danger from them everybody is i said everybody is at random yes but you are now a particular case our hotel had been built in the palmy days for bigspending tourists and the jetset rich the best suites were decorated for their tastes not always for ours neither essie nor i was into straw mats and woodblock pillows but the management moved all that out and moved in the right kind of bed round and huge i was looking forward to getting a lot of use out of it not so much use out of the lobby which was a kind of architecture i hated cantilevered walkways more fountains than versailles so many mirrors that when you looked up you thought you were in outer space through the good offices of the commissaris or anyway of the young cop he sent to escort us home we were spared that we were whisked through a service entrance up a padded elevator that smelled of roomservice food to our own landing where there had been a change in the decoration just across from our suite door there was a marble winged venus in the stairwell now it had a companion in a blue suit a perfectly ordinarylooking man studiously not meeting my eye i looked at the cop escorting us she grinned in embarrassment nodded to her colleague in the stairwell and closed the door behind us we were a particular case all right i sat down and regarded essie her nose was still somewhat swollen but it did not seem to trouble her still maybe you ought to go to bed i suggested she looked at me with tolerant affection for a bloodied nose robin how very foolish you are or do you have some more interesting project in mind it is a true tribute to my dear wife that as soon as she brought the subject up my damaged day and my damaged colon to the contrary notwithstanding i did indeed have something in mind after twentyfive years you would think that even sex would begin to get boring my dataretrieval friend albert had told me about studies of laboratory animals that proved that that was inevitable male rats were left with their mates and their frequency of intercourse measured there was a steady decline over time boredom then they took away the old mates and introduced new ones the rats perked up and went to it with a will so this was established scientific factfor ratsbut i guess that i am not at least in that sense a rat in fact i was enjoying myself quite a lot when without warning someone shoved a dagger right into my belly i couldnt help it i yelled essie pushed me away she sat up swiftly calling for albert in russian obediently his hologram sprang into life he squinted toward me and nodded yes he said please mrs broadhead place robins wrist against the dispenser on the bedside table i was bent double hugging myself against the pain for a moment i thought i was going to vomit but what was in my gut was too bad to be expelled so easily do something cried essie frantically pulling me to her bare breast as she pressed my arm against the table i am already doing it mrs broadhead said albert and as a matter of fact i could appreciate the sudden sense of numbness as the injection needle forcesprayed something into my arm the pain receded and became bearable you are not to be unduly alarmed robin albert said kindly nor you mrs broadhead i have been anticipating this sudden ischemic pain for some hours it is only a symptom damn arrogant program cried essie who had written him symptom of what of the beginning of the final rejection process mrs broadhead it is not yet critical especially as i am already administering medication along with the analgesia still i propose surgery tomorrow i was feeling better enough already to sit up on the edge of the bed i traced with my toe the design of arrows pointing toward mecca that had been worked into the rug for longgone bigspending oil magnates and said what about tissue match that has been arranged robin i let go of my stomach experimentally it didnt explode i have a lot of appointments tomorrow i pointed out essie who had been rocking me gently let go and sighed obstinate maul why put oft could have had transplant weeks ago and all this nonsense not necessary i didnt want to i explained and anyway albert said there was time was time oh of course was time is that reason to use time all up with fiddling and faddling until oh sorry suddenly unexpected event takes place and time is all gone and you die like you warm and alive robin not here after program i nuzzled her with my nose and chin sick man get away from me she snarled but did not draw away huh you feel better now quite a lot better good enough to talk sensibly and make appointment with hospital i blew in her ear essie i said i positively will but not right this minute because if i remember correctly you and i have some unfinished business not albert though so you will please turn yourself off old friend certainly robin he grinned and disappeared but essie held me off staring into my face for a long time before she shook her head you robin she said you want me to write you as here after program not a bit i said and actually right now thats not what i want to discuss discuss she scoffed ha i know how you discuss all i wanted to say is if i do write you robin you bet in some ways i write you much different it had been quite a day it was not surprising that i didnt remember certain unimportant details my secretary program remembered of course and so i got a hint when the service door to the butlers pantry opened and a procession of roomservice waiters came in with dinner not for two for four oh my god said essie striking her forehead with the back of her hand your poor friend with face like frog robin you have invited for dinner and look at you bare feet sitting in underwear nekulturny indeed robin go and dress at once i stood up because there was no use arguing but i argued anyway if im in my underwear what about you she gave me a scathing look actually she wasnt in her underwear she was wearing one of those chinese things slit up the side it looked as much like a dress as it did a nightgown and she used it interchangeably for both in case of nobel laureate she said reprovingly what one wears is defining what is proper also have showered and you have not so do so for you smell of sexual activityand oh my god she added cocking an ear to sounds at the door i think are here already i headed for the bathroom as she went for the door and lingered long enough to hear sounds of argument the least expert of the roomservice waiters was listening too a frown on his face and his hand reaching unconsciously toward the bulge under his armpit i sighed and left it to them and headed for the bathroom actually it wasnt a bathroom all by itself it was a bath suite the tub was big enough for two persons maybe for three or four but i hadnt been thinking in any numbers higher than twothough it did make me wonder just what those arab tourists had liked doing in their baths there was concealed lighting in the tub itself statuary surrounding it that poured out hot water or cold a deep pile rug throughout all the vulgar little things like toilets were in decorous little cubicles of their own it was fancy but it was nice albert i called pulling a blouse over my head and he answered yes robin there was no video in the bath just his voice i said i kind of like this see if you can get me plans for putting one like this into the place at tappan sea certainly robin he said but meanwhile may i remind you that your guests are waiting you may because you just did and also robin you are not to overexert yourself the medication i gave you will be of purely temporary value unless turn yourself off i ordered and entered the main reception salon to greet my guests a table had been set with crystal and china candles were burning wine was in a cooler and the waiters were standing politely at attention even the one with the bulge under his arm sorry i kept you waiting audee said beaming at them but its been a hard day have told them said essie passing a plate to the young oriental girl was necessary as stupid policeman at door considered them likely terrorists too i tried to explain grumbled walthers but he didnt speak any english mrs broadhead had to sort him out its a good thing you speak dutch she shrugged graciously speak deutsch speak dutch is same thing provided one speaks loud also she said informatively is only a state of mind tell me captain walthers you go to speak language other person does not understand what do you think well i think i havent said it right hal exactly but i i think he has not understood it right this is basic rule for speaking foreign language i rubbed my belly lets eat i said and led the way to the table but i had not failed to notice the look essie gave me so i exerted myself to be sociable well were a sadlooking lot i said genially making note of the cast on waltherss wrist the bruise on yeexings face essies still puffy nose been punching each other out have you as it turned out that was not tactful since walthers promptly informed me that indeed they had under the influence of the terrorists tpt so we talked about the terrorists for a while and then we talked about the sad condition the human race had got itself into it was not a cheerful conversation especially as essie decided to get philosophical what a rotten thing human being is she offered and then reversed herself no am unjust one human being can be quite fine even as fine as we four sitting here not perfect but on a statistical basis out of let us say one hundred chances to display kindness altruism decencyall these traits we humpns esteem you seewill in fact perform no fewer than twentyfive of them but nations political groups terrorists she shook her head out of one hundred chances zero she said or perhaps one but then you may be sure with some trick up sleeve you see wickedness is additive is perhaps one grain in each human being but add up quantity of say ten million human beings in even small country or group equals evil enough to damage entire world im ready for dessert i said gesturing to the waiters you would think that was a broad enough hint for any guest to take especially considering that they already knew wed had a bad day but waithers was obstinate he lingered over dessert he insisted on telling me his lifes story and he kept looking at the waiters and all in all i was getting quite uncomfortable not just in the belly essie says i am not patient with people perhaps so the friends i am most comfortable interacting with are computer programs rather than flesh and blood and they dont have feelings to hurtwell im not sure thats true for albert but it is for say my secretarial program or my chef it is certain that i was getting impatient with audee walthers his life had been a dull soap opera he had lost his wife and his savings he had made unauthorized use of equipment on the s ya with yeexings connivance and got her fired he had spent his last dime to get here to rotterdam reason not specified but clearly it had something to do with me well i am not unwilling to loan money to a friend down on his luck but see i was in no mood it was not just the fright over essie or the screwedup day or the nagging worry about whether the next nut with a gun would actually get me there was my damned gut giving me fits at last i told the waiters to clear off though walthers was still lingering over his fourth cup of coffee i stomped over to the table with the liqueurs and cigars and glowered at him as he followed what is it audee i said no longer polite money how much do you need and i got such a look from him he hesitated watching while the last of the waiters filed out through the pantry and then he let me have it it isnt what i need he said his voice trembling its what youre willing to pay for something you want youre a real rich man broadhead maybe you dont worry about people who stick their asses in a crack for you but i made the mistake of doing it twice i dont like being reminded i owe a favor either but i didnt get a chance to say anything janie yeexing put her hand on his bad wrist gently just tell him what youve got she ordered tell me what i demanded and the son of a gun shrugged and said the way you might tell me youd found my car keys on the floor why tell you that ive found what i think is a real live heechee god and the heechee i found a heechee ive got a fragment of the true cross i talked with god literally i didthose statements are all in the same league you dont believe them but they scare you and then if you find theyre true or if you cant be sure theyre notthen its miracle time and scaredtodeath time god and the heechee when i was a kid i didnt distinguish greatly between them and even as a grownup the confusion was still there it was past midnight when i was finally willing to let them go by then id sucked them dry i had the datafan theyd swiped from the ј ya i had brought albert in on the discussion to ask all the questions his fertile digital mind could invent i was feeling pretty rotten and frayed and the analgesia had long worn off but i couldnt go to sleep essie announced firmly that if i was determined to kill self with overexertion she was at least going to stay up to enjoy spectacle and as soon as she was gently snoring on the couch i called albert again one financial detail i said walthers said hed passed up a milliondollar bonus to give this to me so transfer ah two million to his account right away certainly robin albert einstein never gets sleepy but when he wants to indicate that its past my bedtime he is perfectly capable of yawning and stretching i should remind you though that the state of your health i told him what he could do with the state of my health then i told him what he could do with his idea of putting me in the hospital the next day he spread his hands gracefully youre the boss robin he said humbly still ive been thinking it is not true that albert einstein does not spend any time thinking since he moves at nuclearparticle speeds however the time involved is not usually perceptible to fleshandblood human beings like myself unless he wants it to be usually for dramatic effect spit it out albert he shrugged it is only that in your precarious health i do not like to see you excited without reason reason jesus albert sometimes you really act like a dumb machine what more reason could anybody have than finding a living heechee yes he said puffing his pipe judiciously and changed the subject from the sensor readings i am receiving robin i would think you must be in considerable pain how bright you are albert the fact of the matter was that the churning in my gut had shifted gears now there was a mixer blade pureeing my belly and every spin was a separate hurt should i wake mrs broadhead and inform her that message was in code if we woke essie to tell her something like that it would at once result in her throwing me into bed summoning the surgical programs and delivering me over to all the cossetting and curing full medical plus could offer the truth was it was beginning to look attractive pain scared me as dying did not dying was something you could get over and done with at least while pain looked unending but not right then no way albert i said at least not until you come out with whatever youre being so coy about are you telling me that i made a wrong assumption somewhere along the line if so tell me where only in terming audee waltherss perception a heechee robin he said scratching his chin with the stem of his pipe i sat up straight and grabbed at my stomach because the sudden motion had not been a good idea what the hell else could it be albert he said solemnly let us review the evidence walthers said that the intelligence he perceived seemed to be slowed down even stopped this is consistent with the hypothesis it is heechee since they are thought to be in a black hole where time is slowed right then why second he went on the detection was in interstellar space this is also consistent since the heechee are known to have that capability albert finally he said calmly disregarding the tone of my voice the detection was of an intelligent form of life and other than ourselveshe twinkled at meor should i say other than the human race the heechee are the only known such form however he said benignly the duplicate ships log that captain walthers brought us raises serious questions get on with it damn you certainly robin let me display the data he moved aside in his holographic frame and a ships chart leaped into existence it showed a distant pale blob and along the righthand margin symbols and numerals danced note the velocity robin eighteen hundred kilometers a second that is not an impossible velocity for a natural objectsay a condensation from the wavefront of a supernova but for a heechee vessel why would it be going so slowly and does that in fact look like a heechee vessel it looks like nothing at all for gods sake its just a blur at extreme range you cant tell a thing the small figure of albert to one side of the chart nodded not as it is no he admitted but i have been able to enhance the image there is of course other negative evidence if indeed the source is a black hole what he affected to misunderstand me i was saying that the hypothesis that the source is in a black hole is not consistent with the total absence of gamma or xradiation from that region as would presumably occur from infall of dust and gas albert i said sometimes you go too far he gazed at me with hoodedeyed concern i know that those calm stares of alberts and his pretenses of forgetting things are only contrivances for effect they do not reflect any appropriate realityespecially the times when he looks right into my eyes the imaged eyes in alberts holopics see no more than the eyes in a photograph if he senses me and he surely did sense me good it was through camera lenses and hypersound pulses and capacitance probes and thermal imagers none of which are located anywhere near the eyes of the image of albert but there are all the same moments when those eyes seem to be looking right into my soul you want to believe they are heechee dont you robin he asked softly none of your business show me this enhanced image very well the image mottled marbled cleared and i was looking at an immense dragonfly it more than ifiled the screen in alberts little peepshow most of its gauzy wings could be made out only by the stars they obscured but where all the wings came together there was a cylindrical object with points of light gleaming on its surface and some of that light glittered off the wings themselves its a sailship i gasped yes a sailship albert agreed a photonic spacecraft its only propulsion is from light pressur against the array of sails but albertbut albert that must take forever he nodded in human terms yes that is a good description at its estimated velocity the trip from say the earth to the nearest star alpha centauri would take approximately six hundred years my god six hundred years in that little thing it isnt little robin he corrected me it is more distant than you perhaps realize my ranging data is only approximate but my best estimate is that the distance from sailtip to sailtip is not less than one hundred thousand kilometers on the damask couch essie snorted changed position opened her eyes to look at me said accusingly still up eh and closed her eyes again all without waking up i sat back and fatigue and pain swarmed over me i wish i were sleepy i said i need to let all this simmer awhile before i can take it in of course robin ill tell you what i suggest albert said cunningly you didnt have much for dinner so why dont i make you up some nice splitpea soup or maybe some fish chowder you know what puts me to sleep dont you i said almost laughing glad to have my thoughts brought back to the mundane why not so i moved back to the dining alcove i let alberts bartender subroutine fix me a nice hot buttered rum and albert himself appeared in the pvframe over the sideboard to keep me company very nice i said finishing it lets have another before i eat all right certainly robin he said fiddling with his pipestem robin yes i said reaching for the new drink robinbashfullyive got an idea i was in a good mood to hear ideas so i cocked an eyebrow at him as permission to go on walthers gave me the notion institutionalize what you did for him set up annual awards like to nobel prizes or the gateway science bonuses six prizes a year a hundred thousand dollars each each one for someone in a particular field of science and discovery i have prepared a budgethe moved to one side turning his head to glance toward a corner of the viewing frame a neatly printed prospectus appeared thereshowing that for a nominal outlay of six hundred thousand a year nearly all of which would be recouped through tax savings and thirdparty participation hold it albert dont be my accountant be my science advisor prizes for what he said simply for helping to solve the riddles of the universe i sat back and stretched feeling very relaxed and warm and benign even to a computer program oh hell albert sure go ahead isnt the soup ready yet right this minute he said obligingly and so it was i dipped a spoon into it and it was fish chowder thick white with lots of cream i dont see the point though i said information robin he said but i thought you got all that sort of information anyway of course i doafter its published i have a conceptually keyed search program going all the time with more than fortythree thousand subject flags and as soon as something on say heechee language transcription appears anywhere it automatically goes into my store but i want it before its published and even if it isnt published like audees discovery do you see winners each year chosen by a juryi would be gladhe twinkledto help you select the juries and i have proposed six areas of inquiry he nodded toward the display the budget disappeared replaced by a neat tabulation heechee communications translation observations and interpretation of the missing mass analysis of heechee technology amelioration of terrorism amelioration of international tensions nonexploitive life extension they all sound very commendable i said approvingly the soups fine too yes he said the chefs are very good at following instructions i glanced up at him drowsily his voice seemed gentlerno perhaps the word is sweeterthan before i yawned trying to focus my eyes do you know albert i said i never noticed it before but you look a little like my mother he put down his pipe and regarded me sympathetically its nothing to worry about he said youve got nothing to worry about at all i regarded my faithful hologram with drowsy pleasure i guess thats right i conceded maybe its not my mother you look like though those big eyebrows it doesnt matter robin he said gently it doesnt does it i agreed so you might just as wellgo to sleep he finished and that seemed like such a good idea that i did not right away not abruptly just slowly gently i lingered half awake and i was absolutely comfortable and absolutely relaxed so i didnt quite know where half awake ended and allasleep began i was in a dream or a reverie that inbetween state when you suspect you are sleeping but dont care much and the mind wanders oh yes my mind wandered very far i was chasing around the universe with wan reaching into one black hole after another in search of something very important to him and also very important to me though i didnt know why there was a face involved not alberts not my mothers not even essies a womans face with great dark eyebrows why i thought with pleased surprise the son of a bitch has doped me and meanwhile the great galaxy turned and tiny particles of organic matter pushed slightly less tiny particles of metal and crystal across the spaces between the stars and the organic bits experienced pain and desolation and terror and joy in all their various ways but i was all the way asleep and it did not matter to me a bit then the penalties of love one small bit of organic matter named dolly walthers was busy experiencing all of those feelingsor all but joyand a great deal of such other feelings as resentment and boredom in particular boredom except at those moments when the dominant feeling in her sorry small heart was terror as much as anything the inside of wans ship was like a chamber in some complicated wholly automatic factory in which a small space had been left for human beings to crawl in to make repairs even the flickering golden coil that was part of the heechee drive system was only partly visible wan had surrounded it with cupboarding to store food dollys own personal possessionsthey consisted mostly of her puppets and a sixmonth supply of tamponswere jammed into a cabinet in the tiny toilet all the other space was wans there was not much to do and no room to do it in reading was one possible way to pass the time the only datafans wan owned that were readable really were mostly childrens stories recorded for him he said when he was tiny they were extremely boring to dolly though not quite as boring as doing nothing at all even cooking and cleaning were not as boring as nothing at all but the opportunities were limited some cooking smells drove wan to take refuge in the landeror more often to stamp and rage at her laundry was easy involving only putting their garments in a sort of pressure cooker that forced hot steam through them but then as they dried they raised the humidity of the air and that too was cause for stamping and raging he never really hit herwell not counting what he probably thought of as amorous playbut he scared her a lot he did not scare her as much as the black holes they visited one after another they scared wan too fear did not keep him from going on it only made him even more impossible to live with when dolly realized that this whole mad expedition was only a hopeless search for wans longlost and surely longdead father she felt real tenderness for him she wished he would let her express it there were times when especially after sex especially on those rare occasions when he did not at once either go to sleep or drive her away from him with some cutting and unforgivably critical intimate remarkthose times when for a few minutes at least they would hold each other in silence then she would feel a great yearning to make human contact with him there were times when she wanted to put her lips to his ear and whisper wan i know how you feel about your father i wish i could help but of course she never dared the other thing she never dared do was to tell him that in her opinion he was going to kill them bothuntil they came to the eighth hole and she had no choice even two days away from ittwo days in fasterthanlight travel nearly a lightyear in distanceit was different why is it funnylooking she demanded and wan not even looking around as he hunched before the screen only said what she expected shut up then he went on gabbling with his dead men once he realized she could speak neither spanish nor chinese he talked with them openly before her but not in a language intelligible to her no please honey she said a sick feeling in her stomach its all wrong why wrong she could not have said the object on the screen was tiny it was not very clear and it jiggled about the screen but there was no sign of the quick coruscations of energy as stray wisps of matter destroyed themselves as infall yet there was something to see a swimmy sort of blue radiance that was certainly not black pah he said sweating and then because he was scared as well he ordered tell the bitch what she wants in english mrs walthers the voice was hesitant and faint it was a dead persons voice all right if a persons at all i was explaining to wan that this is what is called a naked singularity that means it is not rotating therefore it is not exactly black wan have you compared it with the heechee charts he grumbled of course foolish i was just about to do so but his voice was shaking as he touched the controls next to the image itself another image formed there was the bluish cloudy eyestraining object and there on the other half of the screen the same object with around it a cluster of bright short red lines and flickering green circles the dead man said with dismal satisfaction it is a danger object wan the heechee have tagged it so idiot fool all black holes are dangerous he snapped off the speaker and turned to dolly with anger and contempt youre frightened too he accused and stomped off to the stolen and frightening gadgets in the lander it was not consoling to doily to see that wan was also shaking she waited staring hopelessly at the screen for the mindtouch that would be wans exploratory reaching with the tpt it was a long wait because the tpt did not work at interstellar distances and she slept in fits and woke to peer into the lander hatch to see wan unmoving crouched by the glittering mesh and the diamondbright corkscrew and slept again she was asleep when her dreams were interrupted by the hating fearing obsessed stab of wans troubled mind through the tpt and no more than half awake when he flung himself back into the main cabin and stood over her a person he gabbled his eyes blinking wildly as sweat streamed into them from his forehead now i must reach inside and meanwhile i was dreaming of a deep steep gravitational hole and a treasure concealed in it while wan was deploying his stolen gadgets sweating with terror i was sweating with pain while dolly was staring wonderingly at the great ghostly blue object on her screen i was staring at the same object she had never seen it before i had i had a picture of it over my bed and i had taken that picture at a time when i hurt even more and was even more disoriented i tried to sit up and essies strong gentle hand pushed me back are still on lifesupport systems robin she scolded must not move around too much i was in the little hospice chamber we had built onto the house at tappan sea when it began to seem too much trouble to go to some clinic every time one of us needed repairs how did i get here i managed by airplane how else she leaned past me to study something on the screen over my head and nodded ive had the operation i deduced that son of a bitch albert knocked me out you flew me home while i was still under how clever yes is all over doctor says you are healthy peasant pig and will recover quickly she went on only with bellyache continuing awhile because of two point three meters new intestine eat now then sleep some more i leaned back while essie fussed with the chef program and stared at the holopic it was put there to remind me no matter how unpleasant the tinkering that was going on to keep me alive that there had been times far more unpleasant still but that wasnt what it was reminding me of what it was reminding me of was a woman i had lost i will not say i had not thought of her for years because that would be untrue i thought of her oftenbut as a remote memory and now i was thinking of her as a person time now essiecaroled merrily for nourishing fish broth by god she wasnt fooling that was what it was nauseoussmelling but she said laced with all the things i needed and could tolerate in my present condition and meanwhile wan was fishing in the black hole with the clever and complicated machinery of the heechee and meanwhile it had just occurred to me that the sickening stuff i was eating was laden with more than medicine and meanwhile the clever machinery was performing a separate task wan did not know about and meanwhile i forced myself awake enough to ask essie how long i had been asleep and how much longer i could expect to be and she was saying quite some time both ways dear robin and then i was asleep again the separate task was notification for of all the heechee artifacts the disruptor of order in aligned systems was the one the heechee worried about most improperly used they feared it could disrupt their own order decisively and nastily and so each one had a builtin alarm when you fear that somebody may sneak up on you in the dark you set snaresa dragline of clashing tin pans on a tripcord or a boobytrap to crash down on an intruders head whatever and there is no greater dark than the dark between the stars so the heechee set up their earlywarning sentinels the snares the heechee had set were numerous supple and very very loud when wan deployed his corkscrew it was signaled at once and at once was when captains communications officer reported it to him the alien has done it he said muscles writhing and captain uttered a biological expletive in translation it would not sound like much to a human being because it referred to the act of sexual coupling at a time when the female was not in love captain didnt say it for its technical meaning he said it because it was violently obscene and because nothing less would relieve his feelings when he saw that twice started nervously as she leaned to her remotecontrol board he was instantly contrite captain had the most worries because he was captain but it was twice who had most of the work she was operating three remotes at once the command ship they were about to transfer to the cargo hauler for hiding the sailship away and a special drone in the earth planetary system commanded to survey all transmissions and locate all spaceborne artifacts and she was in no condition for any of this the time of loving had come on her steroids flowed briskly through her wiry veins the biological program was running and her body had ripened for its job not just her body twices personality ripened too and softened the strain of trying to guide her drones with a body and nervous system that was tuned for a season of preoccupying sexual coupling was torture captain leaned toward her are you all right he asked she didnt answer that was answer enough he sighed and turned to the next problem well shoe the communications officer looked almost as distraught as twice a few conceptual correspondences have been established captain he reported but the translation program is very far from complete captain twitched his cheek muscles was there any unexpected illogical thing that could go wrong that had not gone wrong already these communicationsnot only was it dangerous that they could exist in the first place but they were in several languages several not just two as was right and proper in the heechee scheme of things not just the language of do and the language of feel as the heechee themselves spoke but in literally scores of mutually incomprehensible tongues it might have eased the pain of hearing this endless blab of chatter i at least he had been able to find out what they were saying so many worries and problems not just the visible sight of twice getting weaker and more erratic every hour not just the terrible shock of knowing that some nonheechee creature was activating the mechanisms that could pierce a black hole the biggest worry for captain was whether or not he was capable of dealing with all these consequential challenges meanwhile there was a job to be done they located the sailship and homed in on it no problem they dispatched a message to its crew but wisely did not wait for an answer the commpnd ship wakened out of its millennialong powereddown sleep turned up on schedule they transferred themselves lock to lock to the bigger more powerful vessel that too was almost no problem though twice gasping and whimpering as she raced from board to board was slow in taking over her remotecommand functions in the new ship no harm done though and the lumbering cargo bubble also appeared where it was supposed to and even when the whole process took nearly twelve hours for twice they were hours of unremitting toil captain had less to do which left him plenty of time to keep an eye on her he watched her coppery skin turn purple with unfulfilled amorousness even while it was darkening with fatigue it worried him they had been so unready for all these challenges if they had known there was going to be an emergency he could easily have shipped an extra drone operator to share twices burden if they had dreamed it would be necessary they could have taken a command vessel in the first place and spared the strain of changing ships if they had thoughtif they had suspectedif they had had any intimation at all but they hadnt really iiow could they even by galactic time it had been only a few decades since the last peek outside the hiding place at the coreonly a wink in astronomical time and how could anyone have believed that so much could happen in it captain rummaged through food packets until he found the tastiest and easiest to digest and fed them affectionately to twice at her board she had little appetite her movements were slower less sure more difficult for her every hour but she was getting the job done when at last the photon ships sails had been furled the great maw of the bubble vessel was open the mothlike capsule that carried the sailship passengers slipping slowly into the bubble captain began to breathe freely again for twice at least that was the hardest part of what they would have to do now she would have a chance to restmaybe even a chance to do with him what her body and soul were overready to do because the sailship people had responded to his message instantly for them it was instantlytheir reply came before the great gleaming sphere had closed on them the communications officer shoe keyed his screen and the message appeared we accept that we must not complete our voyage we request that you convey us to a place where we will be safe we query are the assassins returning the heechee left only small scout ships for human beings to discover they were careful not to leave their specialpurpose spacecraft where they were easily located for example the bubble transport this was nothing more than a hollow metal sphere fitted with fasterthanlight drive and navigation equipment the heechee apparently used it to move bulk materials from place to place the human race could have used it very well indeed each bubble transport could hold the equivalent of a thousand s yaclass transports ten of them could have solved earths population problem in a decade captain shrugged with sympathy to shoe he said transmit to them we are returning you to your home system for the time being if possible we will bring you back here later shoes expression was strained with a mixture of emotions what about their query about the assassins captain felt a quick shudder in his abdomen tell them not yet he said but it was not the fear of the other ones that was uppermost in captains mind not even his concern for twice the heechee shared with the human race an astonishing number of traits curiosity malefemale love family solidarity devotion to children a pleasure in the manipulation of symbols the magnitude of the shared traits was not always the same however there was one psychological characteristic that the heechee possessed in a far stronger degree than most humans conscience the heechee were almost physically incapable of repudiating an obligation or letting a wrong go unrighted for the heechee the sailship people were a special case the heechee owed them it was from them that they had learned the most frightening fact the heechee had ever had to face the heechee and the sailship people had known each other well but not recently and not for very long the relationship had begun badly for the sailship people for the heechee it had ended even worse it was not possible for either of them ever to forget the other in the slow gurgling eddas the sailship people sang it was told how the coneshaped landing vessels of the heechee had suddenly appeared ternbly hard and terribly swift in the sweet slush of their home the heechee ships had flashed about the floating arcologies of the people with much cavitation and significant local temperature rises many had died much damage had been done before the heechee understood that these were sentient and even civilized beings if slow ones the heechee were terribly shocked at what they had done they tried to make amends the first step was communication and that was difficult the task took a very long timelong at least for the heechee though the time for the sludge dwellers was bewilderingly short before a hard hot octahedral prism slid itself cautiously into the middle of an arcology almost at once it began to speak to them in a recognizable though laughably ungrammatical form of their own language after that events moved with blinding speedfor the slush dwellers for the heechee watching them in their daily lives was a lot like watch ing lichens grow captain himself had visited their great gasgiant planet not a captain then almost what could have been called a cabin boy young yeasty adventurous with that considerable if cautious heechee optimism for the boundless future that had collapsed on them so terrifyingly the gas giant was not the only marvelously exciting place the young heechee visited he visited earth and met the australopithecines he helped chart gas clouds and quasars he ferried crews to outposts and construction projects years passed decades passed the slow work of translating the sludge dwellers communications inched forward it could have gone a little faster if the heechee had thought it particularly important but they did not it couldnt have gone very much faster in any case because the sludge dwellers couldnt but it was interesting in an antiquarian touristy sort of way because the sludge dwellers had been around for a long long time their chill biochemistry was something like three hundred times slower than a heechees or a humans heechee recorded history went back five or six millenniamore or less the same as humanitys at the same stage in technological evolution the recorded history of the sludge dwellers went back three hundred times as far there were nearly two million years of consecutive dated historical data the earliest folk tales and legends and eddas were ten times earlier still they were no harder to translate than the later ones because the slush dwellers did not move very fast even in the evolution of their language but the massed minds who translated them judged them not very interesting they put the work of translating them off until they discovered that two of them spoke of visitations from space when i think of all those years the human race labored under the galling knowledge of inferioritybecause the heechee had done so much more than we had and done it so much earlieri have many regrets i think i regret most that we didnt know about the two eddas i dont mean just knowing the eddas themselves for they would only have given us one more thing to worry about though a reassuringly remote one i mean mostly what they did to the heechee morale the first song was from the very dawn of the slush dwellers civilization and quite ambiguous it was a visitation of the gods they came shining so brightly that even the slushers rudimentary optics could perceive themshining with such a turbulence of energy that they caused the soupy gases to seethe and boil and many died they did no more than that and when they went away they never returned the song itself didnt mean much it had no details that the heechee found believable robin doesnt tell much about the sailship people mostly because he didnt then know much but thats a pity theyre interesting their language was made up of words of one syllable one consonant one vowel they had some fifty distinguishable consonants and fourte en vowels and diphthongs to play with therefore they had for threesyllable units such as names x combinations that was plenty especially for names because that was orders of magnitude more males than they had ever had to give names to and they didnt name the females when a male impregnated a female he produced a male child he only did it rarely because it cost him a great investment of energy unfertilized females produced females more or less routinely bearing males however cost them their lives they didnt know thator anything else really there are no love stories in the eddas of the sallship people and most of it was about a certain urslusher hero who dared defy the visitors and came to rule a whole soggy sector of their planet as a reward but the second song was more specific it dated from millions of years lateralmost within the historical period it sang once more of visitors from outside the dense home world but this time they were not mere tourists they werent conquerors either they were refugees they plunged down to the soggy surface one shipload of them it seemed poorly equipped to survive in an environment that was cold dense poison for them they hid there they stayed for a long time by their standardsmore than a hundred years long enough for the slush dwellers to discover them and even to establish a kind of communication they had been attacked by alien assassins that flamed like fire wielding weapons that crushed and burned their home planet had been flamed clean every vessel they owned in space had been pursued and destroyed and then when generations of the refugees had managed to survive and even multiply it all came to an end the flaming assassins found them and boiled a whole huge shallow of the sludgy methane sea dry to destroy them when the heechee heard this song they might have taken it for fable except for one term the term was not easy to translate for it had had to survive both the incomplete communications with the refugees and the lapse of two million years but it had survived it was what caused the heechee to stop everything they did so that they could concentrate on a single task the verification of the old edda they sought out the home of the fugitives and found ita planet scorched bare by a sun that had exploded they sought for and found artifacts of previous spacegoing civilizations not many none in good condition but nearly forty separate bits and pieces of halfmelted machines and they isotopedated them to two separate epochs one of them coincided in time with the fugitives who fled to the slush planet the other was many millions of years older they concluded that the stories were true there had been such a race of assassins they had wiped out every spacefaring civilization they had discovered for more than twenty million years and the heechee came to believe that they were still somewhere around for the term that had been so hard to translate described the expansion of the heavens and the reversal by the flamewielders so that all the stars and galaxies would crush together again for a purpose and it was impossible to believe that these titans whoever they were would not linger to see the results of the process they had begun and the bright heechee dream crumbled and the slush dwellers sang a new edda the song of the heechee who visited learned to be afraid and ran away so the heechee set their boobytraps hid most of the other evidence of their existence and retreated to their hideyhole at the core of the galaxy in one sense the sludge dwellers were just one of the boobytraps ladzhari knew that they all did that was why he had followed the ancestral commpndment and reported that first touch of another mind on his he expected an answer though it had been years even in ladzharis time since there had been a heechee manifestation of any kind and then only the quick touch of a routine tpt survey he had also expected that when the answer came he would not like it the whole epic struggle of building and launching the interstellar ship the centuries already invested in their millenniumlong journeywasted it was true that a flight of a thousand years to ladzhari was no more than an ordinary whaling voyage for a nantucket captain but a whaler would not have liked being picked up in midpacific and taken home empty either the whole crew had been upset the excitement in the sailship had been so great that some of the crew involuntarily went into fast mode the sludgy liquid was so churned that cavitation bubbles formed one of the females was dead one of the males tsutsunga was so demoralized that he was pawing over the surviving females and not for dinner either please dont be foolish ladzhari pleaded for a male to impregnate a female as tsutsunga seemed about to do involved so large an investment of energy that sometimes it threatened his life for the females there was no threattheir lives were simply forfeited in order to bear a fertilized childbut they didnt know that of course or much of anything else really but tsulsunga said steadily if i cannot become immortal by voyaging to another star then at least i will father a son no please think my friend begged ladzhari we can be home if we wish can return as heroes to our arcologies can sing our eddas so the entire world will hear for the sludge of their homes carried sound as well as a sea and their songs reached as far as a great whales tsutsunga touched ladzhari briefly almost contemptuously at least dismissively were not heroes he said go away and let me do this female and ladzhari reluctantly released him and listened to the dwindling sounds as he moved away it was true they were failed heroes at best robin does not explain very well what the heechee were afraid of they had deduced that the purpose of causing the universe to contract again was to return it to the primordial atom after which it would burst in another big bang and start a new universe they further deduced that in that case the physical laws that govern the universe might develop in a different way what scared them most was the thought of beings who thought they would be happier in a universe with different physical laws the sailship people were not without such human traits as pride it did not please them to be the heecheeswhat slaves not exactly for the only service they were required to perform was to report via sealedbeam communicator any evidence of other spacefaring intelligence they were very glad to do that for their own sakes more than for the heechees if not slaves then what there was only one word that was right pets so the racial psyche of the slush dwellers contained a patch of tarnish they could never burnish away with whatever feats of interstellar venturing they might accomplish in their vast slow staijammers they knew they were pets it was not the first time for them long before the heechee caine they had been chattels in almost the same way to beings quite unlike the heechee or humans or themselves and when generations before their soothsingers had roared the ancient eddas about those others into the heechee listening machine the slush dwellers had not failed to notice that the heechee ran away a pet was not the worst thing one could be so love and fear were abroad in the universe for love tsutsunga damaged his health and risked his life dreaming of love i lay in my hospice waking less than an hour every day while my storebought innards reconciled themselves to the rest of me terrified by love captain saw twice grow thinner and darker for twice had not got better once the cargo bubble was en route the surcease had come too late the closest thing they had to a medical specialist was burst the blackhole operator but even at home even with the finest care few females could survive unrequited love combined with terrible strain it was no surprise to captain when burst appeared hangdog pitying and said im sorry she is joining the massed minds it is not a cheap commodity love some of us can have it and never face the bill but only if someone else picks up the check the new albert everyone conspired against meeven the wife of my bosomeven my trusted dataretrieval program in the brief moments they allowed me to be awake they gave me a free choice you can go to the clinic for a complete checkup said albert sucking judiciously at his pipe or can stay the damn hell asleep until are damn sure you are all better said essie ahha i said i thought so youve been keeping me unconscious havent you its probably been days since you knocked me out and let them cut me open essie avoided my eyes i said nobly i dont blame you for that but dont you see i want to go look at this thing waithers found cant you understand that she was still not meeting my eyes she glowered at the hologram of albert einstein seems damn peppy today you keeping this khuligan tranked up good alberts image coughed actually mrs broadhead the medical program advised against any unnecessary sedation at this point oh god will be awake bothering us day and night that settles it you robin you go to clinic tomorrow and all the time she was snarling at me her hand was on the back of my neck caressing words can be liars but you can feel the touch of love so i said ill meet you halfway ill go to the clinic for the complete physical on condition that if i pass you dont give me any more arguments about going into space essie was silent calculating but albert cocked an eyebrow at me i think that might be a mistake robin thats what us human beings are for to make mistakes now whats for dinner you see i bad calculated that if i showed a happy appetite they would take it as a good sign and maybe they did i had also calculated that my new ship wouldnt be ready for several weeks anyway so there was no real hurryi wasnt about to take off in another cramped smelly five when i had a yacht of my own coming along what i had not calculated on was that i had forgotten how much i hated hospitals when albert examined me he measured my temperature bolometrically scanned my eyes for clarity and my skin for external blemishes like burst blood vessels pumped hypersound through my torso to peer at the organs inside and sampled the contributions i left in the toilets for biochemical imbalances and bacteria counts albert called these procedures noninvasive i called them polite the diagnostic procedures at the clinic didnt bother to be polite they werent really painful they numbed the surface of my skin before going much farther and once you get inside the surface there arent that many nerve endings to worry about all i really felt were tweaks and pokes and tickles but a lot of them and besides i knew what they were doing hairthin light pipes were peering around the inside of my belly needlesharp pipettes were sucking out plugs of tissue for analysis siphons were sipping up my bodily fluids sutures were checked scars were appraised the whole thing took less than an hour but it seemed longer and honestly id rather have been doing something else then they let me put my clothes back on and i was allowed to sit down in a comfortable chair in the presence of a reallive human doctor they even let essie sit in but i didnt give her a chance to talk i got in first what do you say doe i asked how long after the operation can i go into space i dont mean rockets i mean a lofstrom loop about as traumatic as an elevator you see the loop just sort of pulls you along on a magnetized ribbon the doctor held up his hand he was a plump whitehaired santa claus of a man with a neat closetrimmed white beard and bright blue eyes i know what a lofstrom loop is good im glad of that well well he said the usual practice after surgery such as yours is to avoid anything like that for three to four weeks but oh no doc no i said please i dont want to have to hang around for practically a month he looked at me and he looked at essie essie wouldnt meet his eyes either he smiled mr broadhead he said i think you should know two things the first is that it is often desirable to keep a convalescent patient unconscious for some time with electrically stimulated muscle exercise massage good diet and proper nursing care there is no impairment of function and its a lot easier on the patients nervous system and everybody elses too yes yes i said not very interested whats the other thing the other thing is that you were operated on fortythree days ago this morning you can do just about anything you want to now including taking a ride on a loop time was when the road to the stars led through guiana or baikonur or the cape you had to burn about a million dollars worth of liquid hydrogen to get into orbit before you could transship to something going farther away now we had the lofstrom launch loops spaced around the equator immense gossamer structures that you couldnt see until you were almost beside themwell within twenty kilometers which was where the satellite landing field was i watched it with pleasure and pride as we circled and descended to touchdown in the seat beside me essie was frowning and muttering to herself as she worked on some projecta new kind of computer programing or maybe a pension plan for her big chon employees i couldnt tell which because she was doing it in russian on the pulldown console in front of me albert was displaying my new ship rotathg the image slowly while he recited the statistics of capacity accessories mass and amenities since i had put quite a few million dollars and a lot of my time into that plaything i was interested but not as interested as i was in what was coming next later albert i ordered and obediently he winked out i craned my neck to keep the loop in view as we entered final approach faintly along the top of the skijump launch section i could see capsules speeding up through three gravities acceleration and neatly gently detaching themselves at the steepest part of the upslope to disappear into the blue beautiful no chemicals no combustion no damage to the ozone layer not even the energywastage of a heechee lander launch some things we could do even better than the heechee did time was when even being in orbit was not enough and then you had to take the long slow hohmann journey to the gateway asteroid usually you were scared out of your bird because everybody knew that more gateway prospectors got killed than got rich and because you were space sick and cramped and condemned to inhabit that interplanetary slammer for weeks or months on end before you even got to the asteroid and most of all because youd risked everything you owned or could borrow to pay for it now we had a heechee three chartered and waiting for us in lowearth orbit we could transship in our shirtsleeves and be on our way to the far stars before wed finished digesting our last meal on earththat is we could because we had the muscle and the money to pay for it time was when going out into that interstellar nothingness was a lot like playing russian roulette the only difference was that if the luck of the draw was favorable whatever you found at the end of the journey might make you rich beyond richness foreveras it ultimately did me but what you mostly got made was dead is much better now essie sighed as we climbed down out of the aircraft and blinked around in the hot south american sun now where is damn courtesy van from crummy fleabag hotel i did not comment on her reading my mind after all the time we had been married i was used to it anyway it wasnt telepathy it was what any human being would think if he were doing what we were doing at that time i wish audee waithers were going with us i said looking out at the launch loop we were still kilometers away on the far shore of lake tehigualpa i could see the loop reflected in it blue at the center of the lake greenyyellow near the shore where they had sown edible algae and it was a pretty sight if you wanted him with you should not have given him two mil to chase his wife with said essie practically and then looking at me more closely how you feeling absolutely in the pink i said it wasnt far from true quit worrying about me when youve got full medical plus they dont dare let you die before you reach a hundredits bad for business dont have much to say about it she said gloomily when customer is reckless desperado who spends time chasing for makebelieve heecheet anyway she added brightening here is van for fleabag hop in so when we were inside the van i leaned over and kissed the back of her neckeasy to do because she had braided her long hair and brought it around her neck to tie in front like a kind of a necklacegetting ready for the launch you see she leaned against my lips khuligan she sighed but not bad khuligan the hotel wasnt really a fleabag they had given us a comfortable suite on the top floor looking over the lake and the loop besides we would only be in it for a few hours i left essie to key in her programs on the hotel pv screen while i wandered over to the window telling myself indulgently that i wasnt really a hooligan but that wasnt true because it certainly was not the act of a responsible senior citizen of wealth and substance to skylark off into interstellar space just for the glamour and excitement of it it occurred to me then that essie might not be taking quite that view of my motives she might think i was after something else it then occurred to me that maybe my own view was wrong was it really the heechee i was looking for sure it was or anyway could be everybody was desperately curious about the heechee but not everybody had left something else out in interstellar space was it possible that somewhere in the downdeep hidden part of my mind what was driving me out and on was the hope that somehow somewhere i might find that misplaced thing again i knew what the thing was i knew where i had left it what i didnt know was what i would do with itor more accurately herif i found her again and then i felt a sort of quivery notquitepain in my middle it had nothing to do with my two point three meters of new gut what it had to do with was the hope or the fear that somehow gelleklara moynlin might indeed turn up in my life again there was more emotion left over there than i had realized it made my eyes tear so the spidery launch structure out the window seemed to ripple in my sight but there were no tears in my eyes and it wasnt an optical illusion my god i shouted essie and she hurried over to stand beside me and look at the tiny flare of light from a capsule on the launch run and the shaking shuddering of the whole threadthin structure then there was the noisea single faint blast like a distant cannon shot and then the lower slower longer thunder of the immense loop tearing itself apart my god essie echoed faintly clutching my arm terrorist and then she answered herself of course terrorist she said bitterly who else could be so vile i had opened our windows to get a good look at the lake and the loop good thing because that meant they werent blown in others in the hotel were not so lucky the airport itself wasnt touched not counting the occasional aircraft sent flying because it wasnt tied down but the airport officials were scared they didnt know whether the destruction of the launch loop was an isolated incident of terrorist sabotage or maybe the beginnings of a revolutionno one seemed to think ever that it might have been just a simple accident it was scary all right theres a hell of a lot of kinetic energy stored in a lofstrom loop over twenty kilometers of iron ribbon weighing about five thousand tons moving at twelve kilometers a second out of curiosity i asked albert later and he reported that it took x lo joules to pump it up and when one collapses all those joules come out at once one way or another i asked albert later because i couldnt ask him then naturally the first thing i did was to try to key him up or any other dataretrieval or information program that could tell me what was going on the comm circuits were jammed we were cut off the broadcast pv was still working though so we stood and watched that mushroom cloud grow and listened to damage reports one shuttle had been actually accelerating on the ribbon when it blewthat was the first explosion perhaps because it had carried a bomb three others had been in the loading bypass more than two hundred human beings were now hamburger not counting the ones they hadnt counted yet who had been working on the launcher itself or had been in the dutyfree shops and bars underneath it or maybe just out for a stroll nearby i wish i could get albert i grumbled to essie as to that dear robin she began hesitantly but didnt finish because there was a knock on the door would the seсor and the seсora come at once to the bolivar room por favor as there was a matter of the gravest emergency the matter of the gravest emergency was a police checkup and you never saw such a checking of passports the bolivar room was one of those function things that they divide up for meetings and open for grand banquets and one partitionedoff part of it was filled with turistas like us many of them squatting on their baggage all looking both resentful and scared they were being kept waiting we were not the bellhop who fetched us wearing an armband with the initials ser over his uniform escorted us to the dais where a lieutenant of police studied our passports briefly and then handed them back seсor broadhead he said in english accent excellent touches of american midwest does it occur to you that this act of terrorist violence may in fact have been aimed personally at you i gawked not until now i managed he nodded nevertheless he went on touching a pv hardcopy printout with his small graceful hand we have received from interpol a report of a terrorist attempt on your life only two months ago quite a wellorganized one the commissaris in rotterdain specifically suggests that it did not appear random and that further attempts might well be made i didnt know what to say to that essie leaned forward tell me teniente she said regarding him is this your theory ah my theory i wish i had a theory he said furiously terrorists no doubt aimed against you possibly aimed against the stability of our government even more possibly i think as there has been widespread dissatisfaction in rural areas there are even reports i tell you in confidence that certain military units may be planning a coup how can one know so i ask you the necessary questions such as have you seen anyone whose presence here struck you as suspicious or coincidental no have you any opinion as to who attempted to assassinate you in rotterdam can you shed any light at all on this terrible deed the questions came so fast that it hardly seemed he expected answers or even wanted them that bothered me nearly as much as the destruction of the loop itself it was a reflection here of what i had been seeing and sensing all over the world a sort of despairing resignation as though things were bound to get worse and no way could be found to get them better it made me very uncomfortable wed like to leave and get out of your way i said so if youre through with your questions he paused before he answered and began to look like someone with a job he knew how to do again i had intended to ask you a favor seсor broadhead is it possible that you would allow us to borrow your aircraft for a day or two it is for the wounded he explained since our own general hospital was unfortunately in the direct path of the loop cables i am ashamed to say i hesitated but essie did not most certainly yes teniente she said especially as we will need to make a reservation for another loop in any event before we know where we want to go to he beamed that my dear seсora we can arrange for you through the military communications and my deepest thanks for your generosity services in the city were falling apart but when we got back to our suite there were fresh flowers on the tables and a basket of fruits and wine that had not been there before the windows had been closed when i opened them i found out why lake tehigualpa wasnt a lake anymore it was just the heat sink where the ribbon was supposed to dump in case of the catastrophic failure of the loop that no one believed would ever happen now that it had happened the lake had boiled down to a mud wallow fog obscured the loop itself and there was a stink of cooked mud that made me close the window again quickly enough we tried room service it worked they served us a really nice dinner apologizing only because they couldnt send the wine steward up to decant our clarethe was in los servicias emergencias de la republica and had had to report for duty so had the suites regular ladies maid and although they promised that a regular floor maid would be up in an hour to unpack the bags for us meanwhile they stood against the walls in the foyer im rich all right but im not spoiled at least i dont think i am but i do like service especially the service of the fine computer programs essie has written for me ovej the years i miss albert i said looking out at the foggy nighttime scene can find nothing to do without your toys eh scoffed essie but she seemed to have something on her mind well im not spoiled about tha either but when essie seems to have something on her mind i often conclude that she wants to make love and from there it is not usually much of a jump for me to want to too i remind myself now and then that for most of human history persons of our ages would have been a lot less azuative and exuberant about itbut thats just bad luck for them such thoughts do not slow me down especially because essie is what she is besides her nobel laureate essie had been receiving other awards including appearing on lists of ten bestdressed women every now and then the nobel was deserved the bestdressed was in my opinion a fraud the way s ya broadhead looked had nothing to do with what she put on but a lot to do with what was under what she put on what she was wearing right now was a skintight leisure suit pale blue unornamented you could buy them in any discount house and she would have won in that too come here a minute why dont you i said from the great long couch sex fiend huh but it was a fairly tolerant huh i just thought i said that as i cant get albert and we have nothing else to do oh you robin she said shaking her head but she was smiling she pursed her lips thinking then she said i tell you what you go fetch small traveling bag from foyer i have little present to give you then we see out of the bag came a box silverpaper wrapped and inside it a big heechee prayer fan it wasnt really heechee of course it was the wrong size it was one of the kind essie had developed for her own use you remember dead men and here after she said very good heechee software which i decided to steal so have converted old dataretrieval program for you have in hand now guaranteed real albert einstein i turned the fan over in my hands the real albert einstein oh robin so literal not realreal cannot revive dead especially so long dead but real in personality memories thoughtspretty near anyway programed search of every scrap of einstein data books papers correspondence biographies interviews pictures everything even cracked old film clips from what you called them newsreels on ship coming to new york city in ad by pathй news all inputted to here and now when you talk to albert einstein it is albert einstein who talks back she leaned over and kissed the top of my head then to be sure she bragged added some features real albert einstein never had complete pilotage of heechee vessels all update in science and technology since ad time of actual einstein passing on even some simpler functions from cook secretary lawyer medical programs was no room for sigfrid von shrink she apologized but then you no longer need shrinkage eh robin except for unaccountable lapse of memory she was looking at me with an expression that over the past couple of decades i had come to recognize i reached out and pulled her toward me all right essie lets have it she settled down in my lap and asked innocently have what robin you talking about sex again come on oh it is nothing to be sure i have already given you your silver gift what the program it was true that she had wrapped it in silver paperenlightenment exploded oh my god i missed our silver wedding anniversary didnt i when but thinking fast i bit the question off when was it she finished for me why now is still is today robin many congratulations and happy returns robin dear i kissed her i admit as much stalling for time as anything else and she kissed me back seriously i said feeling abject essie dear im really sorry when we get back ill get you a gift that will make your hair stand on end i promise but she pressed her nose against my lips to stop my talking is no need to promise dear robin she said from about the level of my adams apple for you have given me ample gifts every day for twentyfive years now not counting couple years when we just fooled around even of course she added lifting her head to look at me we are alone at this moment just you and me and bed in next room and will be for some hours yet so if you truly wish to make hair stand on end with gift would be pleased to accept happen to know you have something for me even in my size the fact that i didnt want any breakfast brought all of essies standby systems up to full alert but i explained it by saying that i wanted to play with my new toy that was true it was also true that i didnt always eat breakfast anyway and those two truths sent essie off to the dining hail without me but the final truth that my gut did not really feel all that good was the one that counted so i plugged the new albert in to the processor and there was a quick pinkish flare and there he was beaming out at me hello robin he said and happy anniversary that was yesterday i said a little disappointed i had not expected to catch the new albert in silly mistakes he rubbed the stem of his pipe across his nose twinkling up at me under those bushy white eyebrows in hawaiian mean time he said it is let me seehe faked looking at a digital wristwatch that was anachronistically peeking out under his frayed pajamatop sleeve fortytwo minutes after eleven at night robin and your twentyfifth wedding anniversary has still nearly twenty minutes to go he leaned forward to scratch his ankle i have a good number of new features he said proudly including full running time and location circuits which operate whether i am in display mode or not your wife is really very good at this you know now i know that albert einstein is only a computer program but all the same it was like welcoming an old friend youre looking particularly well i complimented i dont know if you should be wearing a digital watch though i dont believe you ever had such a thing before you died because they didnt exist he looked a little sulky but he complimented me in return you have an excellent grasp of the history of technology robin however although i am albert einstein as near as may be to the real thing i am not limited to the real albert einsteins capabilities mrs broadhead has included in my program all known heechee records for example and that fleshandblood self didnt even know the heechee existed also i have subsumed into me the programs of most of our colleagues as well as dataseeking circuits that are presently engaged in trying to establish connection with the gigabit net in that robin he said apologetically i have not been successful but i have patched into the local military circuits your launch from lagos nigeria is confirmed for noon tomorrow and your aircraft will be returned to you in time to make the connection he frowned is something wrong i hadnt been listening to albert as much as studying him essie had done a remarkable job there were none of those little lapses where he would start a sentence with a pipe in his hand and finish by gesturing with a piece of chalk you do seem more real albert thank you he said showing off by pulling open a drawer of his desk to get a match to light his pipe in the old days he would have just materialized a book of matches perhaps youd like to know more about your ship i perked up any progress since we landed if there were he apologized i wouldnt know it because as i mentioned i have been unable to make contact with the net however i do have a copy of the certificate of commissioning from the gateway corp it is rated as a twelvethat is to say it could carry twelve passengers if equipped for simple exploration i know what a twelve would be albert to be sure in any event it has been fitted for four passengers although up to two others can be accommodated it was testflown to gateway two and back performing optimally all the way good morning mrs broadhead i looked over my shoulder essie had finished breakfast and joined us she was leaning over me to study her creation more carefully good program she complimented herself and then albert from where you get this picking nose bit albert removed a finger from a nostril forgivingly from unpublished letters enrico fermi to a relative in italy it is authentic i assure you are there any other questions no then robin and mrs broadhead he finished i suggest you pack for i have just received word over the police link that your aircraft has landed and is being serviced you can take off in two hours and so it was and so we did happily enoughor almost happily the last little bit less happily we were just getting into our plane when there was a noise from behind the passenger terminal and we turned to look why essie said wonderingly that sounds like guns firing and those big things in the parking lot see them pushing aside cars one has just now demolished a fire standpipe and water is shooting out can they be what i think i tugged her into the plane they can i said if what you think they are is army tanks lets get the hell out of here we did no problem not for us anyway even though albert listening in on the reopened gigabit net reported that the tenientes worst fears had been realized and a revolution was indeed lustily tuning up not for us then at least though elsewhere in the wide universe other things were going on that would pose for us some very large problems and some very painful ones and some that were both back from the schwarzschild discontinuity when gellekiara moynlin awoke she was not dead as she had confidently expected to be she was in a heechee exploration ship it was an armored five by the look of it but not the one she had been in at the last she remembered what she remembered was chaotic frightful and filled with pain and terror she remembered it very well it had not included this lean dark scowling man who wore a gstring and a scarf and nothing else nor had it included some strange young blond girl who was crying her eyes out in the last memory klara had there had been people crying all right oh yes and shrieking and cursing and wetting their underwear because they were trapped within the schwarzschild barrier of a black hole but none of those people were these people the young girl was bending over her solicitously are you all right hon youve been through a real bad time there was no news for kiara in that statement she knew how bad the time had been shes awake the girl called over her shoulder the man came bounding over pushing the girl aside he did not waste time inquiring about klaras health your name also orbit and mission numberquickly when she told him he didnt acknowledge the answer he simply disappeared and the blond girl came back im dolly she said im sorry im such a wreck but honestly i was scared to death are you all right you were all messed up and we dont have much of a medical program here kiara sat up and discovered that yes she was messed up all right every part of her ached starting with her head which appeared to have been bashed against something she looked around she had never been in a ship so full of tools and toys before nor one that smelled so pleasantly of cooking look where am i she asked youre in his shippointing his names wan hes been wandering around poking into black holes dolly looked as though she were getting ready to cry again but rubbed her nose and went on and listen hon im sorry but all those other people you were with are dead you were the only one alive klara caught her breath all of them even robin i dont know their names the girl apologized and was not surprised when her unexpected guest turned her bruised face away and began to sob across the room wan snarled impatiently at the two women he was deep into concerns of his own he did not know what a treasure he had retrieved or how much that retrieved treasure complicated my life for it is pretty nearly true that i married my dear wife essie on the elastic rebound from the loss of klara moynlin at least on the upsurge of feeling that came when i shed the guilt or anyway most of the guilt i felt for klaras loss when ultimately i found out that klara was alive again it was a shock but my god nothingnothing compared to the shock to klara even now and in these circumstances i cant help feeling what i can only call incongruously enough a physical pain when i think about my whilom most dear klara as she found herself back from the dead it isnt just because of who she was or who she was in relation to me she deserved the compassion of anybody trapped terrified hurt sure of dyingand then a moment later miraculously rescued god pity the poor i had not met gelleklara moynhin before her accident with the black hole robin couldnt afford as sophisticated a dataretrieval system as me in those days but i surely heard a lot about her from robin over the years what i mostly heard about was how guilty he felt over her death the two of them with others had gone on a science mission for the gateway corp to investigate a black hole most of their ships had been trapped robin had managed to get free there was no logical reason to feel guilty of course moreover gelleklara moynlin though a normally competent female human was in no sense irreplaceablein fact robin replaced her rather swiftly with a succession of other females finally bonding in a longterm mode with s ya lavorovna not only a competent human female but the one who designed me although i am well modeled on human drives and motivations there are parts of human behavior i never will understand woman god knows i do and things did not quickly get better for her she was unconscious half the time because her body had taken a terrible battering when she was awake she was not always sure she was awake from the tingling she felt and the warm flush and the buzzing in her ears she knew that they had been shooting her full of painkillers even so she ached terribly not just in the body and when she was awake she could easily have been hallucinating as far as she was able to know because the sociopath wan and the demoralized dolly were not very stable figures to cling to when she asked questions she got strange answers when she saw wan talking to a machine and asked dolly what he was doing she could make little sense of dollys reply oh those are his dead men he programed them with all the mission records and now hes asking them about you but what could that mean to someone who had never heard of dead men and what could she feel when a wispy uncertain voice from the speakers began to talk about her no wan theres nobody named schmitz on that mission either ship you see there were two ships that went out together and i do not care how many ships went out together the voice paused then uncertainly wan of course i am wan who would i be but wan oh well no theres nobody there that fits your fathers description either who did you say you rescued she claims to be named gelleklara moynlin female not very goodlooking about forty maybe wan said not even looking at her to see how wrong he was kiara stiffened and then reflected that the ordeal had no doubt made her look older than her age moynlin the voice whispered moynlin gelleklara yes she was on that mission the age is wrong though i think kiara gave a half nod causing the throb in her head to start again and then the voice went on let me see yes the name is right but she was born sixtythree years ago the throbbing increased its tempo and its violence klara must have moaned because the girl dolly cried out to wan and then leaned over her again youre going to be all right she said but im going to get henrietta to give you another little sleepy shot all right when you wake up again youll feel better kiara gazed up at her without comprehension then closed her eyes sixtythree years ago how many shocks can a human being stand without breaking kiara was not very breakable she was a gateway prospector four missions all of them tough any of them enough to give nightmares to anyone but her head throbbed furiously as she tried to think time dilation was that the term for what happened inside a black hole was it possible that twenty or thirty years had sped past in the real world while she was spinning around the deepest gravity well there was how about dolly offered hopefully if i get you something to eat klara shook her head wan nibbling his ip in a surly way lifted his head and called how foolish offering her food give her a drink instead he was not the kind of person you would want to please even by agreeing with him when he was right but it sounded like too good an idea to pass up she let dolly bring her what seemed to be straight whiskey it made her cough and splutter but it warmed her hon said dolly hesitantly was one of those you know those guys that got killed was he a special boyfriend there was no reason for kiara to deny it pretty much a boyfriend i mean we were in love i guess but wed had a fight and split up and then started to get together again and thenand then robin was in one ship and i was in another robbie no robin robin broadhead it was really robinette but he was kind of sensitive about the namewhats the matter rabin broadhead oh my god yes said dolly looking astonished and impressed the millionaire and wan looked over then came to stand beside her robin broadhead to be sure i know him well he boasted klaras mouth was suddenly dry you do of course certainly i have known him for many years yes of course he said remembering i have heard of his escape from the black hole years ago how curious that you were there too we are business partners you see i receive from him and his enterprises nearly twosevenths of my present income including the royalties paid me by his wifes companies his wife whispered kiara do you not listen i said that yes his wife and dolly suddenly gentle again said ive seen her on the pv now and then like when they pick her for the ten bestdressed women or when she won the nobel prize shes quite beautiful hon would you like another drink klara nodded starting her head to throbbing again but collected herself enough to say yes please another drink at least for nearly two days wan elected to be benevolent to the former friend of his business partner dolly was kind and tried to be helpful there was no picture of s ya in their limited pv file but dolly pulled out the hand puppets to show her what a caricature of essie at least looked like and when wan growing bored demanded she do her nightclub routine with them managed to fob him off kiara found plenty of time to think dazed and battered as she was she could still do simple arithmetic in her head she had lost more than thirty years of her life no not out of her life out of everybody elses she was no more than a day or two older than when she went into the naked singularity the backs of her hands were scratched and bruised but there were no age spots on them her voice was hoarse from pain and fatigue but it was not an old womans voice shwas not an old woman she was gelleklara moynlin not that much over thirty to whom something terrible had happened when she woke up on the second day the sharpened pains and the localized aches told her that she was no longer receiving analgesia the sullenfaced captain was bending over her open your eyes he snapped now you are well enough to work for your passag i think what an annoying creature he was still she was alive and apparently getting well and there was gratitude due that sounds reasonable enough klara offered sitting up reasonable hal you do not decide what is reasonable here i decide what is reasonable wan explained you have only one right on my ship you had the right to be rescued and i rescued you now all the other rights are mine especially as because of you we must now return to gateway lion said dolly tentatively thats not entirely true theres plenty of food not the kind of food i wish shut up so you kiara must repay me for this trouble he reached his hand behind him doily evidently understood his meaning she moved a plate of freshbaked chocolate brownies to his fingers and he took one and began to eat it gross person kiara pushed her hair out of her eyes studying him coldly how do i repay you the way she does certainly the way she does said wan chewing by helping her maintain the ship but alsooh ho haha that is funny he gasped spraying crumbs of chocolate on klara as he laughed you think i meant in bed how stupid you are klara i do not copulate with ugly older women kiara wiped the crumbs off her face as he reached for another brownie no he said seriously it is more important than that i want to know all about black holes she said trying to be placating it all happened very fast theres not much i can tell you tell what you can tell then and listen do not try to lie oh my god thought klara how much of this must i put up with and this meant more than the bullying wan it meant all of her resumed and wholly disoriented life the answer to how much turned out to be eleven days it was time enough for the worst of the bruises to fade on her arms and body time enough for her to get to know dolly walthers and pity her to know wan and despise him it was not time enough for her to figure out what to do with her life but her life did not wait until she was ready for it ready or not wans ship docked on gateway and there she was the very smells of gateway were different the noise level was differentmuch louder the people were radically different there did not seem to be a single living one among them for kiara to recognize from her last time therethirty years or not much more than thirty days in the past depending on whose clock you timed by also so many of them were in uniform lhat was quite new to klara and not at all pleasing in the old days however subjectively recent those old days wereyou saw maybe one or two uniforms a day crewpersons on leave from the fourpower guard cruisers mostly certainly you never saw one of them carrying a weapon that was not true any longer they were everywhere and they were armed debriefing had changed along with everything else it had always been a nuisance youd come back to gateway ifithy and exhausted and still scared because up until the last minute you hadnt been sure youd make it and then the gateway corp would sit you down with the evaluators and the data compilers and the accountants just what did you find what was new about it what was it worth the debriefing teams were the ones charged with answering questions like that and how they scored a flight made the difference between abject failure andonce in a great whilewealth beyond dreaming a gateway prospector needed skills simply to survive once he had closed himself into one of those unpredictable ships and launched himself on his mad magic mystery bus ride but to prosper he needed more than skills he needed a favorable report from the debriefing team debriefing had always been bad news but now it was worse there wasnt a debriefing team from the gateway corp anymore there were four debriefing teams one from each of the four guardian powers the debriefing had been moved to what had once been the asteroids principal night club and gambling casino the blue hell and there were four separate little rooms each with a flag on the door the brazilians got dolly the peoples republic of china snatched wan off the floor the american mp took klara by the arm and when the lieutenant of mps in front of the soviet cubicle frowned and patted the butt of his kalashnikov the american scowled right back his hand resting on his colt it didnt really make any difference because as soon as klara was through with the americans the brazilians took their turn with her and when you are invited somewhere by a young soldier with a sidearm it makes little difference whether it is a colt or a paz between the brazilians and the chinese klara crossed paths with wan sweating and indignant on his way from the chinese to the russians and realized she had something to be thankful for the interrogators were rude overbearing and nasty with her but they seemed to be worse with wan for reasons she didnt know each of his sessions was lasting twice as long as her own which was already very long each team in turn pointed out that she was supposed to be dead that her bank account had long since reverted to the gateway corp that there was no mission payment due her for traveling with juan henriquette santosschmitz since it was not an officially authorized gateway mission and as for any payment that might have been due for her trip to the black hole well she hadnt come back in that vessel had she with the americans she claimed at least a science bonuswhoever else had been inside a black hole they told her the matter would be taken under advisement the brazilians told her it was a matter for fourpower negotiation the chinese said it all hinged on an interpretation of the award made to robinette broadhead and the russians had no interest in that subject at all because what they wanted to know was whether wan had given any indication of terrorist leanings the debriefing took forever and then there was a medical check that took almost as long the diagnostic programs had never encountered a living human being who had been exposed to the wrenching forces behind a schwarzschild barrier before and they would not let her go until they had pinpointed every bone and ligament and helped themselves freely to samples of all the fluids she had and then they released her to the accountancy section for her statement of account it was a hardcopy chit and all it said was moynlin gellekiara current balance awards due not yet evaluated waiting outside the accountancy offices was dolly walthers looking fretful and bored howd you do hon she asked klara made a face oh thats too bad wans still in there she explained because they kept him for bloody ever in the debriefing ive been just sitting here for hours what are you going to do now i dont exactly know kiara said slowly thinking about the very limited options one had on gateway when one had no money yeah same here dolly sighed with wan you know you never know he cant stay anywhere very long because they start asking questions about some of the stuff on his ship and i dont think he got it all exactly legally she swallowed and said quickly watch it here he comes to klaras surprise when wan looked up from the chits he was studying he beamed at her ah he said my dear gelleklara i have been studying your legal position very promising indeed i think promising she glared at him with considerable dislike if you mean that theyll probably toss me out into space within the next fortyeight hours for nonpayment of bills thats not what i call promising he peered at her decided she was joking haha that is very humorous since you are not used to dealing with large sums of money permit me to recommend a banking chap i find very useful cut it out wan thats not funny of course its not funny he scowled just as in the old days and then his expression softened into incredulity can it beis it possiblehave they not told you of your claim what claim against robinette broadhead my legal johnny says you might get quite fifty percent of his assets oh bullahit wan she said impatiently not bullshit i have an excellent legal program it is the doctrine of the calf follows the cow if you understand you should have had a full share of the survivors benefits from his last mission now you should have an equal share of that and also of all that he has added to it since it came from that original capital butbut oh thats stupid she snapped im not going to sue him of course sue him what else how else can you get what is yours why i sue as many as two hundred persons a year gellekiara and there is a very large sum involved indeed do you know what broadheads net worth is much much more even than my own and then with the jolly fraternal goodfellowship of one person of wealth to another of course there may be some inconvenience for you while the matter is being adjudicated allow me to transfer a small loan from my account to yoursone moment he made the necessary entries on his statement chit yes there you are good luck so there was my lost love gelleklara moynlin more lost than ever after she had been found she knew gateway well but the gateway she knew was gone her life had skipped a beat and everything she knew or cared for or was interested in had suffered the changes of a third of a century while she like some enchanted princess in a forest had slept away the time good luck wan had said but what constituted good luck for the sleeping beauty whose prince had married someone else a small loan wan had said and it turned out that was what he had meant ten thousand dollars enough to pay her bills for a few days and then what there was thought klara the excitement of finding out some of the facts people like her had been dying for so once she had found herself a room and gotten something to eat she headed for the library it no longer contained spools of magnetic tape everything was now stored on some kind of secondgeneration heechee prayer fans and she had to hire an attendant to teach her how to use them was it worth it to kiaras disgruntled surprise not really so many questions answered and strangely so little joy in getting the answers when klara was a gateway prospector like any other the questions were literally a matter of life and death what were the meanings of the symbols on the control panels of heechee ships what settings meant death what meant reward now here were the answers not all of them perhapsthere was still not much clue to that great shuddery question of who the heechee were in the first place but thousands upon thousands of answers even answers to questions no one had known enough to ask thirty years before but the answers gave her little pleasure the questions lost their urgency when you knew the answers were in the back of the book the one class of questions whoђe answers held her interest was i know me robinette broadhead oh surely there was much data on him in store yes he was married yes he was still alive and even well unforgivably he gave every indication of being happy almost as bad he wasokl hewasnotwizenedordecrepit of course andhisscalpstillhad all its hair and his face was wrinklefree but that was just full medical plus unfailing purveyor of health and youth to those who could afford it robinette broadhead could obviously afford anything but he was older all the same there was a solid thickness to the neck an assurance to the smile that looked out at her from the pv image that had not been part of the frightened confused man who had broken her tooth and sworn to love her always so now kiara had a quantitative estimate for one more term always it meant a period substantially less than thirty years when she bad depressed herself sufficiently in the brary she roamed about gateway to see what changes had occurred the asteroid had become more impersonal and more civilized there were many commercial enterprises on gateway now a supermarket a fastfood franchise a stereotheater a health club handsome new tourist pensions glittering souvenir shops there was plenty to do on gateway now but not for kiara the only thing that attracted her interest really was the gainbling casino in the spindle replacement for the old blue hell but such luxuries she could not afford she could not afford much of anything really and she was depressed the lady magazines of her adolescence had been full of giggly little tricks to combat depressionwhat they called the blahs clean your sink call somebody on the pv wash your hair but she had no sink and who was there to call on gateway after she bad washed her hair for the third time she began to think of the blue hell again a few small bets she decided would do no harm to her budget even if she lostit would only mean really giving up a few luxuries for a bit in eleven spins of the roulette wheel she was penniless a party of gabonian tourists was just leaving laughing and stumbling and behind them at the short narrow bar klara saw dolly she walked over to her steadily and said would you like to buy me a drink you bet said dolly unenthusiastically waving to the barman i never knew gellekiara moynhin when robin was romantically involved with her for that matter i didnt know robinette broadhead then eitherjor he was too poor to afford so sophisticated a dataretrieval system as me although i cannot experience physical courage directly i estimate theirs very highly their ignorance almost as high they didnt know what drove the ftl ships they flew they didnt know how the navigation worked or what the controls did they didnt know how to read heechee charts and didnt have any to read anyway because they werent found for another decade after klara was sucked into the black hole it is astonishing to me how much meat intelligences can accomplish with so little information then could you lend me some money dolly laughed with surprise lost your stake did you boy have you got a wrong number i wouldnt be buying drinks if some of the tourists hadnt thrown me a couple of chips for luck when the highball arrived dolly divided the small change in front of her in half and pushed a part to kiara you could hit wan up again she said but hes not in a very good mood thats not news said klara hoping the whiskey would elevate her spirits it did not oh worse than usual i think hes going to be in the deep shit again she hiccoughed and looked surprised whats the matter kiara asked reluctantly she knew perfectly well that once she asked the girl would tell her but it was she supposed a way of paying for the loose change theyre going to catch up with him sooner or later dolly said sucking at the bottle again hes such a jerk coming here when he could have dropped you off anywhere and got his goddamn candy and cake well id rather be here than some other place said klara wondering if it was true dont be silly he didnt do it for you he did it because he thinks he can get away with anything at all anywhere because hes a jerk she stared moodily at the bottle he even makes love like a jerk jerky if you know what i mean he even screws jerky he comes up to me with that look on his face as if hes trying to remember the combination to the food locker you know and then he gets my clothes off and then he starts push here poke there wiggle this part i think i ought to write up an operating manual for him the jerk how many drinks the little stake lasted for kiara didnt knowseveral anyway at some later time dolly remembered that she was supposed to shop for brownie mix and liqueur chocolates at a later time still kiara now strolling around by herself realized she was hungry what made her know it was the smell of food she still had some of dollys loose change in her pocket it was not enough for a decent meal and anyway the sensible thing would be to go back to her cubicle and eat the prepaid meals but what was the point of being sensible anymore besides the smell was nearby she passed through a sort of archway of heechee metal ordered at random and sat as close as she could get to a wall she pried the sandwich apart with a finger to see what she was eating probably synthetic but not any product of the food mines or sea farms she had ever tasted before not bad not very bad anyway although there was no dish she could think of that would have tasted really good just then she ate slowly analyzing each bite not so much because the food justified it as because doing that postponed the next thing she would have to do namely contemplate what she was going to do with the rest of her life and she became aware of a stir the busgirl was sweeping the floor twice as diligently peering over her shoulder at every stroke of the broom the counter people were standing straighter speaking more clearly someone had come in it was a woman tall not young handsome thick ropes of tawny hair hung down her back and she was conversing pleasantly but authoritatively with staff and customers alike while she rubbed fingers under shelves to check for grease tasted crusts to check for crispness made sure the napkin holders were full retied the apron strings on the busgirl kiara stared at her with dawning recognition that felt more like fear her the one the woman whose picture she had seen in so many of the news stories the library had produced about robinette broadhead s ya lavorovnabroadhead opens new chonfood outlets in persian gulf s ya lavorovnabroadhead to christen converted interstellar transport s ya lavorovnabroadhead directs programing of expanded datastore net although the sandwich was just about the last crumb of food klara could afford to buy she could not force herself to finish it she sidled toward the door face averted crammed the plate into the waste receptacle and was gone there was only one place to go when she saw that wan was alone in it she took it as a direct message from providence that she had made the right decision wheres dolly she asked he was lying in a hammock sulkily nibbling on fresh papayabought at what incredible cost klara could not imagine he said where indeed yes i would like to know that too i will deal with her when she comes back oh yes i lost my money she told him he shrugged contemptuously and she lied inventing as she went along i came to tell you that youve lost too theyre going to impound your ship impound he screeched the animals the bastards oh when i see dolly believe meshe must have told them about my special equipment or you did klara said brutally because youve sure been shooting your mouth off you only have one chance one chance maybe one chance if youre smart enough and courageous enough smart enough courageous enough you forget yourself kiaral you forget that for the first part of my life i was all alone no i dont forget anything she said wearily because you sure dont let me its what you do next that counts are you all packed ships stores all on board stores no of course not have i not told you ice cream yes candy bars yes but my brownie mix and chocolates the hell with the chocolates said kiara and since shes not here when shes needed the hell with dolly too if you want to keep your ship take off now now alone without dolly with a substitute said klara tightly cook bedmate somebody to yell atim available and skilled maybe i cant cook as well as dolly but i can make love better or anyway more often and you dont have time to think it over he stared at her slackjawed for a long moment then he grinned take those cases on the floor he ordered also that package under the hammock also wait a minute she objected theres a limit to what i can carry you know as to what your limits are he said we will discover in time i assure you now you may not argue simply take that netting and fill it and then we go and while you are doing so i will tell you a story i heard from the dead men many years ago there were these two prospectors who discovered a great prize inside a black hole and could not think how to get it out one said finally ah now i know i have brought my pet kitten along we will simply tie her to the treasure and she will pull it out and the second prospector said oh what a fool you are how can a little kitten pull a treasure out of a black hole and the first prospector said no it is you who are the fool it will be easy for see i have a whip gateway revisited gateway gave me all of my many millions but it also gives me the creeps coming there was like meeting myself coming back i met myself as a young deadbroke terrified despairing human being whose only choices lay between leaving on a trip that might kill him and staying in a place where no one would want to live it hadnt changed that much no one would still want to live there although people did and tourists were in and out all the time but at least the trips were not as recklessly dangerous as they used to be as we were docking i told my program albert einstein that i had made a philosophical discovery namely that things even out gateway gets safer and the whole home planet earth gets more perilous maybe there is a sort of law of conservation of misery that insures an average quantum value of unhappiness for every human being and all we can really do is spread it in one direction or another it is when you say things like that robinhe sighedthat i wonder if my diagnostic programs are as good as they ought to be are you sure youre not in pain from your operation he was or appeared to be sitting on the edge of the seat guiding our vessel into landing as he talked but i knew that his question was rhetorical he was monitoring me all along of course as soon as the ship was secured i unplugged the albert datafan tucked it under my arm and headed for my new ship no sightseeing essie asked studying me with almost the exact expression albert had displayed then you want me to come with im really excited about the ship i said and i just want to go look at it you can meet me there later i knew she was eager to see how her beloved franchise was getting along in this location of course i did not then know who she might run into so i was thinking about nothing in particular as i clambered through the hatch into my own personal humanbuilt interstellar space yacht and be damned if it didnt turn out that i was just about as excited as i had told essie i was i mean talk about childhood fantasies come true it was real and it was all mine and it had everything at least it had almost everything it had a master stateroom with a marvelously wide anisokinetic bed and a genuine toilet next door it had a fully stocked larder and something very like a real kitchen it also had two working cabins one for essie and one for me that could provide concealed berths for more guests in case we ever wanted company it had the first humanbuilt drive system ever to be successfully proved out for a civilian fasterthanlight vesselwell some of the parts were heechee salvaged out of damaged exploration ships but most of it was humanmade and it was powerful with a bigger faster drive it had a home for albert a fan socket with his name engraved over it i slipped hini into place but did not activate him because i was enjoying my solitary prowl it had datafans full of music and pv plays and reference works and specialist programs to do almost everything i might ever want to do or that essie might either it had a viewscreen copied from the one on the big s ya transport ten times the size of the little blurry plates in the exploration ships it had everything i had ever thought of wanting in a ship in fact and the only thing it didnt have was a name i sat on the edge of the big anisokinetic bed the thrust feeling funny on my bottom because it was all exerted upward instead of that constricting sideways squeeze you get from regular mattresses and i thought about one of the lesser artifacts the heechee left around was the anisokinetic puncha simple tool that could convert an impact to an equal force at some angle to the driving force the theory of it turned out to be both profound and elegant the use peopie made of it less sothe most popular product made with anisokinetic materials was a bedding mattress with springs whose force was vector rather than scalar producing what is said to be a titillating support for sexual activity sexual activity how much time meat intelligences waste on that sort of thing that problem it was a good place to do it since the person who would occupy that bed with me was the one i wanted to name the ship after however i had already named the transport after her of course i thought there were ways of dealing with that i could call it the semya or the essie or the mrs robinette broadheo for that matter although that was pretty stupid the matter was fairly urgent we were all set to go there was nothing to keep us on gateway except that i couldnt face taking off in a ship that didnt have a name i found myself in the control cabin and dropped into the pilot seat this one was built for a human bottom and in that way alone an immense improvement over the old style when i was a kid in the food mines i used to sit on a kitchen chair in front of the radar oven and make believe i was piloting a gateway ship to the far corners of the universe what i did now was just about the same thing i reached out and touched the course wheels and made believe to squeeze the initiator teat andandwell i fantasized i imagined myself dashing through space in just the same careless adventurous penaltyfree style i had imagined as a child circling quasars speeding out to the nearby alien galaxies entering the silicon dust shroud around the core meeting a heechee entering a black hole the fantasy collapsed then because that was too personally real but i suddenly realized i had a name for the ship it fit essie perfectly but did not duplicate the one on the s ya true love it was the perfect name that being so why did it leave me feeling vaguely sentimental lovelorn melancholy it was not a thought that i wanted to pursue anyway now that a name had been decided there were things to do the registry had to be amended the ships insurance papers had to be correctedthe world had to be notified of my decision the way to do that was to tell albert to get it done so i rocked the datafan that held him to make sure it was firmly seated and turned him on i had not got used to the new albert so it surprised me when he turned up not in a holograph box not even near his datafan but in the doorway to the main cabin he stood there with an elbow cupped in a palm the pipe in the free hand gazing peacefully around for all the world as though he had just come in a beautiful ship robin he said my congratulations i didnt know you could jump around like that i am in fact not jumping around my dear robin he pointed out amiably it is part of my program to give to the maximum extent possible the simulation of reality to appear like a genie out of a bottle would not seem realistic would it youre a neat program albert i acknowledged and smiling he said and an alert one too if i may say so robin for example i believe your good wife is coming this way now he stepped asidequite unnecessarilyas essie came in panting and looking as though she were trying not to look upset whats the matter i demanded suddenly alarmed she didnt answer right away havent heard then she said at last heard what she looked both surprised and relieved albert you have not acquired linkage with data net i was just about to do so mrs broadhead he said politely no do not there isahthere are some adjustments in bias must make for gateway conditions first albert pursed his lips thoughtfully but did not speak i was not so reticent essie spit it out what is it she sat down on the communicators bench fanning herself that rogue wan she said is here is talk of entire asteroid complex i am astonished you have not heard woosh i ran so i was afraid you would be upset i smiled forgivingly the operation was weeks ago essie i reminded her im not that delicateor that likely to get all in an uproar over wan for that matter have a little more confidence in me she looked at me narrowly then nodded is true she admitted was foolish well i get back to work she went on standing up and moving to the door but remember albertno interfacing with net until i come back wait i cried you havent heard my news she paused long enough to let me say proudly ive found a name for the ship the true love what do you think she took a long time to think that over and her expression was a lot more tentative and a lot less delighted than i might have expected then she said yes is very good name robin god bless her and all who sail in her eh now must go after twentyfive years i still did not entirely understand essie i told albert so he was sitting at his ease on essies dressingtable bench observing himself in the mirror and he shrugged do you suppose she didnt like the name i asked him its a good name i should have thought so robin he agreed experimenting with different expressions in the mirror and she didnt seem to want to look at the ship she appeared to have something on her mind he agreed but what i swear i repeated i dont always understand her i confess that i do not either robin in my case he said turning from the mirror to twinlde at me i have assumed that it is because i am mechanical and she is human i wonder what it is in your case i stared at him a little annoyed and then grinned youre pretty funny in your new programing albert i told him what do you get out of pretending to look in a mirror when i know you dont really see anything that way what do you get out of looking at the true love robin why do you always answer a question with a question i responded and he laughed out loud it was really a very convincing performance as long as ive had the albert program he was able to laugh and even make jokes of his own but you always knew it was a picture laughing you could think it was a picture of a real person if you wanted tolets face it i usually didlike the picture of a person on the pphone but there was no what shall i call it no presence now there was i couldnt smell him but i could perceive his physical presence in the room with more senses than simple sight and hearing temperature mass sensation i dont know whatever it is that tells you somebody is there with you the answer really he said sobering is that this appearance is my equivalent of a new ship or a new sundaygotomeeting suit or whatever analogy you like to give it im just sort of looking it over to see how much i like it how do you like it which is after all more important dont be humble albert i told him i like it very well only i wish you were hooked up to the data nets id like to know if any of the people ive been working on have done anything about the terrorist data for instance i will of course do what you order me to robin he said but mrs broadliead was very explicit no i dont want you blowing yourself up or damaging your subroutines i know what ill do i said getting up as the light bulb flashed over my head ill just go out into the passageway and plug into a comm circuitprovided i joked i havent forgotten how to make a call all by myself why of course you could do that he said his tone was troubled for some reason or other it isnt necessary though robin well no i said pausing halfway to the door but i am curious you know as to your curiosity he said smiling at me as he poked tobacco into the bowl of his pipebut it was a forced smile i thought as to that you must know that until we docked i was in constant touch with the net there was no real news it is possible though that the lack of news was itself interesting even encouraging i was not entirely used to the new albert i sat down again regarding him youre a cryptic son of a bitch dr einstein i told him only when reporting information that is itself quite unclear he smiled general manzbergen is not receiving calls from you just now the senator says he has done all he can maitre ijsinger says that kwiatkowski and our friend from malaysia have not responded to efforts to contact them on your behall and all he got from the albanians was a message that said dont worry so somethings happening i cried jumping up again something may be happening he corrected and if so really all we can do is let it happen in any case robin he said his tone wheedling now i would personally prefer that you not leave the ship at this time for one good reason how do you know there is not some other person here with a gun and your name on a list a terrorist here here or in rotterdam why is one more unlikely than the other i beg to remind you robin that i am not without experience in these matters at one time the nazis put on my head a price of twenty thousand marks be sure i was careful not to let anyone earn it that came out of left field i stopped in the doorway the whatzees the nazis robin a group of terrorists who seized control of the nation of germany many years ago when i was alive when you were what i mean of coursehe shruggedwhen the real human being whose name you have given me was alive but from my point of view that is not a distinction worth making he stuffed the filled pipe in his pocket absently and sat down in such a natural friendly way that automatically i sat down again too i guess i havent quite got used to the new you albert i said theres no better time than the present robin he smiled preening himself he did have more solidity to him the old holograms showed him in a dozen or so characteristic poses with baggy sweater or tee shirt although it is interesting to see myself from robins point of view it is not very enjoyable mrs broadheads programing constrained me to speak act and even think as the original albert einstein would have done had he survived to assume my role robin seems to think that grotesque in a sense he is right human beings are grotesque socks on or off sneakers or slippers pipe or pencil today he wore a tee shirt to be sure but over it was one of those baggy european sweaters that button up the front and have pockets and might as well be a jacket really except that theyre loosely knitted wool there was a button on the sweater that read two percen and a faint pale stubble around the chin that suggested he hadnt shaved that morning well of course he hadnt shaved he never would either being nothing more than a holographic projection of a computer constructbut so convincing and jazzy that i almost offered to lend him my razor i laughed and shook my head what does two percent mean ah he said bashfully it was a slogan of my youth if two percent of the human race would refuse to fight there would be no war do you believe that now i hope that robin he corrected the news is not all that conducive to hope i must admit would you like to know the rest of the news i suppose i should i said and watched him stroll over to essies vanity he sat on the bench before it idly playing with her flasks of perfume and bits of feminine decoration as he talked so normal so human that it distracted me from what he was saying that was as well for the news was all bad the terrorists were busier than ever the destruction of the lofstrom loop had indeed been the first move in an insurrection and a small bloody war was going on all over that part of south america terrorists had dumped botulinus toxin into the staines reservoir and london was going thirsty news like that i did not want and i told him so he sighed and agreed it was a gentler day when i was alive he said wistfully though not perfect to be sure i could perhaps have been president of the state of israel did you know that robin yes but i felt i could not accept i was for peace always and a state must sometimes make war loeb once told me that all politicians must be pathological and i fear he was right he sat up straighter and brightened but there is some good news after all robin the broadhead awards for scientific discovery the what you recall robin he said impatiently the system of awards you authorized me to inaugurate just before your operation they have already begun to bear fruit youve solved the mystery of the heechee ah robin i perceive you are joking with me he said in gentle reproof of course nothing so vast just yet but there is a physicist in laguna beachbeckfurt you know his work the one who proposed a system for achieving flat space no i dont even know what flat space is well he said resigning himself to my ignorance that doesnt matter just now i think but he is now working on a mathematical analysis of the missing mass it appears robin that the phenomenon is quite recent somehow mass has been added to the universe within the last few million years oh wow i said attempting to look comprehending i did not deceive him he said patiently if you recall robin some years ago the dead man the woman that isfrom what is now the s ya bmadhead led us to believe that this phenomenon had something to do with an act of the heechee we discounted this at the time since there seemed to be no reason for it i remember i said only partly untruthfully i did remember that albert had had the wild idea that for some reason not specified the heechee were collapsing the universe back to its primordial atom so as to bring about a new big bang and thus a new universe with somewhat different physical laws then he had changed his mind he had surely explained all the reasoning to me at the time but i had surely not remined it mach i said something about this fellow mach and somebody named davies exactly right robin he applauded beaming on me with delight machs hypothesis suggested a reason for doing it but daviess paradox made it unlikely that the reason would work now beckfurt has shown analytically that daviess paradox need not apply only assuming that the number of expansions and contractions of the universe is finite he got up and roamed around the room too pleased with himself to sit still i could not see what he was rejoicing over albert i said unsteadily are you tethng me that it may be so that the universe is coming crashing around our ears and well all be squeezed intowhat do you call itphloem exactly my dear boy and this makes you happy precisely oh he said coining to a halt at the doorway and gazing at me i see your problem it will not happen soon a matter of at least some billions of years to be sure i sat back staring at him this new albert was going to take some getting used to he did not seem to notice anything amiss he was babbling on happily about all the halfbaked notions that had been pouring robin did not quite understand daviess paradox but then he didnt even understand the more famous olberss paradox which bothered astronomers way back in the nineteenth century olbers said if the universe is infinite there should be an infinite number of start that means that we should see not individual stars in a black sky but a solid dome of starlight blinding white and he proved it mathematically so a century later paul davies said if its true that the universe is cyclical expanding and contracting over and over then if it is possible for a little bit of matter or energy to stay out of the crunch and cross over to the next universe then in infinite time that leftover light would increase infinitely and wed have an olbers sky again what he didnt know was that the number of oscillations in which a little bit of the energy was left out was not infinite we happened to be in the very first of them in on him ever since the awards were announced and what interesting notions he had thought of because of them thought of wait a minute i said frowning because there was something i didnt quite understand when when what robin when were you doing this thinking youve been turned off except when weve been talking exactly robin when i was turned off as you put it he twinided now that mrs broadhead has provided me with a hardwired builtin database i do not cease to exist when you dismiss me you know i didnt know i said and it is such a great pleasure to me you have no idea simply to think all of my life it is what i have most wanted as a young man i would weep for the chance to sit and only thinkto do such things for example as reconstructing proofs of wellknown mathematical and physical theorems now i can do it very often and so much more quickly than when i was alivel i am deeply grateful to your wife for this he cocked an ear and here she is coming again robin he said mrs broadhead i have just remembered to express to you my gratitude for this new programing she looked at him in a puzzled way then shook her head dear robin she said i have something i must tell you one moment she turned to albert and shot three or four fast russian sentences at him he nodded looking grave it takes me a long time to see what is before me sometimes but by now it was evident something was going on that i should know about come on essie i said alarmed and even more alarmed because i didnt know what i was alarmed about whats happening has wan done something she said soberly wan has left gateway and not a moment too soon to be sure since is in trouble with gateway corp and with many others as well but is not of wan i wish to speak is of woman i observed in my shop she did closely resemble dear robin woman whom you loved before me named gellekiara moynlin so close that i thought perhaps a daughter i stared at her whathow do you know what klara looked like anyway oh robin she said impatiently twentyfive years and i a specialist in data retrieval you think i would not arrange to know know her exactly robin every datum on record yes butshe never had a daughter you know i stopped suddenly wondering if indeed i would know i had loved klara very much but not for very long it was quite possible there were things in her history she had not got around to telling me actually said essie apologetically first guess was maybe she was your own daughter only theory you know but was possible could have knocked lady up you know but now she turned to albert questioningly albert have completed search i have mrs broadhead he nodded looking grave there is nothing in gellekiara moynlins record to suggest she ever bore a child and he reached for his pipe and fumbled with it there is no question about the identity mrs broadhead she checked in two days ago with wan essie sighed then she said bravely is no doubt at all woman in shop was kiara herself no impostor at that moment trying to take in what i had been told what i wished for most in the world or at that moment most urgently at any rate was the soothing healing presence of my old analysis program sigfrid von shrink i needed help klara alive here and if this impossibility was true what should i do about it it was easy enough for me to tell myself i owed klara nothing i had not already paid the coin i paid in was a long time of mourning a deep and abiding love a sense of loss that even three decades had not entirely cured she had been taken away from me across a gulf i could not span and the only thing that made that bearable to me was that i had finally come to believe that it was not my fault but the gulf had somehow spanned itself here she was and here was i with a wellestablished wife and a wellordered life and no room in it for the woman i had promised to love exclusively and always is more said essie watching my face i was not keeping up with the conversation very well yes is more wan arrived with two women not one second woman was dolly waithers unfaithful wife of person we saw in rotterdam you know young person weeping eye makeup smearedpretty young woman but not in pretty frame of mind us military police arrested her when wan left without clearance so i went to talk to her dolly walthers oh robin listen to me please yes dolly walthers could tell me very little though because mps had other plans for her americans wanted to take her to high pentagon brazilian mps tried to stop them big argument but americans finally won i nodded to show i was comprehending i see the americans have arrested dolly walthers essie studied me sharply are you all right robin certainly im all right im only a little worried because if theres friction between the americans and the brazilians i hope it doesnt keep them from putting their data together au said essie nodding now is clear could tell you were worried about something was not sure what it was and then she bit her lip excuse me please dear robin i am a little upset too i think she sat down on the edge of the bed twitching irritably as the anisokinetic mattress poked at her practical matters first she said frowning what do we do now these are alternatives one go off to investigate object walthers detected as planned two attempt to discover more information about gelleklara moynlin three eat something and get good nights sleep before doing anything elsefor she added reprovingly must not forget robin you are still somewhat convalescent from major abdominal surgery i personally lean toward third alternative what do you think as i was mulling over this difficult question albert cleared his throat mrs broadhead it has occurred to me that it would not be very expensive a few hundred thousand dollars perhaps to charter a one for a few days and send it on a photoreconnaissance mission i peered at him trying to follow his meaning that is he explained we could have it seek the object you are interested in locate it observe it and report to us singlepassenger ships are not in great demand now i believe and at any rate there are several available here on gateway what a good idea essie cried settled then all right arrange same albert and at same time cook us up something delicious for first meal on ah on new ship true love myself interposing no objection that is what we did myself interposed no objection because myself was in shock the worst thing about being in shock is that you dont know it while youre in it i thought i was quite lucid and aware so i ate whatever it was they put in front of me and did not notice anything strange until essie was tucking me into the big bouncy bed you havent been saying anything i said is because last ten times i spoke to you dear robin you did not respond she said not accusingly at all will see you in morning i figured the implications of that out pretty quickly youre going to sleep in the guest cabin then yes not in anger dear or even in sorrow just to let you be by yourself for a bit all right i guess so i mean yes sure honey thats probably a good idea i said beginning to register the notion that essie really was upset and even to think that i should concern myself about it i took her hand and kissed the wrist before letting it go and bestirred myself to offer some conversation essie should i have consulted you before naming the ship she pursed her lips true love is good name she said judiciously but she did seem to have reservations and i didnt know why i would have asked you i explained but it seemed tacky to do that i mean to ask the person youre naming it after like asking you what you want for your birthday instead of thinking up something by myself she grinned relaxing but robin dear you always do ask me that is not important really and yes true love is truly excellent name now that i know particular true jove you had in mind is me i think probably albert had been fooling around with his little magic sleeping potions again because i went right off but i didnt stay asleep three or four hours later i was lying in the anisokinetic bed wide awake fairly tranquil very perplexed out on the perimeter of the gateway asteroid where the docking pits are there is a little bit of centrifugal force because of rotation down becomes up only in the true love it didnt albert had turned the ship on and the same force that kept us from floating around in flight was also neutralizing and reversing the thrust of the asteroids spin i was gently held to the gentle bed i could feel the faint hum of the ships housekeeping systems as they changed the air and kept the pressure in the plumbing and did all the other little chores that made the ship alive i knew that if i said alberts name he would appear for mehow exactly i didnt know and it was almost worth summoning him to see whether he would choose to walk through the door or maybe crawl out from under the bed to amuse me i suppose there was a mood elevator in the food as well as a sleepy drink because i felt quite at ease with my problemsalthough that feeling did nothing to solve them which problems to solve that was the first problem my priorities had been reordered so many times in the past few weeks that i didnt know which to put on top of the pile there was the hard harmful problem of the terrorists and that was important to solve for more reasons than my own but that had moved down a notch when i heard what audee walthers had produced as a new problem for me in rotterdam there was the problem of my health but that seemed temporarily at least in abeyance and there was the new and insoluble problem of klara any one of them i could have dealt with all four of them i could deal with tooone way or anotherbut specifically how what should i do when i got up i didnt know the answer to that and so i didnt get up i drifted off to sleep and when i woke again i was not alone good morning essie i said reaching out for her hand good morning she said pressing my hand to her cheek in the fond familiar way but she had an unfamiliar subject to discuss are feeling all right robin good i have been thinldng about your situation i see i said i could feel myself tensing up the peaceful relaxation was being nibbled away what situation is that the klara moynlin situation to be sure she said i see is difficult for you robin dear oh i said vaguely these things happen it was not a situation i could discuss easily with essie but that didnt stop essie from trying to discuss it with me dear robin she said her voice calm and her expression gentle in the dim night light of the room is no use your keeping all this to self bottle up it will explode i squeezed her hand have you been taking lessons from sigfrid von shrink thats what he always used to tell me was good program sigfrid please believe i understand what is in your heart i know you do only onlyshe noddedis embarrassing to talk of this with me who am other woman in case without whom would be no problem thats not true damn it i had not intended to yell but maybe there was after all something bottled up incorrect robin is true if i did not exist could go look for kiara no doubt find her then decide what to make of this worrying situation might become lovers again might notis young woman kiara might not want raddled old spareparts wreck for lover eh i foreclose this option i am sorry she thought for a moment then corrected herself no is not true i am not a bit sorry we love each other value that very greatlybut problem remains only robin there is no guilt in this for anyone you deserve none i accept none certainly klara moynlin has earned none so all guilt worry fear is all in your head no robin do not mistake me what is in head can hurt very powerfully especially for person with welldeveloped conscience like you but is paper tiger blow on it it goes away problem is not kiaras reappearance problem is you feel guilt it was very apparent that i had not been the only one to sleep poorly obviously essie had been rehearsing this speech for some time i sat up and sniffed the air is that coffee you brought in with you only if you want robin i want i thought for a minute while she was handing me the bottle youre certainly right i said i know this what i dont know as sigfrid used to say is how to integrate this knowledge into my life she nodded i perceive i blundered she said should have included sigfrid subroutines in albert program instead of let us say gourmet cookery have thought of making programing change in albert for you because this is on my conscience oh honey thats not your fault no that is center of this conversation correct essie leaned forward to give me a swift kiss then looked concerned oh wait robin i withdraw that kiss for what i wish to say is this in psychoanalytical shrinkery as you have so often explained to me the analyst is not important what is important is what happens in the head of analysand eg you so the analyst can be machine even very rudimentary machine or dolt with bad breath or human with doctoral degree or even me you she winced have heard more flattering tone from you she complained youre going to psychoanalyze me she shrugged defensively yes me why not as friend as good friend intelligent wishing to listen i promise not judgmental in the least i promise this dear robin as one who will let you talk fight shout weep if you will until all comes out for you to see clear what you want and feel she melted my heart all i managed to say was ah essie but i could have managed to weep then without much trouble instead i took another pull at the coffee and then shook my head i dont think it would work i said i was feeling regretful and must have sounded it but also i was feelingwhats the right word interested technically interested interested in it as a problem to be solved why not work she demanded combatively listen robin i have thought this out with care i remember all you have told me of this and i quote you exactly best part of sessions you said came often with sigfrid while you were on your way to see him rehearsing what you would say what sigfrid would say what you would reply did i say that it was always amazing to me how much essie remembered of the idle chitchat of a quarter of a century together said exactly she said smugly so why not me only because i am personally involved well that would surely make it harder the hard things do at once she said merrily impossible sometimes take up to a week bless you i said but i thought for a moment see its not just a question of listening the big thing about a good shrink program is that it listens to the nonverbal stufl too do you understand what i mean the me that does the talking doesnt always know what it wants to say i block itsome i or other blocks it because letting all that old stuff out involves pain and it doesnt want the pain i would hold your hand through all of the pain dear robin of course you would but would you understand the nonverbal stuff that inside silent me talks in symbols dreams freudian slips unexplained aversions fears needs twitchings and blinkings allergiesall of those things essie and a thousand more like impotence shortness of breath itches insomnia i dont mean i suffer from all those things certainly not all but theyre part of the vocabulary that sigfrid could read i cant you cant either essie sighed and accepted defeat then must go to plan b she said albert turn on lights come in here the lights in the room came up slowly and albert einstein came in through the door he didnt exactly yawn and stretch but he did give the impression of an elderly genius just out of the sack ready for whatever might come but not quite fully awake yet have you chartered photoreconnaissance vessel she demanded it is already on its way mrs broadhead he said it did not seem to me that i had quite agreed to do that but perhaps i had i thought and she went on have dispatched messages as agreed all of them mrs broadhead he nodded as you instructed to all persons high in the military establishment or government of the united states who owe robin a favor asking them to use their best efforts to persuade the pentagon people to let us interview dolly walthers yes that is as instructed essie agreed and turned to me so you see is now only one way to go go find this dolly go find this wan go find kiara then she said her voice steadfast but her expression looking suddenly much less confident and a whole lot more vulnerable then we see what we see robin and the very best of good luck to all of us she was going very much faster than i could follow and in directions i was sure i had never agreed to my eyes were popping with astonishment essie whats going on who said person who said dear robin was i is obvious cannot deal with kiara as ghost in subconscious can perhaps deal with real live klara face to face only way to go correct essie i was deeply shocked you sent those messages you forged my name you now you wait you robin she said deeply shocked herself what forgery i signed messages broadhead is my name correct have right to sign my name to message correct i stared at her frustrated fondly frustrated woman i said youre too smart for me you know that why do i get the idea that you knew every word of this conversation before we had it she shrugged smugly am information specialist as i keep telling you dear robin know how to deal with information especially twentyfive years of it on subject that i love dearly and want dearly to be happy so yes i thought with care of what could be done and what you would permit and reached inevitable conclusions would do much more than that if necessary robin she finished getting up and stretching would do whatever was best not excluding going off by myself for six months or so so you and klara can work things out and so ten minutes later while essie and i were getting ourselves cleaned up and dressed albert had received departure clearance and popped the thue love free of its docking pit and we were on our way to the high pentagon my dear wife essie had many virtues one was an altruism that sometimes took my breath away another was a sense of humor and sometimes she imparted that to her programs albert had dressed himself for the part of daring hot pilot leather helmet with earfiaps flying red baron white silk scarf thrown around his neck as he sat crouched in the pilot seat glowering ferociously at the controls you can cut that out albert i told him and he turned his head and gave me a sheepish smile i was only trying to amuse you he said removing the helmet you did that all right and indeed i was amused i was feeling rather good all in all the only way to deal with the terrible crushing depression of problems unmet is to meet themone way or another and this was surely a way i appreciated my wifes loving care i appreciated the way my beautiful new ship flew i even appreciated the neat way the holographic albert got rid of his holographic helmet and scarf there was no vulgar popping out of existence he simply rolled them up and stowed them between his feet and i guess waited to vanish them until no one was looking does flying this ship take all your attention albert i asked well not really robin he admitted it has full navigation programing of course so your being there is just another way of amusing me then amuse me in a different way why dont you talk to me tell me some of that stuff youre always anxious to show off you know about cosmology and the heechee and the meaning of everything and god if you wish robin he said agreeably but first perhaps you would like to see this incoming message essie looked up from the corner where she was going over her customercomment synoptics as albert wiped the big overhead screen of its star pictures and displayed robinette my boy for the guy who made the brazilians roll over and play dead nothing is too much high pentagon alerted to your visit and instructed to extend every courtesy the joint is yours manzbergen by god said i surprised and delighted they did it they turned over the data albert nodded so it would appear robin i think you have a right to be pleased with your efforts essie came over and kissed the back of my neck i endorse this comment she purred excellent robin man of great influence aw shucks i said grinning i couldnt help grinning if the brazilians had turned over their searchandlocate data to the americans then the americans could very probably put it together with their own data and find a way to deal with the damn spaceborne terrorists and their damn crazymaking tpt no wonder general manzbergen was pleased with me i was pleased with myself and it just went to show that when problems seemed absolutely overwhelming and you couldnt decide which to tackle first if you just tackled one of them you would find that all the others were melting away too what i asked if you were still interested in carrying on a conversation albert said wistfully why sure i guess so essie was back in her corner but watching albert rather than returning to her reports then if you dont mind albert said shyly it would give me pleasure to talk to you not about cosmology and eschatology and the missing mass but about my own previous life instead essie scowling opened her mouth to speak but i raised a hand let him talk love i guess my mind wouldnt really be on the missing mass right now anyway so we flew along on that short happy run to the high pentagon while albert leaning back in the pilot seat with his hands folded over the plump tummy in the sloppy sweater reminisced about early days in the patent office in switzerland and the way the queen of belgium used to accompany his violinplaying on the piano and meanwhile my atthirdhand friend dolly walthers was being questioned with great vigor by military intelligence officers n the high pentagon and meanwhile my notquiteyet friend captain was tidying up the traces of his intervention and grieving over his lost love and meanwhile my oncemuchmorethan friend klara moynlin was was i didnt know what klara was doing meanwhile not then i didnt actually in detail i surely did not really want to picking up the pieces the hardest part of klaras new life was keeping her mouth shut she had a combative nature klara did and with wan combat was all too easy to create what wan wanted was food sex company occasional assistance at the jobs of running the spacecraftwhen he wanted them and not at any other times what klara wanted was time to think she wanted to think about this astonishing derailment of her life the possibility of getting killed she had always facedif not bravely exactly then at least steadfastly the possibility that so weird a misadventure as being stuck on a siding inside a black hole for an entire generation while the world moved on without her had never crossed her mind that needed to be thought over wan had no interest in klaras needs when he wanted her for some thing he wanted her when he didnt he made that very clear it was not his sexual demands that troubled klara in general they were not much more trouble or more personally significant than the routine of going to the bathroom foreplay for wan consisted of taking his pants off the act was over at his pace and his pace was rapid the use of kiaras body disturbed her less than the rape of her attention klaras best times were when wan was sleeping they did not usually last very long wan was a light sleeper she would settle down for a conversation with the dead men or make herself something to eat that wan didnt particularly like or simply sit and stare into spacea phrase that took on new meaning when the only thing one could look at that was more than an armslength away was the screen that looked out onto space itself and just as she was relaxed the shrill teasing voice would come doing nothing again klara what a lazy thing you are dolly would have baked a whole batch of brownies for me or worse he would be in a playful mood then out would come the little paperfolds and drugstore vials and silver boxes of pink and purple pills wan had just discovered drugs he wanted to share the experience with klara and sometimes out of boredom and dejection she would let herself be persuaded she would not inject or sniff or swallow anything she could not positively identify and she rejected a lot of the things she could but she accepted a lot too the rushes the euphoriathey didnt last but they were a blessed diversion from the emptiness of a life that had hiccoughed and died and was trying to start itself again getting stoned with wan or even making love with wan was better than trying to evade the questions that wan asked and she did not want to answer honestly kiara do you honestly think ill ever find my father not a hope wan the old boys long dead because the old boy surely was the man who had fathered wan had left gateway on a solitary mission just about the time wans mother began to wonder if shed really missed her first period the records simply posted him as missing of course he could have been swallowed up by a black hole he could still be there frozen in time as kiara herself had been but the odds were very poor an astonishing thing to klaraout of the million astonishing things thirty years had broughtwas the easy way wan displayed and interpreted the old heechee navigation charts in a good moodalmost a record because it had lasted nearly a quarter of an hourhe had shown her the charts and marked the objects he had already visited including her own when the mood evaporated and he stamped off furiously to sleep klara had cautiously asked the dead men about it it could not be said that the dead men really understood the charts but the tiny bit they did know was far more than klaras contemporaries had ever known some of the cartographical conventions were simple enougheven selfevident like columbuss egg once youd been told what they meant the dead men were pleased to tell klara what they meant the problem wastokeepthemfromtellingherandtellingher thecolorsofthe objects shown simple said the dead men the bluer they were the farther they were the redder the nearer that shows whispered the most pedantic of the dead men who happened to be a woman that shows the heechee were aware of the hubblehumason law please dont tell me what the hubblehumason law is klara said what about all these other markings the things like crosses with little extra bars on them theyre major installations sighed the dead man like gateway and gateway two and the food factory and and these things like check marks wan calls them question marks whispered the tiny voice indeed they did look like that a little if you took the dot the bottom of the question mark and turned the rest of it upside down most of them are black holes if you change the setting to twentythree eightyfour please be still cried wan appearing disheveled and irritated from his bunk i cannot sleep with all this foolish yelling we werent yelling wan klara said peaceably werent yelling he yelled mali he stomped over to the pilot seat and sat down fists clenched on his thighs shoulders hunched glowering at her what if i want something to eat now he demanded do you he shook his head or what if i wanted to make love do you do i do i it is always an argument with you and you are not really a very good cook and also in bed you are far less interesting than you claimed dolly was better klara found she was holding her breath and forced herself to release it slowly and silently she could not force herself to smile wan grinned pleased to see that he bad scored on her you remember dolly he went on jovially that was the one you persuaded me to abandon on gateway there they have the rule of no pay no breathe and she had no money i wonder if she is still alive shes still alive gritted klara hoping it was true but dolly would always find someone to pay her bills wan she began desperate to change the subject before it got worse what do those yellow flashes on the screen mean the dead men dont seem to know no one knows if the dead men do not know is it not foolish to think i would know you are very foolish sometimes he complained and in the very nick of time just as klara was reaching the boiling point the thin voice of the female dead man came again setting twentythree eightyfour ninetyseven eight fourteen what said klara startled setting twentythree the voice repeated the numbers whats that klara asked and wan took it upon himself to answer his position had not changed but the expression on his face was different less hostile more strained more fearful it is a chart setting to be sure he said showing what he looked away set it and find out he said it was difficult for klara to operate the knurled wheels for in all her previous experience such n act was tantamount to suicide the chartdisplaying function had not been learned and a change in the settings almost invariably meant an unpredictable and usually fatal change in course but all that happened was that the images on the screen flickered and whirled and steadied to showwhat a star or a black hole whatever it was it was bright cadmium yellow on the screen and around it flickered no fewer than five of the upsidedown question marks what is it she demanded wan turned slowly to stare at it it is very big he said and very far away and it is where we are going now all that combativeness was gone from his face now klara almost wished it were back for what had replaced it was naked unrelieved fear and meanwhile meanwhile the task of captain and his heechee crew was nearing the end of its first phase though it brought no joy to any of them captain was still grieving for twice her slim sallow shiny body emptied of personality had been disposed of at home it would have gone to join the other refuse in the settling tanks for the heechee were not sentimental about cadavers on shipboard there were no settling tanks so it had been jettisoned into space the part of twice that remained was in store with the rest of the ancestral minds and as captain roamed about his new and unfrniilinr ship he touched the pouch where she was stored from time to time without knowing that he did it it was not just the personal loss twice was their drone controller and the cleanup job could not be done properly without her mongrel was doing her best but she was not primarily an operator of enslaved equipment captain standing nervously over her was not helping much dont kill your thrust yet thats no stable orbit he hissed and i hope those people dont get motion sickness the way youre jerking them around mongrel pulsed her jaw muscles but did not respond she knew why captain was so tense and withdrawn but at last he was satisfied and tapped mongrel on the shoulder to signify that she could discharge cargo the great bubble lurched and revolved a line of dark appeared from pole to pole and it opened like a flower mongrel hissing with satisfaction at last disengaged the crumpled sailship and allowed it to slide free they got a rough ride commented the communications officer coming over to stand beside his captain captain twitched his abdomen in the heechee equivalent of a shrug the sailship was quite clear of the opened sphere now and mongrel began to close the great hemisphere what about your own task shoe are the human beings still chattering more than ever im afraid massed minds have you made any progress in translating what theyre yelling about the minds are working on it captain nodded gloomily and reached for the eightsided medallion clipped to the pouch between his legs he stopped himself barely in time the satisfaction he might gain from asking the minds how they were getting along with the translation would not justify the pain of hearing twice among them sooner or later he would hear her necessarily not yet he blew air through his nostrils and addressed mongrel button it up power it down let it float there we cant do any better than that for now shoe transmit a message to them tell them were sorry we cant fix them up any better right now but well try to come back whitenoise plot all vessels in space for me the navigator nodded turned to his instruments and in a moment the screen filled with a whirling mass of yellowtailed comets the color of the nucleus indicated distance the length of the tail velocity which one is the fool with the corkscrew captain demanded and the screen contracted its field to show one particular comet captain hissed in astonishment that particular ship last time he looked had been safely moored in its home system now it was traveling at very high velocity indeed and had left its home far behind where is he going he demanded whitenoise twitched his corded face muscles itll take a minute captain well do it under other circumstances whitenoise might have taken offense at captains tone heechee did not talk uncivilly to each other the circumstances however were not to be ignored the fact that these upstart humans were in possession of blackholepiercing equipment was terribly frightening in itself the knowledge that they were filling the air with their loud foolish communications was worse who knew what they would do next and the death of a shipmate was the final straw making this trip just about the worst since those longago days before whitenoise had been born when they learned of the existence of the others it doesnt make sense whitenoise complained theres nothing along their course that i can see captain scowled at the cryptic graphics on the screen reading them was a task for a specialist but captain had to have a smattering of everyones skills and he could see that along the plotted geodesic there was nothing in reasonable range what about that globular cluster he demanded i dont think so captain its not directly in line of flight and theres nothing there nothing at all really all the way to the edge of the galaxy minds said a voice from behind them captain turned the blackhole piercer burst was standing there and all his muscles were rippling madly the mans fear communicated itself to captain even before burst said tightly extend the geodesic whitenoise looked at him uncomprehendingly extend it outside the galaxy the navigator started to object then caught his meaning his own muscles were twitching as he obeyed the screen flickered the fuzzed yellow line extended itself it passed through regions where there was nothing else on the screen at all undiluted black space empty not quite empty a deepblue object emerged from the darkness of the screen paling and yellowing it was quintuply flagged there was a hiss from every member of the crew as it steadied and stopped and the fuzzy yellow geodesic reached out to touch it the heechee looked at each other and not one of them had a word to say the one ship that could do the greatest damage one could imagine was on its way to the place where the damage was waiting to be done in the high pentagon the high pentagon isnt exactly a satellite in geostationary orbit its five satellites in geostationary orbit the orbits are not precisely identical so all five of these armored pulsehardened chunks of metal waltz around each other first alphas on the outside and deltas nearest the earth then they swing awhile and its epsilon thats facing out and maybe gamma thats inboard swing your partners dosido and so on why one might ask did they do it that way instead of just building one big one well one is answered five satellites are five times as hard to hit as one satellite also i personally think because both the soviet orbit tyuratam and the peepchina command post are single structures naturally the u s of a wanted to show that they could do the job better or at least different it all dated from the time of the wars at one time they said it had been the very latest in defense its huge nukefueled lasers were supposed to be able to zap any enemy missile from fifty thousand miles away probably they indeed couldwhen they were builtand for maybe three months after that until the other fellows began using the same pulsehardening and radardecoy tricks and everybody was back to go unfortunately they all went but thats a whole other story so we never saw fourfifths of the pentagon except on our screens the hunk they vectored us in on was the one that held crew quarters administrationand the brig that was gamma sixty thousand tons of metal and meat about the size of the great pyramid and pretty much the same shape and we found out right away that no matter how openhanded general manzbergen had been back on earth here in orbit we were about as welcome as a cold sore for one thing they kept us waiting for permission to unseal suppose they must have been hardhit in the minute madness essie speculated scowling at the viewscreen which showed nothing but the metal flank of gamma thats no excuse i said and albert chipped in his two cents worth they were not hit so hard but that they were ready to hit much harder im afraid i have seen too much war i do not like such things he was fingering his two percent button and acting for a hologram rather nervous what he said was true enough a couple weeks earlier when the terrorists had zapped everybody from space with their tpt the whole station had gone crazy for a minute literally one minute it was no more than that and a good thing it was no longer because in that one minute eight of the eleven duty stations that had to be manned in order to aim a proton beam at terrestrial cities were in fact manned and raring to go that wasnt what was troubling essie albert she said do not play games that make me nervous you have not in fact seen any war ever you are only a program he bowed as you say mrs broadhead please i have just received permission for us to unseal and you may enter the satellite so we entered with essie looking thoughtfully over her shoulder at the program we left behind the ensign waiting for us did not seem enthusiastic he ran his thumb over the ships data chip as though he were trying to make sure the magnetic ink didnt come off yeah he said we got a signal about you only thing im not sure if the brigadier can see you now sir it was not a brigadier we wished to see essie explained sweetly simply a mrs dolly walthers whom you are holding here oh yes maam but brigadier cassata has to sign your pass and right now were all pretty busy he excused himself to whisper into a phone then looked happier if youll just come with me sir and maam he said and conducted us out of the port at last you lose the habit of maneuvering in lowg or zerog if you dont practice it and i was long out of practice also i was rubbernecking all this was new to my experience gateway is an asteroid tunneled out by the heechee long ago and every interior surface lined by them with their favorite blueglowing metal the food factory heechee heaven and all of the other large structures i had visited in space were also heechee construction it was confusing for me to be for the first time in a very large humanmade space artifact it seemed more alien than anything heechee no familiar blue glow just painted steel no spindleshaped chamber at the core no prospectors looking sickscared or triumphant no museum collections of bits and pieces of heechee technology found here and there around the galaxy what there was plenty of was military personnel in skintights and for some reason crash helmets the curiousest thing of all was that although every one of them wore a weapons holster all the holsters were empty i slowed down to point this out to essie looks like they dont trust their own people i commented she shook me by the collar and pointed ahead where the ensign was waiting do not talk against hosts robin not until are behind their backs anyway here this must be place not a minute too soon i was beginning to run out of breath with the exertion of puffing myself along a zerog corridor right inside sir and maam said the ensign hospitably and of course we did as he said but what was inside the door was only a bare room with a couple of sitdown lashings around the walls and nothing else wheres the brigadier i demanded why sir i told you were all pretty busy right now hell see you soons he can and with a sharks smile he closed the door on us and the interesting thing about that door we both perceived at once was that there was no knob on the inside surface like everybody i have had fantasies of being arrested youre busy with your life herding fish or balancing somebodys books or writing the great new symphony and all of a sudden theres a knock on the door come along without resistance they say and snap the cuffs on and read you your rights and the next thing you know youre in a place like this essie shivered she must have had the same fantasies though if ever there was a blameless life it was hers is silly she said more to herself than to me what a pity there is no bed here could put the time to use i patted her hand i knew she was trying to cheer me up they said they were busy i reminded her so we waited and half an hour later without warning i felt essie stiffen under the hand i had on her shoulder and the expression on her face was suddenly raging and mad and i felt a quick hurting furious jolt to my own mind and then it was gone and we looked at each other it had only lasted a few seconds long enough to tell us just what it was they had been busy about and why they had carried no weapons in their holsters the terrorists had struck againbut only a glancing blow when at last the ensign came back for us he was gleeful i do not mean that he was friendly he still didnt like civilians he was happy enough to have a big smile on his face and hostile enough not to tell us why it had been a long time he didnt apologize just conducted us to the commandants office grinning all the way and when we got there pastelpainted steel walls with its west point holoscape on the wall and its sterling silver smoke eater trying vainly to keep up with his cigar brigadier cassata was smiling too there were not very many good explanations possible for all this secret joffity so i took a long leap in the dark and landed on one of them congratulations brigadier i said politely on capturing the terrorists the smile flickered but came back cassata was a small man and pudgier than the military medics must have preferred his thighs bulged out at the hems of his olivedrab shorts as he sat on the edge of his desk to greet us as i understand it mr broadhead he said your purpose here is to interview mrs dolly walthers you may certainly do that considering the instructions i have received but i cant answer your questions about security matters i didnt ask any i pointed out then as i felt essies whyyouantagonizethiscreep glare burning the back of my neck i added anyway its very kind of you to let us do it he nodded obviously agreeing that he was very kind id like to ask you a question though would you mind telling me why you want to see her essies glare was still burning which kept me from telling him that i did mind not at all i lied mrs walthers spent some time with a very good friend of mine whom i am anxious to see were hoping she can tell us how to get in touch with uh with my friend it was not a lot of use skipping the genderrevealing pronoun they had surely interrogated the hell out of poor dolly waithers and knew that there were only two people i could mean and of the two it was not at all likely that i would call wan a friend he looked at me in a puzzled way then at essie then said waithers is certainly a popular young lady i wont keep you any longer and he turned us over to the ensign for the conducted tour as a tour guide the ensign was a flat failure he didnt answer questions he didnt volunteer information there was a lot to be curious about too because the pentagon was showing signs of recent trouble not physical damage so much but when the station had gone crazy for the earlier minute of madness the brig was damaged its locking program had been crashed by the duty guards fortunately they had wrecked it in the open position otherwise there woujd have been some sorry skeletons starving to death in the cells the way i found out about it was by passing through a tier of cells and observing that they were all open with armed mps squatting boredly in the corridors to make sure the inmates stayed inside the ensign paused to talk briefly to the guard officer and while we waited essie whispered if didnt catch terrorists what would brigadier be nice to you for good question i answered heres one back what did he mean about her being a very popular young lady the ensign was scandalized by our talking in ranks he cut short the chat with the mp lieutenant and hustled us along to a cell like any other cell door standing open he pointed inside theres your prisoner he said you can talk to her all you like but she doesnt know anything much i realize that i said because if she did you surely wouldnt let us see her at all would you i got the hot flash of another of essies glares for that she was right too if i hadnt annoyed him the ensign might have had the common decency to move back a few steps so that we could talk to dolly waithers in private instead of posting himself firmly at the open door or might not the latter theory is the one that got my vote dolly waithers was a childsized woman with a childish highpitched voice and bad teeth she was not at her best she was scared fatigued angry and sullen and i was not all that much better i was wholly disconcertingly aware that this young woman before me had just spent a couple of weeks in the company of the love of my lifeor one of the loves of my lifein the top two anyway i say this lightly enough it wasnt a light thing i didnt know what to do and i didnt know what to say say hello robin essie instructed miz waithers i said obediently hello im robin broadhead she had manners left she put out her hand like a good child i know who you are mr broadhead even not counting that i met your wife the other day we shook hands politely and she flashed a hint of a sad smile it wasnt until some time later when i saw her robinette broadhead puppet that i knew what she had been smiling at but she looked puzzled too i thought they said there were four people who wanted to see me she said peering past the stolid ensign in search of the others is just the two of us said essie and waited for me to speak but i didnt speak i didnt know what to say i didnt know what to ask if it had been just essie there perhaps i could have managed to tell dolly walthers what klaraaiad meant to me and ask for her helpany kind of help or if it had been just the ensign i could have ignored him like any other piece of furniture or i think i couldbut they were both there and i stood tonguetied while dolly waithers gazed at me curiously and essie expectantly and even the ensign turned to stare essie sighed an exasperated and compassionate sound and made her decision she took charge she turned to dolly waithers dolly she said briskly must excuse my husband is quite traumatic for him for reasons too complex to explain just now must excuse me also please for allowing mps to take you away i also have some trauma for related reasons important thing is what we do now that will be as follows first we secure your release from this place second we invite your company and help in voyage to locate wan and gelleklara moynlin you agree it was all happening too fast for dolly walthers too well she said i good said essie nodding we go to arrange this you ensign take us back to our ship true love at once please the ensign opened his mouth scandalized but i got in ahead of him essie shouldnt we see the brigadier about that she squeezed my hand and gazed at me the gaze was compassionate the squeeze was a shutsillymouthrobin warning that nearly broke my knuckles poor lamb she said apologetically to the officer has just had major surgery is confused to ship for his medicine and quickly when my wife essie is determined to do something the way to get along with her is to let her do it what she had in mind i did not know but what i should do about it was very clear i assumed the demeanor of an elderly man dazed by recent surgery and let her guide me in the wake of the ensign down the corridors of the pentagon we didnt move very fast because the corridors of the pentagon were pretty busy the ensign halted us at an intersection while a party of prisoners marched past for some reason they were clearing out an entire block of cells essie nudged me and pointed to the monitors on the wall one set of them were no more than signposts commissary z enlisted personnel latrines docking v and so on but the other the other showed the docking area and there was something big coming in great hulking humanbuilt you could tell it was earthbuilt rather than heechee at the first glance it wasnt just the lines or the fact that it was constructed of gray steel rather than heecheemetal blue the proof lay in the meanlooking projectileweapons that poked their snouts out of its smooth exterior the pentagon i knew had lost six of those ships in a row trying to adapt the heechee fasterthanlight drive to human ships i couldnt complain about that it was from their mistakes that the design for the true love had benefited but the weapons were not pleasant to see you never saw one on a heechee vessel come on snapped the ensign glaring at us youre not supposed to be here lets move it he started along a relatively empty corridor but e sie slowed him down is faster this way she said pointing to the docking sign off limits he snapped not for good friend of pentagon who is unwell she replied and tugged at my arm and we headed for the densest noisiest knots of people there are secrets within secrets in essie but this one clarified itself in a moment the commotion had been the captured terrorists being brought in from the cruiser and essie had just wanted to get a look at them the cruiser had intercepted their stolen ship just as it was coming out of ftl they shot it up apparently there had been eight terrorists on boardeight in a heechee ship that five persons crowded three of them had survived to become prisoners one was comatose one was missing a leg but conscious the third one was mad it was the mad one that was attracting all the attention she was a young black girlfrom sierra leone they saidand she was screaming incessantly she wore a straitjacket by the look of it she had been kept in it for a very long time for the fabric was stained and stinldng her hair was matted her face was cadaverous somebody was calling my name but i pressed forward along with essie to get a better look is russian she is saying said essie her brows furrowing but is not very good georgia accent very strong says she hates us i could have figured that out i said i had seen enough when the ensign got through the crowd yelling furious orders for people to get out of the way i let him tug me back and then i heard my name called again so it wasnt the ensign in fact it wasnt a mans voice at all it came from the knot of prisoners being moved out of their cells and i saw who it was the chinese girl janie something good god i said to the ensign what have you arrested her for he rasped that is a military matter and none of your business broadhead come on you dont belong here there was no point in arguing with a man who had made up his mind i didnt ask him again i just walked over to the line and asked janie the other prisoners were all female all military personnel no doubt in for overstaying a furlough or punching somebody like the ensign in the mouthall good people i was sure they were quiet listening audee wanted to come up here because they had his wife she said with a look on her face as though she were saying his case of tertiary syphilis so we took a shuttle up and as soon as we got here they stuck us in the brig now broadhead the ensign shouted thats the last straw you come on out of there or youre under arrest yourself and his hand was on the holster that once more contained a sidearm essie sailed by smiling politely is now no more need for concern ensign she said for there is true love waiting for us so we are out of hair now remains only to fetch brigadier here to settle remaining questions the ensign goggled maam he stuttered maam you cant get the brigadier here of course can husband requires medical treatment therefore must be here to receive brigadier cassata is courteous man right west point many courses in deportment courtesy covering coughs and sneezes and also please tell brigadier is excellent bourbon here which poor sick husband requires assistance to dispose of the ensign stumbled away hopelessly essie looked at me and i looked at essie now what i asked she smiled and patted my head first i instruct albert about bourbon and other things she said turning to deliver a couple of quick sentences in russian and then we wait for brigadier to show up it didnt take long for the brigadier to arrive but by the time he had gotten there i had almost forgotten him essie was engaged in a lively chat with the guard the ensign had left and i was thinking what i was thinking about mostly for a change was not klara but the mad african woman and her almost as mad associates they scared me terrorists scared me in the old days there was a plo and an ira and puerto rican nationalists and serbian secessionists and german and italian and american rich kids asserting their contempt for their daddiesoh lots of terrorists all sizes all kindsbut they were all separate the fact that they had got together scared me the poor and the furious had learned to join their rages and resources and there was no question at all that they could make the world listen capturing one ship would not stop them it would only make their efforts bearable for a whileor almost bearable but to solve their problemto ease their rage and supply their needs more was needed the colonization of worlds like peggys planet was the best and maybe the only answer but it was slow the transport could take three thousand eight hundred poor people to a better life each month but each month something like a quarter of a million new poor people were being born and the fatal arithmetic was easy to do new poor people to deal with each month the only hope was new and bigger transports hundreds or thousands of them a hundred would keep us even with the present level of misery a thousand would cure it once and for allbut where were the thousand big ships to come from it had taken eight months to build the true love and a lot more of my money than i had really intended what would it cost to build something a thousand times as big the brigadiers voice took my mind off these reflections it is he was saying flatly impossible i let you see her because i was asked to to take her away with you is out of the question he glowered at me as i joined them taking essies hand also she said is question of male waithers and chinese woman we wish them also we do i asked but the brigadier wasnt listening to me what else for gods sake he demanded you wouldnt like me to turn over my section of the pentagon or give you a cruiser or two essie shook her head politely our ship is more comfortable thi nk you jesus cassata wiped his brow and allowed essie to lead him into the main lounge for the promised bourbon well he said theres no real charge against walthers and yeexing they had no right coming up here without clearance but if you take them away again we can forget that one splendid essie cried remains now only other waithers i could not possibly take the responsibility he began and essie did not let him finish certainly not one understands that of course so we will refer to higher authority right robin call general manzbergen do here so will be no annoying record to possibly embarrass all right there is no use arguing with essie when she is in such a mood and besides i was curious to see what she was up to albert i called do it please sure robin he said obligingly voice only and in a moment the screen lit up and there was general manzbergen at his desk morning robin essie he said genially i see youve got perry cassata there congratulations to all of you thank you jimmy said essie looking sidewise at the brigadier but is not what we called about please oh he frowned whatever it is do it fast all right ive got a top meeting coming up in ninety seconds take less than that general dear merely please instruct brigadier cassata to turn over dolly walthers to us manzbergen looked puzzled for what so can use her to locate missing wan general dear has tpt you know much in everyones interest to make him give it back he grinned fondly at her minute honey he said and bent to a hushphone the brigadier might have been rushed but he was on his toes theres a lag he pointed out isnt this zerospeed radio is burst transmission essie lyingly explained have only small vessel here not much poweranother lieso must conserve communications energyah here is general again the general pointed toward cassata its authorized he barked theyre trustworthy we owe them a favorand they might be able to save us a pack of future trouble give them whoever they want on my authority now for gods sake let me get to my meetingand dont call me again unless its world war four so the brigadier went away shaking his head and pretty soon the mps brought janie yeexing to us and a minute later audee walthers and quite a while after that dolly walthers nice to see you all again said essie welcoming them aboard am sure you have much to talk over among you but first let us get away from this wicked place albert move it please right mrs broadhead sang alberts voice he didnt bother with materializing in the pilot seat he simply walked in a door and leaned against the lintel smiling at the company will introduce later said essie this is good friend who is computer program albert are now safely away from pentagon he nodded twinkling then before my eyes he turned from elderly man in pipe and baggy sweater to the leaner taller uniformed and medaled chief of staff general james p manzbergen right you are honey he cried now lets get our asses into ftl before they find out we foxed them the permutations of love who sleeps with whom ah that was the question we had five passengers and only three staterooms to put them in the true love had not been planned for very many guests and especially when the guests did not come presorted in pairs should we put audee in with his wedded wife dolly or with his most recent bedmate janie yeexing put audee by himself and the two women togetherand what would they do to each other if we did it was not that janie and dolly were hostile to each other so much as that audee seemed unaccountably hostile to both of them he cannot make up his mind which he should be true to said essie wisely and is a man who wishes to be true to a woman is audee well i understood that well enough and even understood that more of our passengers than one suffered that problem but there is a word in that statement that did not apply to me and it is the word suffered you see i wasnt suffering i was enjoying myself i was enjoying essie too because the way we solved the problem of assigning accommodations was to walk away from it essie and i retired to captains quarters and locked the door we told ourselves that the reason we did was to let our three guests sort things out among themselves that was a good reason god knows they needed time to do that because the interpersonal dynamics latent among the three of them were enough to explode a star but we had other reasons too and the biggest of them was so that we could make love and so we did enthusiastically with great joy you would think that after a quarter of a centuryat our advanced ages and mpking allowances for familiarity and boredom and the fact that there are after all just so many mucous surfaces to rub against and a finite number of appurtenances to rub them withthere would be very little incentive for us to do that wrong we were motivated as hell perhaps because it was because of the relatively cramped quarters on the true love locking ourselves into our private cabin with its anisokinetic bed gave the affair a spice of teenage fooling around on the porch with daddy and mommy only a window screen away we giggled a lot as the bed pushed us about in ingenious waysand suffer not a bit of it i hadnt forgotten klara she popped into my mind over and over often at very personal times but essie was there on the bed with me and kiara was not so i lay back on the bed twitching a little now and then to feel how the bed would twitch back and how it would twitch essie cuddled close into my side and she would twitch a littleit was a little like playing threecushion billiards but with more interesting piecesand thought calmly and sweetly about klara at that moment i felt quite certain that everything would work out what after all was wrong only love only that two people loved each other there was nothing wrong in that it was a complication to be sure that one of that particular two eg me might be also a part of another two who loved each other but complications could be resolvedsomehow or othercouldnt they love was what made the universe go around love made essie and me linger in captains quarters love was what made audee follow dolly to the high pentagon and a kind of love was what made janie go with him and another kind of love or maybe the same kind made dolly marry him in the first place because one of the functions of love is surely to give a person another person to organize his or her life around and off in one stretch of the great gassy starry wastes captain was mourning for a love and even wan who had never loved anyone but himself was in fact scouring that universe for someone to aim his love at you see how it works it is love that is the motivator robin said essie drowsily to my collarbone did that very well my compliments and of course she too was talking about love although in this case i chose to accept it as a compliment to my skills in the demonstration of it thank you i said makes me ask question though she went on drawing back to peer at me are fully recovered gut in good shape two point three meters new tubing working well with old has albert reported all well i feel just fine i reported as indeed i did and leaned over to kiss her ear i only hope the rest of the world is going as well she yawned and stretched if you refer to vessel albert is quite capable of handling piotage ah yes but is he capable of handling the passengers she rolled over sleepily ask him she said so i called albert come and talk to us i turned to look at the door curious to see how he would manage his appearance this time through a tangible real door that happened to be closed he fooled me there was a sound of albert apologetically clearing his throat and when i turned back he was sitting on essies dressing bench again eyes bashfully averted essie gasped and grabbed for the covers to shield her neat modest breasts now that was a funny thing essie had never bothered to cover herself in front of one of her programs before the funniest thing about it was that it did not seem strange at the time sorry to intrude my dear friends said albert but you did call yes fine said essie sitting up to look at him betterbut with the bedspread still clutched to her perhaps by then her own reaction had struck her as odd but all she said was so our guests how are they very well i should say albert said gravely they are having a threesided conversation in the galley captain walthers is preparing sandwiches and the two young women are helping no fights no eyes scratched out i asked not at all to be sure they are rather formal with many excuse mes and pleases and thank yous however he added looking pleased with himself i do have a report for you on the sailship would you like to have it now orit occurs to meperhaps you would like to join your guests so that you may all hear it at once all my instincts were to get it right away but essie looked at me is only polite robin she said and i agreed splendid said albert you will find it extremely interesting i am sure as do i of course i have always been interested in sailing you know he went on chattily when i was fifty the berliner handeisgesellschaft gave me such a fine sailboatlost unfortunately when i must leave germany because of those wicked nazis my dear mrs broadhead i owe you so much now i have all these fine memories that i did not have before i remember my little house near ostend where i used to walk along the beach with albertthathe twinldedwas king albert of belgium and we would speak of sailing and then in the evenings his wife would accompany me on the piano while i played my violin and all this i now remember dear mrs broadhead only because of you through the whole speech essie had been sitting rigid beside me staring at her creation with a face like a stone now she began to sputter and then she broke out in guffaws oh albert she cried reaching behind her for a pillow she took aim and threw it right through him to bounce harmlessly against the cosmetics beyond him great funny program you are welcome now get out please since are so human with memories and tedious anecdotes cannot permit to observe me unclothed and he allowed himself this time to simply wink away while essie and i hugged each other and laughed so get dressed now she ordered at last so we can find out about sailship in mode satisfactory to computer program laughter is sovereign medicine right in that case have no further fears for your health dear robin so well rejoiced a body will surely last forever we headed for the shower still chucklingunaware that in my case forever at that moment amounted to eleven days nine hours and twentyone minutes we had never built into the true love a desk for albert einstein particularly not one with his pipe marking his place in a book a bottle of skrip next to a leather tobacco jar and a blackboard behind him half covered with equations but there it was and there he was entertaining our guests with stories about himself when i was at princeton he declared they hired a man to follow me around with a notebook so that if i wrote something on a blackboard he would copy it down it was not for my benefit but for theirsotherwise you see they were afraid to erase the blackboards he beamed at our guests and nodded genially to essie and me standing hand in hand at the doorway to the main lounge i was explaining mr and mrs broadhead something of my history to these people who perhaps have not really heard of me although i was i must say quite famous did you know for example that since i disliked rain the administration at princeton built a covered passage which you can still see so that i could visit my friends without going outdoors at least he wasnt wearing his generals face and red baron silk scarf but he made me just a little uncomfortable i felt like apologizing to audee and his two women instead i said essie dont you think these reminiscences are getting a bit thick is possible she said thoughtfully do you wish him to stop not really stop hes much more interesting now but if you could just turn down the gain on the personalizedidentity database or twist the potentiometer on the nostalgia circuits how silly you are dear robin she said smiling with forgiveness then she commanded albert cut out so much gossip robin doesnt like it of course my dear semya he said politely no doubt you wish to hear about the sailship in any case he stood up behind his deskthat is his holographic but physically nonexistent image rose behind his equally nonexistent hologram of a desk i had to keep reminding myself of that he picked up a blackboard eraser and began to wipe away the chalk then recollected himself with an apologetic glance at essie he reached for a switch on the desk instead the blackboard vanished it was replaced by the familiar pebbly greenygray surface of a heechee ships viewscreen then he pressed another switch and the pebbly gray disappeared replaced this time by a view of a star chart that was realistic tooall it took to convert any gateway ships screen to a usable picture was a simple bias applied to the circuits what you see he said genially is the place where captain walthers located the sailship and as you see there is nothing there walthers had been sitting quietly on a hassock before the imitation fireplace as far as possible from either dolly or janieand each of them was as far as possible from the other and also very quiet but now walthers spoke out stung impossible the records were accurate you have the data of course they were accurate albert soothed but you see by the time the scout ship arrived there the sailship was gone it couldnt have gone very far if its only drive was from starshine no it could not but it was absent however albert said beaming cheerfully i had provided for some such contingency if you remember my reputationin my former self i meanrested on the assumption that the speed of light was a fundamental constant subject he added blinking tolerantly around the room to certain broadenings of context that we have learned from the heechee but the speed yes is always the samenearly three hundred thousand kilometers per second so i instructed the drone in the event that the sailship was not found to remove itself a distance of three hundred thousand kilometers times the number of seconds since the sighting great clever egotistical program essie said fondly that was some smart pilot you hired for scout ship right albert coughed it was an unusual ship as well he said since i did foresee that there might be special needs i fear the expense was rather high however when the ship had reached the proper distance this is what it saw and he waved a hand and the screen showed that multiwinged gossamer shape no longer perfect it was folding and contracting before our eyes albert had speeded up the action as seen from the scout and we watched the great wings roll themselves up and disappear well what we saw you have already seen the way in which you were advantaged over us was that you knew what you were seeing there we were walthers and his harem essie and me we had left a troublesome human world to chase after a troublesome puzzle and there we saw the thing we were aiming at beingbeing eaten by something else it looked exactly that way to our shocked and unprepared eyes we sat there frozen staring at the crumpled wings and the great glistening blue sphere that appeared from nowhere to swallow them i became aware that someone was chuckling gently and was shocked for the second time when i realized who it was it was albert sitting now on the edge of his desk and wiping away a tear of amusement i do beg your pardon he said but if you could see your faces damn great egotistical program essie grated no longer fondly stop crap immediately what is going on here albert gazed at my wife i could not quite decipher his expression the look was fond and tolerant and a great many other things that i did not associate with a computergenerated image even alberts but it was also uneasy dear mrs broadhead he said if you did not wish me to have a sense of humor you should not have programed me so if i have embarrassed you i apologize follow instructions essie barked looking baffled oh very well what you have seen he explained turning pointedly away from essie to lecture to the group is what i believe to be the first known example of an actual heecheemanned operation in real time that is the sailship has been abducted observe this smaller vessel he waved a negligent hand and the image spun and flowed magnifying the scene the magnification was more than the resolution of the scout ships optics were good for and so the edge of the sphere became pebbly and fuzzy but there was something behind it there was something that moved slowly into eclipse behind the sphere just as it was about to disappear albert froze the picture and we were looking at a blurry fishshaped object quite tiny very poorly imaged a heechee ship said albert at least i have no other explanation janie yeexing gave a choking sound are you sure no of course not said albert it is only a theory as yet one never says yes to a theory miss yeexing only maybe for some better theory will surely come along and the one that has seemed best until then will get its no but my theory is that the heechee have decided to abduct the sailship now get the picture heechee real ones attested to by the smartest dataretrieval system anyone had ever encountered i had been looking for heechee one way or another for twothirds of a century desperate to find them and terrified that i might and when it happened the thing uppermost in my mind was not the heechee but the dataretrieval system i said albert why are you acting so funny he looked at me politely tapping his pipestem against his teeth in what way funny robin he asked damn it come off it the way you act dont you i hesitated trying to put it politely dont you know youre just a computer program he smiled sadly i do not need to be reminded of that robin i am not real am i and yet the reality that you are immersed in is one for which i do not care albert i cried but he put up his hand to quiet me allow me to say this he said for me reality is i know a certain large quantity of parallelprocessed onoff switches in heuristic conformations if one analyzes it it becomes only a sort of trick one plays on the viewer but for you robin is reality for an organic intelligence very different or is it merely certain chemical transactions that take place in a kilogram of fatty matter that has no eyes no ears no sexual organs everything that it knows it knows by hearsay because some perceptual system has told it so every feeling it has comes to it by wire from some nerve is it so different between us robin albert he shook his head ab he said bitterly i know you cannot be deceived by my trick because you know the trickstershe is here among us but arent you deceived by your own should i not be granted the same esteem and tolerance i was quite an important man robin held in high regard by some very fine persons kings queens great scientists and such good fellows they were on my seventieth birthday they gave me a partyrobertson and wigner kurt goedel rabi oppenheimer he actually wiped away an actual tear and that was about as far as essie was willing to let him go she stood up my friends and husband she said is obviously some severe malfunction here apologize for this must pull out of circuit for complete downcheck you will excuse please it isnt your fault essie i said as kindly as i could but she didnt take it kindly she looked at me in a way i hadnt seen from her since we first began dating and i told her about all the funny jokes i used to play on my psychoanalysis program sigfrid von shrink robin she said coldly is all too much talk about fault and guilt will discuss later guests must borrow my workroom for a time albert present yourself there at once for debugging one of the penalties of being rich and famous is that a lot of people invite you to be their guests and almost all of them expect to be invited back hosting is not one of my skills essie on the other hand really likes it so over the years we worked out a good way to handle guests its very simple i hang around them as long as i am enjoying itthat can be several hours sometimes five minutes then i disappear to my study and leave the hosting to essie i am particularly likely to do this when for any reason there is tension among the guests it works finefor me but then it stops working sometimes and then im stuck this was one of the times i couldnt leave them to essie because essie was busy i didnt want to leave them alone because we had already done that for a goodish long period and of tension there was plenty so there i was trying to remember how to be gracious when i didnt have a failback position would you like a drink i asked jovially something to eat there are some good programs to watch if essie hasnt killed the circuits so she can deal with albert janie yeexing interrupted me with a question where are we going mr broadhead well i said beamingjovial good host try to make the guests feel at ease even when they ask you a perfectly good question that you havent thought of an answer for because youve been thinking about a lot of more urgent things i guess the question is where would you like to go i mean it looks like theres no point in chasing after the sailship no yeexing agreed then i suppose its up to you i didnt think youd want to stay in the guardhouse reminding them that id done them all a favor after all no yeexing said again back to the earth then we could drop you at one of the loop points or gateway if you like orlets see audee youre from venus in the first place right do you want to go back there it was waltherss turn to say no he left it at that i thought it was very inconsiderate of my guests to give me nothing but negatives when i was trying to be hospitable to them dolly walthers bailed me out she raised her right hand and it had one of those hand puppets pf hers on it the one that was supposed to look like a heechee the trouble is mr broadhead she said not moving her lips in a syrupy snaky kind of voice none of us have any place much to go to since that was obviously true nobody seemed to have anything to say to it then audee stood up ill take that drink now broadhead he growled dolly janie it was obviously the best idea any of us had had in some time we all agreed like guests arriving too early at a party finding something to do so we would not obviously be doing nothing there were things to do to be sure and the biggest of them in my mind was not to be cordial to my company that biggest thing wasnt even trying to assimilate the fact that we had seen an actual operating heechee vessel with heechee inside it it was my gut again the doctors said i could lead a normal life they hadnt said anything about one as abnormal as this so i was feeling my age and frailty i was glad to take my gin and water and sit down next to the makebelieve fireplace with its makebelieve flames and wait for someone else to carry the ball which turned out to be audee walthers broadhead i appreciate your getting us out of stir and i know youve got things of your own to do i suppose the best thing is for you to set all three of us down in the handiest place you can find and go about your business well there are lots of places audee isnt there one youd like better than another what i would like he said what i think we would all like is to have a chance to figure out what we want to do by ourselves i guess youve noticed weve got some personal problems that need to get worked out that is not the kind of statement you want to agree to and i certainly couldnt deny it so i just smiled so what we need is a chance to get off by ourselves and talk about them ah i said nodding i guess we didnt give you enough time when essie and i left you alone you left us alone your friend albert didnt albert it had never occurred to me that he would present himself to guests especially without being invited all the time broadhead said waithers bitterly sitting right where you are now asking dolly a million questions i shook my head and held out my glass for a refill it probably wasnt a good idea but i didnt have any ideas that i thought were good when i was young and my mother was dyingbecause she couldnt afford medical care for both of us guilt guilt guilt and decided to get it for me there was a time when she didnt recognize me didnt remember my name talked to me as though i were her boss or the landlord or some guy shed dated before she married my father a bad scene it was almost worse to have her that way than to know she was dying a solid figure crumbling before my eyes the way albert was crumbling now what kind of questions did he ask i asked looking at dolly oh about wan she said fiddling with the hand puppets but speaking with her own voicethough still without moving her lips much about where he was going what he was doing mostly he wanted me to show him all the objects wan was interested in on the charts show me i said i cant run that thing she said peevishly but janie yeexing got up and was at the controls before she finished talking she touched the display board frowned punched out a combination scowled and turned back to the rest of us mrs broadhead must have locked it when she took your pilot out of the circuit she said anyway said dolly it was all black holes one kind or another i thought there only was one kind i said and she shrugged we were all clustered around the control seat looking up at the viewplate which was showing nothing but stars damn him i said and from behind us alberts voice said frostily i am sorry if i have inconvenienced you robin we all turned like the figures in one of those old german town clocks he was sitting on the edge of the seat i had just vacated studying us he looked different younger less selfassured he was turning a cigar in his handscigar not the pipeand his expression was somber i thought essie was working on you i saidi am sureirritably she has finished robin she is coming now in fact i think it is fair for me to say that she found nothing wrongisnt that right mrs broadhead essie came in the door and stopped there her fists were on her hips her eyes fastened on albert she didnt even look at me is right program she declared gloomily have found no programing error i am glad to hear that mrs broadhead do not be glad fact remains you are one screwedup program so tell me intelligent program with no fault in programing what is next step the hologram actually licked its lips nervously why said albert hesitantly i would suppose you might want to check the hardware precisely said essie as she reached to pull his datafan out of its socket i could swear i saw a fleeting expression of panic on alberts face the look of a man going under the anesthetic for major surgery then it disappeared with the rest of him go on talking she ordered over her shoulder putting a loupe in her eye and beginning to scan the surface of the fan but what was there to talk about we watched while she studied every corrugation of the fan we drifted after her when scowling she took the fan to her workroom and watched silently while she touched the fan with calipers and probes plugged it in a test socket pressed buttons turned verniers read results off the scales i stood there rubbing my belly which had begun to be unpleasant to me again and audee whispered whats she looking for but i didnt know a nick a scratch corrosion anything and whatever it was she didnt find it she stood up sighing is nothing there she said thats good i offered thats good she agreed because if was anything serious i could not fix here but is also bad robin because is obvious that buggery program is all bugged to hell has taught me lesson in humility this dolly offered are you sure hes busted mrs broadhead while you were in the other room he seemed coherent enough a little peculiar maybe peculiar dollylady all the time i check him you know what hes talking about machs hypothesis missing mass black holes blacker than regular black holes would need to be a real albert einstein to understandhey whats that was talking to you and when she had heard confirmation from the others she sat with her lips compressed in thought for some time then she shook hersell oh hell she said dismally is no good to try to guess at problem is only one person who knows what is wrong with albert and that is albert himself and what if albert wont tell you i asked is wrong question she said plugging in the fan proper question is what if albert cant he looked all rightalmost all right anyway he sat fumbling with his cigar in his favorite chairwhich was also my own favorite seat but at that moment i was not disposed to argue it with him now albert she said her tone kindly but firm you know you are screwed up correct a little aberrant i think yes he said apologetically aberrant as all hell i think well now here is what we do albert first we ask you some simple factual questionsnot about motivations not about hard theoretical stufl only questions that can be resolved by objective facts you understand certainly i understand mrs broadhead right first understand you were chatting with guests while robin and i were in captains chambers that is correct mrs broadhead she pursed her lips strikes me as unusual behavior no you were questioning them please tell us what questions were and your answers albert shifted position uneasily mostly i was interested in the objects wan was investigating mrs broadhead mrs walthers was good enough to pick them out for me on the charts he pointed at the display and when we looked at it sure enough it was showing a series of charts one after another if you look at them carefully said albert pointing with his unsmoked cigar you will see that there is a definite progression his first targets were simple black holes which are indicated on the heechee charts by these marks like flshhooks those are danger signs in the heechee cartography how you know this essie demanded and then no purge that question i assume you have good reason for this assumption i do mrs broadhead i have not been entirely forthcoming with you in this respect hal are getting somewhere now continue yes mrs broadhead the simple black holes each had two check marks then wan investigated a naked singularitya nonrotating black hole in fact the one that robin himself had such a terrible experience with many years ago it was there that he found gellekiara moynlin the image flickered then showed the naked blue ghost star before returning to the chart this one has three flshhooks meaning more danger and flnallywave of the hand the picture altering to show a different section of the heechee chartthis is the one mrs walthers identified for me as the one wan was heading for next i didnt say that dolly objected no mrs walthers albert agreed but you did say that he looked at it frequently that he discussed it with his dead men and that it terrified him i believe that it is the one he is aiming at very fine applauded essie have passed first test admirably albert now will proceed with second part without this time participation from audience she added glancing at dolly im at your service mrs broadhead to be sure you are now factual questions what is meant by term missing mass albert looked uneasy but he responded promptly enough the socalled missing mass is that quantity of mass which would account for various galactic orbits but has never been observed excellent now what is machs hypothesis he licked his lips i am not really comfortable with speculative discussions about quantum mechanics mrs broadhead i have difficulty believing that god plays dice with the universe have not asked for belief keep to rules albert am only asking for definition of widely used technical term he sighed and shifted position very well mrs broadhead but allow me to put it in tangible terms there is reason to believe that some sort of very largescale tampering is going on with the expansioncontraction cycle of the universe the expansion is being reversed the contraction is being made to proceed it would appear to a single pointthe same as before the big bang and what was that essie demanded he shuffled his feet i really am getting quite nervous mrs broadhead he complained but you can answer the questionin terms of what is generally believed at what point mrs broadhead what is believed now what was believed let us say before the days of hawking and those other quantum people there is one definite statement about the universe at its very beginning but it is a religious one albert said essie warningly he grinned wealdy i was only going to quote st augustine of hippo he said when he was asked what god was doing before he created the universe he replied that he was creating hell for people who asked that question albert oh very well he said irritably yes it is thought that prior to some very early timeno later than the fraction one over of a second before itrelativity can no longer account for the physics of the universe and some sort of quantum correction must be made i am getting quite tired of this schoolboy quiz mrs broadhead i have not often seen essie shocked albert she cried again in a quite different tone not warning astonished and disconcerted yes albert he said savagely that is who you created and who i am let us stop this please have the goodness to listen i do not know what happens before the big bang i only know that there is someone somewhere who thinks he does know and can control it this frightens me very much mrs broadhead frightens gasped essie who has programed to be frightened in you albert you have mrs broadhead i cant live with that and i do not wish to discuss it further and he winked out he didnt have to do that he could have spared our feelings he could have pretended to exit through a door or disappeared when we were looking the other way he didnt do either of those things he just vanished it was just as though he were a truly real human being in just such a spat finishing it off by flouncing out and slamming the door in anger he was too angry to be careful of appearances is not supposed to lose temper said essie dismally but he had and the shock of that was not nearly as great as the shock that came when we discovered that the viewscreen still would not respond to its controls and neither would the piloting board albert had locked them both we were heading at a steady acceleration toward we did not know what unwanted encounter the phone was tinging in wans ship well it was not really a phone and it certainly wasnt ringing but there was the signal to show that someone was directing a message to the ship on the ftl radio off shouted wan waking up indignantly from his sleep i will speak to no one and then somewhat more awake he looked not only angry but puzzled it has been turned off he said staring at the ftl radio and the look on his face went the rest of the way across the spectrum to fear what makes wan less than loathsome to me i think is that ulcer of fear that ate away at him always heaven knows he was a brute he was surly he was a thief he cared for nothing but himself but that only means that he was what we all once were but we are socialized out of it by parents and playmates and school and police no one had ever social ized wan and so he was still a child i will speak to no one he shouted and woke klara i can see klara as she was then since now i can see so much that was hidden she was tired she was irritable and she had had all of wan any person could be expected to stand you might as well answer it she said and wan glared at her as though she were insane answer of course i shall not answer it is only at most some interfering bureaucrat to complain that i have not followed the exact proper procedures to complain that you stole the ship she corrected mildly and crossed to the ffl radio how do you answer it she asked do not be foolish he howled wait stop what are you doing is it this lever she asked and his yell was answer enough he leaped across the tiny cabin but she was larger than he and stronger she fended him off the signal chirp stopped the golden light went off and wan suddenly relaxing laughed out loud ho what a fool you are there is no one there he cried b it he was wrong there was a hissing sound for a moment then recognizable wordsalmost recognizable at least a shrill and queerly stressed voice said i fill to you no harrum for klara to understand what had been said took considerable thought and then when she had understood it it did not achieve its desired effect was it what it sounded like some stranger with a terrible hissing speech impediment trying to say i will do you no harm and why would he say that to be reassured that you are not in danger at a time when you had no reason to think you were is not reassuring wan was scowling what is it he cried sharply beginning to sweat who is there what do you want there was no answer the reason there was no answer was that captain had used up his entire vocabulary and was busy rehearsing his next speech to wan and klara however the silence had more meaning than the words the screen wan cried foolish woman use the screen find out what this is it took time for kiara to work the controls the use of the heechee vision screen was a skill she had only begun to acquire on this voyage since no one in her time had known how to operate it it clarified to display a ship a big one the biggest kiara bad ever seen far larger than any of the fives that had operated out of gateway in her time what whatwhat whimpered wan and only on the fourth try managed to complete it what is it kiara didnt try to answer she didnt know she feared though she feared that it was the sight every gateway prospector had both longed for and dreaded and when captain finished rehearsing and delivered his next speech she was sure i cummin aboreud tchew coming aboard for one ship to dock with another in full drive was not impossible kiara knew it had been done but no earthly pilot had had much practice in doing it dont let him in shrieked wan run away hide do something he glared at klara in terror then made a lunge for the controls dont be a fool she yelled springing to intercept him klara was a strong woman but he was all she could handle just then mad fear made him strong he flailed out at her and sent her reeling and weeping with fear leaped at the controls in the terror of this unexpected contact klara nevertheless had room for another stabbing fear everything she had learned about heechee ships had taught her that sou never never tried to change course once it was established newer skills had made it possible to do it she knew but she also knew that it was not to be done lightly only after careful calculation and planning and wan was in no shape for either of those and even soit made no difference the great sharkshaped ship moved closer in spite of herself kiara watched admiringly as the pilot of the other ship matched course change and velocity increment without difficulty it was a technically fascinating process wan froze at the controls watching it mouth open slobbering then when the other ship loomed large and disappeared below the view of the scanners and there was a grating sound from the lander hatch he bellowed in fear and dove for the toilet kiara was alone as she saw the lander hatch open and fall back and so it was gelleklara moynlin who was the first human being to stand in the presence of a heechee it rose from the hatch stood erect and confronted her less tall than she reeking of something ammoniacal its eyes were round because that is the best design for an organ that must rotate in any direction but they were not human eyes there was no concentric ring of pigment around a central pupil there was no pupil just a crossshaped blotch of darkness in the middle of a pinkish marble that stared at her its pelvis was wide slung below the pelvis between what would have been its thighs if its legs had been articulated in a human way was a capsule of bright blue metal as much as anything else the heechee looked like a diapered toddler with a load in its pants that thought penetrated through kiaras terror and eased itminutelybrieflynot enough as the creature moved forward she leaped back as klara moved the heechee moved too it started as the hatch cover moved again and another one of them came through from the tension and hesitancy of its movements it seemed to kiara that it was nearly as frightened as she and so she said not with the expectation of being understood but because it was impossible for her to say nothing hello there the creature studied her a forked tongue licked the shiny black wrinkles of its face it made a strange purring sound as though it were thinking then in something close to recognizable english it said i em heetsee i fill to you no harrum it gazed with fascination and repugnance at klara then chittered briskly to the other one who began to search the vessel they found wan without trouble and without trouble moved both klara and wan down through the hatch through the connected landers into the heechee ship kiara heard the batches scrape closed and then a moment later felt the lurch that meant that wans ship had been cast free she was a captive of the heechee in a heechee ship they did not harm her if they were intending to do it at least they were in no hurry about it there were five of them and they were very busy what they were busy at kiara could not guess and apparently the one with the limited english vocabulary was too busy at it to take time for the laborious task of explaining what they really wanted from kiara at that moment was for her to stay out of the way they had no trouble communicating that to her they unceremoniously took her by the arm with a leathery and painful grip and shoved her where they wanted her wan gave them no trouble at all he lay huddled in a corner with his eyes tightly closed when he discovered that klara was nearby he peered at her with one eye poked her in the spine to get her attention and whispered did he really mean he wouldnt harm us do you think she shrugged he whimpered almost inaudibly then relapsed into his fetal crouch she saw with disgust that a trickle of saliva was coming out of the side of his mouth he was the next thing to catatonic if there was anyone to help her that was not wan she would have to face the heechee alonewhatever it might be that they intended but what was happening was fascinating so much was new to kiaral she had spent the decades of rapid accretion of heechee technology whirling at very nearly lightspeed around the core of the black hole her acquaintance with heechee vessels was limited to the antiques she and i and the other prospectors had operated out of gateway this was something else it was a lot bigger than a five it far outshone even wans private yacht in its fittings it didnt have one control panel it had threeof course kiara did not know that two of them were for purposes other than piloting the ship itself those two possessed instruments and operating readouts she had never seen before not only was it eight or ten times the cubic volume of a five but relatively less of the space was taken up with equipment it was possible to move about it quite freely it had the standard featuresthe wormshaped thing that glowed during fasterthanlight travel the vshaped seats and so on but it also had blueglowing boxes that whined and peeped and flickered with lights and a different sort of wormshaped crystal that wan told her terrified was for digging into black holea above all it had heechee heechee the seiniinythfcal perplexing nearly divine heechee no human being had ever seen one or even a picture and here was gelleklara moynlin with no less than five of them all about hergrowling and hissing and tweeting and smelling quite strange they looked strange too they were smaller than human beings and their very wide pelvises gave them a gait like a walking skeleton their skin was plasticsmooth and mostly dark though there were patches and curlicues of bright gold and scarlet that looked like indian war paint their physiology was not merely lean it was gaunt there was not much flesh on those quick strong limbs and fingers although their faces seemed as though they were carved out of shiny plastic they were at least resilient enough to allow for facial expression though klara could not be sure what the expressions represented and swinging below the crotches of every one of them male and female alike was a great coneshaped thing at first klara thought it was part of their bodies but when one of them disappeared into what she assumed was some sort of toilet it fussed for a moment and removed the cone was it something like a knapsack a pocketbook an attache case to carry papers pencils and a brownbag lunch whatever it was it came off when they wanted it off and when it was on it explained one of the great puzzles of heechee anatomy namely how they managed to sit down on those incredibly painful vshaped seats it was their dependent cones that filled the vshaped gap the heechee themselves perched comfortably on the top of the cones kiara for decades the heechee prayer fans were a mystery we did not know that they were actually their equivalent of books and datastores because the greatest minds of the time could not find a way to read them or even to find indications that they contained anything to be read the reason was that although scansion was simple enough it could only take place in the presence of a background microwave radiation the heechee themselves had no problem with that because their cones produced the proper radiation all the time since they were always in some sort of contact with the datafans that contained the stored memories of their ancestors held in their cones human beings could be excused for not guessing that the heechee carried data between their legs for human anatomy would not allow such a thing shook her head wonderingall the idle guesses and jokes on the subject in gateway why had no one ever thought of that she felt wans hot breath on the back of her neck what are they doing he demanded she had almost forgotten he was there she had almost forgotten even to be afraid so fascinated was she by what she saw that was not prudent who could tell what these monsters would do with their human captives for that matter who could guess what they were doing now they were all buzzing and chirping in an agitated way the four larger ones clustered around the smaller fifth the one with blue and yellow markings on itsno definitely on herupper arms all five of them were paying no attention to the humans just now they were concentrating on one of the display panels which was showing a star chart that klara thought vaguely familiar a group of stars and around them a cluster of check markshadnt wan displayed such a pattern on his own screen im hungry wan growled sullenly in her ear hungry kiara pulled sharply away from him astonishment as much as revulsion hungry she was nearly sick to her stomach with fear and worryand she realized a queer odor half ammonia and half rotting stump that seemed to come from the heechee themselves besides she had to go to the bathroom and this other monster could think of nothing but that he was hungry please shut up she said over her shoulder and touched off wans always available fury what me shut up he demanded no you shut up foolish woman he almost stood up to tower over her but got no farther than a crouch quickly groveling back to the floor for one of the heechee looked up and came toward them it stood over them for a moment its wide narrowlipped mouth working as it rehearsed what it was about to say be fair it pronounced distinctly and waved a skinny arm toward the viewscreen klara swallowed laughter nervously trying to bubble out of her throat be fair to whom for what be fair it said again for dese are sass sass sins so there was klara my truest love that was she had suffered in a matter of weeks the terror of the black hole the shock of losing decades of the worlds life the misery of wan the intolerable trauma of being taken by the heechee and meanwhile and meanwhile i had problems of my own i had not yet been vas tened and did not know where she was i did not hear the warning to beware of the assassins i didnt then know that the assassins existed i couldnt reach out to comfort her in her fearnot just because i didnt know but because i was full of fears of my own and the worst of them did not involve kiara or the heechee or even my aberrant program albert einstein it was in my own belly abandoned by albert nothing worked we tried everything essie pulled alberts fan from its socket but he had locked the controls so that even without him we could change nothing essie set up another piloting program and tried to insert it it was locked out we shouted his name and scolded and begged him to appear he would not for days that seemed like weeks we kept going guided by the nonexistent hands of my nonfunctioning dataretrieval system albert einstein and meanwhile the nutkid wan and the dark lady of my dreams were in the spaceship of captains heechee crew and behind us the worlds were stewing and grumbling toward a violence too large to be accommodated they were not what occupied our minds our worries were closer to hand food water air wed stocked the true love for long cruises much longer than this but not for five people we werent doing nothing we were doing everything we could think to do walthers and yeexing tinkered together piloting programs of their owntried themcould not override what albert had done essie did more than any of us for albert was her creation and she would not could not admit herself beaten check and recheck write test programs and watch them come up blank she hardly slept she copied alberts entire program into a spare datafan and tried thatstill hoping you see that the fault was mechanical somewhere but if so it carried over into the new storage dolly walthers uncomplainingly fed the rest of us stayed out of our way when we thought we might be getting somewhere and let us talk ideas out when we were stumped and i had the hardest job of all albert was my program said essie and if he would reply to anyone he would reply to me so i sat there and talked to him talked to the air really because i had no evidence at all that he was listening as i reasoned with him chatted with him called his name yelled at him begged him he did not answer not even a ificker in the air when we took a break for food essie came to stand behind me and rub my shoulders it was my larynx that was wearing out but i appreciated the thought at least she said shakily to the air more than to me must know what hes doing i think must realize supplies are limited must provide for return to civilization for us because albert could not deliberately let us die the words were a statement the tone wasnt im certain of it i said but did not turn around so that she could see my face i too she said in a dismal tone as i pushed away my plate and dolly to change the subject said in a motherly way dont you like my cooking essies fingers stopped massaging my shoulders and dug in robin you dont eat and they were all looking at me it was actually funny we were out in the middle of nowhere at all with no good way of getting home and four people were staring at me because i didnt eat my dinner it was essie of course clucking over me in the early stages of the trip before albert went mute they suddenly realized that i might not be well in point of fact i wasnt i tired quickly my arms felt tingly as though they had gone to sleep i had no appetitehad not eaten much for days and bad escaped notice only because usually we ate in quick gobbles when we found time it helps to stretch out the supplies i smiled but nobody smiled back foolish robin hissed essie and her fingers left my shoulders to test the temperature of my forehead but that was not too bad because id been gulping aspirin when no one was looking i assumed an expression of patience im fine essie i said it wasnt exactly a liea little wishful thinking maybe but i wasnt sure i was sick i guess i should have been checked over but with albert out of commission for this albert who needs i craned my neck puzzled to look at essie for this need only subset medic program she said firmly subset she stamped her foot medic program legal program secretarial programall subsumed into albert program but can be accessed separately you call medic program this instant i gaped at her for a mox ient i couldnt speak while my mind raced do as i say she shouted and at last i found my voice not the medical program i cried theres something better than that and i turned around and bellowed to thin air sigfrid von shrink help i need you desperately there was a time in the year of my psychoanalysis when i hung on hooks while i waited for sigfrid to appear sometimes i had a real wait for in those days sigfrid was a patchedtogether program of heechee circuits and human software and none of the software was my wife essies essie was good at her trade the milliseconds of response time became nano pico femtoseconds so that albert could in real time respond as well as a humanwell hell no better than any human and so when sigfrid did not at once appear it was the feeling you get when you turn a switch and the light doesnt go on because its burned out you dont waste your time ificking the switch back and forth you know dont waste time said essie over my shoulder if a voice can be pale hers was i turned and smiled shakily at her i guess things are worse than we thought i said her face was pale all right i put my hand on hers takes me right back i said making conversation so that we would not have to face just how much worse things were when i was in analysis with sigfrid waiting for him to show up was the worst part i would always get uptight and well i was rambling i might have gone on doing it forever if i hadnt seen in essies eyes that i didnt have to i turned around and heard his voice at the same time i am sorry to hear that it was so difficult for you robin said sigfrid von shrink even for a holographic projection sigfrid looked rather poorly he was there with his hands clasped on his lap sitting uncomfortably on nothing at all the program had not troubled to furnish him with chair or pad nothing just sigfrid looking for one of the few times in my recollection of him quite ill at ease he gazed around at the five of us all staring at him and sighed before returning to me well robin he said would you like to tell me what is bothering you i could hear audee walthers take a breath to answer him and janie click her tongue to stop him because essie was shaking her head i didnt look at any of them i said sigfrid old tin whiz i have a problem thats right down your alley he looked at me under his brows yes robin its a case of fugue severe incapacitating i told him he nodded as though it were what he had been expecting i do prefer that you not use technical terms robin he sighed but his fingers were lacing and relacing themselves in his lap tell me is it yourself that you are asking me to help not really sigfrid i admitted the whole ballgame could have blown up then i think it almost did he was silent for a moment but not at all stillhis fingers snaked in and out of each other and there was a bluish sparkle in the air around the outlines of his body when he moved i said its a friend of mine sigfrid maybe the closest friend i have in the world and he is in bad trouble i see he said nodding as though he didwhich i expect was true enough i suppose you know he mentioned that your friend cannot be helped unless he is present hes present sigfrid i said softly yes he said i rather thought he was the fingers were still now and he leaned back as though there were a chair for him to lean against suppose you tell me about it andwith a smile which was the most welcome thing i had ever seen in my lifethis time robin you may use technical terms if you wish behind me i heard essie softly exhale and realized both of us bad been trying to hold our breaths i reached back for her hand sigfrid i said beginning to hope as i understand it the term fugue refers to a flight from reality if a person finds himself in a doublebind situationexcuse me i mean if he finds himself in a position when one very powerful drive is frustrated by another so he cant live with the conflicthe turns his back on it he runs away he pretends it doesnt exist i know im mixing up several different schools of psychotherapy here sigfrid but have i got the general idea right close enough robin at least i understand what you are saying an example of that might bei hesitatedperhaps someone very deeply in love with his wife who finds out that shes been having an affair with his best friend i felt essies fingers tighten on mine i hadnt hurt her feelings she was encouraging me you confuse drives and emotions robin but that doesnt matter what are you leading up to i didnt let him rush me or another example i said might be religious someone with a heartfelt faith who discovers there is no god do you follow me sigfrid its been an article of faith with him although he knows there are a lot of intelligent people who disagreeand then little by little he finds more pnd more support for their belief and finally its overwhelming he nodded politely listening but his fingers had begun to writhe again so finally he has to accept quantum mechanics i said and that was the second point at which it all could have gone right out the chute i think it nearly did the hologram ifickered badly for a moment and the expression on sigfrids face changed i cant say what it changed to it wasnt anything i recognized it was as though it had blurred and softened but when he spoke up his voice was steady when you talk about drives and fugues robin he said you are talking about human beings suppose the patient you are interested in isnt human he hesitated and then added quite i made an encouraging noise because i really didnt know where to go from there that is to say suppose he has these drives and emotions ah programed into him let us say but only the way a human can be programed to do something like speak a foreign language after he is fully grown the knowledge is there but it is imperfectly assimilated there is an accent he paused we are not human he said essies hand gripped mine tightly a warning albert is programed with a human personality i said yes as far as possible very far sigfrid agreed but his face was grave albert is still not human for no computer program is i mention only that none of us can experience for example the tpt when the human race is going mad with someone elses madness we feel nothing the ground was very delicate now thin ice crusted over a quagmire and if i stepped too roughly what might we all fall into essie held my hand strongly the others were hardly breathing i said sigfrid human beings are all different too but you used to tell me that that didnt matter a great deal you said the problems of the mind were in the mind and the cure for the problems was in there too all you did was help your patients bring them up to the surface where they could deal with them instead of keeping them buried where they could cause obsessions and neuroses and fugue it is true that i said that yes robin you just kicked the old machine sigfrid right to jar it loose from where it was stuck he grinneda pale grin but there that is close enough i suppose right so let me try a theory on you let me suggest that this friend of minei didnt dare name him again just thenthis friend of mine has a conflict he cant handle he is very intelligent and extremely well informed he has access to the best and latest knoiledge of science in particularall kinds of sciencephysics and astrophysics and cosmology and everything else since quantum mechanics is at the base of it he accepts quantum mechanics as validhe couldnt do the job he was programed to do without it thats basic to hisprograming i had almost said personality the grin was more pain than amusement now but he was still listening and at the same time sigfrid he has another layer of programing he has been taught to think like and behave liketo be as much as he can bea very inteffigent and wise person who has been dead for a hell of a long time and who happened to believe very strongly that quantum mechanics was all wrong i dont know if that would be enough of a conflict to damage a human being i said but it might do a lot of harm towella computer program there were actual beads of perspiration on sigfrids face now he nodded silently and i had a bright painful flashbackthe way sigfrid looked to me now was that how i had looked to sigfrid in those longago days when he was shrinking me is that possible i demanded it is a severe dichotomy yes he whispered and there i bogged down the thin ice had broken i was ankledeep in the quagmire i wasnt drowning yet but i was stuck i didnt know where to go next it broke my concentration i looked around helplessly at essie and the others feeling very old and very tiredand a lot unwell too i had been so wrapped up in the technical problem of shrinking my shrink that i had forgotten the pain in my belly and the numbness in my arms but they caine back on me now it wasnt working i didnt know enough i was absolutely certain that i bad uncovered the basic problem that had caused albert to fugueand nothing had come of it i dont know how long i would have sat there like a fool if i hadnt got help it came from two people at once trigger whispered essie urgently in my ear and at the same moment janie yeexing stirred and said tentatively there must have been a precipitating incident isnt that right sigfrids face became blank a hit a palpable hit what was it sigfrid i asked no response come on sigfrid old shrinking machine spit it out what was the thing that pushed albert out the airlock he looked me straight in the eye and yet i couldnt read his expression because his face became fuzzy it was almost as though it was a picture on the pv and something was breaking down in the circuits so the image was fading fading or fuguing sigfrid i cried please tell us what scared albert into running away or if you cant do that just get him here so we can talk to him more fuzz i couldnt even tell if he was looking at me anymore tell me i commanded and from that fuzzy holographic shadow came an answer the kugelblitz what whats a kugelblitz i stared around in frustration damn it get him here so he can tell us for himself is here robin whispered essie in my ear and the image sharpened again but it wasnt sigfrid anymore the neat freud face had softened and widened into the gentle pouchy german band leader and the white hair crowned the sad eyes of my best and closest friend i am here robin said albert einstein sorrowfully i thank you for your help i dont know if youll thank me though albert was right about that i didnt thank him albert was also wrong about that or right for wrong reasons because the reason i didnt thank him was not merely that what he said was so grisly unpleasant so scary incomprehensible but also that i was in no position to when he had finished my position wasnt much better when he began because the letdown when he came back let me down all the way i was drained exhausted it was perfectly expectable that i should be exhausted i told myself because god knew it had been about as stressful a strain as i had ever been through but it felt worse than simple exhaustion it felt terminal it wasnt just my belly or my arms or my head it was as though all the power were draining out of all my batteries at once and it took all the concentration i could get together to pay attention to what he was saying i was not precisely in fugue as you call it he said turning the unlit pipe over in his fingers he had not bothered to be comical he was wearing sweatshirt and slacks but his feet were in shoes and the shoelaces were tied it is true that the dichotomy existed and that it rendered me vulnerableyou will understand mrs broadhead a contradiction in my programing i found myself looping since you made me homeostatic there was another imperative to repair the malfunction essie nodded regretfully homeostasis yes but selfrepair implies selfdiagnosis should have consulted me for check i thought not mrs broadhead he said with all respect the difficulties were in areas in which i am better equipped to function than you cosmology ha i stirred myself to speakit wasnt easy because the lethargy was strong would you mind please just saying what you did albert he said slowly what i did is easy robin i decided to try to resolve these conflicts i know they seem more important to me than to you you can be quite happy without settling cosmological questions but i cannot i devoted more and more of my capacity to study as you may not know i included a great many heechee fans in the datastores for this ship some of which had never been analyzed properly it was a very difficult task and at the same time i was making observations of my own what you did albert i begged but that is what i did in the heechee datastores i found many references to what we have called the missing mass you remember robin that mass which the universe should have to account for its gravitational behavior but which no astronomer has been able to find i remember yes well i may have found it he sat brooding for a moment im afraid that this did not solve my problem though it made it worse if you had not been able to reach me through your clever little trick of talking through my subset sigfrid i might be looping yet found what i cried the flowing adrenaline almost but not quite took my mind off the way my body was notifying me of its troubles he waved a hand at the viewscreen and i saw there was something on it in that first quick glance what i saw on the screen did not make sense and when i did give it a second look and a more careful one what stopped me cold and staring was not what was important the screen showed mostly nothing at all there was a corner of a whirlpool of light at one edge of ita galaxy of course i thought it looked like m in andromeda as much as anything but i am no expert in galaxies especially when i see them without any spattering of stars around them and there was no such spattering here there was something like stars little points of light here and there but they werent stars because they were winking and flickering like christmastree lights thinktf a couple dozen fireflies on a cold night so they arent flashing their little passionate pleas very often quite far away so that they arent easy to see that was what they looked like the most conspicuous object among them still not very conspicuous was something that looked a little like the nonrotating black hole i had once lost klara in but not as large and not as threatening and all of this was queer but it was not what shocked a gasp out of me i heard noises from the others too its a ship dolly whispered shakily and so it was albert said so he turned around gravely that is a ship yes mrs walthers he said it is in fact the heechee ship we saw before i am nearly certain i have been wondering if i could establish communication with it communication with the heechee albert i shouted i know youre crazy but dont you realize how dangerous that is as to danger he said somberly i am much more afraid of the kugelblitz kugelblitz i had lost my temper completely albert you horses ass i dont know what a kugelblitz is and i dont much care what i care about is that youve damn near killed us all and i stopped because essies hand on my mouth stopped me shut up robin she hissed you want drive him to fugue again now albert she said quite calmly yes please tell us what is kugelblitz that thing looks to me like black hole actually he passed a hand over his forehead the central object you mean yes it is a kind of black hole but there is not one black hole there there are many i have not been able to count how many since they cannot be detected except when there is some infall of matter to produce radiation and there is not much matter out here between galaxies between galaxies cried waithers and then stopped with essies eyes on him yes albert please go on she encouraged i do not know how many black holes are present in excess of ten probably in excess of ten squared all in all he glanced at me beseechingly robin do you have any idea how strange that is how can one account for this i not only cant account for it i dont even know what a kugelblitz is oh good heavens robin he said impatiently we have discussed this sort of thing before a black hole results from the collapse of matter to an extraordinary density john wheeler was the first person to predict the existence of another form of black hole containing not matter but energyso much energy so densely packed that its own mass pulled space around it that is called a kugelblitz he sighed then said i have two speculatioiis the first is that this entire construct is an artifact the kugelblitz is surrounded by black holes i think to attract any loose matterof which there is not much here in the first placeto keep it from falling into the kugelblitz itself the second speculation is that i think we may be looking at the missing mass i jumped up albert i cried do you know what youre saying you mean somebody made that thing you mean i jumped up and did not finish the sentence i did not finish the sentence because i couldnt part of the reason was that there were too many scary notions floating around in my head for if someone had made the kugelblitz and if the kugelblitz was part of this missing mass then the obvious conclusion was that somebody was tampering with the laws of the universe itself trying to reverse the expansion for reasons that i could not guess the other reason was that i fell over i fell over because for some reason my legs would not support me there was a blinding pain in the side of my head just about the ear everything went all gray and swimmy i heard alberts voice cry out oh robin i havent been paying attention to your physical state my what i asked or tried to ask it didnt come out well my lips i did tell robin seveial times what a kugelblitz wasa black hole caused by the collapse of a large quantity of energy rather than a large quantity of matterbut as nobody had ever seen one he didnt really listen i also told him about the general state of intergalactic spacevery little free matter or energy barring scanty photon flux from distant galaxies and of course the universal k radiationwhich is what made it such a good place to put a kugelblitz when you didnt want anything else to fall into it did not seem to want to form the words properly and i felt suddenly very sleepy that first quick explosion of localized pain had come and gone but there was a distant awareness of pain oh yes big pain not very far away and rapidly coming closer they say that there is a selective amnesia for pain you dont remember that rootcanal job except almost fondly as a humorously rotten experience if it were not for this they say no woman would have more than one child that is true for most of you i suppose im sure it was true for me for a good many years but not now now i remember very clearly indeed and yes it is with almost humorous affection what had happened in my head had provided its own anesthesia and what i experienced was unclear but i remember that unclearness with great clarity i remember the panicky talk and being hauled to a couch i remember long dialogues and the tiny bite of needles as albert fed me medication and took samples of me and i remember essie sobbing she was cradling my head in her lap though she was talking past me to albert and mostly in russian i heard my name often enough to know she was talking about me i tried to reach up to pat her cheek im dying i saidor tried to say she understood me she leaned over me her long hair drifting across my face very dear robin she crooned is true yes you are dying or your body is but that does not mean an end to you now we had discussed religion from time to time over the decades wed been together i knew her beliefs i even knew my own essie i wanted to say youve never lied to me before you dont have to do it now to try to ease dying for me its all right but all that came out was something like does so tears dripped over my face as she rocked me crooning no truly no dearest robin is a chance a very good chance i made a tremendous effort there is no hereafter i said strongly spacing the words out with the best articulation i could manage it may not have been clear but she understood me she bent and kissed my forehead i felt her lips move against my skin as she whispered yes is a hereafter now or maybe she said a here after is there life after death and the stars sailed on they didnt care what was happening to one biped m mm iian intelligentwell semiintelligentliving thing simply because it happened to be me i have always subscribed to the egocentric view of cosmology im in the middle and everything ranges itself on one side of me or another normal is what i am important is what is near to me significant is what i perceive as important that was the view i subscribed to but the universe didnt it went right on as though i didnt matter at all the truth is that i didnt matter just then even to me because i was out of it a good many thousand lightyears behind us on earth general manzbergen was chasing another batch of terrorists who had hijacked a launch shuttle and the commissaris had caught the man who had taken a shot at me i didnt know and if had known wouldnt have cared a lot closer but still as far from us as antares is from earth gelleklara moynlin was trying to make sense of what the heechee were telling her i didnt know that either very close to hand indeed my wife essie was trying to do something she had never done before though she had invented the process with the help of albert who had the entire process in his datastores but had not hands to do it with about that i would have cared a great deal if i had known what they were doing but i couldnt know of course since i was dead i did not however stay that way when i was little my mother used to read me stories there was one about a man whose senses were somehow scrambled after a brain operation i dont remember who wrote it verne wells one of those biggies from the golden agesomebody what i remember is the punch line the man comes out of the operation so that he sees sound and hears touch and the end of the story is him asking what smells purple that was a story told me when i was little now i was big it was not a story anymore it was a nightmare sensory impressions were battering at me and i couldnt tell what they were i cant describe them now for that matter any more than i can describe smerglitch do you know what smerglitch is no neither do i because i just made the word up its only a word it has no meaning until it is invested with one and neither did any of the colors sounds pressures chills pulls twitches itches squirmings burnings yearningsthe billion quantum units of impression that were assaulting naked tender me i didnt know what they meant or were or threatened i dont know what to compare it to even maybe being born is like that i doubt it i dont think any of us would survive it if it were but i survived i survived because of only one reason it was impossible for me not to its the oldest rule in the book you cant knock up a pregnant woman and you cant kill someone who is dead already i survived because all that part of me that could be killed had been do you have the picture try to see it flayed assaulted and most of all aware i was decil among the other stories my mother read me was dantes inferno and what i sometimes wonder was whether dante had some prevision of what it would be like for me for if not where did he get his description of hell how long this lasted i did not know but it seemed forever then everything dwindled the piercing lights moved farther away and paler the terrifying sounds were quieter the itches and squeezes and turbulences diminished fbr a long time there was nothing at all like carlsbad caverns in that scary moment when they turn off all the lights to teach you what dark is there was no light there was nothing but a distant confused mumbling that might have been the circulation of blood around the stirrups and anvil in my ears if i had had ears and then the mumbling began to hint of a voice and words and from a long way off the voice of albert einstein robin i tried to remember how to speak robin robin my friend do you hear me yes i shouted and do not know how im here as though i knew where here was a long pause then alberts voice again still faint but sounding closer robin he said each word spaced as though for a tiny child robin listen you are safe safe you are safe he repeated i am blocking for you i did not answer had nothing to say i will teach you now robin he said a little at a time be patient robin soon you will be able to see and hear and understand patient i could be nothing but patient i had no other options but to patiently endure while he taught me i trusted old albert even then i accepted his word that he could teach the deaf to hear and the blind to see but was there any way to teach the dead to live i do not particularly want to relive that next little eternity by alberts time and the time of the cesium clocks that concerted the human parts of the galaxy it tookhe sayseightyfour hours and a bit by his time not by mine by mine it was endless although i remember very well i remember some things only distautly not from incapacity from desire and also from the fact of velocity let me explain that the quick exchange of bits and bytes within the core of a datastore goes much faster than the organic life i had left behind it blurs the past with layers of new data and you know thats just as well because the more remote that terrible transition is from my now the better i like it if i am unwilling to retrieve some of the early parts of that data at least the first part that i am willing to look at is a big one how big big albert says i anthropomorphize probably i do wheres the harm i spent most of my life in the morph of an anthropos after all and old habits die hard so when albert had stabilized me and i wasi guess the only word is vastenedit was as a human anthropomorphic being that i visualized myself assuming of course that the human being were huger than galaxies older than stars and as wise as all the billions of us have learned to be i beheld the local groupour galaxy and its nextdoor neighborsas one little clot in a curdling sea of energy and mass i could see all of it but what i looked at was home the mother galaxy and m beside it with the magellanic clouds nestling nearby and all the other little clouds and globules and tufts and fluffs of streaky gas and starshine andthe anthropomorphic part isi reached out to touch them and cup them and run my fingers through them as though i were god i was not really god or even sufficiently godlike to be able really to touch any galaxies i couldnt touch anything at all not having anything to touch them with it was all illusion and optics like albert lighting his pipe there was nothing there no albert and no pipe and no me not really i was not operatively godlike because i did not have any tangible existence i could not create the heavens and the earth nor destroy them i could not affect even the least part of them in any physical way at all but i could behold them most splendidly from outside or in i could stand at the center of my home system and see peering past masei and the millions and zillions of other groups and galaxies stretching out in speckled immensity to the optical ends of the universe where fleeing star clusters run away faster than light can return to display them and beyond that too though what i could see beyond the optical limit was not really much differentand not really albert tells me any more than a hypothesis in the heechee memory stores i was tapping for of course thats all it was old robin hadnt suddenly swelled immense it was just the paltry remrnns of robinette broadhead who at that point was no more than a clutter of chained memory bits swimming around in the sea of datastores in the library of the true love a voice broke into my immense and eternal reverie alberts voice robin are you all right i did not want to lie to him no nowhere near all right it will get better robin i hope so i said albert yes i dont blame you for going crazy i said if this is what you were going through silence for a moment then the ghost of a chuckle robin he said you havent seen yet what drove me crazy i cannot say how long all of this took i dont know that the concept of time meant anything for at the electronic level which is where i was dwelling the time scale does not map well against anything real much time is wasted the stored electronic intelligence does not operate as efficiently as the machinery we are all born with an algorithm is not a good substitute for a synapse on the other hand things move a lot faster down in subparticle land where the femtosecond is a unit that can be felt if you multiply the pluses and factor in the minuses youd have to say that i was living somewhere between ten and ten thousand times as fast as i was used to of course there are objective measures of real timeby which i mean thee love time essie marked the minutes very carefully to prepare a corpse for the queasy semistorage of her here after chain took many hours to prepare that particular stiff which happened to be me for the somewhat better storage she was able to arrange in the datafan exactly like alberts own datafan took a great deal longer when her part in it was done she sat and waited with a drink in her hand that she didnt drink and attempts at conversation from audee and janie and dolly that she didnt hear although sometimes she answered something that they didnt hear either it was not a jolly party on the true love while they waited to see if anything at all remained to access of the late robinette broadhead and it took all in all more than three days and a half for me in that world of spin and charm and color and forbidden orbits where i was now transported to exist it waswell call it forever it seemed that way what you must do albert commanded is learn how to use your inputs and outputs oh swell i cried gratefully is that all gosh sounds like nothing at all sigh i am glad you retain your sense of humor he said and what i heard was because youll damn well need il youve got to work now im afraid it is not easy for me to go on encapsulating you this way enwhat protecting you robin he said impatiently limiting your access so that you wont suffer from too much confusion and disorientation albert i said are you out of your mind ive seen the whole universe youve only seen what i was accessing myself robin thats not good enough i cant control access for you forever you have to learn to do it for yourself so im going to lower my guard a little for you when youre ready i braced myself im ready but i hadnt braced myself enough you would not believe how much it hurt the chirping chittering bitching demanding voices of all the inputs assaulted mywell assaulted those loci in a nonspatial geometry that i still persisted in thinking of as my ears it was torture was it as bad as that first naked exposure to everything at once no it was worse in that terrible first blast of sensation i had had one thing going for me i had not then learned to identify noise as sound or pain as pain now i knew i knew pain when i felt it please albert i screamed what is it these are only the datastores accessible to you robin he said soothingly only the fans on board the true love plus telemetry plus some inputs from the sensors to the ship and crew itself make them stop i cant there was real compassion in his voice though really no voice existed you have to do it robin you have to select what stores you wish to access pick out just one of them and block out the others do what i begged more confused than ever select just one robin he said patiently some are our own datastores some are heechee fans some are other things you have to learn how to interface with them interface to consult them robin as though they were reference volumes in a library as though they were books on shelves books dont yell at you and these are all yelling surely it is how they make themselves evidentjust as books on shelves are evident to your eyes but you need only to look at the one you want there is one in particular that i think will ease this for you see if you can find that one find it how do i look for it there was a sound like a sigh well he said theres a stratagem that might be tried robin i cant tell you up down or sideways because i dont suppose theres any frame of reference for you yet damn right no but theres an old animal trainers trick used to cause an animal to perform complicated maneuvers it does not understand there was a stage magician who used it to get a dog to go into an audience select a particular person take from it a particular object albert i begged this is not the time for you to tell me those long rambling anecdotes no this is not an anecdote its a psychological experiment it works well on dogsi do not know that it has ever been tried on an adult human but lets see this is what you do begin to move in any direction if it is a good direction i will tell you to go on when i stop telling you that you stop doing that particular thing cast about try different things when the new thing you do or the new direction is a useful one i will tell you to keep going can you do that i said will you give me a piece of bread when its over albert faint chuckle at least the electronic analog of one robin now start casting about start casting about how but there was no use asking that question because if albert had been able to give me a how in words we wouldnt have had to try a dog handlers trick so i begandoing things i cant tell you what things i was doing exactly i can give you an analogy maybe when i was in school in science class they showed us an electroencephalogram scanner and showed how all our brains generated alpha waves it was possible they said to make the waves go faster or get largerto increase the frequency or the amplitudebut there was no way to tell us how to do it we all took turns all of us kids and every one of us did in fact manage to speed up the sine trace on the screen and no two of us described what we did in the same way one said he held his breath another that he sort of tensed his muscles one thought of eating and another sort of tried to yawn without opening his mouth none of them were real all of them worked and what i did now was not real either because i had nothing real to do it with but i moved somehow i moved and all the time alberts voice was saying no no no no thats not it no no and then yes yes robin keep on doing that i am keeping on dont talk robin just keep going keep going keepgoingkeepgoingkeepgoingkeepno stop no no no noyes keepgoingkeepgoingkeepgoingkeepgoingnoyes keep goingstop there it is robin the volume you must open here this thing here this voice that sounds like i stopped i couldnt go on see i had accepted the fact that i was dead nothing but stored electrons in a datafan able to talk just then only to mechanical storage or other nonalive persons like albert open the volume he commanded let her speak to you she did not need permission hello robin love said the nonliving voice of my dear wife essiestrange strained but no doubt at all who it was is a fine place are in now is it not i do not think that anything not even the recognition of my own death was as terrible a shock as finding essie among the dead ones essie i screamed what happened to you and at once albert was there solicitous quick shes all right robin shes not dead but she must be shes here no my dear boy not really here said albert her book is there because she partially stored herself as part of the experiments for the here after project and also as part of the experiments that led to me as i am at present constituted you bastard you let me think she was dead he said gently robin you must get over this fleshandblood obsession with biology does it really matter if her metabolism still operates on the organic level in addition to the version of her which is stored here and that strange essievoice chimed in be patient dear robin be calm is going to be all right i doubt that very much i said bitterly trust me robin she whispered listen to albert he will tell you what to do the hardest part is over albert reassured me i apologize for the traumas you have suffered but they were necessaryi think you think yes only think robin for this has never been done before and we are operating largely in the dark i know it has been a shock to you to meet the stored analog of mrs broadhead in this way but it will help to prepare you to meet her in the flesh if i had had a body to do it with i would have been tempted to punch himif albert had had anything to punch youre crazier than i am i cried ghost of a chuckle not crazier robin only as crazy you will be able to speak to her and see her just as i did with you while you were still alive i promise this robin it will succeedi think i cant pause it is not easy he conceded but consider this i can do it so do you not think you can do as well as a mere computer program like myself dont taunt me albert i understand what youre saying you think i can display myself as a hologram and communicate in real time with living persons but i dont know how no not yet robin for those subroutines do not yet exist in your program but i can teach you you will be displayed perhaps not with all the natural grace and agility of my own displays he boasted but at least you will be recognizable are you prepared to begin to learn and essies voice or that voice which was a degraded copy of essies whispered please do dear robin for am waiting for you without patience how tiresome it is to be born tiresome for the neonate and more tiresome still for the auditor who is not experiencing it but only listening to interminable woes interminable they were and spurred by constant nagging from my midwives you can do it promised the copy of essie from one side of me and it is easier than it seems confirmed the voice of albert from the other there were no two persons in the universe whose word i would take more readily than either of them but i bad used up all my trust there was none left and i was scared easy it was prepostemus for i was seeing the cabin as albert had always seen it i didnt have the perspective of two focusing eyes and a pair of ears located at particular points in space i was seeing and hearing all of it at once long ago that old painter picasso painted pictures like that with the parts spread out in random order they were all there but so exploded and randomized that there was no overriding form to recognize but only a helterskelter mosaic of bits i had wandered the tate and the met with essie to look at such paintings and even found some pleasure in them they were even amusing but to see the real world spread out that way like parts on an assembly benchthat was not amusing at all let me help you whispered the analog of essie do you see me there robin asleep in the big bed have been up for many days robin pouring old organic you into fine new fan bottle and am now worn out but see i have just moved hand to scratch my nose do you see hand do you see nose do you recognize then the ghost of a chuckle of course you do robin for that is me all over out of the heechee hideaway there still was klara to be thought about if i had known enough just then to think about hernot just klara but wan and also captain and his heechee who were worth all the thoughts anyone could give them but i did not then know that either i was vaster all right but not as yet a whole lot smarter and certainly i was distracted by problems of my own although if captain and i had known each other and been able to compare it would have been interesting to see whose problems were worse actually it would have been a standoff both sets of problems were simply off the scale too much to be handled the physical closeness of his two human captives was one of captains problems in his bony nostrils they stank they were physically repellent loose bouncing jiggling fat and sagging flesh marred the clean lines of their structuresthe only heechee ever that gross were the few dying of the worst degenerative disease they knew even then the stink was not as bad the human breath was rancid with putrefying food the human voices grated like buzzsaws it made captains throat sore to try to frame the buzzy grumbly syllables of their nasty little language in captains view the captives were nasty all over not least because they simply refused to understand most of what he said when he tried to tell them how perilously they had endangered themselvesnot to mention the heechee in their hiding placetheir first question was are you heechee in all his troubles captain had room for irritation at that heechee he groaned then gave his abdominal shrug yes it does not matter be still stay quietly phew muttered whitenoise referring to more than the physical stink captain glared and turned to burst have you disposed of their vessel he demanded of course said burst it is en route to a holding port but what of the kugelblitz captain shrugged his belly morosely he was tired they were all tired they had been operating at the extreme limits of their capability for days now and they were showing the effects captain tried to put his thoughts in order the sailship had been tucked out of sight these errant human beings had been removed from the vicinity of that most terrible of dangers the kugelblitz and their ship on automatic was being hidden away so far he had done he knew as much as could have been expected of him it had not been without cost he thought sorrowing for twice it was hard to believe that in the normal course of events he would still be enjoying her onceayear love but it was not enough it was entirely possible captain reflected that by this point there was no longer such a thing as enough it might well be too late for anything he or the entire heechee race could do but he could not admit that as long as there was a chance he had to act display the charts from their ship he ordered and turned again to the rude crude mounds of blubber he had captured speaking as simply as to a child he said look at this chart it was one of the minor annoyances of captains situation that the leaner and therefore less physically appalling of his captives was also the nastier you be still he ordered pointing a lean fist at wan his ravings had been even more nearly sensefree than the females you do you know what this is at least the female had the sense to speak slowly it took only a few repetitions before he understood klaras answer it is the black hole we were going to visit captain shuddered yes he said trying to match the unfamithir consonants exactly burst was translating for the others and he could see the tendons writhing on their limbs in shock captain chose his words carefully pausing to check with the ancestral minds to make sure he had the right words listen carefully he said lhis is very dangerous long long ago we discovered that a race of assassins had killed off every technologically advanced civilization in the universeat least in our own galaxy and in some nearby ones well it did not go that swiftly captain had to repeat and repeat a dozen times for a single word sometimes before the blubbery creatures could seem to grasp what he was saying long before he was finished his throat was raw and the rest of his crew though they knew as well as he what perils were involved were frankly dozing but he didnt stop that chart on the screen with its clustered energysinks and its quintuple warning legend did not let him relax the assassins had done their work of slaughter millennia before the heechee appeared on the scene at first the heechee had thought they were simple monsters from the primeval past no more to be feared in their time than the heechee equivalent of a tyrannosaur then they had discovered the kugelblitz captain hesitated there looking around at his crew the next part was hard to say for it led to an obvious conclusion his tendons writhing he plunged ahead it was the assassins he said they have retreated into a black hole but the particular kind of black hole that is composed of energy not matter for they themselves were not made of matter they were pure energy inside their black hole they exist only as a sort of standing wave in an energy sea by the time he had repeated it several times in several ways he could see that questions were forming but the logical deduction he feared wasnt among them the question was from the female and it was only how can a being composed only of energy survive that was easy enough to answer the answer was i dont know because robin was quite naturally preoccupied with other concerns i was not then able to discuss the kugelblitz with him in as much detail as i would have wished its statistics were interesting its temperature i calculated at about three million kelvin but that was not worrying it was the energy density that disturbed me the energy density of blackbody radiation goes up as the cube of the temperaturethats the old stefanbolzmann lawbut the number of photons goes up linearly with the temperature too so effectively its a fourthpower increase inside the kugelblitz at one kelvin its electronvolts per liter at three million its three million to the fourth power times thatoh say about ev liter and there was a bunch of liters in that thing whats the importance of that that all that energy represented organized intelligences assassins a universe of them all stored in the one kugelblitz waiting for their plans to mature and the universe to be remade to suit them there were captain knew theoriestheories that said the assassins had once been creatures of physical bodies but had somehow cast them off but whether the theories had any relation to fact even the oldest of the massed minds could not say but it was the very difficulty of survival for beings of pure energy captain explained that led to the last and worst thing about the assassins the universe was not hospitable to them so they decided to change the universe did something to create a good deal of additional mass in the universe caused the expansion of the universe to reverse itself holed up in their kugelblitz and waited i have heard of this missing mass often said the male captive eagerly the dead men when i was a child spoke of itbut they were crazy you know the female stopped him w y she demanded why would they do this captain paused bonetired from the ordeal of trying to communicate with these dangerous primitives again the best answer was i dont know but there were speculations it is thought by the massed minds he said slowly that the physical laws of the universe were determined by random fluctuations in the distribution of matter and energy at the first moment after the big bang it is possible that the assassins intend to interfere with that process once they have collapsed the universe and it rebounds they may change those basic lawsthe ratio of the masses of the electron and proton the number that relates the gravitational force to the electromagneticall of themand so bring about a universe in which they could live more comfortably but you and i could not the male had been less and less able to contain himself now he burst out in squawking sounds only gradually turning into intelligible words hoho cried wan wiping away a tear what cowards you are afraid of some creatures that hide themselves in a black hole to do something that wont happen for billions of years what does that matter to us but the female had grasped captains meaning shut up wan she said her facial muscles tightening in an almost heechee expression what youre saying is that these assassins arent taking any chances they came out once before to wipe out everybody who looked like he might be going to get civilized enough to interfere with their plan they might do it again exactly so cried captain with pleasure you have said it precisely and the danger is that you barbariansyou people he corrected himself are likely to bring them back using radio penetrating black holes flying all around the universe even up to the kugelblitzes themselves surely they have left monitoring systems to warn them if new technological civilizations emergeyou must very soon alert them if you havent already and when the prisoners had finally understood wan whimpering in fear kiara whitefaced and shaken when they had been given food packets and told to rest when the crew clustered around captain to know what made his jaw tendons writhe like snakes he could only say it is beyond belief to make the blubbery ones understand him had been difficult enough for him to understand them impossible he said they say they cannot make all their fellows stop but they must cried whitenoise aghast they are intelligent are they not they are intelligent agreed captain for otherwise they would not use our ships so easily but i think they are also mad they have no rule of law they must have law said burst unbelieving no society can live without law their law is compulsion said captain gloomily if one of them is where the agencies of enforcement cannot touch him he may do as he pleases then let them enforce let them track down every ship and make it stop you foolish whitenoise said captain shaking his head think about what you have said chase them down fight them battle them in space can you imagine any louder commotion than thatand can you imagine the assassins will not hear then what whispered burst then said captain we must reveal ourselves he raised his hand to still debate and gave orders they were orders the crew had never thought they would hear but they perceived captain was right messages flew in a dozen places in the galaxy longsilent ships received their remotecontrolled commands and came to life a long dispatch was sent to the monitors near that central black hole where the heechee lived by now the first word of warning should have got through the schwarzschild barrier and reinforcements should be coming out it was a herculean task for the shorthanded crew and twices absence was regretted more sorely than ever but at last it was done and captains own ship turned on a new course for a rendezvous as he curled into a sleeping ball captain found himself smiling it was not a joyous smile it was the rictus of a paradox too wounding to respond to in any other way he had feared all through the talk with the captives that they would come to an unwelcome conclusion once they knew that the assassins had hidden themselves inside a black hole they might easily suspect the heechee had done the same and so the central secret of the heechee race would be compromised compromised he had done much more than compromise it all on his own authority with no higher powers to approve or forbid captain had awakened the sleeping fleets and summoned reinforcements from inside the event horizon the secret was no secret anymore after half a million years the heechee were coming out the geography of heaven where was i really it took me a long time to answer that question for myself not least because my mentor albert dismissed it as silly the question of where is a foolish human preoccupation robin he grumped concentrate learn how to do and how to feel reserve the philosophy and the metaphysics for those long evenings of leisure with a pipe and a stein of good beer beer albert he sighed the electronic analog of beer he said testily is quite real enough for the electronic analog of a person now pay attention please to the inputs i am now offering you which are video scans of the interior of the control cabin of the true lov i did as he said of course i was at least as eager as albert to complete my training course so that i could go on to dowhatever it was possible for me to do in this new and scary state but in my odd femtoseconds i could not help turning over that question in my mind and i finally found an answer where was i really i was in heaven think about it it meets most of the specifications you know my belly didnt hurt anymorei didnt have a belly my enslavement to mortality was over for if i had owed a death i had paid it and was quit for the morrow if it was not quite eternity that waited for me it was something pretty close data storage in the heechee fans we already knew was good for at least half a million years without significant degradationbecause we had the original heechee fans still workingand thats a lot of ferntoseconds no more earthly cares no cares at all except those i chose to take on for myself yes heaven you probably dont believe that because you wont accept that an existence as a disembodied clutter of databits in fan storage can have anything really heavenly about it i know that because i had trouble accepting it myseif yet reality isis reallya subjective matter we fleshandblood creatures really perceived reality only at second or third hand as an analog painted by our sensory systems on the synapses of our brains so albert had always said it was trueor almost trueno it was more than true in some ways because we disembodied clutters have a wider choice of realities than you but if you still dont believe me i cant complain however many times i told myself it was so i didnt find it very heavenly either it had never occurred to me before how terribly inconvenient it wasfinancially legally and in many otherlies not least maritallyto be dead so coming back to the question where was i really why really i was at home as soon as i hadwelldied albert in remorse had turned the ship around it took quite a while to get there but i wasnt doing anything special just learning how to pretend to be alive when in fact i wasnt it took the whole flight back just to make a start on that for it was a lot harder to be born into fan storage than into the world in the old biological wayi had to actively do it you see everything about me was a great deal vaster in one sense i was limited to a heecheemodel datafan with a cubic content of not much more than a thousand cc and in that sense i was detached from my plugin and carried through customs and brought back to the old place on the tappan sea with no more trouble than youd carry an extra pair of shoes in another sense i was vaster than galaxies for i had all the accumulated datafans in the world to play in faster than a silver bullet quick as quicksilver swift as the shining lightningi could go anywhere that any of the stored heechee and human datastores had ever gone and that was everywhere i had ever heard of i heard the eddas of the slush dwellers from the sailship and hunted with the first exploring heechee party that captured the australopithecines i chatted with the dead men from heechee heaven well never mind where all i went you dont have time to hear and that was all easy human affairs were harder by the time we were back on the tappan sea essie had had a chance to rest up and i had had the time and practice to recognize what i saw and both of us had got over some of the trauma of my death i dont say wed got over it all but at least we could talk at first it was only talk for i was shy of trying to display myself to my dear wife as a hologram then said essie comm ndingly you robin is no longer tolerable this talking to you on voiceonly phone come where i can see yes do ordered the other essie stored with me and albert chimed in simply relax and let it happen robin the subroutines are well in place in spite of them all it took all my courage to show myself and when i did my dear wife looked me up and down and said oh robin how lousy you look now that might sound less than loving but i knew what essie meant she wasnt criticizing she was sympathizing and trying to keep from tears ill do better later darling i said wishing i could touch her indeed he will mrs broadhead said albert earnestly which made me realize that he was sitting by my side at present i am helping him and the attempt to project two images at once is difficult i am afraid they are both degraded then you disappear she suggested but he shook his head there is also the need for robin to practiceand i think you yourself may wish to make some programing amendments for example surround i cannot give robin a background unless i share it with him improvements are also needed in full mimation realtime reaction consistency between frames yes yes groaned essie and set about doing things in her workshop so did we all there was much to do especially for me i have worried about many things in my time and almost always about the wrong ones worrying about dying hovered in the edges of my concerns for most of my physical lifejust as it does in yours what i feared was extinction i didnt get extinction i got a whole new set of problems a dead man you see no longer has any rights he cant own property he cant dispose of property he cant votenot only cant he vote in an election to a government office he cannot even vote the large majority of shares he owns in the hundred corporations he himself has set up when he is only a minority interesteven a very powerful one as i was in for example the transport system that sent new colonists to peggys planet he wont even be heard as you could say he might as well be dead i was unwilling to be that dead it wasnt avarice as a stored intelligence i had very few needs there was no risk of my being turned off because i couldnt pay the utility bills it was an urgency more pressing than that the terrorists had not disappeared because the pentagon captured their spaceship every day there were bombings and kidnappings and shootings two other launch loops were attacked and one of them damaged a tanker of pesticide was deliberately scuttled off the coast of queensland and so a hundred kilometers of the great barrier reef was dying there were actual battles being fought in africa and central america and the near east the lid was barely being kept on the pressure cooker what we needed was a thousand more transports like the s ya and who was going to build them if were silent so we lied the story went out that robin broadhead had suffered a cerebrovascular accident all right but the lie that was tacked on said i was showing steady improvement well i was not in the exact sense implied of course but almost as soon as we were back home i was able to talk voiceonly with general manzbergen and some of the people in rotterdam in a week i was showing myself from time to timeswathed in lap robes supplied courtesy of alberts fertile imagination after a month i allowed a pv crew to film me tanned and fit if thin sailing our little catboat on the sea of course the py crew was my very own and the clips that appeared on the newscasts were more art than reportage but it was very good art i could not handle facetoface confrontations but i didnt need to so all in all you see i wasnt too badly off i conducted my business i planned and carried out plans to ease the ferment that fed the terrorists not enough to cure the problem but to sit on the lid for a while longer i had thne to listen to alberts worries about the curious objects he called kugelblitz and if we didnt then know what they meant it was probably just as well all i lacked was a body and when i complained about that essie said forcefully dear god robin is not end of world for you how many others have had same problem to be reduced to a datastore not many i should think but same problem anyhow she insisted consider healthy young male goes skijumping falls and cracks spine paraplegic eh no body that amounts to anything except liability needs to be fed needs to be diapered needs to be bathedyou are spared that robin but the important part of you that is still here sure i said i did not add what essie of all people did not need to have me add that my own definition of important parts included some accessories to which i had always attached particular value even there there were pluses to set against the losses ff no longer had eg sexual organs there was surely no further problem about my suddenly complicated sexual relationships none of that had to be said what essie said instead was buck up old robin keep in mind you are so far only first approximation of final product what does that mean i demanded were great problem robin here after storage was i admit quite imperfect learned much in development of new albert for you had never before attempted complete storage of entire and very valued person unfortunately dead the technical problems i understand there were technical problems i interrupted i didnt really want to hear just yet the details of the risky untried exquisitely complex job of pouring me out of the decaying bucket of my head into the waiting basin of a storage matrix to be sure well now have more leisure now can make fine tuning trust me old robin improvements can yet be made in me in you certainly also she said twinkling in very inadequate stored copy of self have good reason to believe same can be made much more interesting to you oh i said wow and wished more than ever for at least the temporary loan of some parts of a body for what i wanted more than anything else just then was to put my arms around my very dear wife and meanwhile and meanwhile the worlds went on even the very small worlds of my friend audee walthers and his own complicated loving when you look at them from inside all worlds are the same size audees didnt seem small to him i took care of one of their problems very quickly i gave each of them ten thousand shares of stock in the peggys planet ferry the s ya and its pendant enterprises janie yeexing didnt have to worry about being fired anymore she could rehire herself as a pilot if she chose or ride the s ya as passenger if she liked so could audee or he could go back to peggys and boss his former bosses on the oilfield or none of the above but lounge around in luxury for all his life and so could dolly and of course that didnt solve their problems at all the three of them mooned around the guest suites for a while until finally essie suggested we lend them the true love for a cruise to nowhere until they got their heads straightened out and we did none of them were foolish at alllike the rest of us they acted that way now and then maybe they recognized a bribe when they saw one they knew that what i really wanted was for them to keep their mouths shut about my present unpleasantly noncorporeal state but they also knew what a friendly gift was and there was that component in the stock transfer too and what did they do the three of them on the thue love i think i dont want to say most of it is no ones business but theirs consider there are times in everyones lifecertainly including yours most definitely including my ownwhen what you are doing and saying is not either important or pretty you strain at a bowel movement you have a fugitive and shocking thought you break wind you tell a lie none of it matters very much but you do not want advertised those parts of everyones life in which he looks ludicrous or contemptible or mean usually they dont get advertised because there is no one to seebut now that i am vastened there is always one to see and that is me maybe not right away but sooner or later as everyones memories are added to the database there are no personal mysteries left at all i will say this much of audee waltherss private concerns what motivated his actions and fueled his worries was that admirable and desirable thing love what frustrated his loving was also love he loved his wife dolly because he had schooled himself to love her all the while they were marriedthat was his view of how married people should be on the other hand dolly had left him for another man and janie yeexing had turned up to console him they were both very attractive persons but there were too many of them audee was as monogamous as i was if he thought to make up with dolly there was janie in the wayshe had been kind he owed her some sort of considerationcall it love but between him and janie there was dolly they had planned a life together and he had had no intention ever of changing it so you could call that love too complicated by some feeling that he owed dolly some kind of punishment for abandoning him and janie some sort of resentment for being in the wayremember i told you there were contemptible and ludicrous parts complicated much more by the equally complex feelings of dolly and janie it must almost have been a relief to them whenorbiting idly in a great cometary ellipse that was pushing them out toward the asteroids and at angle to the eclipticwhatever discussion they were having at the moment was interrupted by a gasp from dolly and a stifled scream from janie and audee waithers turned to see on the screen a great cluster of vessels huger and more numerous and far far bigger than any human being had seen in earths solar system before they were scared out of their minds no doubt but no more than the rest of us all over the earth and everywhere in space where there were human beings and communications facilities to carry the word there was shock and terror it was the worst nightmare of every human being for the past century or so the heechee were coming back they didnt hide they were thereand so many of them optical sensors in the orbital stations spotted more than fifty shipsand what ships twelve or fourteen as big as the s ya another dozen bigger still great globular structures like the one that had swallowed the sailship there were threes and fives and some intermediate ones that the high pentagon thought looked suspiciously like cruisers and all of them coming straight down at us from the general direction of vega i could say earths defenses were caught unprepared but that would be a flattering lie the truth was that earth had no defenses worth mentioning there were patrol ships to be sure but they had been built by earthmen to fight other earthmen no one had dreamed of pitting them against the semimythical heechee and then they spoke to us the message was in english and it was short it said the heechee cant allow interstellar travel or communication anymore except under certain conditions that they will decide and supervise everything else has to stop right away theyve come to stop it that was all before the speaker with a helpless shake of the head faded away it sounded a lot like a declaration of war it was interpreted that way too in the high pentagon in the orbiting forts of other nations in the councils of power all over the world there were abrupt meetings and conferences and planning sessions ships were called in for rearming and others were redirected toward the heechee fleet the orbital weapons that had been quiet for decades were checked and aligneduseless as arbalests they might be but if they were all we had to fight with we would fight them the confusion and shock and reaction swept the world and there was nowhere that suffered more astonishment and bewilderment than the people who made up my own happy household for the person who gave the heechee ultimatum albert had recognized at once and essie only a moment later and i before i even saw her face it was gelleklara moynlin return to earth gelleklara moynlin my love my lost love there she was staring at me out of the frame of the pv and looking no older than the last time id seen her years and decades beforeand looking no better either because both times she was about as badly shaken up as it was possible for a person to be not to mention beaten up once by me but if shed been through a lot and showed it my kiara she had plenty in reserve she turned from the screen when she had delivered her message to the human race and nodded to captain you zaid it he demanded anxiously you gave the mezzage prezisely as i inzdructed precisely said klara and added your english is getting much better now you could talk directly if you wanted to is too important to take chanzes said captain fretfully and turned away half the tendons on his body were rippling and twitching now and he was not alone his loyal crew were as harried as himself and in the communications screens that linked his ship to the others in the grand fleet he could see the faces of the other captains it was a grand fleet captain reflected studying the displays that showed them in proud array but why was it hl fleet he didnt need to ask he knew the answer the reinforcements from inside the core amounted to more than a hundred heechee and at least a dozen of them were entitled to call themselves senior to him if they chose they could easily have asserted command of the fleet they didnt they let it be his fleet because that made it also be his responsibility and his own sweet essence that would go to join the massed minds if it went wrong how foolish they are he muttered and his communicator twitched agreement i will instruct them to maintain better order he said is that what you mean of course shoe captain sighed and watched gloomily as the communicator rattled instructions to the other captains and controllers the shape of the armada reformed itself slowly as the great cargo vessels capable of biting a thousandmeter spherical chunk out of anything and carrying it anywhere dropped back behind the transports and the smaller ships human woman kiara he called why do they not answer she shrugged rebelliously theyre probably talking it over she said talking it over ive tried to tell you she said resentfully there are a dozen different major powers that have to get together not counting a hundred little countries a hundred countries captain groaned trying to imagine such a thing he failed well that was long and long ago especially if you measure time in femtoseconds so very much has happened since so much that vastened as i am it is hard for me to take it all in it is even harder to remember every detail of every event of that time although as you have seen i can recall quite a lot when i want to but that picture stays with me there was kiara her black brows scowling as she watched the heechee jitter and mope there was wan all but comatose and forgotten in a corner of the cabin there were the heechee crew twitching and hissing to one another and there was captain gazing with pride and fear at the resurrected armada on the mission he had ordered he was gambling for the highest of stakes he did not know what would happen nextexpected anythingfeared al most everythingcould not be surprised he thought by whatever occurred until something did occur that surprised him very much captain cried mongrel the integrator there are other ships and captain brightened ah he applauded at last they respond it was curious of the humans to do so physically rather than by means of radio but then they were strange to begin with are the ships speaking to us shoe he asked and the communicator twitched his cheek muscles no captain sighed we must be patient then he said studying the display the human vessels were certainly not approaching in any sensible order it seemed in fact as though they had been detached from whatever errands they were on and thrown in to meet the heechee fleet hurriedly carelesslyalmost frantically one was in easy range of ship communication two others farther away and one of those battling an existing velocity that went the wrong way then captain hissed in surprise human female he commanded come here and inzdruct them to be careful zee what is happening from the nearest ship a smaller object had launched a primitive thing that was chemically propelled much too tiny to contain even a single person it was accelerating directly toward the heart of the heechee fleet and captain nodded to whitenoise who instantly ordered a nudge into fil velocity that removed the nearest cargo vessels from danger they muzt not be zo zlipzhodi he cried sternly a collizion could occur not by accident said kiara grimly what i do not underzdand those are missiles she said and theyve got nuclear warheads thats your answer theyre not waiting for you to attack theyre shooting first do you have the picture now can you see captain standing there with his tendons shocked still and his jaw dropping staring at klara he chews at his tough thin lower lip and glances at the screen theres his fleet the huge caravan of cargo transports resurrected from half a million years of hiding so that he canwith grave doubt at great risk to himself offer the human race a couple of million at a time free transportation and safe refuge from the assassins in the core where the heechee themselves hid shooting he repeated numbly to hurt us pozzibly to kill exactly flared klara what did you expect if its war you want youll get it and captain closed his eyes hardly hearing the horrified hiss and buzz that went around his crew as whitenoise translated war he mut tered unbelieving and for the first time ever he thought of joining the massed minds not with fear but almost with longing however bad it might be how could it be worse than this and meanwhile meanwhile it almost went too farbut fortunately for everyone not quite the brazilian scoutships missile was far too slow to catch the heechee as they dodged by the time they were in position to fire again long before any other human ship could come closecaptain had managed to explain to klara and kiara was on the communication circuits again and the word was out not an invasion fleet not even a coinmando raid a rescue missionand a warning of what made the heechee run and hide and was now for us to worry about the thing the heechee feared vastened as i am i can smile at those pitiful old fears and apprehensions not at the time maybe but now ah yes the scales are all bigger and a lot more exciting there are ten thousand stored heechee dead ones outside the core alone and i can read them all have read them nearly all go on reading them as i choose whenever there is something i want to study more closely books on a library shelf they are more than that i dont exactly read them either it is much more like remembering them when i open one of them i open it all the way i read it from the inside out as though it were part of me it was not easy to do that and for that matter hardly anything i have learned to do since i was vastened has come easily but with albert to help me and simple texts to practice on i learned the first datastores i accessed were only thatjust data no worse than consulting a table of logarithms then i had old heecheestored dead men and some of essies first cases for her here after franchises and they were really not very well done i was never in doubt about which part of what i was thinking was me but after we had straightened out the misunderstanding with captain and i got to consult their own records then it got hairy there was captains late love the female heechee named twice to access her was like waking up in the dark and putting on a whole suit of clothes that you couldnt seeand that didnt fit you anyway it was not just that she was female although that was an immense incongruity it was not even that she was heechee and i was human it was what she knew and always had known that neither i nor any other human had guessed perhaps albert hadperhaps that was what had driven him mad but even alberts conjectures had not shown him a race of starfaring assassins who stored themselves in a kugelblitz to wait for the birth of a new and for them betteruniverse but once the shock was over twice became a friend shes really a nice person once you get past the weirdness and we have a lot of interests in common the heechee library of stored intelligences is not merely heechee or even human there are musty old querulous voices that once belonged to winged creatures from an antares planet and slugs from a globular cluster and of course there are the slush dwellers twice and i spent a lot of time studying them and their eddas time you see is what i have plenty of with my femtosecond synapses i have enough time almost to want to visit the core itself and perhaps someday i will not for some long time though meanwhile and meanwhile audee and janie yeexing have gone there helping to pilot a mission that will be there for six or seven monthsor as we measure time out here a few centuries by the time they come back dollys presence should no longer be a problem while dolly herself is happy enough with her pv career and essie has the grace not to be too happy lacking the sweet physical presence of myself but seems all the same to have made a good adjustment what she likes best is her work and shes got plenty of itimproving the here after using the same processes that make chonfood to make more important organic items such as she hopes before very long spare parts for people who need them so that nobody need ever steal another persons organs again and when you come right down to it most people are happy now that weve borrowed the heechee fleet and can lift a million people a month with all their effects to any of fifty fine planets waiting to be used its the pioneers and the covered wagons all over again and a bright career for anyone especially for me and then there was klara we met at last of course i would have insisted and anyway in the long run she couldnt have been kept away essie took a launch loop to meet her in orbit and escort her personally in our own aircraft down to the tappan sea it made for a little problem in etiquette im sure but otherwise klara would have been swamped in media people trying to find out what it was like to be a captive of the heechee or kidnapped by the wolfchild wan or whatever other phrases they chose to bandy and actually i guess she and essie got along pretty well it wasnt as though they had to fight over me i didnt exist to fight over in that sense so i practiced my best holographic smiles and designed my best holographic surroundings and waited for her to get there she came in by herself to the big atrium room where i was waitingessie must have had the tact to show her the way and disappear and when klara came through the door i could tell by the way she stopped and gasped that she had expected me to look a lot more dead hello kiara i said it wasnt much of a speech but whats the right thing to say in those circumstances and she said hello robin she didnt seem to be able to think of anything to add to it either she stood looking at me until i thought to ask her to sit down and i of course did a lot of looking at her in all the multiphased ways we electronically stored intelligences have but in all those ways she looked pretty damned good tired yes shed had some hard times and dear kiara was not a classic beauty not with those dark and thick eyebrows and that strong muscular bodybut yes she looked fine i guess the staring session made her nervous because she cleared her throat and said i understand youre going to make me rich not me kiara just giving back to you your share of what we earned together seems to have multiplied a lot she grinned your uhyour wife says i can have fifty million dollars in cash you can have more than that no no anyway there is moreit seems i get shares in a lot of companies too thanks robin youre welcome and then there was another silence and thenwould you believe it the next words out of my mouth were klara ive got to know have you been hating me all this time it was the question after all that had been on my mind for thirty years even then the question struck me as incongruous how it struck kiara i cant say but she sat there with her mouth open for a moment and then she swallowed and shook her head and then she began to laugh she laughed loud and fullbodied and when she had finished laughing she knuckled the corner of her eye still chuckling as she said thank god robin at least something hasnt changed youve died youve got a mourning widow the worlds on the brink of the biggest changes ever some scary creatures are likely out to screw up just everything and and and youre dead and what youre worried about is your own damn feelings of guilt and i laughed too for the first time in my god half my life the last little vestige of guilt was gone it was hard to identify what it felt like it had been a long time since id known that liberation i said still laughing myself i know i sound stupid kiara but its been a long time for me and i knew you were out there in that black hole with time slowed downand i didnt know what you were thinking i thought maybe you were i dont know blaming me for deserting you but how could i robin i didnt know what happened to you do you want to know what i was really feeling i was feeling terrified and numb because i knew you were gone and i thought you were dead andi grinnedyou finally get back here and i am i could see that she was more sensitive about jokes in that area than i was its all right i said really all right im just fine and sos the whole world i really was i wished i could touch her of course but that was beginning to seem part of a remote childhood past what was present was that she was here and safe and the universe was open before us and when i said so her jaw dropped again youre so damned optimistic she blazed i was honestly surprised why shouldnt i be the assassins theyre going to come out sometime and what are we going to do if they can scare the heechee they scare the hell out of me ah kiara i said understanding at last i see what you mean you mean its like it used to be for us when we knew the heechee had been somewhere and might come back and knew theyd been able to do things we couldnt hope to do exactly were no match for the assassins no i said grinning were not and we werent any match for the heechee eitherthen but by the time they did come outwe were with any luck at all well have time before we have to face the assassins so what theyll still be an enemy i shook my head not an enemy klara i said just another resource
