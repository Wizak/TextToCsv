the philanderers prologue five englishmen were watching a camp fire in the centre of a forest clearing in midafrica they did not speak but sat propped against logs smoking one of the five knocked out the ashes of his pipe upon the ground a second roused by the movement picked up a fresh billet of wood with a shiver and threw it on to the fire and the light for a moment flung a steady glow upon faces which were set with anxiety the man who had picked up the billet looked from one to the other of the faces then he turned and gazed behind him into the darkness the floor of the clearing was dotted with the embers of dying fires but now and again he would hear the crackle of a branch and see a little flame spirt up and shine upon the barrels of rifles and the black bodies of the sleeping troops round the edge of the clearing the trees rose massed and dark like a cliffs face he turned his head upwards look drake he cried suddenly and pointed an arm eastwards the man opposite to him took his pipe from his mouth and looked in that direction the purple was fading out of the sky leaving it livid i see said drake shortly and replacing his pipe he rose to his feet his four companions looked quickly at each other and the eldest of them spoke look here drake said he i have been thinking about this business all night and the more i think of it the less i like it of course we only did what we were bound to do we couldnt get behind that evidence there was no choice for us but youre the captain and there is a choice for you no replied drake quietly i too have been thinking about it all night and there is no choice for me but you can delay the execution until we get back i cant even do that a week ago there was a village here its not the man i am thinking of i havent lived my years in africa to have any feeling left for scum like that but also i havent lived my years in africa without coming to know theres one thing above all others necessary for the white man to do and thats to keep up the prestige of the white man string gorley up if you like but not here not before these blacks but thats just what i am going to do answered drake and just for your reason too the prestige of the white man every day something is stolen by these fellows a rifle a bayonet rations something when i find the theft out i have to punish it havent i well how can i punish the black when he thieves and let the white man off when he thieves and murders if i did well i dont think i could strike a harder blow at the white mans prestige i dont ask you to let him off only take him back to the coast let him be hanged there privately and how many of these blacks would believe that he had been hanged drake turned away from the group and walked towards a hut which stood some fifty yards from the camp fire three sentries were guarding the door drake pushed the door open entered and closed it behind him the hut was pitch dark since a board had been nailed across the only opening gorley he said there was a rustling of boughs against the opposite wall and a voice answered from close to the ground damn you what do you want have you anything you wish to say that depends replied gorley after a short pause and his voice changed to an accent of cunning theres no bargain to be made the words were spoken with a sharp precision and again there was a rustling of leaves as though gorley had fallen back upon his bed of branches but you can undo some of the harm continued drake and at that gorley laughed drake stopped on the instant and for a while there was silence between the pair a gray beam of light shot through a chink between the logs and then another and another until the darkness of the hut changed to a vaporous twilight then of a sudden the notes of a bugle sounded the reveill gorley raised himself upon his elbows and thrust forward his head outside he heard the rattle of arms the chatter of voices all the hum of a camp astir drake he whispered across to the figure standing against the door theres enough gold dust to make two men rich but you shall have it all if you let me go you can easily enough it wouldnt be difficult for a man to slip away into the forest on the march back if you gave the nod to the sentries guarding him all i ask for is a rifle and a belt of cartridges id shift for myself then he ended abruptly and crouched listening to the orders shouted to the troops outside the men were being ranged in their companies then the companies in succession were marched halted wheeled and halted again gorley traced a plan of their evolutions with his fingers upon the floor of the hut the companies were formed into a square drake he began again and he crawled a little way across the hut drake do you hear what im saying theres a fortune for you mind you all of it and i am the only one who can tell you where it is i didnt trust those black fellows no no and he wagged his head with an attempt at an insinuating laugh i had it all gathered together and i buried it myself at night you gave me a chance before with nothing to gain give me another you have everything to gain this time drake why dont you speak because theres no bargain to be made between you and me replied drake if you tell me where the gold dusts hid it will be given back to the people it belonged to or rather to those of them you left alive you can do some good that way by telling me but you wont save your life steps were heard to approach the hut there was a rap on the door well asked drake gorley raised himself from the floor i am not making you rich and letting you kill me too he said and then who cares im ready drake opened the door and stepped out gorley swaggered after him he stood for a moment on the threshold here and there a wisp of fog ringed a treetrunk or smoked upon the ground but for the rest the clearing littered with the charred debris of a native village lay bare and desolate in a cold morning light it looks a bit untidy said gorley with a laugh two of the troopers approached and laid their hands upon his shoulders at first he made a movement to shake them off then he checked the impulse and stood quietly while they pinioned him after they had finished he spat on the ground cast a glance at the square and the rope dangling from a branch above it and walked easily towards it the square opened to receive him and closed up again on the march back two of the englishmen sickened of ague and died six months later a third was killed in a punitive expedition the fourth was drowned off walfisch bay before another year had elapsed chapter i hugh fielding while speculating upon certain obscure episodes in the history of a life otherwise familiar to an applauding public and at a loss to understand them caught eagerly at a simile now fielding came second to none in his scorn for the simile as an explanation possibly because he was so well acquainted with its convenience a fairy lamp he would describe it quite conscious of the irony in his method of description effective as an ornament upon a tablecloth but a poor light to eat your dinner by nevertheless fielding hugged this particular simile applying it as a sort of skeleton key to the problem of stephen drakes career he compared drakes career or at all events that portion of it which was closed to the writing of a book so many years represent the accumulation of material a deliberate accumulation at a certain date the book is begun with a settled design finis being clearly foreseen from the first word of the preface but once fairly started the book throws the writer on one side and takes the lead drags him panting and protesting after it flings him down byways out of sight of his main road tumbles him into people he had no thought of meeting and finally stops him dead heaven knows where in front of a blank wall most likely at the end of a cul de sac he may sit down then and cry if he likes but to that point he has come in spite of his intentions the actual settling down to the work with the material duly ticketed at his elbow in drakes case hugh fielding dated back to a certain day towards the close of october upon that afternoon the dunrobin castle from cape town steamed into plymouth harbour and amongst the passengers one man stepped from the tender on to the quay and stood there absolutely alone no one had gone out to the ship to meet him no one came forward now on the quayside and it was evident from his indifference to the bystanders that he expected no one the more careless of these would have accounted him a complete stranger to the locality the more observant an absentee who had just returned for while his looks expressed isolation one significant gesture proved familiarity with the environments as his eyes travelled up the tiers of houses and glanced along towards the hoe they paused now and again and rested upon any prominent object as though upon a remembered landmark and each such recognition he emphasised with a nod of the head he turned his back towards the town directing his glance in a circle the afternoon although toning to dusk was kept bright by the scouring of a keen wind and he noted the guardship on his right at its old moorings the funnels rising like solid yellow columns from within a stockade of masts thence he looked across the water to the yellowing woods of mount edgcumbe watched for a moment or so the brown sails of the fishingsmacks dancing a chassezcroisez in the sound and turned back to face the hillside a fellowpassenger hustled past him by half a dozen importunate children extricated a hand to wave and shouted a cheery see you in town drake drake roused himself with a start and took a step in the same direction he was confronted by a man in a norfolk jacket and tweed knickerbockers who standing by had caught the name captain stephen drake yes why the man mopped a perspiring face i was afraid i had missed you i should have gone out on the tender only i was late can you spare me a moment you have time certainly answered drake with a look of inquiry the man in the knickerbockers led the way along the quay until he came to an angle between an unused derrick and a wall we shall not be disturbed here he said and he drew an oblong notebook and a cedarwood pencil from his pocket i begin to understand said drake with a laugh you can have no objection there was the suavity of the dentist who holds the forceps behind his back in the tone of the speakers voice on the contrary a little notoriety will be helpful to me too that word too jarred on the reporter suggesting a flippancy which he felt to be entirely out of place the feeling however was quickly swallowed up in the satisfaction which he experienced at obtaining so easily a result which had threatened the need of diplomacy o si sic omnes he exclaimed and made a note of the quotation upon the top of the open leaf surely the quotation is rather hackneyed to begin with suggested drake with a perfectly serious inquisitiveness the reporter looked at him suspiciously we have to consider our readers he replied with some asperity by the way what paper do you represent the reporter hesitated a little the evening meteor he admitted reluctantly keeping a watchful eye upon his questioner he saw the lips join in a hard line and began to wonder whether after all the need for diplomacy had passed i begin to appreciate the meaning of journalistic enterprise said drake your editor makes a violent attack upon me and then sends a member of his staff to interview me the moment i set foot in england you hardly take the correct view if i may say so our chief when he made the attacks acted under a sense of responsibility and he thought it only fair that you should have the earliest possible opportunity of making your defence i beg your pardon replied drake gravely your chief is the most considerate of men and i trust that his equity will leave him a margin of profit only i dont seem to feel that i need make any defence i have no objection to be interviewed as i told you but you must make it clear that i intend nothing in the way of apology is that understood the pressman agreed and made a note of the proviso there is another point i have seen nothing of the paper necessarily for the last few weeks the meteor has i suppose continued its crusade shall we call it but on what lines exactly i am of course ignorant it will be better consequently that you should put questions and i answer them upon this condition however that all reference is omitted to any point on which i am unwilling to speak the reporter demurred but seeing that drake was obdurate he was compelled to give way the entire responsibility of the expedition rests with me drake explained but there were others concerned in it you might trench upon private matters which only affect them he watched the questions with the vigilance of a counsel on behalf of a client undergoing crossexamination but they were directed solely to the elucidation of the disputed point whether drake had or had not while a captain in the service of the matanga republic attacked a settlement of arab slavedealers within the zone of a british protectorate the editor of the meteor believed that he had and strenuously believed it in the interests of his shareholders drake on the other hand and the colonial office it should be added were dispassionately indifferent to the question for the very precise reason that they knew it could never be decided there were doubts as to the exact sphere of british influence and the doubts favoured drake for the most part insular prehensiveness at its highest flight could do no more than claim boruwimi as its uttermost limit and was aware it would be hard put to it to substantiate the claim the editor nevertheless persevered bombarded its citizen readers with warnings about trade fleeing from lethargic empires published a cartoon and reluctantly took the blackest view of drakes character and aims drakes march with a handful of men six hundred miles through a tangled forest had been a handsome exploit quickening british pride with the spectacle of an englishman at the head of it civilian blood tingled in office and shop claiming affinity with drakes it needed an englishman to billhook a path through that fretwork of branches and fall upon his enemy six weeks before he was expected the true combination of daring and endurance that stamps the race current coin across the world economy also pleaded for drake but for him the country itself must have burned out the hornets nest and the taxpayer paid and paid dearly for there would have been talk of the expedition beforehand the force would have found an enemy prepared and fortified the hornets could sting too whereas drake had burned them out before they had time to buzz he need not have said one word in exculpation of himself and that indeed he knew but he had interests and ambitions of his own to serve a hint of them peeped out as to your future plans asked the reporter you mean to go back i presume no london for me if i can find a corner in it i hold concessions in matanga the land needs development of course machinery too capital most of all at the bookstall upon the platform drake bought a copy of the times and whilst taking his change he was attracted by a grayishgreen volume prominently displayed upon the white newspapers the sobriety of the binding caught his fancy he picked it up and read the goldlettered title on the back a man of influence the stallkeeper recommended the novel he had read it himself besides it was having a sale drake turned to the titlepage and glanced at the authors name sidney mallinson he flashed into enthusiasm selling eh very well indeed has it been published long less than three months i will take it and everything else by the same author it is his first book the stallkeeper glanced at his enthusiastic customer and saw a sunburnt face eager as a boys oh he said doubtfully i dont know whether you will like it its violently modern perhaps this and he suggested with an outstretched forefinger a crimson volume explained by its ornamentation of a couple of assegais bound together with a necklace of teeth drake laughed at the application of the homoeopathic principle to the sale of books no i will take this he said and moving aside from the stall stood for a little turning the book over and over in his hands feeling its weight and looking incessantly at the titlepage wondering you would say that the author had accomplished so much he had grounds for wonder too his thoughts went back across the last ten years and he remembered mallinsons clamouring for a reputation a name that had been the essential thing no matter what the career in which it was to be won work he had classified according to the opportunities it afforded of public recognition and his classification varied from day to day a cause clbre would suggest the bar a published sermon the church a flaming poster persuade to the stage in a word he had looked upon a profession as no more than a soundingboard it had always seemed to drake that this fervid desire for fame as a thing apart in itself not as a symbol of success won in a cherished pursuit argued some quality of weakness in the man something unstable which would make for failure his surprise was increased by an inability to recollect that mallinson had ever considered literature as a means to his end long sojourning in the wilderness moreover had given drake an exaggerated reverence for the printed page he was inclined to set mallinson on a pinnacle and scourge himself at the foot of it for his earlier distrust of him he opened the book again at the beginning and let the pages slip across beneath his thumb from cover to cover was marked on the top corner of the last pages actually written and printed and published all consecutive too something new on each page he turned to a porter how long have i before the train starts five minutes sir where is the telegraph office the office was pointed out to him and he telegraphed to mallinson at the address of his publishers have just reached england dine with me at eight tomorrow at the grand hotel and he added after a moments pause bring conway if you have not lost sight of him drake when the train started drake settled himself to the study of a man of influence the commentary of the salesman had prepared him for some measure of perplexity there would be hinted references and suggestions difficult of comprehension to the traveller out of touch with modern developments these however would only be the ornaments but the flesh and blood of the story would be perceptible enough it was just however this very flesh and blood which eluded him he could not fix it in a definite form he did not hold the key to the authors intention drakes visvis in the carriage saw him produce the book with considerable surprise conscious of an incongruity between the reader and what he read his surprise changed to amusement as he noticed drakes face betray his perplexity and observed him turn now and again to the title upon the cover as though doubtful whether he had not misread it he gave an audible chuckle drake looked up and across the carriage at a man of about fifty years of age with a large red face and a closecropped pointed beard the chuckle swelled to a laugh you find that a hard nut to crack drake noticed a thickness in the articulation i have been some years abroad i hardly catch its drift explained drake and then with an effort at praise it seems a clever satire satire guffawed the other well thats rich satire why its a manifesto gad sir its a creed i believe in my duty to my senses and the effectuation of me for ever and ever amen the modern jargon topsy turvydom run the world on the comic opera principle but be flaming serious about it satire good lord he flung himself back on his cushions with a snort of contempt look you im not a pess he checked at the word and then took it at a run a pessimist but as things are going on well you have been out of the country and and you cant help it i suppose you may laugh praps you havent got daughters not that i have either praise glory but nieces if the fathers a fool wear you out very little less satire ho ho the semiintoxicated uncle of nieces relapsed vindictively into his corner and closed his eyes occasionally drake would hear a muffled growl and looking in that direction would see one inflamed eye peering from a mountain of rugs satire and a husky voice would address the passengers indiscriminately satire and the mans not a day under forty either drake joined in the laugh and lit his pipe he was not sensitive to miscomputations of his years and felt disinclined to provoke further outbursts of family confidences instead he pursued his acquaintance with a man of influence realising now that he must take him seriously and regard him stamped with mallinsons approval a dominating being he found the task difficult the character insisted upon reminding him of the nurserymaids ideal the dandified breaker of hearts and bender of wills an analytical hero too who traced the sentence through the thought to the emotion which originally prompted it whence his success and influence but for his strength plainly aimed at by the author and to be conceded by the reader if the book was to convince drake compared him to scree and shingle as against solid granite lean on him and you slip the plot was the timeworn imperishable story of the married couple and the amorous interloper the influential man of course figuring as the latter and consequently glorified the husband was pelted with ridicule from the first chapter to the last though for what particular fault drake could not discover unless it were for that of being a husband at all so that the interloper in robbing him of his wife was related to have secured not merely the succs destime which accompanies such enviable feats but the unqualified gratitude of all married women and most unmarried men there were no doubt redeeming qualities drake gave them full credit and perhaps more than they deserved he noticed a glitter in the dialogue whether of foil or gold he refused to consider and a lively imagination in the interweaving of the incidents but altogether the book left with him a feeling of distaste which was not allayed by the perception that he himself was caricatured in the picture of befooled husband while mallinson figured as the successful deceiver after all he thought mallinson and he were friends and he disliked the mere imagining of such a relationship between them drake summed up his impressions as his hansom turned into the bayswater road the day was just beginning to break the stems of the trees bordering the park were black bars against the pure colourless light and their mingling foliage a frayed black ribbon stretched across the sky one might have conceived the picture the original of a black and white drawing by a preraphaelite artist drake drew in a long breath of the keen clear air i am glad i asked him to bring conway he said to himself chapter ii waking up six hours later drake looked out upon a brown curtain of london fog the lamps were lit at the crossings in trafalgar square halfamile distant they seemed opaque haloes about a pins point of flame and people passing in the light of them loomed and vanished like the figures of a galantyshow from beneath rose the bustle of the streets perceptible only to drake upon the fourth floor as a subterranean rumble london he said to himself i live here and laughed unappalled listening to the clamour he remembered a map seen somewhere in a railway guide a map of england with the foreign cables tiny spiderthreads spun to the four quarters and thickening to a solid column at falmouth and cromer the worlds arteries he liked to think converging to its heart the notion of messages flashing hourly along these wires brought to mind the existence of the meteor he sent out for a copy of each number which had appeared since he had begun his voyage and commencing on the task whilst he was still at breakfast read through every article written concerning the boruwimi expedition he finished the last in the smokingroom shortly after one oclock and rose from his investigation with every appearance of relief from the first to the final paragraph not so much as a mention of gorleys name the reason for his relief lay in a promise which he had sent to gorleys father that he would suppress the trouble as far as he could and drake liked to keep his promises gorley had come out to matanga with a cloudy reputation winging close at his heels there were rumours of dishonesty in the office of a private bank in kent his name became a sign for silence and you were allowed to infer that gorleys relatives had made good the deficit and so avoided a criminal prosecution it was not surprising then that gorley on hearing of drakes intended march to boruwimi should wish to take service under his command he called upon drake with that request was confronted with the current story and invited to disprove it gorley read his man shrewdly and confessed the truth of the charge without an attempt at mitigation he asked frankly for a place in the troop the lowest as his chance of redemption or rather demanded it as a grace due from man to man drake was taken by his manner noticed his build which was tough and wiry and conceded the request nor had he reason to regret his decision on the march out gorley showed himself alert and vigilant a favourite with the blacks and obedient to his officers he was advanced from duty to duty a week before the force began its homeward march from boruwimi he was sent out with a body of men to forage for provisions three days later a solitary negro rushed into camp one of the few survivors of his tribe he said he told a story of food freely given a village plundered and burned for thanks of golddust stolen and the owners murdered that they might the better hold their tongues he signified gorley as the culprit drake guided by the negro marched towards the spot he met gorley and his company halfway between boruwimi and the village carried him along with him and proved the story true against gorleys troops no charge could be sustained they had only obeyed orders but gorley he courtmartialled and the result has been described this was the incident which drake was unwilling to commit to the discretion of the editor of the meteor he had discovered gorleys relations in england and had written to them a full account of the affair despatching with his letter a copy of the evidence given at the courtmartial the reply came from the father a heartbroken admission of the justice of drakes action and a prayer that for the sake of those of the family who still lived gorleys crime should be as far as possible kept secret drake gave the promise so far he had kept it he realised as he tossed aside the last copy of the meteor at eight oclock sidney mallinson arrived he saw drake at the top of the flight of steps in the vestibule and hesitated perceiving that he was alone hasnt conway come he asked i sent to him not yet its barely eight they shook hands limply and searched for topics of conversation you look older than you did said mallinson ah ten years you know you havent changed much drake was looking at a face distinguished by considerable comeliness the forehead however overhung the features beneath it and gave to a mouth and chin which would otherwise have aroused no criticism an appearance of irresolution the one noticeable difference in mallinson was the addition of an air of constraint it was due partly to a question which had troubled him since he had received the invitation had drake read a man of influence and recognised himself i got your telegram he said at length naturally or you wouldnt be here the answer was intended to be jocular it sounded only gauche as drake recognised and the laugh which accompanied it positively rude shall i put my coat in the cloakroom suggested mallinson oh yes do replied drake he was inclined to look upon the proposal as an inspiration and his tone unfortunately betrayed his thought when mallinson returned he saw conway entering the hotel the latter looked younger by some years than either of his companions so that as the three men stood together at this moment they might have been held to represent three separate decades twenty minutes late im afraid said conway and he shook drakes hand with a genuine cordiality five said drake looking at his watch twenty replied conway a quarter to was the time mallinson wired me was it asked mallinson with a show of surprise i must have made a mistake it occurred however to drake that the mistake might have been purposely made from a prevision of the awkwardness of the meeting the dinner prefaced inauspiciously failed to remove the awkwardness since the reticence under which drake and mallinson laboured gradually spread and enveloped conway a forced conversation of a curiously impersonal sort dragged from course to course absolute strangers would have exhibited less restraint for the ghost of an old comradeship made the fourth at the feast and prated to them in exiguous voice of paths that had diverged drake noticed besides an undercurrent of antagonism between conway and mallinson he inquired what each had been doing during his absence mallinson interposed conway has been absorbed in the interesting study of his own personality i am not certain that pursuit is not preferable to revolving unsuccessfully through a cycle of professions said mallinson in slow sarcasm the flush was upon conways cheek now he set his wine glass deliberately upon the table and leaned forward on an elbow my dear good sidney he began with elaborate affection plainly intended as the sugar coating of an excessively unpleasant pill drake hastily interrupted with an anecdote of african experiences it sounded bald and monstrously long but it served its purpose as peacemaker literary acquisitiveness drew mallinson on to ask for more of the same kind drake mentioned a race of pigmies and described them speculating whether they might be considered the originals of the human race my dear fellow dont said mallinson i loathe hearing about them its so degrading to us to think we sprang from them the peculiar sensitiveness of a mind ever searching burrowing in and feeding upon itself struck a jarring note upon its healthier companion why what on earth does it matter asked drake ah perhaps you wouldnt understand conway gave a shrug of the shoulder and laughed to drake across the table the latter looked entreaty in reply and courageously started a different topic he spoke of their boyhood in the suburb on the heights six miles to the south of london and in particular of a certain hill elmtree hill they called it a favourite goal for walks and the spot where the three had last met on the night before drake left england london had lain beneath it roped with lights the enchanted city said conway catching back some flavour of those times it seemed distant as el dorado and as desirable mallinson responded with the gentle smile with which a man recognises and pities a childishness he has himself outgrown drake ordered port having great faith in its qualities as inducive of a catlike content and consequent goodfellowship mallinson however never touched port nothing but the lightest of french burgundies after dinner for him the party withdrew to the smokingroom by the way drake asked mallinson have you anything to do tonight no why i was asked to take you to a sort of party conway looked up sharply in surprise you were asked to take me exclaimed drake who asked you oh nobody whom you know he hesitated for a second then added with studied carelessness a miss le mesurier her mothers dead he explained noticing the look of surprise on drakes face so she keeps house for her father theres an aunt to act as chaperon but she doesnt count i got a note from miss le mesurier just before i came here asking me to bring you but what does she know of me oh i may have mentioned your name he explained indifferently and conway smiled besides said conway the meteor has transformed you into a public character one knows of your movements what i dont see is how miss le mesurier could have known that you had landed yesterday commented mallinson i was interviewed by the meteor on plymouth quay you received the note you say this evening she may have seen the interview drake called to a waiter and ordered him to bring a copy of the paper conway took it and glanced at the first page yes here it is he read a few lines to himself and burst into a laugh guess how it begins i know said drake a sovereign you dont drake laid a sovereign on the table conway followed his example it begins said drake with a latin quotation o si sic omnes it begins corrected conway pocketing the money with very downright english and he read drake with the casual indifference of the hardened filibuster readily accorded an interview to our representative on landing from the dunrobin castle yesterday afternoon drake snatched the paper out of conways hand and ran his eye down the column to see whether his words had been similarly transmuted by the editorial alchemy they were printed however as they had been spoken but interspersed with comments the editor had contented himself with stamping his own device upon the coin he had not tried to change its metal drake tossed the paper on one side the man goes vitriolthrowing with vinegar he said conway picked up the meteor you are a captain arent you he asked the omission of the title presumes you a criminal i dont object to the omission replied drake i suppose the title belongs to me by right but after all a captain in matanga there are more honourable titles mallinson looked at him suddenly as though some fresh idea had shot into his brain well will you come he asked carelessly i hardly feel inclined to move i didnt imagine you would there was evidence of distinct relief in the brisk tone of mallinsons voice he turned to conway we ought to be starting i fancy i shall stay with drake conway answered despondently to drakes thinking and he lapsed into silence after mallinsons departure broken by intervals of ineffective sarcasm concerning women ineffectively accentuated by short jerks of laughter he roused himself in a while and carried drake off to his club where he found hugh fielding pulling his moustache over the meteor he introduced drake and left them together i was reading a list of your sins said fielding and he waved the newspaper drake laughed in reply the vivisectionists said fielding may cite you as proof of the painlessness of their work it is my character that suffers the knife i fancy the editor would prefer to call the operation a postmortem fielding warmed to his new acquaintance whisky and potass helped them to discover common friends about whom fielding supplied information with a flavour of acid in his talk which commended him to drake it bit without malice mallinsons name was mentioned you have read his autobiography asked fielding no but i have read his novel thats what i mean most men wait till they have achieved a career before they write their autobiographies he anticipates his its rather characteristic of the man i think they drove from the club together in a hansom opposite to his rooms in st jamess street fielding got out goodnight he said and took a step towards the door a lukewarm curiosity which had been stirring in drake during the latter part of the evening prompted him to a question now that he saw the opportunity to satisfy it disappearing you know the le mesuriers he asked fielding laughed already he said i dont understand then you are not acquainted with the lady no thats what im asking what is miss le mesurier like she is more delightfully surprising than even i had imagined otherwise shes difficult to describe a bald enumeration of features would be rank injustice drakes curiosity responded to the flick one might fit them together with a little trouble he suggested the metaphor of a puzzle is not inapt replied fielding as he opened his door goodnight and he went in halfway down pall mall drake was smitten by a sudden impulse the fog had cleared from the streets he looked up at the sky the night was moonless but starlit and very clear he lifted the trap spoke to the cabman and in a few minutes was driving southwards across westminster bridge it was the chance recollection of a phrase dropped by conway during dinner which sent him in this untimely scurry to elmtree hill as distant as el dorado and as desirable the sentence limned with precision the impression which london used to produce upon drake the sight of it touched upon some single chord of fancy in a nature otherwise prosaic of which the existence was unsuspected by his few companions and unrealised by himself working in that tower which you could see from the summit of the elmtree hill topping the skyline to the west in order to complete his education as an engineer before his meagre capital was exhausted drake had enjoyed little opportunity of acquiring knowledge of london and those acquaintances of his who travelled thither with their shiny black bags every morning seemed to him to know even less than he did there were but two points of view from which the town was regarded in the suburb and the inhabitants chose this view according to their sex to the men london was a countinghouse and certainly some miles of yellow brick mansions and flashing glasshouses testified that the view was a profitable one to the women it was the alluringly wicked abode of society and they held their hands before their faces when they mentioned it to hide their yearning occasionally they imagined they caught a glimpse into it when a minister from one of the states in the balkan peninsula strayed down to shed a tallowcandle lustre over a garden party to both these views drake had listened with the air of a man listening to an impertinence and his attitude towards the former view showed particularly the strength of the peculiar impression which london made on him since he always placed the acquisition of a fortune as an aim before himself he thought of london in fact as a countryman might with all a countrymans sense of its mystery and romance intensified in him by the daily sight of its domes and spires he saw it clothed by the changing seasons now ringed in green now shrouded in white on summer mornings when it lay clearly defined like a finished model and the sun sparkled on the vanes set the long lines of windows ablaze in the houses of parliament and turned the river into a riband of polished steel or again when the cupola of st pauls and the clock tower at westminster pierced upwards through a level of fog as though hung in the midair or when mists shredded by a south wind swirled and writhed about the rooftops until the city itself seemed to take fantastic shapes and melt to a substance no more solid than the mists themselves these pictures deeply impressed upon him at the moment of actual vision remained with drake during the whole period of his absence changing a little no doubt as his imagination more and more informed them but losing nothing of vividness rather indeed waxing in it with the gradual years one may think of him as he marched on expeditions against hostile tribes dwelling upon these recollections as upon the portrait of an inherited homestead london in fact became to him a living motive a determining factor in any choice of action whatsoever ambitions he nourished presumed london as their startingpoint it was then after all not very singular that on this first night of his return he should make a pilgrimage to the spot whence he had drawn such vital impressions for a long time he stood looking down the grass slope ragged with brambles and stunted trees and comprehending the whole lighted city in his glance on the way home his mind which soon tired of a plunge into sentiment reverted to the thought of miss le mesurier and he speculated unsuccessfully on the motive which had prompted her to send him so immediate an invitation the enigmatic interest which she took in him gave to him in fact a very definite interest in her he wondered again what she was like fieldings description helped to pique his curiosity all that he knew of her was her surname and he found it impossible to infer a face or even a figure from this grain of knowledge by the time he reached the grand hotel he was regretting that he had not accepted her invitation chapter iii drake repeated his question to fielding two days later after a dinner with conway at his club but in a tone of languid interest why dont you ask mallinson said fielding he knows her better than i do conway contested the assertion with some heat besides added drake his imagination may have been at work about women i prefer the estimate of a man of the world the phrase was distasteful to a gentleman whose ambition it was to live and to be recognised as living within view of but outside the world say just above it in a placid atmosphere of his own creation fielding leaned back in his chair to mete out punishment joining the fingertips with an air of ordering a detailed statement the inhabitants of sark he began were from immemorial times notable not merely for their predatory instincts but for the stayathome fashion in which they gave those instincts play they did not scour the seas for their victims neither did they till their island there was no need for so much exertion they lay supine upon their rocks and waited until a sail appeared above the horizon even then they did not stir till nightfall but after it was dark they lighted bonfires upon suitable promontories especially towards brecqhou and the gouliot channel where snags are numerous and gathered in their harvest in the morning but drake interrupted what on earth has that to do with miss le mesurier a great deal as you will see if you listen patiently lloyds at that time had not been invented and the sarkese were consequently unpopular with the trading community and in the reign of henry the well the particular henry is immaterial an irate band of merchants sailed from winchelsea on a trip they depopulated sark in a single night as they thought but they were mistaken one family escaped their attention the le mesuriers who were the custodians of the silver mines at this point conway broke in with an impatient laugh fielding turned a quiet eye upon him and repeated in an even voice who were the custodians of the silver mines and lived under the shelter of a little cliff close by the main shaft when helier de carteret who you know and he inclined suavely towards conway was seigneur of somewhere or other in jersey came a few years later to colonise sark he found the le mesuriers in possession and while he confiscated the mines he allowed them to retain their ancient dignity of custodians fudge said conway rudely fielding waved a deprecating hand and continued living where they did it is not to be wondered at that the le mesuriers became gradually rich and the de carterets gradually poor so that when the latter family was compelled to place the seigneurie of sark upon the market the le mesuriers were the highest bidders the le mesuriers thus became seigneurs of sark but with their position they reversed their conduct and instead of taking other peoples money out of mines they put their own in with the result that they sustained embarrassing losses i mention these details incidentally to show that miss le mesurier of today is directly descended from ancestors of predatory instincts who did not go ahunting for victims but unobtrusively attracted them in a passive lazy way which was none the less effectual conways patience was exhausted at this period of the disquisition i never heard such a hotchpotch of nonsense in my life he said i admit returned fielding with unruffled complacency that i aimed at an allegory rather than a pedantic narrative of facts i was endeavouring to explain clarice le mesurier on the fashionable principle of heredity it flashed across drake that if fielding had described though with some exaggeration an actual phase of miss le mesuriers character she must have been driven to make the first advance towards his acquaintance by a motive of unusual urgency the notion however did but flash and flicker out he had no mental picture of the girl to fix her within his view he knew not in fact whether she was girl or woman she was to him just an abstraction and drake was seldom inclined for the study of abstractions his curiosity might perhaps have been stronger had mallinson related to him the way in which he had been received at the house of the le mesuriers after his dinner with drake when he arrived he found the guests staring hard at each other silently with the vacant expression which comes of an effort to understand a recitation in a homely dialect from the north of the tweed he waited in the doorway and suddenly saw miss le mesurier rise from an embrasure in the window and take half a step towards him then she paused and resumed her seat thats because i come alone he thought and something more than his vanity was hurt the recitation reached its climax darby and joan quarrelling through nineteen stanzas as to whether they had been disturbed by a rat or a mouse discovered in the twentieth that the animal was a ball of wool the company sighed their relief in a murmur of thanks and mallinson crossed the room to the window and captain drake clarice asked as she gave him her hand the disappointment in her voice irritated him and he answered with a sharp petulance hes not a captain really you know the girl glanced at him in surprise i mean he went on answering the glance of course he held the rank over there but a captain in matanga he shrugged his shoulders there are more honourable titles still i asked you to bring him you got my note i suppose her manner signified a cold request for an explanation i couldnt he replied shortly you mean you did not think it worth while to take enough trouble to find him no thats not the reason in fact i dined with him tonight but i saw that i couldnt bring him here why well hes changed in what way he has grown so hopelessly bourgeois the epithet was a light to clarice she knew it for the superlative in mallinsons grammar of abuse bourgeois the term was the palm of a hand squashed upon a lighted candle it snuffed you out convicted of bourgeoisie you ought to tinkle a bell for the rest of your life or at the easiest be confined east of temple bar applied to drake the word connoted animosity pure and simple animosity suddenly conceived too for it was not a week since mallinson had been boasting of his friendship with the man what was the reason of that animosity clarice lowered her eyelashes demurely and smiled i fancied he was your friend she said with inquiring innocence i believe i remarked that he was changed mallinson looked up at a corner of the ceiling as he spoke and the exasperation was more than ever pronounced in his voice mr drake she went on and she laid the slightest possible emphasis on the prefix mr drake has travelled among the natives a good deal i think you told me yes its funny that that should make a man bourgeois mallinson became flippant i am not so sure he said the natives i should think are essentially bourgeois they love beads and thats typical of the class evil communications you know and he laughed but awkwardly and without merriment really asked clarice looking straight at him with grave eyes she seemed to be seriously deliberating the truth of his remark mallinsons laughter stopped short theres my aunt beckoning to you she said later in the evening she relented towards him salving her disappointment with the flattery of his jealousy she did not however relinquish on that account her intention to make stephen drakes acquaintance she merely postponed it trusting that the tides of accident would drift them together as indeed they did though after a longer delay than she had anticipated the occasion of their meeting was provided by the visit of a french actress to one of the london theatres drake and conway edged into their stalls just before the curtain rose on a performance of froufrou during the first act the theatre gradually filled and when the lights were turned up at its close only one box was empty it was upon the first tier next to the stage a few minutes after the second act had begun conway nudged drake and nodded towards the box you asked what miss le mesurier was like theres your answer drake glanced in that direction he saw a girl in a dress of pink silk standing in the front of the box with her hands upon the ledge and leaning her head a little forwards beyond it the glare striking up from the stage beneath her gave a burnish of copper to her hair and a warm light to her face she seemed of a fragile figure and with features regular and delicate drake received a notion of unimpressive prettiness and turned his attention to the stage when the lights were raised again in the auditorium he noticed that fielding was in the box talking to a gentleman with white hair and that mallinson was seated by the side of miss le mesurier the latter couple were gazing about the house and apparently discussing the audience at all events conversing with considerable animation drake commented upon their manner and drew the conventional inference oh dear no answered conway energetically of course mallinsons aim is apparent enough poor fellow a touch of scorn in the voice which rang false negatived the pity of the phrase but i dont suppose for an instant that she has realised it she would be the last to do so no she has a fad in her head about authors just for the moment oh said drake turning with some interest to his companion does that account for a man of influence yes replied conway reluctantly i fancy it does i wondered what set him to writing he was at the bar when he met her i believe she persuaded him to write the book and give up the law she is undertaking a pretty heavy responsibility conway looked at his friend and laughed im afraid you wont find that she takes that view nor indeed do i see why she should mallinson was doing no good well not much anyway at the bar he has scored by following her advice so if she ever had any responsibility which i dont admit for there was no compulsion on him to obey his luck has already wiped it out i suppose the whitehaired mans her father said drake yes theres another sister but shes at school in brussels how did you come across them mallinson and i met them one summer when we were taking a holiday at sark drake caught the eye of a man who was passing the end of his row of stalls towards the saloon and was beckoned out i will join you after the interval he said turning to conway and he saw that his companion was bowing to miss le mesurier miss le mesurier in her box noticed drakes movement and she asked mallinson who is that speaking to mr conway mallinson put up his glasses and looked clarice read recognition in a lift of eyebrows and guessed from his hesitation to answer who it was that he recognised well who is it where asked mallinson assuming an air of perplexity where you were looking said she quietly its stephen drake interposed fielding and hulloa he added in a voice of surprise as he observed the man whom drake joined drake stephen drake exclaimed mr le mesurier leaning forward hurriedly point him out to me fielding the latter obeyed and mr le mesurier watched drake until he disappeared through the doorway with what seemed to mallinson a singular intentness the fathers manner waked him to a suspicion that he might possibly have mistaken the daughters motive in seeking drakes acquaintance was it merely a whim a fancy strengthened to the point of activity by the sight of his name in print or was it something more was there some personal connection between drake and the le mesuriers of which the former was in some way ignorant he was still pondering the question when clarice spoke to him so that was the bourgeois was it she said bending forwards and almost whispering the words mallinson flushed was it he asked i cant see i am rather shortsighted i begin to think you are the sentence was spoken with an ironic sympathy which deepened the flush upon mallinsons cheek a knock at the door offered him escape he rose and admitted conway conway was received with politeness by mr le mesurier with cordiality by his daughter i have drake with me said conway i came to ask permission since you invited him to beaufort gardens to introduce him after the next act mr le mesurier started up in his chair did you ask him to the house he asked clarice abruptly i asked mr mallinson to bring him she replied and then with all the appearance of a penitent anxiety why oughtnt i to have done so she asked mr le mesurier cast a suspicious glance at his daughter i am so sorry she said i didnt know that oh well interrupted mr le mesurier hurriedly theres no reason that i know of why you shouldnt have asked him except that its surely a trifle unusual isnt it you dont know him from adam but i assure you mr le mesurier interposed conway theres nothing to be said against drake of course replied mr le mesurier with a testy laugh at the others warmth we know the length of your enthusiasms my dear conway but ill grant all you like about drake i only say that my daughter isnt even acquainted with the fellow it is just that drawback which mr conway proposes to remove said clarice demurely of course she went on i should never have thought of inviting him if mr mallinson had not spoken of him so often as his friend she directed her sweetest smile to mallinson you did didnt you yes mr drake had been away from england for so long that i thought it would be only kind to ask you to bring him but if i had known that papa had any objection i should naturally never have done it i am very sorry perhaps i am not careful enough she ended her speech in a tone of selfreproach which had its effect for her father was roused by it to expostulate my dear he said i never hinted that i had an objection to him you are always twisting peoples words and imputing wrong meanings to them mallinson fancied that he detected a note of something more than mere remonstrance in mr le mesuriers voice a consciousness of some thought in his daughters mind which he would not openly acknowledge her to possess the perception quickened mallinsons conjecture into a positive conviction there was evidently some fact about drake some incident perhaps in his life which brought him into relations with the le mesuriers relations ignored by drake but known by mr le mesurier and suspected by clarice was this fact to drakes advantage or discredit the fathers manner indicated rather the latter but mallinson put that aside it was more than overbalanced by the daughters he sought for a word and chanced on forwardness his irritation against her prompted him to hug it to stamp it on his thoughts of her with a jeer of i have found you out on the other hand all his knowledge of her cried out against the word he looked into the girls face to resolve his doubts upon the point and found that she was watching him with some perplexity a question to conway explained the reason why she was puzzled how did you know that i asked mr drake to beaufort gardens she asked i was present when mallinson asked him to go mr mallinson asked him she exclaimed dropping her fan in her surprise why i thought she saw the confusion in mallinsons face and checked herself suddenly with a little laugh of pure enjoyment her companions jealousy was more heroical than she had given him credit for it had induced him to lie to cover his discomfiture mallinson dived for the fan oh dont trouble she said sympathy shaping the words into a positive entreaty you are so shortsighted you know then you will bring mr drake she turned to conway as he rose and moved towards the door mr le mesurier had resumed his conversation with fielding and beyond a slight movement of impatience he gave no sign that he had heard the words after the next act said conway and he went out mallinson picked up the fan and laid it upon the ledge of the box i lied to you that evening he whispered in a low faltering tone i have no excuse cant you guess why i lied there was a feeling behind the words genuine by the ring of it and to feeling clarice was by nature responsive mallinson saw the mischief die out of her face the eyelids droop until the lashes touched the cheek then she raised them again tenderness flowered in her eyes perhaps she said she turned from him and watched conway making his way along the row of stalls drake was already in his seat then why didnt mr drake come if you asked him she said with a quick change of tone he gave no reason beyond that it was his first night in london miss le mesurier looked again at drake his indifference irritated her and in a measure interested her in spite of herself she was not used to indifference and felt a need to apologise for it to herself of course she reflected he had not seen me then and so was reinstated in her selfesteem the explanation however failed her the next moment for drake at all events had seen her now she had caught him looking up into the box before conway left yet when conway communicated his news drake never so much as moved his head in her direction the three blows of the mallet had just sounded from behind the curtain and he sat upright in his seat his face fixed towards the stage clarice bit her lips and frowned dont be alarmed he is really quite interested in you she looked up fielding was standing just behind her shoulder he asked me quite often what you were like i dont understand you said she loftily and then he might be a schoolboy at his first pantomime he gives that kind of impression i believe in everything he does miss le mesurier had not made the remark in order to elicit eulogy he looks old though she said and her voice defied fielding to contradict her responsibility writes with the cyphers of age he quoted solemnly it was his habit to recite sentences from a man of influence when mallinson was present in a tone which never burlesqued but somehow belittled the work mallinson was never able to take definite offence but he was none the less invariably galled by it as a matter of fact there is hardly a year to choose between the ages of drake conway and you mallinson is there asked fielding mallinson admitted that the statement was correct he has lived a hard life has anxieties enough now i dont doubt you will find the explanation in that the only people who remain young nowadays are actors they keep the child in them the curtain went up as he spoke as soon as it was lowered again conway hurried drake out of the stalls and up the staircase to the box clarice welcomed drake quietly mr le mesurier vouchsafed him the curtest of nods didnt i see you join israel biedermann asked fielding the name belonged to a speculator who had lately been raised into prominence by the clink of his millions yes replied drake with a laugh the city makes one acquainted with strange financiers i have business with him mr le mesurier showed symptoms of interest really he said you mean to return to africa i suppose if i can help it no you intend to stay in england asked mallinson sharply yes replied drake he addressed himself to miss le mesurier you were kind enough to invite me to your house on the evening i arrived mr le mesuriers eyebrows went up at the mention of the day mr mallinson had talked of you she explained we seemed to know you already i saw that you had landed from an interview in the meteor and thought you might have liked to come with your friend the words were spoken indifferently the meteor inquired mr le mesurier isnt that the paper which attacked you mr drake you let yourself be interviewed by it i didnt know that he glanced keenly at his daughter and mallinson intercepted the look his conviction was proved certain there was something concealed something maybe worth his knowing the attack was of no importance replied drake but i wanted it to be known in some quarters that i had landed without losing time you replied to the attack not so much that i gave the itinerary of the march to boruwimi mr le mesurier perceived his daughters eyes quietly resting upon him and checked a movement of impatience less at the answer than at his own folly in provoking it drake turned to clarice and was offered a seat by her side he realised now that she was near talking to him that his impression of her gained from the distance between the box and the stalls did her injustice she seemed now the vignette of a beautiful woman missing the stateliness perhaps too the distinction but obtaining by very reason of what she missed a counterbalancing charm to be appreciated only at close quarters a charm of the quiet kind diffused about her like a light winsome that was the epithet he applied to her and remained doubtfully content with it for there was a gravity too clarice invited him to speak of matanga but drake was reticent on the subject through sheer disinclination to talk about himself a disinclination which the girl recognised and gave him credit for shooting a comparing glance at mallinson mr le mesurier it should be said remarked this reticence as well and it gave him an idea from matanga drake led the conversation back to london and they fell to discussing the play you are very interested in it she said yes said he i have never seen the play before i should hardly have thought it would have suited your taste conway observed why its french of course but you can discount the sentiment there is a stratum of truth left dont you think mallinson raised pitying shoulders of the abc order perhaps he allowed i am afraid it appeals to me all the more on that account drake answered with a genial laugh but what i meant really was truth to those people truth to the characters presumed consistency is perhaps the better word i like to see a play run on simple lines to an end you cant but foresee the tastes barbarian i dont doubt miss le mesuriers lips instinctively pouted a mischievous bourgeois towards mallinson he remarked hastily that he thought the curtain was on the point of rising and miss le mesurier pushed her operaglasses towards him with a serene not yet i think mallinson understood the suggestion of her movement and relapsed into a sullen silence by the time that conway and drake rose to leave the box mr le mesurier had thought out his idea his manner changed of a sudden to one of great cordiality he expressed his pleasure at meeting drake and shook him by the hand but destroyed the effect of his action through weakly revealing his diplomacy to his daughter by a triumphant glance at her at the close of the performance he met drake in the vestibule of the theatre and lingered behind his party fielding mallinson and conway meanwhile saw miss le mesurier into her carriage what in the world is papa doing asked clarice exchanging cards with drake replied fielding mallinson turned his head round quickly and beheld the two gentlemen affably shaking hands again conway bent into the carriage do you like him he asked oh yes she replied indifferently then i am glad i introduced him to you and some emphasis was laid upon the i mr le mesurier came out to the brougham and the coachman drove off i like that young fellow drake he said with a wave of the hand i have asked him to call clarice did not inform her diplomatic father that unless she had foreseen his intention she would have undertaken the discharge of that act of courtesy herself mallinson took a hansom and drove straight from the theatre to his chambers in south kensington conway walked off in the opposite direction so that drake and fielding were left to stroll away together they walked across leicester square towards st jamess street each occupied with his own thoughts fieldings were of an unusually stimulating kind he foresaw the possibility of a very diverting comedy to be played chiefly for his amusement and partly for miss le mesuriers by clarice herself drake and mallinson from the clash of two natures so thoroughly different as those of the two men played off against one another with all the delicate manipulation of miss le mesuriers experienced hand there was much enjoyment to be anticipated for the purely disinterested spectator which he intended to be of the probable dnouement he formed no conception and in fact avoided purposely any temptation to do so he preferred that the play should unroll itself in a series of delightful surprises the one question which he asked himself at this time was whether drake might not decline to act his proper and assigned part he glanced at him as they walked along drake looked thoughtful and was certainly silent both thought and silence were propitious signs on the other hand drake had interests in the city had them at heart too and worse still had the city itself at heart fielding recollected an answer he had made to mallinson the word heart brought it to his mind mallinson was jeering at the journalists metaphor of the throbbing heart as applied to london the phrase drake had said to me is significant of something more than cheap phraseology i know that half a throb could create an earthquake in matanga what if the mans established interest in this direction were to suppress his nascent interest in clarice fielding immediately asked drake what he thought of miss le mesurier oh said the latter palpably waking from reflections of quite another order i liked her and he spoke of her looks she has the art of dressing well corrected fielding disappointment spurring him to provoke advocacy of the lady drake however was indifferent to the correction i like her eyes he said she is skilled in the use of them i didnt notice that they seemed of the quiet kind at need she can swing a wreckers light behind them i like her hand too it has the grip of a friend a friend yes theres the pitfall drake only laughed he was not to be persuaded to any strenuous defence and fielding felt inclined to harbour a grudge against him as needlessly a spoilsport later on however when he was in bed it occurred to him that the play might still be performed though upon different lines and with a plot rather different from what he had imagined his plot inverted in fact clarice le mesurier he remembered had made the first advance to drake what if she for once in a while were to figure as the pursuer that alternative would perhaps be the more diverting of the two he must consult mrs willoughby as to the effect which drakes bearing would produce on women consult her cautiously prudence warned him mrs willoughby a cousin and friend of miss le mesuriers was not of the sort to lend a helping hand in the game if the girl was to provide the sport or indeed in the other event the one essential thing however was that there should be a comedy and he must see to it that there was one with which reflection he drew the bedclothes comfortably about him and went to sleep there was however one other condition equally essential to his enjoyment but so apparently inevitable that he did not stop to consider it namely that hugh fielding should be a mere spectator it did not occur to him at all that he might be drawn into an unwilling assumption of a part in his own play chapter iv mallinson on reaching home unlocked a little oak cabinet which hung against the wall beside his writingtable and searched amongst a litter of newspaper cuttings and incomplete manuscripts he unearthed at last a copy of the meteor bought between the grand hotel and beaufort gardens on the night of drakes dinner and drawing up a chair to the fire he read through the interview again the something to be known was gradually he felt shaping into a definite form it had acquired locality this very evening as he was assured by the recollection of a certain repressed movement upon mr le mesuriers part at the mention of boruwimi could he add to the knowledge by the help of the interview mr le mesurier had not known of its publication until tonight and so clearly had not read it his knowledge was antedated but on the other hand it was immediately after the perusal of the article that clarice had sent through him her invitation to drake mallinson studied the article line by line but without result he tossed the newspaper back into the cupboard changed his coat and sat down to his writingtable with a feverish impulse to work he was unable to conceive it possible that drake should be unaffected by miss le mesuriers attractions the man was energetic therefore a dangerous rival miss le mesurier besides seemed bent upon pitting drake and himself against each other why he asked well whatever the reason he had a chance of winning more than a chance he reflected remembering a passage of tenderness that evening his future was promising if only he worked perhaps clarice only ranged the two men opposite to one another in order to stimulate one of them he reached an answer to his question why the extravagances of a lovers thoughts have often this much value they disclose principles of his nature working at the formation of the man and in mallinsons case they betrayed his habit of drawing the energy for application from externals and from no sacred fire within he shut his door and worked for a month at the end of the month lying in bed at night and watching a planet visible through his window he saw the ray of light between himself and the star divide into two and the two beams describe outwards segments of a circle he turned his face away for a few moments and then looked at the planet again the phenomenon was repeated he knew it for a trick of tired eyes and a warning to slacken his labours on the next afternoon he called at beaufort gardens and was received warmly by clarice and her aunt there was a suggestion of reproach for his long absence in the formers voice and suggestion of reproach from her kindled him he explained his plunge under surface on the ground of work details were immediately demanded the plot of the new novel discussed and praised there was flattery too in the diffident criticism of an incident here and there and the sweetest foretaste of happiness in the joint rearrangement of the disputed chapter mallinson was lifted on a billow of confidence he was of the type which adjusts itself to the opinions his company may have of him praise mallinson and he deserved praises ignore him and he sank like a plummet to depths of insignificance conscious of insignificance and of nothing more except a dull rancour against the person who impressed the knowledge on him that way drake had offended unwittingly at the grand hotel he had recognised no distinction between the mallinson of today and the mallinson of ten years ago mallinson was asked to dinner on friday of the next week really said the aunt after his departure he is very clever i didnt understand what he said but he is very clever yes said clarice reflectively i suppose i mean of course he is she spoke in a tone of hesitation which surprised her auditor for hitherto clarice had been very certain as to her impressions on the point at dinner on the following friday mallinson was confronted by conway and had mrs willoughby upon his right mallinson liked mrs willoughby the widow of the black hair and blue eyes now in the mauve stage of widowhood she drew him out of the secretiveness within which he habitually barred himself and he felt thankful to her for his prisoners hour of midday airing mrs willoughby spoke to clarice mentioning a private view of an exhibition of pictures at which she had seen clarice who was the cavalier she added mr drake clarice replied serenely i met him there by accident mrs willoughby looked puzzled and repeated the name in an undertone you dont know him i think clarice went on he comes here papa asked him to call captain drake i suppose we ought to call him but he has dropped the captain mrs willoughby started and shot a bewildered glance at mr le mesurier i like the man very much said mr le mesurier with a touch of championship in his voice you should meet him i am sure you would like him too mrs willoughby made no answer to the suggestion and resumed her dinner in silence while conway sang his usual paean of praise after a little she turned to mallinson do you know this mr drake yes we were boys together in the same suburb before he went to africa it was unfortunately through me that he was asked to this house i had mentioned him as a friend of mine at one time and miss le mesurier invited me to bring him on the day he reached london so soon as that its funny clarice never mentioned him to me you of course told her the date of mr drakes arrival no she found that out from an interview in the meteor i remember you read it yes so you introduced him to clarice no he did not come that night conway brought him up to mr le mesuriers box when froufrou was being played a month ago never mind we will talk of something else mrs willoughby had just observed clarice she was nodding assent to the words of her neighbour but plainly lending an attentive ear to mrs willoughbys conversation mrs willoughby spoke of indifferent subjects until the ladies rose when mallinson however entered the drawingroom he perceived mrs willoughbys fan motioning him to attendance and she took up the thread of her talk at the point where she had dropped it you said unfortunately well you have read the meteor you endorse their view from what i have seen of drake since his return yes but if theres anything in their charges why doesnt the colonial office move the colonial office mallinson shrugged his shoulders you forget only natives and arabs were killed in the boruwimi expedition and they dont count if he had killed a white man whats the matter nothing said mrs willoughby recovering from a start an idea occurred to me thats all tell me for a moment mrs willoughby seemed at a loss then she said with a laugh if you will know i was wondering whether your explanation covered all you meant by unfortunately she lowered her voice you can be frank with me mallinson was diverted by her assurance of sympathy and launched out immediately into an elaborate history of the emotions which the friendliness of miss le mesurier to drake had set bubbling within him mr le mesurier approached the pair before mallinson had finished and the latter hurriedly broke off well said mr le mesurier will you meet mr drake constance at lunch say on sunday mrs willoughby stared do you mean that certainly mr le mesurier was defiant mrs willoughbys stare changed to a look of thoughtfulness no she said i dont think i could she moved away mallinson followed her you know something about drake he exclaimed something which would help me that is hardly generous rivalry she replied does he deserve generosity he asked with a trace of cunning in his expression which mrs willoughby found distasteful if i can help you she answered evasively help you honourably i will and she turned away mallinson put out a hand to stop her i need help he whispered there is a conspiracy to praise the man you heard conway at dinner its the same with every one from mr le mesurier to fielding oh she said her voice kindling to an expression of interest does mr fielding like him he is fastidious too she paused for a second in deliberation her eyes searching the floor raising them she perceived mr le mesurier coming towards her i claim our privilege she said i will lunch on sunday and meet your paragon after all i am very glad he said impressively lunch at two mrs willoughby waited until he was out of earshot and turned again to mallinson it is best that i should see the man and know something more of him than hearsay dont you think so a note of apology discounted the explanation mallinson understood that the reference to fielding was the cause of her change of mind do you value fieldings opinion he asked oh i dont know on some subjects i think yes dont you mallinson began to wonder immediately whether fieldings opinions might not be valuable after all since mrs willoughby valued them if so the man might be able to throw some light upon other points for instance the perplexing question of miss le mesuriers inclinations mallinson made up his mind to call upon fielding he called on the sunday morning and fielding blandly related to him his history of sark having worked mallinson to a sufficiently amusing pitch of indignation and having hinted his moral that the subjugation of miss le mesurier would be effected only by the raider fielding complacently dismissed him and repaired to beaufort gardens for lunch he found drake upon the doorstep with a hand upon the knocker and the two gentlemen exchanged greetings i have just left mallinson said fielding drakes hand fell from the knocker tell me he said mallinson perplexes me in many ways for instance he shows me little goodwill now does that surprise you fielding interjected with a laugh drake coloured and replied quickly you didnt let me finish if he dislikes me what made him talk about me as his friend to to the le mesuriers before i returned to england your name in print you verged on well notoriety you may laugh but thats the reason mallinsons always on the rack of other peoples opinions judges himself by what he imagines to be their standard of him acquaintanceship with a celebrity lifts him in their eyes he thinks so really in his own drake remained doubtfully pondering what credit acquaintanceship with him could confer on any one he was led back to his old view of mallinson as a man tottering on a rickety base will he do something great he asked his forehead puckered in an effort to calculate the qualities which make for greatness fielding chuckled quietly and answered unlikely i think clever of course the man is but it is never the work he does that pleases him but the pose after the works done thats fatal drake looked at fielding curiously thats a criticism which would never have occurred to me he glanced at his watch we have five minutes shall we walk round the gardens fielding chuckled again and assented he saw the curtain rising on his comedy for five minutes they paced up and down the pavement with an interchange of simple questions on drakes part and discriminating answers on fieldings answers not wholly to encourage but rather to promote a state of doubt so much more interesting to the spectator when after the five minutes had elapsed they entered the house they found that mrs willoughby had arrived clarice introduced stephen drake to mrs willoughby he saw a woman apparently in the early twenties tall with a broad white forehead under masses of unruly black hair and black eyebrows shadowing eyes of the colour of seashallows on an august morning the eyes were hard he noticed and the lips pressed together she bowed to him without a word hostility was evidently to be expected and drake wondered at this for he knew mrs willoughby to be clarices chief friend and confidante mrs willoughby fired the first shot of the combat as soon as they had sat down to lunch she spoke of unscrupulous cruelty shown by african explorers and appealed to drake for correction she said but her tone implied corroboration i have known cases he admitted here and there you cant always prevent it the pioneer in a new country doesnt bring testimonials with him invariably in fact one case of the kind happened under my own eyes i might almost say mrs willoughby seemed put out of countenance by drakes reply she had plainly expected a strenuous denial of her statement drake caught a look of reproof which mr le mesurier directed towards her and set it down to his hosts courtesy towards his guest clarice however noticed the look too indeed she said tell us about it mr drake it will be a change from our usual frockcoat conversation mr le mesurier imposed the interdict of paternal authority i think my dear stories of that class are as a rule a trifle crude eh drake miss le mesurier on the instant became personified submission of course papa she said if you have reason for believing the story isnt suitable i wouldnt think of asking mr drake to tell it mr le mesurier raised his hands in a gesture of despair and looked again at mrs willoughby his glance said unmistakably now see what youve done fielding broke into an open laugh and clarice haughtily asked him to explain the joke so that the others present might share in his amusement i will said fielding in fact i meant you to ask me to i laughed because i notice that whenever you are particularly obedient to papa then you are particularly resolved to have your own way miss le mesuriers foot tapped under the table of course she said with a withering shrug of her shoulders thats wit mr fielding repartee was not her strong point no he replied merely rudeness and whats the use of being a privileged friend of the family if you cant be rude drake came to the rescue mr le mesurier is quite right said he incidents of the kind i mentioned are best left untold i dont doubt it said fielding a man loses all sight of humanitarian principles the moment hes beyond view of a fireside oh does he replied drake the man by the fireside is apt to confuse sentiment with humanitarian principles and sentiment i admit you have to get rid of when you find yourself surrounded with savages exactly you become assimilated with the savages and retain only one link between yourself and civilisation and that link is a maxim gun my dear fellow thats nonsense drake answered in some heat its easy enough to sit here and discuss humanitarian principles but you need a pretty accurate knowledge of what they are and what they are not before you begin to apply them recklessly beyond the reach of civilisation when i went first to africa i stayed for a time at pretoria and from pretoria i went north in a pioneer company you want to have been engaged in an expedition of that kind to quite appreciate what it means we were on short rations a good part of the time with a fair prospect of absolute starvation ahead and doing forced marches all the while when we camped of an evening i have seen men who had eaten nothing since breakfast and little enough then just slip the saddles from the horses and go fast asleep under the nearest tree without bothering about their supper then perhaps an officer would shake them up and theyd have to go collecting brushwood for fires thats a pretty bad business in the dark when youre dead tired with the days tramp you dont much care whether you pick up a snake or a stick of wood i remember too and he gave a laugh at the recollection we used to be allowed about a thimbleful of brandy a day well i have noticed men walk twenty yards away from the camps to drink their tot for fear some one might jog their elbows and it was only one mouthful after all you didnt need to water it altogether that kind of expedition would be something considerably more than an average strain upon a mans endurance if it was led through a friendly country but add to your difficulties the continual presence of an enemy outnumbering you incalculably always on the alert for you to slacken discipline for a second and remember you are not marching to safety but from it the odds against you are increasing all the time and that not for one or two days but for eighty and a hundred i can assure you one would hear a great deal less of the harmlessness of the black if more people had experienced that grisly hour before daybreak when they generally make their attacks your whole force its a mere handful stands under arms at attention in the dark and it can be dark on the veld even in the open on a starlight night the veld seems to drink up and absorb the light as though it was so much water trickling on the parched ground there you stand you have thrown out scouts to search the country round you but you know for certain that half of them are nodding asleep in their saddles for all you know you may be surrounded on all sides the strain of that hour of waiting grows so intense that you actually long to see the flash of a scouts rifle and so be certain they are coming or to feel the ground shake under you as they stamp their wardance half a mile away their battle chant too makes an uncanny sound when it swells across the veld in the night but upon my soul you almost hear it with relief drake stopped and looked round upon faces fixed intently on his own faces which mirrored his own absorption in his theme there was one exception however mrs willoughby sat back in her chair constraining herself to an attitude of indifference and as drake glanced at her her lips seemed to be moving as though with the inward repetition of some word or phrase even fielding was shaken out of his supermundane quietism for the first time he saw revealed the real quality in drake he saw visibly active that force of which although it had lain hitherto latent he had always felt the existence and understood why he had made friends so quickly and compelled those friends so perpetually to count with him in their thoughts it was not so much in the mere words that drake expressed this quality as in the spirit which informed the voice which launched them and the looks which gave them point his face flashed into mobility enthusiasm dispelling its set habit of gravity sloughing it fielding thought or better still burning through it as through a crust of lava his eyes eyes which listened fielding had not inaptly described them now spoke and spoke vigorously enthusiasm too rode on his voice deepening its tones not enthusiasm of the febrile kind which sends the speech wavering up and down the scale but enthusiasm with sobriety as its dominant note concentrated into a level flow of sound his description had all the freshness of an immediate occurrence compared with the ordinary style of reminiscence it was the rose upon the tree to the dried leaves of a potpourri but said fielding unconsciously resisting the influence which drake exerted i thought you took a whole army of blacks with you on these expeditions not on the one i speak of in matanga a small force of them yes but even they were difficult to manage and you could not depend upon them they would desert at the first opportunity sell their guns your peaceofferings of brass rods and whatever they could lay their hands on and straggle behind in the dusk until they got lost it was no use sending back for them in the morning one would only have found their bones and their bones pretty well scoured too i speak of them as a class of course there were races loyal enough no doubt the zanzibari for instance but the difficulty with them was to prevent them fighting when there was no occasion in fact the blacks who were loyal made up for their loyalty by a lack of commonsense cause and effect i should be inclined to call the combination remarked fielding with the lack of commonsense as the cause mrs willoughby looked her gratitude across the table and again her lips moved drake chanced to catch her eye and in spite of herself she rippled to a laugh she had been defending herself by a repetition of the editors comment of filibuster but at the same moment that drakes glance met hers she had just waked up to the humour of her conduct and recognised it as a veritable childs device she could not but laugh and laughing there into the eyes of the man she lost her hostility to him however mrs willoughby made an effort to recover it well i dont see she said to drake what right you have got to marching into other peoples countries even though they are black ah drake answered thats precisely what i call if i may say so the fireside point of view we obey a law of nature rather than claim a right one can discuss the merits of a law of nature comfortably by a fireside but out there one realises how academic the discussion is one obeys it the white man has always spread himself over the country of the black man and we may take it he always will he has the pioneers hankering after the uttermost corners of the earth and in addition to that the desire to prosper he obeys both motives they are of the essence of him besides if it comes to a question of abstract right i am not sure we couldnt set up a pretty good case after all a nation holds its country primarily to benefit itself no doubt but also in trust for the world and the two things hang together it benefits itself by observing that trust now the black man seals his country up he doesnt develop it in the first place he doesnt know how to and in the second if he did he would forget as soon as he could i suppose that it is impossible to estimate the extent of the good which the opening of africa has done for an overcrowded continent like europe and what touches europe touches the world no doubt of that is there but im preaching and he came abruptly to an end what i dont understand said mr le mesurier and he voiced a question the others felt an impulse to ask is how on earth you are content to settle down as a business man in the city drake retired into himself and replied with some diffidence oh the change is not as great perhaps as you think i have always looked forward to returning here one has ambitions of a kind you ought to go into parliament clarice said drake laughed thanking her with the laugh its rather too early to speak of that mrs willoughby observed that he actually blushed a blushing filibuster there was a contradiction of terms in the phrase and he undoubtedly blushed a question shot through her mind did he blush from modesty or because clarice made the suggestion mrs willoughby asked fielding for an answer as he stood by the door of her brougham before she drove away from beaufort gardens for both reasons i should say he replied you think then hes attracted he hardly showed signs of it except that once and modesty alone might account for that mrs willoughby laid some insistence upon the possibility i should have been inclined to agree with you answered fielding but drake dragged me round the square before lunch to question me about mallinson that makes for your view certainly what did you tell him i painted the portrait which i thought he wanted picked out mallinsons vices in clear colours and added a few which occurred to me at the moment however drake closed my mouth with hes a hard worker though i like the man for that cried mrs willoughby and checked herself suddenly yes hes honest certainly but was he right quite mallinson works very hard scents danger i suppose mrs willoughby heaved a sigh of relief theres some chance for him then will he do anything great fielding laughed thats one of the questions drake put to me i think never mrs willoughby accepted the dictum without asking for the reason she sat for a moment disconsolately thoughtful then she gave a start theres percy conway i had forgotten him and wisely i should think he is just making a back for drake to jump from if he will yes i noticed that said mrs willoughby with a sneer at the folly of the creature he seems to look upon mallinson and himself as the two figures which tell the weather in a swiss clock when one comes out of his box the other goes in i catch your trick you see and her face relaxed to a smile only to improve on it in the matter of truth for you imply a comparison between miss le mesurier and the weather and the points of resemblance are strong mrs willoughbys smile became a laugh i dont hold with you about clarice she said you dont know her as i do she can take things seriously intensely so for five minutes i have never denied it mrs willoughby did not display her usual alacrity to engage in the oftrepeated combat as to miss le mesuriers merits her face grew serious again does clarice care for him you think fielding was admiring mrs willoughbys eyes at the moment and answered absently conway you mean no no how wilfully irritating you are this mr drake of course by the way i suppose he will get on she spoke in a voice which implied regret for the supposition and almost appealed for a denial of it i should think theres no doubt of it they tell me he has just sent a force up country in matanga to locate concessions you hit harder than you knew at lunch for the force carries machineguns oh yes hell get on he has been seen arminarm with israel biedermann in throgmorton street you must tell that to a city man to realise what it means but do you think clarice cares for him miss le mesurier cares for he began and broke off with a question do you read latin he was answered with an exasperated shake of the head because miss le mesurier always reminds me of an ode of horace finished exquisite to the fingertips but still lacking something soul is it perhaps that lack makes the perfection but whats your objection to drake mrs willoughby started a little objection she laughed why i never told you that i had one you told not only me but every one at lunch drake himself included mrs willoughby looked doubtfully at fielding well she said there is something i feel inclined to explain it to you you may be able to advise me not now she went on as fielding bent forward with a very unusual interest let me see monday tuesday wednesday she ticked off the days upon her fingers thursday afternoon could you come and see me then yes thanks goodbye and dont forget five oclock i shall be in to no one else and mrs willoughby drove off with the smile again upon her face chapter v whether fielding was correct in limiting miss le mesuriers capacity for continued seriousness she was undeniably serious when she called upon mrs willoughby at halfpast one on the following day there were dark shadows under her eyes and the eyes themselves seemed to look pathetic reproaches at a world which had laid upon her unmerited distress mrs willoughby was startled at her appearance and imagined some family disaster why clarice what has happened she exclaimed you look as if you hadnt slept all night clarice kissed her and for answer sighed wearifully mrs willoughby was immediately relieved the trouble was due she realised to some new shuffle of clarices facile emotions she returned the kiss and refrained from further questions but being a practical woman she rang the bell and ordered the servant to lay two places for lunch clarice sank despondently into the most comfortable chair in the room not for me she said i am sure i couldnt eat anything you may as well try dear replied mrs willoughby and she crossed to clarice and unpinned her hat a little straw hat with the daintiest of pink ribbons she held it in her hand for a moment weighing it with a smile which had something of tenderness in it she laid a light hand upon the brown hair touching with a caress the curls about the forehead a childs face was turned up to hers with a pretty appeal of melancholy mrs willoughby was moved to kiss the girl again in spite of a similarity of years she had an affection almost maternal for clarice and with an intuition too which was almost maternal she was able to appreciate the sincerity of the girls distress with a doubtful smile at the gravity of its cause clarice threw her arms about mrs willoughbys neck oh connie she quavered you cant guess what has happened the voice threatened to break into sobs and there were tears already brimming the eyes never mind you shall tell me after lunch at lunch mrs willoughby industriously beguiled her with anecdotes she talked of an uncle of clarice a philistine seacaptain with pronounced opinions upon the advance of woman ludicrously mimicking his efforts to adapt a quarterdeck style of denunciation to the gentler atmosphere of a drawingroom to sharpen his diatribes the worthy captain was in the habit of straining ineffectually after epigrams mrs willoughby quoted an unsuccessful essay concerning the novels women favoured a woman with a slice of intellect likes that sort of garbage for the same reason that a girl with a neat pair of ankles likes a little mud in the streets clarice was provoked to a reluctant smile by a mental picture of a violent rubicund face roaring the words she was induced to play with a fragment of sole she ended by eating the wing of a chicken now said mrs willoughby when she had set clarice upon a sofa in front of a cosy fire in her boudoir tell me what all the troubles about she drew up a low chair and sat down with a hand upon the girls arm its about sid i mean mr mallinson she began he called yesterday afternoon after you had left papa had gone out for a walk and aunt was lying down with a sick headache so i saw him alone he said he was glad to get the opportunity of speaking to me by myself and he he well he asked me to marry him he was quite different from what he usually is else i might have stopped him before but he made a sort of rush at it i told him that i was very sorry but i didnt care for him in that kind of way at all events yet and then it was horrible the voice began to break again mrs willoughby took hold of clarices hand and the latter nestled towards her he got angry and violent and said that i had persuaded him to give up his profession and must have known quite well why he did it and that no woman had a right to interfere with a mans life until she was prepared to accept the responsibility of her interference i hardly understood what he said because he frightened me but i dont think that was at all a nice thing to say do you connie and her hand tightened upon her friends but he said other things too much worse than that i cant tell you and at last i felt as if i wanted to scream i should have screamed in a minute or two i know so i told him to go away then he became silent all at once and just stood looking at me and and i think that was worse than being abused at last he said goodbye so sorrowfully and i knew it would be for ever and we shook hands and he went out into the hall and closed the door it seemed to me that the door would never open again the threatened tears began to fall mrs willoughby however did not interrupt and clarice went on so as i heard the front door unlocked to let him out i opened the door of the room and went into the hall mr mallinson was standing on the first step he never looked back he was turning up his coatcollar and somehow it all seemed so sad i felt as if i hadnt a friend left in the world so i i i well asked mrs willoughby quickly i called him back into the room and asked him if we couldnt be friends what did he answer that he didnt see how that was possible since he wanted to marry me but i said that wouldnt matter as long as he didnt tell me so i think men are so inconsiderate dont you connie she broke off in a tone of reproach i cant understand what there is to laugh at you wouldnt either if you had seen him then because he just sat down and cried not as you and i do you know but with great tears running through his fingers and heaves of his shoulders it was heartbreaking then he got up and begged my pardon for what he had said and that was the worst of it all he declared that if he went the rest of his way alone the journey would be all the easier for the mile i went along with him and at that somehow i began to cry too and and thats all mrs willoughby sat silent for a little so you refused him she said thoughtfully and she bent towards clarice is it to be stephen drake clarice started up from the sofa and stood looking into the fire what an extraordinary thing that you should ask me that she replied slowly because mr mallinson asked it too she paused for a second or so and went on i have never thought of him in that way i am sure oh no and she roused herself from her attitude of deliberation and crossed to the window speaking briskly as she went i had quite a different reason mrs willoughby looked at her sharply but said nothing and presently clarice turned back into the room as though moved by a sudden impulse can i write a note here she asked certainly replied mrs willoughby and she set some envelopes and paper on the table clarice wrote a few lines and tore them up she repeated the process on four sheets of notepaper and as she was beginning the fifth attempt the door was opened and the servant announced that mr conway was waiting in the drawingroom clarice tore up the fifth sheet and rose from her chair i can write it when i get home she said percy conway said mrs willoughby when the door was closed again what a funny thing hes not in the habit of visiting me the fact is said clarice without the least embarrassment as she pinned on her hat i asked him to call for me here you dont mind do you clarice exclaimed mrs willoughby she stared at the girl noticing the traces of tears still visible on her face and then she began to laugh connie said miss le mesurier and her tone showed that she was hurt you are unsympathetic i cant help it cried mrs willoughby and she laughed yet louder i cant help it dear you cant imagine how lonely i have felt since since yesterday cried mrs willoughby and her laughter increased clarice youll be the death of me clarice stood gazing at her patiently her face grave with reproach until mrs willoughby succeeded in composing herself to a fitting seriousness but for all her efforts her mouth worked and the dimples appeared and vanished in her cheeks and a little ripple of laughter now and again escaped from her lips really said clarice i am disappointed in you connie i know it was out of place dear said mrs willoughby with humility but nevertheless her voice shook as she spoke fearing another access she began as a resource to lecture clarice upon the impropriety of making appointments with young gentlemen at other peoples houses the lecture however was received with disdain that seems to me still more out of place said clarice well we had better go into the drawingroom to mr conway said mrs willoughby clarice was indeed excessively indignant with mrs willoughby for she was in the habit herself of treating her feelings with a tender solicitude and consequently disliked the want of respect shown to them by her friend she betrayed the extent of her indignation by a proportionately excessive friendliness towards conway that afternoon he was allowed to conduct her to four picture galleries and a panopticon museum of tortures his offer to refresh her with tea in bond street was shyly accepted and at parting he was thanked with effusion for the pleasantest afternoon she had spent for some time on reaching home however miss le mesurier immediately wrote out the note which she had begun in mrs willoughbys boudoir she wrote it now without hesitation as though she had composed the form of its message while in the company of conway and addressed it to stephen drake she had a question to ask him she stated of some importance to herself would he call on thursday afternoon and answer it clarice read through the note before she sealed up the envelope the word importance caught her eye and she pondered over it for a moment she crossed it out finally and substituted interest then she sent her letter to the post at breakfast on the thursday morning clarice casually informed her father of drakes visit i wrote to him asking him to call she added mr le mesurier looked up from the pages of his times why he asked quickly i want him to tell me something the times crackled in his hands and fluttered to the floor he opened his mouth to speak and thought better of it and repeated the action more than once then he scratched his head with a helpless air and picked up his newspaper silly girl he said at last silly girl and relapsed into silence at the close of breakfast however he made an effort at expostulation you will make the man believe youre in love with him he said and in fact he could have chanced on no happier objection to present to her clarice flushed to the temples sidney mallinson mrs willoughby and now her father all three had made the same suggestion and the repetition of it vexed her pride there were others they might have said it of with more appearance of truth she thought sidney mallinson himself for instance or even percy conway but he drake for a moment she felt inclined to telegraph to him telling him not to come then she thought of the motive which had induced her to send for him no she would ask her question that afternoon and so have done with him for good aloud she answered how ridiculous i should hardly think he has that sort of conceit anyhow if he has that impression i will take care that he does not carry it away mr le mesurier did not pursue the argument but he gave certain instructions to his butler and when drake arrived at the house he was shown into the library mr le mesurier received him pull up a chair to the fire he said with an uneasy geniality i have something to say to you drake it wont take long drake laid down his hat and seated himself opposite to mr le mesurier my daughter told me this morning quite spontaneously of course that she had asked you to call in order that she might get from you a certain answer to a certain question and i thought that i had better prepare you for what that question will be he hesitated in his speech searching for the best way to begin his explanation and he caught sight of a cigarbox on the mantelshelf above his head by the way do you smoke yes but i wont just now thank you you had better you can throw it away when i have done these are in rather a good condition mr le mesurier seemed inclined to branch off upon the quality of different brands but drake gave him no assistance he lit his cigar and patiently waited his eyes fixed upon his host mr le mesurier felt driven back upon the actual point of his explanation and almost compelled to fine his words down to just the needful quantity clarice i believe he said brusquely means to ask you how gorley died he was engaged to her drake did not so much as stir a muscle even his eyes maintained their steadiness and mr le mesurier drew a breath of relief i am glad you take it like this he went on i was afraid that what i had to say might have been well perhaps a blow to you and if so the fault would have been mine for i encouraged you to come here drake bent forward and knocked the ash off the end of his cigar yes he asked why did you do that mr le mesurier looked uncomfortable it is only right that i should be frank with you he replied the mere fact of gorleys death apart from its manner upset clarice more i confess than we expected and made her quite ill for a time she is not very strong you know so it was deemed best not only by me but by gorleys family as well that she should be kept in ignorance of what had actually happened we simply told her that gorley had died near boruwimi but i fancy that she suspected we were concealing something perhaps our avoidance of the subject gave her the hint or it may have been mrs willoughby mrs willoughby she is related to the gorley family as well as to us it was through her clarice first met gorley he explained and went on then you returned to england and were interviewed in the meteor clarice read the interview you had described in it your march to boruwimi and she sent through mallinson at once an invitation to you i only found that out the night you were introduced to us at the theatre it made me certain that she had suspicions and i admit that i asked you to call in the hope of allaying them i believed foolishly as it seems that if i was cordial she would give up any ideas she might have that you were connected in any way with gorleys death afterwards drake i need hardly tell you i was glad you came here upon other grounds mr le mesurier leaned forward in his chair and touched drake upon the knee it didnt take long for me to conceive a genuine liking for you and of course i knew all the time that you had only done your duty drake made no response whatever to mr le mesuriers sentiment i understand then he said that miss le mesurier was engaged to gorley at the time of his death oh dear no exclaimed the other starting up from his chair you are aware i suppose why gorley left england drake nodded assent the engagement was broken off then and there and clarice at that time did not seem to take it much to heart i was inclined to believe that the whole affair had been just a girls whim indeed in spite of her illness i am not certain now that that isnt the truth she may have had some notion of reforming him i find clarice rather difficult to understand drake stood up where is miss le mesurier he asked upstairs in the drawingroom he took a step towards the door and took the step unsteadily he stopped for a second bracing his shoulders then he walked firmly across the room while his hand was on the handle he heard mr le mesurier speaking what do you mean to tell her i hardly understand he answered turning round there surely is but one thing to say the truth she has a right to know that has she the engagement was broken off finally when gorley left england they had nothing more to do with one another no common interests no common future has she it seems to me yes we have kept the knowledge from her up till now no one could blame you if you kept it from her a little longer the argument smacked of sophistry to drake he had an unreasoned conviction that the girl had a right to learn the truth from him i think i ought to tell her if she asks me i might forbid you to do it grumbled mr le mesurier do you asked drake the question brought mr le mesurier up short it was a direct question inviting a responsible decision and mr le mesurier was averse by nature to making such decisions out of hand if drake cared for clarice he reflected it was really in drakes province to decide the point rather than in his own i dont know enough of you he replied to either forbid or give you permission drake wondered what the sentence meant in that case i must take my own course he said and he went out of the room and mounted the stairs chapter vi it was the dusk of a february afternoon drake had found the lamps lit in mr le mesuriers library and the gas was burning in the hall and on the stairs but within the drawingroom all the light there was came from the fire leaping upon the hearth and from the two recessed windows which faced it in the farthest of these windows drake saw miss le mesurier standing the outline of her face relieved as it were against a gray panel of twilight as the door closed she turned and took a step into the room drake could no longer see more than the shape of her head and the soft waves of hair crowning it he could not distinguish a single feature but none the less as she stood facing him he felt of a sudden his heart sink within him and his whole strength race out of his body clarice stood still and he became possessed with a queer longing that she would move again forwards within the focus of the firelight however she spoke from where she stood you have seen my father instinctively drake walked to the fireplace but she did not follow i have just left him he replied he told me what the question was which you wished me to answer and forbade you to answer it i suppose no he left the choice to me well she asked i mean to answer it to the full he said i was not aware till a moment ago that you had been engaged to gorley then he hesitated clarice was still standing in the shadow and his desire that she should move out of it and within the circle of light grew upon him until it seemed almost as though the sight of her face and the knowledge of how she was receiving the history of the incident were necessary conditions of its narration i suppose that is the reason he went on which made you ask me here at first why did you never put the question before why repeated clarice slowly as if she was putting the question to herself then she moved slowly towards the fireplace and seated herself by the side of it bent forwards towards its glow her elbows upon her knees her hands propping her chin drake gave a sigh of relief and clarice glanced at him in surprise and turned again to the fire tell me your story she said and left his question unanswered drake began but now that his wish was accomplished of a sudden all the reality seemed to fade out of the tragic events he was to recount his consciousness became in some queer way centred upon the girl who was listening to the exclusion of the subject she was listening to he was intensely conscious of her face of its changing expressions of the ebb and flow of the blood from time to time flushing her cheeks and temples and of the vivid play of lights and shadows upon them as the flames danced and sank on the hearth he noticed too with an observation new to him and quite involuntary the details of the room in which he stood the white panelling of the walls the engravings in their frames the china ranged upon a ledge near to the ceiling of these things his mind took impressions with the minuteness almost of a camera they were real to him at this moment because they formed the framework and setting of the girls face and figure but gorleys crime and his expiation of it became by contrast as remote to his apprehension in point of all connection with clarice as they were in point of locality he could not realise them to himself as events which had actually happened and in which he had played a part and he spoke in the toneless voice of one who relates a fable of which through frequent repetition he is tired instinctively in order to make the truth of his story palpable he began to corroborate it with particulars which he would otherwise have spared his auditor but with the same impersonal accent he told clarice of the condition of the village after gorleys raid as he first came within view of it here the body of a negro stood pinned upright against the wall of his hut by an assegai fixing his neck there another was lying charred upon stillsmouldering embers and as he saw her turn pale and shudder he almost wondered why but in spite of his efforts to appreciate its actuality the incident grew more unsubstantial the further he progressed in its narration and he ended it abruptly gorley was properly tried he said his relations testified to the justice of his trial and he was executed in accordance with the verdict clarice sat motionless after he had ended drake watched the flames sparkle in her gray eyes at his elbow the clock ticked upon the mantelshelf spacing the seconds and the fire was hot upon his limbs that dreamworld in africa dissolved to a vapour clarice recalled him to it at last i never imagined she said in a low voice that the truth was anything like this i shouldnt have asked you if i had a long time ago i knew that something was being concealed but i thought it was an accident or well i couldnt conceive what it was and i grew curious i suppose when you came back to england i thought you might be able to tell me lately however i began to fancy that you were concerned in it some way you might have sent mr she checked herself with the name unspoken and went on you might have sent him on some fatal mission or something of that sort but this oh why did you tell me she took her hands from beneath her chin and clenched them with a convulsive movement upon her knees her memory had gone back to the days when she and gorley had been engaged to their meetings their intimate conversations this man in whose hand her hands had lain whose lips had pressed hers been pressed by hers this man had been convicted of a double crime dastardly murder and dastardly theft and punished for it her pride cried out against her knowledge and cried out against the man who had vouchsafed the knowledge why did you tell me she repeated and the words were an accusation you wished to know he replied doggedly and it seemed to me that you had the right to know right she exclaimed right what right had i to know what right had you to tell me she rose to her feet suddenly as she spoke and confronted drake he looked into her eyes steadily but with a certain perplexity i felt bound to tell you he said simply and his simplicity appealed to her by its frank recognition of an obligation to her why she asked herself why did he feel bound merely because i wished to know the truth of the matter or because he himself was implicated in it as the instrument of gorleys punishment either reason was sufficient to appease her she inclined to the latter there were conclusions to be inferred from it which staunched her wounded pride clarice turned away drake watched her set a foot upon the rail of the fender lay her hand upon the mantelshelf and support her forehead upon it after a little she raised her head and spoke with an air of apologising for him of course she said you could not know that there was anything between myself and and him no i could not know that how should i for i did not know you and i am glad that i didnt know drake spoke with some earnestness and clarice looked at him in surprise it would have made my duty so much harder to do he explained with a little cry of irritation clarice slipped her foot from the fender and moved from him back to the couch she had given him the opportunity to escape from his position and he refused to make use of it he seemed indeed unable to perceive it however she clung to it obstinately and repeated it you could not know there was anything between us she emphasised the words deliberately drake mistook the intention of the emphasis but was there he exclaimed at the time i didnt think of that miss le mesurier oh no no she interrupted not at the time the man was impracticable and yet his very impracticability aroused in a measure her admiration so you would have shot him just the same had you known shot him asked drake almost absently yes didnt i tell you i beg your pardon i didnt shoot him at all i hanged him clarice was stunned by the words and the more because of the dull seemingly callous accent with which they were spoken you hanged him she whispered dropping the words one by one as though she was striving to weigh them yes i have been blamed for it he replied with no change of voice people said i was damaging the prestige of the white man the argument bothered me i confess but i think they were wrong i should have damaged that prestige infinitely more if i had punished him secretly or oh dont she cried with a sharp interruption and she stared at him with eyes dilating in horror almost in fear you can discuss it like that the man i had been engaged to you hanged him she ended with a moan of actual pain and covered her face with her hands on the instant drake woke to a full comprehension of all that he had said and understood something of the humiliation which it meant to her clarice was sitting huddled in her chair her fingers pressed lightly on her eyes while now and again a shiver shot through her frame still i was bound to tell her drake thought he waited for a little wondering whether she would look up but she made no movement an emerald ring upon her finger caught the light and winked at him maliciously leering at him he fancied there was nothing more for him to say and he quietly went out of the room the click of the doorhandle roused clarice she saw that the room was empty and drawing a breath of relief started out of her chair standing thus she heard drakes footsteps descending the stairs and after a pause the slamming of the halldoor then she went to the fireplace and knelt down close to it warming her hands at the blaze the degradation of it she whispered chapter vii bit by bit she sought to reconstruct the scene piecing it together out of drakes words but somehow that scene would not be reconstructed she gradually found herself considering drakes words as a light thrown upon the man who spoke them rather than as the description of an actual incident the humiliation which she experienced made her shrink with a certain repulsion from her recollections of gorley and dwell instead upon the contrasting tones in drakes voice the contrasting expressions upon his face when he spoke to her and when he merely narrated his story in the first instance gentleness had been the dominant characteristic in the second indifference and that very indifference while it repelled her magnetised her thoughts something indeed of the same process which had caused that appearance of indifference in drake was now repeating itself in clarice drake was superseding gorley in her mind she struggled against the obsession and morbidly strove to picture to herself the actual execution the black troops ranged in a clearing before the smouldering village looking up at one figure gorleys spinning on a rope but even upon that picture drakes face obtruded she thrust out her hands to keep it off as though it was living and pressing in upon her for a moment she tried to conjure up gorleys face but it was blurred only his form she could see spinning on a rope and drake beneath it his features clear like an intaglio and firmset with that same sense of duty which had forced him sternly to recount to her the truth that afternoon she recurred to her recent habit of comparing him with mallinson she had a vision of mallinson with the same experience to relate if that were imaginable fidgeting through evasions grasping at any diversion she might throw out for him to play with but what if drakes frankness outspoken to the point of cruelty sprang from an indifference to her clarice had seen a good deal of drake lately she caught herself almost smiling at the idea softening at its palpable falsity in a last effort at resistance she fixed her thoughts on the cruelty the callousness in his method of narration and began to feel herself on solid ground she was consequently inspired to run over all that he had said in order to make her footing yet firmer and at the outset she was brought to a check why had she never questioned him upon the matter before he had asked clarice stopped and asked the question of herself at the beginning of their acquaintance certainly there had always been others by but afterwards there had been opportunities enough but by that time what with her fathers and mrs willoughbys hostility she had begun to suspect that drake was in some way implicated in the mystery was it because she was afraid to know it for certain that she had refrained she recalled her letter to him written last monday and how she had crossed out importance and substituted interest was this knowledge important to her really important bearing issues in the future it could only be important she realised if she set great store upon her acquaintanceship with drake drake in fact had achieved something of a triumph though quite unknown to himself for he had compelled clarice le mesurier to abandon the consideration of his attitude towards her in favour of a search after the state of her feelings towards him she was still engaged in the search when the clock struck six and rousing herself brusquely she rang the bell for the lamps to be brought at that moment mrs willoughby had just finished telling to fielding the story which drake had told to clarice so thats what drake was referring to on sunday said fielding yes said mrs willoughby what in the world made you attack him in that way if you didnt want clarice to suspect the fact was i was a fool i suppose i just put my head down and charged but what i want your advice upon is this ought clarice to be told now before things go further no no said fielding he saw the curtain descending precipitately upon his comedy before the climax was reached and he added quite sincerely i like drake i dont see why he shouldnt have a run for her money mrs willoughby looked doubtful for a moment and then she said very well she hesitated for a second i think i like him too chapter viii this was by no means the last occasion upon which mrs willoughby thought it prudent to take counsel with fielding concerning the affairs of her friend nor was fielding in any degree backward to respond with his advice he developed in fact an interest in their progress quite disproportionate to his professed attitude of the spectator in the stalls mrs willoughby lived at knightsbridge in a little house of which the drawingroom overlooked the park close to the barracks and he found it very pleasant to sit there of an afternoon and discuss in a cosy duet the future of clarice the subject besides had the advantage of inexhaustibility on the one side fielding ranged the suitors or those whom he considered such on the other the vagaries of the girl playing these forces off not merely against each other but against themselves as well for as he pointed out there was no harmony in the separate camps he evolved an infinite number of endless complications there was consequently no end to the discussion not even when clarice was argued through the marriage ceremony for that point fielding took to represent the one oclock in the morning of a carnival ball then the fun really begins though decent people have to go away mrs willoughby was as ever staunch in her defence though a recollection of clarices tearful visit with conways arrival for a climax prompted her now and again to laugh in the midst of it you mistake thoughtlessness for tricks she said clarice is only a child as yet she has a childs capacity for emotion i admit corrected fielding but a womans knowledge of its use the combination is deplorable fielding inquired about drake and was told that he had not been seen lately it looks as if he was declining in favour mrs willoughby added not necessarily the mans busy theres a company coming out a solid one likely to be since drake handles it i am thinking of taking shares mrs willoughby was surprised fielding seemed to her the last man calculated by nature for dabbling in stocks you she exclaimed fielding nodded assent then dont do it mrs willoughby flashed out vigorously dont think of it oh i know those men in the city their friends get ruined and they well i mustnt say anything against them because my husband was one of them poor dear but they move into larger offices mr drake has been asking you to join him he hasnt done anything of the sort i heard of the matter through quite an independent channel however i am not ruined yet and the company wont be floated for another four months and after all its my money mrs willoughby became quiet well she said and she derived some satisfaction from the thought at all events clarice has dropped talking about him fielding laughed that means that its mallinsons turn on the roundabout and nothing more sidney mallinson has been refused refused when on the sunday we lunched at beaufort gardens oh fielding was silent for a moment he was thinking that he had met mallinson of late with unusual frequency here at mrs willoughbys house but are you sure he asked certain he told me so himself clarice told me too the day after mrs willoughby began again to laugh she would have prevented him if she could but apparently he tried to take her by storm oh exclaimed fielding on the sunday afternoons you say then i was to blame i am afraid for i gave him precisely that advice on the sunday morning of course i never thought that he would take it fielding met sidney mallinson again and again at the house in knightsbridge he was invited to dinner but so was mallinson and the latter had confidential talks with mrs willoughby he dined with some friends at the savoy and went on in a comfortable frame of mind to a concert there mrs willoughby joined them so did mallinson and the couple sat side by side and conversed through a song the height of bad taste commented fielding in an access of irritation the fellow was spoiling his comedy by relinquishing his part he drew mallinson aside as they passed through the hall you seem to see a good deal of mrs willoughby yes we generally pair off together fielding dropped plump among the coarse sensations of the ordinary human he wanted to kick mallinson and to kick him hard he saw with an anticipatory satisfaction the glasses flying off the supercilious gentlemans nose and felt the jar at the end of his boot as it dashed into the coattails the action would have been too noticeable however and he only said what a very bourgeois thing to do mallinsons air of complacency vanished as he heard the offensive term levelled against himself he did not however on that account change his attitude towards mrs willoughby fielding found him at the house a few days later and proceeded to sit him out the contest drove fielding to the last pitch of exasperation for apart from the inherent humiliation of the proceeding mrs willoughby was directly encouraging mallinson to stay mallinson at last was suffered to leave and mrs willoughby instead of resuming her seat walked across to the window and scrutinised intently the passersby that creature visits you pretty often it appears said fielding does he she asked he comes to me for the sake of consolation i suppose and makes love to you for the sake of contrast he tells me you generally pair off together when you meet pair off and he grimaced the phrase to show how little he minded it itll be keeping company next mrs willoughby gave a little quiet laugh her back was towards him so that he could not catch her expression but she seemed to him culpably indifferent to the complexion which mallinson had given to their friendship its rather funny she said though i cant help feeling sorry for him i saw that you were sorry for him fielding interrupted but he pretends mrs willoughby went on ignoring the interruption with complete unconsciousness he pretends to himself that i am clarice he talks to me as if i were he called me clarice the other day and never noticed the mistake and thats not my name is it she turned to him quite seriously as she put the question no replied fielding your names constance and he dwelt upon the name for a second yes constance said mrs willoughby thoughtfully it sounds rather prim dont you think constance fielding repeated weighing it deliberately constance no i rather like it clarice shortens it to connie does she indeed connie constance fielding contrasted the two names and again constance connie mrs willoughbys mouth began to dimple at the corners although one laughs she proceeded its really rather serious about mr mallinson he told me once the colour of my eyes was do you let him talk to you about the colour of your eyes fielding was really indignant at the supposition he didnt ask my permission mrs willoughby said penitently but it isnt a thing people ought to do he said they were gray and they arent are they she turned her face towards him gray of course not said fielding and starting from his chair he approached mrs willoughby at the window to make sure clarices are i know but i am certain mine arent she held up her face towards the light and the remark was pitched as a question yours said fielding examining them neptune dipped them in the sea at six oclock on an august morning mrs willoughby moved away from the window precipitately so if mr mallinson is so fond of clarice she said that he sees her in everybody one cant help pitying him mrs willoughby however for a short time subsequently was not seen in the company of the discarded lover and fielding inferred with satisfaction that her pity was taking a less active form he was roused to a perception that his inference was false one night at the opera mrs willoughby was present with mr le mesurier and clarice percy conway he hardly reckoned counting him at this time from his constant attendance rather as an item of clarices toilette and fielding took care to descend the staircase after the performance in close proximity to the party and hows mr mallinson he asked of mrs willoughby not without a certain complacency in his voice oh poor boy she replied with the tenderest sympathy hes in bed ill ill asked clarice quickly you dont mean that yes im so concerned he wrote to tell me all about it fielding looked displeased and much the same expression was to be seen on the face of clarice mrs willoughby was serenely unconscious of the effect of her words i heard that he was in bed interposed conway carelessly but apparently he has got something to console himself with yes he wrote to me about that too said mrs willoughby fancy clarice he has inherited quite a good income an uncle or somebody left it to him clarice expressed an acid satisfaction at the news she dropped behind with fielding you didnt know that mr mallinson was ill she asked did none of his friends know except connie and then there was a perceptible accent of pique in her voice fielding did not answer the question immediately he had been brought of a sudden to the vexatious conclusion that mrs willoughby was a coquette just like the rest of her trivial sex no better indeed than the girl at his side whose first anxiety was not as to whether mallinson was seriously ill but why he wrote the information to mrs willoughby he felt that mrs willoughby had no right to trifle with mallinson the poor fellow had already suffered his full share of that kind of experience miss le mesurier repeated her question impatiently and fielding suddenly realised that miss le mesuriers pique might prove useful in setting matters right he determined to encourage it none that im aware of he replied mrs willoughby of course would be likely to know first why havent you noticed they have struck up a great friendship lately always pair off together you know miss le mesuriers lips curled at the despicable phrase but she blamed mrs willoughby for the fact which it described not sidney mallinson his attitude she could understand and make allowance for it had been a despairing act prompted by an instinct of selfpreservation to rid himself of the hopeless thought of her an unsuccessful act too for the poor fellow had broken down she had no doubts as to the origin of his illness and overflowed promptly with sympathy her resentment against mrs willoughby none the less remained driving homewards she asked her why didnt you tell me before that mr mallinson was ill my dear i never gave a thought to it until i saw mr fielding the illness isnt serious and mrs willoughby laughed with peculiar heartlessness thought clarice they were however not thinking of the same individual mrs willoughby clarice and fielding in consequence suffered some such change in their relative positions as is apt to take place amongst the european powers poor mrs willoughby in the innocent pursuit of her own ideas had suddenly roused two former friends into a common antagonism these friends besides had much the same grounds for resentment as the powers usually have for mrs willoughbys conduct was a distinct infringement of rights which did not exist clarice and fielding drew perceptibly nearer to one another they exchanged diplomatic pourparlers fielding found a great deal to praise in mallinson and clarice had a word or two to say upon the score of widows she was doubtful whether they ought ever to remarry fielding kept an open mind on the subject but was willing to discuss it on the particular point however whether this widow was to marry mallinson they were both uncompromisingly agreed and were only hindered from an armed demonstration by the suspicion that the sinner to the overawed would merely laugh at it on the whole fielding deemed it best to address a friendly remonstrance to mrs willoughby in the interests of clarice he suggested that she should see less of sidney mallinson but i have no grounds for slamming my door in his face she answered plaintively you see clarice has refused him and really hes very sweet and polite to me fielding pointed out with the elaborate calmness of intense exasperation that there could be no finality in a refusal given by miss le mesurier mrs willoughby replied that they had differed before in their views of clarice and that the point he mentioned was one upon which mr mallinson must be left to judge for himself exactly said fielding with emphasis he should be left to judge for himself and was for marching off with colours flying but mrs willoughby could not refrain from declaring that the unprecedented interest which mr fielding took in his friend mr mallinson had raised that friend to a very different position in her esteem from that which he had held before the combat was renewed more than once but with no different result and upon the same lines mrs willoughby received his attacks with a patient humility and rushed out to catch him a flout as he was retiring finally however she shifted her position and became the aggressor she suggested that fielding was really in love with clarice and trying to gain favour with her by bringing an admirer back to her feet fielding was furious at the suggestion and indignantly repudiated it she ignored the repudiation and quietly insisted in pointing out the meanness of such a system of making love the unfortunate gentlemans dignity constrained him to listen in silence for he felt that he would have spluttered had he opened his lips the only course open to him was a retreat with a high head and he declared that it was no longer possible for him to continue a discussion which he had begun as much in her true interests as on behalf of justice and her particular friend miss le mesurier and went home by return of post he received a penandink drawing of himself and clarice pairing off he was figured in the costermongers dress with his arm tucked under the girls and her hat on his head meanwhile mallinson was still in bed completely ignorant of the battle which had been waged for the possession of him fielding thought more than once of calling at his flat since his determination had been sharpened rather than overcome by the victories of mrs willoughby he was more than ever convinced that mallinson ought to have a fair chance with miss le mesurier an equal chance with drake the name of drake made him pause miss le mesurier knew everything there was to be known about mallinson but there were certain facts in drakes history of which she was ignorant the question sprang into his mind could mallinson have a fair chance unless she was made acquainted with those facts fielding knew members of parliament who had been returned over the heads of residents in the constituency because they entered it too late for the electors to become intimate with their defects drakes career might provide an analogy unless clarice was told he argued to convince himself that he felt she ought to be told but he could not bring himself to the point of telling he decided finally upon an alternative which would he imagined secure his purpose while relieving him of the responsibility he would tell mallinson of the gorley episode for the rival surely had a right to know whether clarice was to be informed or not mallinson should be allowed to judge fielding assured himself of the justice of his intention for the space of two days without putting it into execution but on the third he chanced to meet conway and was given the information that mallinsons inherited income amounted to a thousand pounds the news decided him under these circumstances mallinson certainly ought to know he jumped into a hansom and drove down to south kensington mallinson was still in bed but sufficiently recovered to write up his diary the book lay upon the counterpane open but as fielding was introduced into the room its author shut it up and tucked it under his pillow it was kept entirely for his own perusal a voluminous record of sensations ranging from a headache to a fit of anger without the mention of an incident from cover to cover i hear you have had a touch of bronchitis said fielding something more than a touch i can tell you i have been rather ill however i am going to get up tomorrow fielding found it difficult to come to the point of his visit you must have found it dull not very i can always interest myself drake came to see me yesterday drake how did he know conway told him i suppose no miss le mesurier told him miss le mesurier he asked yes are you surprised the question was put with some resentment that she told him no i expect she sent him a smirk upon the invalids face showed he shared the thought by the way fielding continued talking of miss le mesurier did you ever meet a man called gorley no there was a gorley who was engaged to her is that the man yes i heard rather a strange story about him he went out to africa you know mallinson lifted himself on his elbow africa he said slowly yes i heard that why do you mention him oh i thought perhaps you might have known the man thats all hes dead fielding spoke with a studied carelessness looking anywhere except at mallinson dead repeated mallinson in the same tone but his heart was beginning to race and he lifted himself higher into a sitting position gorley was a relation of mrs willoughby i believe a kind of cousin there was silence between the men for a second or two mallinson was recalling what mrs willoughby had said that evening at beaufort gardens when mr le mesurier pressed her to meet stephen drake at lunch so gorley died in africa he remarked where do you know yes at boruwimi mallinson started fielding glanced at him involuntarily and their looks crossed a strange story you said suppose you tell it me it will while away some of my time fielding lit a cigarette and related the story at the end of it mallinson lay back on the pillows staring at the ceiling once or twice fielding spoke to him but he did not hear he was not thinking the knowledge that the secret to be discovered was his to use was as a sense in him he felt it pulsing through his veins and throbbing at his heart mrs willoughby was forgotten it had been after all but a fictitious fancy which he had conceived for her a fancy fostered in the main as balm for his selfrespect after his refusal by clarice as soon as he was sufficiently recovered he called upon miss le mesurier confident that his hour and opportunity had come drake however had reported to clarice on the condition of mallinson and her sympathy had in consequence to a great extent evaporated bronchitis was not of the ailments which spring from a broken heart and she was inclined to hold it as a grievance against him that she had been so wastefully touched with pity her sympathy disappeared altogether when with little circumlocution he broached the subject of the boruwimi expedition and dropped a mention of mrs willoughbys relative there was something at the back of it he hinted clarice wondered whence he had got his information but made no effort to check him she stood looking out of the window while he retold her the story of gorleys death it became more unreal to her than ever for while his account was correctly given as mrs willoughby had given it to fielding it lacked the uncompromising details which drake himself had furnished her recollection of these details made the man who had given them stand out in her thoughts it was a pitiful affair mallinson concluded but i thought you ought to know clarice drew a finger down the frame of glass in front of her mr drake thought so too she said quietly drake exclaimed mallinson utterly bewildered drake the man wouldnt be such a he was though do you mean that he confessed to it confess she said turning towards him that is hardly the word he told me of his own accord the moment he knew i had been engaged to to she broke off at the name and continued and he spared himself in the telling far less than you have spared him she spoke with a gentle dignity which mallinson had never known in her before and he felt that it raised a more solid barrier between them than even her refusal had done fielding meanwhile waited with an uneasy conscience which no casuistry would lighten he threw himself in mallinsons way time after time in order to ascertain whether the latter had spoken mallinson let no word of the matter slip from him and for the rest seemed utterly despondent fielding threw out a feeler at last of course he said you would never repeat what i told you about gorley i forgot to mention that mallinson flushed of course not he said awkwardly fielding turned on him quickly then what made you tell miss le mesurier mallinson was too taken aback to deny the accusation oh miss le mesurier he replied knew already she knew who told her drake fielding drew in his breath and whistled his first feeling was one of distinct relief that after all he had not been the means by which clarice had come to her knowledge his second was one of indignation against drake he realised how a frank admission from drake would outweigh in the girls susceptible nature the fact admitted what on earth induced him to reveal it i suppose he is a little more cunning than one took him for no doubt he saw the thing would get known sooner or later and thought the disclosure had better come from himself fielding had been leaning to the same opinion but the moment he heard it stated and stated by mallinson he felt a certain conviction that it was wrong i dont believe that he said sharply he was none the less however indignant with drake to intermeddle at all in other peoples concerns was averse to his whole theory of existence but to intermeddle and not very creditably and out of the most disinterested motives of benevolence and expediency and then to fail all this was nothing short of degrading he dined that night at his club to which drake had been elected and lay in wait for him drake however did not appear and at ten oclock fielding went round to his rooms drake was living in chambers on the embankment a little to the west of hungerford bridge as he was shown into the room fielding could not help noticing the plainness of its furniture and adornment the chairs were covered with a cheap red cretonne there was an armchair or two with the high seat and long elbows which seemed to have gone astray from a peckham drawingroom an ormolu clock under a glass shade ornamented the overmantel and in the way of literature there was one book in the room prescotts conquest of peru and a copy of the times drake was seated at the table engaged in the study of a map of matanga come in he said cordially fielding drew up a chair to the fire have a drink the cigars are on the mantelshelf drake fetched a syphon and a decanter of whisky and mixed two glasses he handed one to fielding and brought his map to the fire ah said fielding theres likely to be a rising in matanga i see very possibly how will that affect you not at all i think it may delay things of course but it wont take long and besides it wont touch the interior of the country there will be a certain amount of shouting in the capital and round the coast perhaps a gun or two fired off and then theyll settle down under a new president but there are a good many germans there arent there what if they invite the german government to interfere i dont fancy thats probable the german colonist isnt over fond of german rule you see the first thing a german official wants to do when he catches sight of a black is to drill him its his first and often his last idea he wants to see him holding the palm of his hand against the stripe of an invisible trouser and the system doesnt work because the black clears over the nearest border fielding laughed and turned to the object of his visit talking of matanga what in the world made you tell miss le mesurier about gorley drake looked up from his map how did you know anything about gorley he asked mrs willoughby told me i thought it was decided miss le mesurier should not be told mr le mesurier left the choice to me and it seemed to me that she had a right to know why drake paused for a second in reflection it seemed to me he began again well she hadnt snapped fielding well i think she had answered drake quietly returning to his map then you were wrong she hadnt the engagement was broken off a long while ago and you hadnt a right to tell her unless you want to marry her yourself drake raised his head with a jerk and stared at the wall in front of him fixedly he made no answer nor could fielding distinguish upon his face any expression which gave a clue to his thoughts he got up from his chair and drake turned to him i gather from your tone he said in an indifferent voice that mrs willoughby resents my action my dear fellow no exclaimed fielding energetically for heavens sake dont take me for a reflex of mrs willoughby no more plotting for him he determined he had planned and calculated and interfered all for other peoples good and this was the thanks he got to be quietly informed that he hadnt an idea of his own the next afternoon mrs willoughby stopped her phaeton beside him in bond street she looked very well he thought with her clear complexion clear as those clear eyes of hers with just the hint of azure in the whites of them windwhipped now to a rosy warmth may i congratulate you yet she asked pleasantly fielding was not to be provoked to renew the combat and he put the question aside you remember what you told me the other day about gorley he said yes she answered becoming serious well miss le mesurier knows who told her and she leaned forward guess mrs willoughby thought for a moment and then shook her head i cant her father no drake himself she started back in her seat then she said of course we might have known that he would and the we sealed their reconciliation chapter ix when fielding had gone drake opened the window and stepped out on the balcony unless you want to marry her yourself the words were stamped upon his mind in capitals they formulated to him for the first time the cause of that unreasoned conviction of his and formulated it too as he realised with absolute truth yes it was just his desire for clarice to which he owed his belief that she had an unquestionable right to know his responsibility for gorleys death he wanted her and wanting her was committed to scrupulous frankness drake looked out across the city at his feet lay the quiet strip of garden lawn and bush beyond the lamps burning on the parapets of the embankment and beyond them the river shining in the starlight polished and lucent like a slab of black marble with broad regular rays upon it of a still deeper blackness where the massive columns of hungerford bridge cast shadows on the water an engine puffed and snorted into the station leaving its pennant of white smoke in the air through the glass walls of the signalbox above the bridge drake could see the men in a blaze of light working at the levers and from the surrey end there came to him a clink and at that distance a quite musical clink of truck against truck as some freighttrain was shunted across the rails away to his right the light was burning on westminster clocktower on westminster bridge the lamps of cabs and carriages darted to and fro like fireflies drake watched two of them start across in the same direction a few yards apart saw the one behind close up the one in front spirt forward as though each was straining for the lead they drew level then flashed apart then again drew level and so passing and repassing raced into the myriad lights upon the opposite bank that bank was visible to him through a tracery of leafless twigs for a tree grew in front of his window on the farther edge of the gardens and he could see the lights upon its roadway dancing twirling clashing in the clear night just as they clashed and twirled and danced in the roadway beneath him sparks from a forge and that forge london in their ceaseless motion they seemed rivulets of fire and the black sheet of water between them the solid highway but even while he looked a ruby light moved on that highway out from the pillars of the bridge and then another and another everywhere was the glitter of lights fixed flashing like a star on the curve or again growing slowly from a pins point to an orb and then dwindling to a point and vanishing and on every side too drake heard the quick beat of horses and the rattle of wheels struck out not from silence but from a dull eternal hum like the hum of a mill sharp particular notes emerging incessantly from a monotonous volume of sound it was just this aspect and this noise of restless activity which had always appealed to drake and had satisfied him with an assurance that he was on the road to the fulfilment of his aims he had achieved something of his desires however small he was in london working at certain schemes of which he did not doubt the ultimate success they were built upon a foundation of knowledge arduously gained and tested the rising in matanga if it took place might delay success but success would surely come he might then look forward with confidence to a seat in that parliament on which the light was burning to a share perhaps finally in its executive but tonight he found that there was something wanting in the contemplation of these aims something wanting in the very outlook from his window he needed clarice here in his balcony by his side and he pictured the shine of her eyes bent towards him in the dark and the perception of that need held him in check gave him a hint of warning that the thought of her might become as a wedge driven into the framework of his purposes and splitting them he could still draw back he assured himself but if he went on and won he felt the blood surging through his veins he might win there was just a chance the gorley incident had made no real difference in clarices friendliness when once indeed she had grown used to it she had seemed almost to express some queer sort of sympathy with him drake closed the window and sat down to calculate the time at which he would be sufficiently established to make known his suit he fixed that time definitely in july july the name sounded pleasantly with its ripple of liquid syllables drake found himself repeating it when he should have been at work it began to rise to his lips the moment a date was asked of him as the only date at all worth mentioning fielding came down to drakes office in old broad street in order to apply for shares in matanga concessions you had better wait said drake i will let you know before they are offered to the public that will be soon not for the moment theres the possibility of this rising let the country quiet down first but when do you propose july july thats a long time to come drake coloured to the roots of his hair i beg your pardon he said with evident embarrassment much sooner than that of course i was thinking of some one else he made matters worse by a hurried correction of some one to something fielding noticed the embarrassment and the correction and drew conclusions they were conclusions he thought of which mrs willoughby should be advised and he drove to her house accordingly he had ceased to feel displeasure at mrs willoughbys conduct for since he had studiously refrained from betraying the slightest irritation at mallinsons visits those visits had amazingly diminished did he happen to mention the date of the month and the time of the day was mrs willoughbys comment it sounds coldblooded hardly if you knew the man he looks on life as a sort of draughtboard so many definite moves to be made forward upon definite lines then youre crowned king and can move as you please backwards if you like till the end of the game he will be crowned king in july so i imagine meanwhile drake worked on through march and april outwardly untroubled but inwardly asking himself ever shall i win shall i win the question besieged him patient he could be none more so when the end in view was to be gained by present even though gradual endeavour but this passive waiting was a lid shut down on him forcing his energies inwards to prey upon himself his impatience moreover was increased by the increasing prospects of his undertaking additional reports had been received from his engineer appraising at a still higher value the quality of the land he spoke too of a tract of country bordering drakes concession on the north and advised application for it biedermann besides had taken up the project warmly the company was to come out early in may there would be few shares open to the public and the revolution had not taken place why should he wait till july after all drake felt inclined to argue the question one sunday afternoon in londons lilac time as he walked across the green park towards beaufort gardens he found miss le mesurier alone and in a melancholy mood she was singing weariful ballads in an undertone as he entered the room and she rose dispiritedly to welcome him its seldom one finds you alone he said and his face showed his satisfaction i dont know she replied it seems to me sometimes that i am always alone even when people are by and her eyelids drooped you clarices sincerity was of the artists sort implying a subconsciousness of an audience she recognised from the accent upon the you that her little speech had not failed of its effect she continued more cheerfully aunt has gone up to highgate to see some relations and papas asleep in the library you were singing i hope you wont stop i was only passing the time you will make me think i intrude ill prove to you that you dont and she went back to the piano drake seated himself at the side of it facing her and facing the open window the windowledges were ablaze with flowers and the scent of them poured into the room on a flood of sunshine clarice was moved by a sudden whim to a change of humour she sprang from her dejection to the extreme of good spirits her singing proved it for she chose a couple of lighthearted french ballads and sang them with a dainty humour which matched the daintiness of the words and music her shrugs and pouts the pretty arching of her eyebrows the whimsical note of mockery in her voice represented her to drake under a new aspect helped to complete her in his thoughts much as her voice very sweet and clear for all its small compass completed in some queer way the flowers and sunshine her manner however did more than that it gave to him conscious of a certain stiffness and inflexibility of temperament an inner sense of completion anticipated from his hope of a time when their lives would join he leaned forward in his chair watching the play of her face the lights and shadows in the curls of her hair the nimble touch of her fingers on the keys clarice stopped suddenly you dont sing i have no accomplishments at all she laughed and began to play one of chopins nocturnes her fingers rattled against the ivory on a run up the piano she stopped and took a ring from her right hand drake noticed that it was the emerald ring which he had seen winking in the firelight on that evening when she had covered her face from him she dropped the ring on the top of the piano at drakes side it spun round once or twice and then settled down with a little tinkling whirr upon the rim of its hoop drake fancied that the removal of this particular ring was in some inexplicable way of hopeful augury to him clarice resumed her playing but as she neared the end of the nocturne drake perceived that there was a growing change a declension in her style she seemed to lose the spirit of the nocturne and even her command on the instrument the firm touch faltered into indecision from indecision to absolute unsteadiness the notes before clear and distinct now slurred into one another with a tremulous wavering you are fond of music she asked at length with something of an effort very he replied though it puzzles me its like opening a book written in a language you dont understand you get a glimpse of a meaning here and there but no meaning really i cant explain what i feel he added with a laugh i want mallinson to help me you admire mr mallinson asked clarice stopping suddenly well one always admires the class of work one cant do oneself eh thats very generous of you why generous drake leaned suddenly forward his habit of putting questions abrupt and straight to the point had discomposed miss le mesurier upon an occasion before she answered hurriedly i mean you spoke as if you meant that class of work was above your own oh theres no basis of comparison clarice seized the opportunity and inquired after the prospects of his work in matanga the place should do said drake the lands good theres a river running through and i have got picked men to settle on it all english thats the point but you said generous i dont see clarice switched him on the subject of english colonisation its necessary to have englishmen to start it why oh well said drake its easy enough to see if you can compare english with the foreign colonies he rose from his chair and launched forth walking about the room look at the germans there are seven hundred german colonists all told in the german colonies and each of them costs the german taxpayer little short of eight hundred a year how many of them are in the english colonies and whats the reason why they want to have the institutions of the fatherland readymade in five minutes they need the colonies made before they can prosper in it the french are better but they are spoilt by officialdom the englishman just adapts himself to the conditions and sets to work to adapt the conditions to himself too he strikes a sort of mean and the home government leaves him alone leaves him too much alone some say and rightly in cases theres a distinction to be drawn and its difficult to draw it so far away its this when the colonys made then it isnt a bad thing for the government to keep a fairly tight hold on it but in the making its best left to itself you can lay a cable between london and a colony too soon for the good of that colony theres no fear of the colonist forgetting the mother country he may forget the home government does at times and then theres a mistake or two but thats the defect of the quality he checked himself abruptly but im running away from what we were talking about yes i think we shall do all right in matanga you dont mean to go back there yourself not to live there to tell the truth i think theres a man or two wanted in england just now who has had a practical experience of our colonies drake spoke without the least trace of boastfulness but in a tone of quiet selfreliance and clarice had a thrill of intuition that he would not have said so much as that to any one but herself clarice began to play again this time a waltz tune drake came over to the piano and stood leaning upon the lid of it he took up the ring and turned it over in his fingers she said thoughtfully i suppose thats true of men as well and then with a hesitating correction i mean of men like you whats true well that they are best without help from any one that they stand in no need of it she spoke quite seriously with a note almost of regret oh i dont know that he answered with a laugh it would be a rash thing to say of course a man ought to depend upon himself oh of course she agreed and went on playing drake was still holding the ring and he said slowly you remember that afternoon i told you about he hesitated for a second gorley clarice looked up in surprise yes she said you were wearing this ring you hid your face in your hands it was the last thing i saw of you she lowered her eyes from his face and said with a certain timidity he gave it to me drake started and leaned on the piano and you still wear it he asked sharply she nodded but without looking at him drake rose upright straightening himself for a moment or two he stood looking at her and then he walked away towards the window his hat was lying on a table close by it but i dont think that i shall again she murmured she heard him turn quickly round and come back he stood behind her she could see his shadow thrown across the bar of sunlight on the carpet but he did not speak clarice became anxious that he should and yet afraid too the music began to falter again once she stopped completely and let her fingers rest upon the keys as though she had no power to lift them and continue then she struck a chord with a loud defiance if only he would move she thought if only he would come round and stand in front of her it would be so much easier to speak to divert him so long as he stood silent and motionless behind her she felt in a strange manner at his mercy she rose from her seat suddenly and confronted him there was challenge in the movement but none the less her eyes sought the ground and once face to face with him she stood in an attitude of submission what does that mean she heard him ask in a low voice you wont wear it again she did not answer but in spite of herself against her will she raised her eyes until they met his she heard a cry hoarse and passionate she felt herself lifted caught and held against him she saw his eyes above hers burning into hers she felt the pressure of two lips upon hers and her own respond obediently is it true the words were whispered into her ear with an accent of wonder almost of awe yes she whispered back compelled to the answer subservient to his touch to his words and to the full conscious of her subservience she felt the big breath he drew in answering her monosyllable he held her unresisting passive in his arms watching her cheeks fire she realised in a kind of detached way that he was holding her so that the tips of her toes only touched the floor and somehow that seemed of a piece with the rest then he set her down and stood apart keeping her hands its funny he said how one goes on year after year quite satisfied knowing nothing of this meaning not to know she caught at the phrase and stammered perhaps that was wise it was for so i met you he released her hands and she sank into the nearest chair drake walked to the window and stood facing the sunlight breathing it in clarice she heard him murmur with a shake of his shoulders like a great newfoundland dog and then the cry of a newspaper boy shouting the headlines of a special edition rasped into the room drake leaned out of the window hi he called and tossed a penny into the street threepence shouted the boy from below its a penny paper cried drake threepence theres a corner in em clarice listened to the argument most men she thought helplessly dont buy newspapers the moment they have been accepted and at all events it is an occasion when they are disposed to throw their money about it made no difference of any kind to him drake finally got the better of the bargain and the paper was brought up to the room clarice saw drake open it hurriedly and his face cloud and harden as he glanced down the column whats the matter she asked in a rising voice a rebellion in matanga he said slowly i thought that danger was averted and there was a distinct note of selfreproach in his tone clarice felt her heart beat quicker she rose from her chair what does that mean to you she asked delay he replied with the selfreproach yet more accentuated nothing more i am sure but it does mean that nothing more he noticed an expression of disappointment upon the girls face and mistaking it repeated nothing more than that clarice he took a step towards her of course i ought not to have spoken to you yet not until everything was settled i am sorry of course it will come out all right only till then it wasnt fair i didnt mean to not even when i came this afternoon but seeing you i wasnt strong enough i gave in clarice felt a pulse of satisfaction and her lips shaped to a smile ah you dont regret it he exclaimed and the look of humiliation passed from his face your fathers in the library he went on i had better go and tell him shall i go alone or will you come with me no you go i will wait here she stood alone in the centre of the room while drake went downstairs staring fixedly in front of her once or twice she set her hands to her forehead and drew them down her flushed cheeks then she walked to the window there was something floating on the edge of her mind just eluding her a thought was it or a phrase if a phrase who had spoken it she began to remember it was something stephen drake had said but about what and then in a flash her recollection defined it for her it was about moonlight being absorbed into the darkness of an african veld just soaking into it like water into dry ground she had a vision of the wide rolling plain black from skys rim to skys rim and the moonlight pouring a futile splendour into its lap she moved with a quick and almost desperate run to the door opened it and leaned over the balustrade of the staircase the hall was empty and no sound of voices came from the library she stepped cautiously down the stairs as she reached the last step the door of the library opened and drake appeared on the threshold clarice leaned against the wall holding her hand to her heart why clarice he cried and started towards her hush she tried to whisper the word but her voice rose she thrust out a hand between herself and drake and cast a startled glance across his shoulder expecting to see her father come forward smiling congratulations at her drake caught the outstretched hand and setting an arm about her waist drew her into the library i have not seen mr le mesurier he said hes out i am afraid the room was empty clarice looked round it doubting her eyes and with a sudden revulsion of feeling dropped into a chair by the table and sat with her face buried in her arms in a flood of tears chapter x drake bent over her stroking her hair with a gentle helpless movement of his hand and occasionally varying his consolation by a pat on the shoulders the puffed sleeves of silk yielding under his touch gave him a queer impression of the girls fragility oh dont child he entreated its my fault for speaking so soon but really theres nothing to fear nothing itll all come out right not a doubt of that youll see consolation of this kind did but make the tears flow yet more freely drake perceived the fact and stood aside wondering perplexedly at the reason the sound of each sob jerked at his heart he began to walk restlessly about the room the storm from its very violence however wore itself quickly out the sobs became less convulsive less frequent clarice raised her head from her arms and stared out of the window opposite with just now and then a little shiver and heave of her back drake stopped his walk and advanced to her she anticipated his speech turning with a start to face him you havent seen my father no the servant told me he had gone out but i wrote a note saying i would call again this evening it is under your elbow clarice picked up the crumpled envelope and looked at it absently stephen she said and she tripped upon the name theres something i ought to tell you now but its rather difficult drake walked to the window and stood with his back towards her she felt grateful to him for the action and was a little surprised at the tact which had prompted it yes he said we are not very well off she continued perhaps you know that yes he interrupted but the positions more complicated than you can know she was speaking carefully weighing her words of course you know that i have a sister younger than myself shes at school in brussels well by the sark laws the seigneurie cant be split up between the members of a family i think its the same with all land there it must go whats the word unencumbered to the eldest child so it must come to me all of it that leaves my sister still to be provided for father explained the whole thing to me as it is he has as much as he can do to keep the seigneurie up this house we cant really afford but father thought he ought to take it well for my sake i suppose so you see whatever money he has he must leave to my sister and theres still the seigneurie for me to keep up yes i understand you are bound by duty if you marry to marry some one with means but clarice it wont be long to wait and he turned back from the window into the room but till then dont you see of course i know you will be successful and she laid considerable emphasis on the i drake reflected for a moment you mean there would be trouble between your father and you the weight of it would fall on you he might distrust me yes after all why should he not but still the things done isnt it clarice rose from her chair and walked to the grate a fire was burning and she still held drakes letter in her hand we might keep it to ourselves she said diffidently she saw drakes forehead contract for my sake she said softly laying a hand upon his sleeve she lifted a tearstained face up to his with the prettiest appeal i know you hate it but it will spare me so much he said nothing and she dropped the letter into the fire as drake was leaving the house she heard through the closed door the sound of her fathers voice in the hall speaking to him and felt a momentary pang of alarm the next instant however she laughed he might have broken his word to himself he would not break it to her drake went home reckoning up the harm he had done with a feeling of degradation quite new to him not the least part of that harm was the compromise finally agreed upon but for the traces of tears upon the girls cheeks he would hardly have agreed to it even in the face of her appeal once alone however he saw clearly all the deception that it implied deception which involved the girl too as well as himself he rose the next day in no more equable frame of mind and leaving his office at three oclock in the afternoon walked along cheapside holborn and oxford street and turned down bond street meaning to pass an hour in the fencingrooms halfway down st james street at the corner of bruton street he came face to face with miss le mesurier she coloured for an instant and then came frankly forward and held out her hand its funny meeting you here she said and laughed without the least embarrassment drake turned and walked by her side with a puzzled conjecture at the reason of womans recuperative powers clarices eyes were as clear her forehead as sunny as though she had clean wiped yesterday from her consciousness the conjecture however brought the reality of yesterday only yet more home to him he stopped in the street and said abruptly clarice i cant she stopped in her turn and drew a little pattern on the pavement with the point of her umbrella why a passerby jostled drake in the back standing there they were blocking the way isnt there anywhere we could go tea one drinks tea at this hour eh no clarice felt more mistress of herself in the open street more able to cope with drake while they walked in a throng she remembered enough of yesterday to avoid even the makeshift solitude of a teatable in a public room let us walk on she said cant you explain as we go i am late she moved forward as she spoke and drake kept pace with her shortening his strides the need of doing that trifle though it was increased his sense of responsibility towards her its so abominably deceitful and its my doing i should involve you in the deceit clarice glanced at him sharply the distress of his voice was repeated in the expression of her face there was no doubting that he spoke sincerely i had better see your father to day he added no she replied energetically and after a moments pause theres another way well let everything be as it was before yesterday i shall not change it will be better for you to be free come to me when you are ready she signed to a passing hansom and it drew up by the curb she got into it while drake stood with brows knitted revolving the proposal in his mind but you see it cant be the same he said because i kissed you didnt i yes you did she replied the tremble of laughter in her voice made him look up to her face the rose deepened in her cheeks and the laughter rippled out you are quaint she said i will forget well what you said until you are ready till then its to be just as it was before only not less you are not to stay away and without waiting for an answer she lifted the trap gave the cabman his order and drove off drake watched the hansom disappear and absently retraced his steps down the street he stopped once or twice and stared vaguely into the shopwindows one of these was a jewellers and he turned sharply away from it and quickened his pace towards the fencingrooms how could it be the same he asked himself when the mere sparkle of an emerald ring in a jewellers shopwindow aroused in him a feeling of distaste towards the end of this week clarice called upon mrs willoughby and seemed for the moment put out on finding that mallinson and fielding were present mrs willoughby welcomed her all the more warmly because she was finding it difficult to keep the peace between her two visitors she understood clarices embarrassment when percy conway arrived close upon her heels clarice however quietly handed him over to mrs willoughby and seated herself beside mallinson in one of the windows i see nothing of you now she said and she looked the reproach of the hardlyused i thought we had agreed to be friends mallinson sighed wearily i will come and call some day he said dejectedly i have not so many friends that i can afford a loss she answered pathetically and then tell me about yourself what are you doing nothing no work no mallinson shook his head why i have no incentive nothing to work for thats cruel they played out their farce of sham sentiment with a luxurious earnestness for a little while longer and then mallinson went away so hes doing no work said fielding maliciously to miss le mesurier he leaned forward as he spoke from the embrasure of the second window which was in a line with and but a few feet apart from that at which she was sitting miss le mesurier flushed and asked how did you hear both windows are open mallinson was leaning out the girls confusion increased and with it fieldings enjoyment he repeated so hes doing no work a thousand a year dont you know said conway with a sneer it would make a man like that lazy its not laziness exclaimed clarice indignantly she was filled with pity for mallinson and experienced too a sort of reflex pity for herself as the inappropriate instrument of his suffering she was consequently altogether tuned to tenderness for him its not laziness at all its its she cast about for a laudatory explanation well what fielding pressed genially its the artistic temperament she exclaimed triumphantly fielding laughed at her vindication and miss le mesurier walked across the room and said goodbye to mrs willoughby conway rose at the same time and the pair left the house together what a liar that man is said fielding what man asked mrs willoughby why mallinson he said he was doing no work because he had no incentive as a matter of fact i happen to know that he is working rather hard what did clarice say what you might expect she melted into sympathy mrs willoughby looked puzzled yet she went off with percy conway immediately afterwards she said and then laughed at her recollections of a previous visit from that gentleman yes and absolutely unconscious of the humour of her behaviour said fielding thats so delightful about her he paused for a second and asked have you ever been inside a camera obscura you get a picture an impression very vivid very accurate of something that is actually happening then some one pulls a string and you get a totally different picture equally vivid equally accurate of something else which is actually happening there is no trace of the first picture in the second then they open a shutter and you see nothing but a plain white slab somehow i always think of miss le mesuriers mind after leaving mrs willoughbys conway and miss le mesurier walked together in the direction of beaufort gardens do you see much of mr drake she asked after a considerable silence not as much as one would wish to hes generally busy you like him then she asked curiously why dont you theres an absence of pretension about him nothing of the borntocommand air but insensibly you find yourself believing in him following him i believe even fielding finds that as well when drake first came back i used to stand up for him well because perhaps i had a reason of my own i am not sure that i believed all i said but i am sure now i should say exactly the same and believe every word of it he spoke with a quiet conviction which gave solid weight to his words owing to its contrast with the flighty enthusiasm which was the usual characteristic of his eulogies you mentioned mr fielding she said yes havent you heard hes investing in matanga concessions and largely for him hes often seen in drakes office clarice walked along in silence for some way further then she said with a distinct irritation in her voice i suppose it all comes from the fact that mr drake doesnt seem to need any one to rely upon or well any particular incentive to work conway glanced at miss le mesurier with a slight surprise she was generally given to accept facts without inquiry into their causes i shouldnt wonder if you are right drake i should think would find his incentive in the work itself yes i believe you are right its just his singlemindedness which influences one there are certain ideas fixed in his mind combined into one aim and he lets nothing interfere to obscure that aim so he spoke so too clarice believed and that picture of moonlight on the veld became yet more vivid yet more frequent in her thoughts pondering upon it her fancy led her to exaggerate drake into the likeness of some egyptian god that sits with huge hands resting upon massive knees and works out its own schemes behind indifferent eyes the sight of him and the sound of commonplace words from his mouth would at times make her laugh at the conception and restore her to her former familiarity with him but the fancy returned to her and each time added a fresh layer to the colour of her thoughts she came now and again to betray a positive shrinking from him drake noticed it he noticed something else as well in the first week of july the emerald ring reappeared upon her finger in the second week mr le mesurier removed his household gods to sark it was his habit to spend the summer months upon the island and to entertain there his friends in succession he invited both mrs willoughby and stephen drake the former accepted the latter being on the eve of floating the matanga concessions declined for the present to clarices great relief but promised to come later the company was floated towards the end of the month and with immediate success mr le mesurier read out at breakfast a letter which he had received from drake announcing that every share had been taken up on the very day of flotation then he is coming said clarice when mr le mesurier mistook his daughters anxiety and smiled satisfaction at her tomorrow he replied but only for three days at first theres some new development he speaks of he will have to leave again on saturday for a fortnight clarice sat thoughtfully for a minute or two then she asked did you invite mr mallinson this summer mr le mesurier shuffled his feet under the table no my dear he said i forgot all about it and now i dont see that we shall have room oh yes replied clarice quickly he might have mr drakes room during that fortnight i think we ought to ask him we always have and it will look rather strange if we leave him out this summer i will get aunt to write after breakfast mr le mesurier glanced at mrs willoughby but made no active resistance and clarice took care that the letter was despatched by that days post on the next day she organised a picnic in little sark and returned to the seigneurie at an hour which gave her sufficient time to dress for dinner but no margin for welcoming visitors in consequence she only saw drake at the dinnertable she saw little of him afterwards for mr le mesurier pounced upon him after dinner i want to introduce you to burl he said hes parliamentary agent for the northern counties theres a constituency in yorkshire where my brother lives and i rather think burl wants a candidate drake was presented to a gentleman six feet three in his socks deepchested broadshouldered with a square rugged face on the slant from the forehead to the chin mrs willoughby said he looked like a pirate and rumour made of her simile a fact it was known that late one night in the smokingroom of the seigneurie he had owned to silverrunning on the coast of mexico mr burl and drake passed most of that evening smoking together in the garden similarly on the next day clarice avoided a private interview with drake on the other hand however he made no visible effort to secure one mrs willoughby wondered at his reticence and did more than wonder she had by this time espoused his cause and knowing no halfmeasures in her enthusiasms saw his chances slipping from him with considerable irritation she was consequently provoked to hint her advice to him on the evening before he was to leave drake shook his head and replied frankly one can be too previous i made that mistake once before and i dont mean to repeat it he remained silent for a moment or two and added i think ill tell you about it mrs willoughby you have guessed some part of the story and you are clarices friend and mine too i believe with an impulsiveness rare in him which however served to rivet him yet more firmly in mrs willoughbys esteem he confided to her the history of his proposal and its lame result so you see he concluded i am not likely to risk a repetition of the incident but said she surely theres no risk now very likely but there is just a little this next fortnight will i think make everything secure but i must wait that fortnight well i believe you are unwise drake turned to her quickly why mr mallinson takes your place for the fortnight of course i dont know clarice has given up confiding in me but i really think you are unwise drake sat staring in front of him he was considering mallinsons visit in conjunction with the reappearance of the emerald ring upon miss le mesuriers finger all the same he said at length i shall wait the reason for this hesitation he explained more fully to clarice herself some half an hour afterwards he found her standing by herself upon the terrace she started nervously as he approached and it seemed to him that her whole figure stiffened to a posture of defence she said nothing however and for a while they stood side by side looking seawards across the breadth of the island the ground stretched away broken into little hollows and little hills downs in vignette a cheery yellow light streamed from the windows of a cottage in a dip of the grass the slates of a roof glistened from a group of sycamores like a mirror in a dark frame the whole island lay bared to the moonlight towards the edge of it the land rose upwards to a ridge but there was a cleft in the ridge opposite to where they stood and through the cleft they looked downwards to the sea clarice spoke of the moonbeams broken into sparkles by the ripple of the water like a shoal of silver coins said drake wouldnt you like to hear them clink she asked petulantly then he said miss le mesurier and the change in his voice made the girl turn swiftly to face him i leave sark tomorrow morning by the early boat so i thought i would say goodbye to you tonight but you are coming back she said quickly i shall see you of course when you come back what takes you away theres some land in matanga which bounds my concession on the north and i want to get hold of it its i believe quite as good and may be better than mine and i know that some people are after it it wouldnt help me if another company was to be started and as the president of the matanga republic is on his way to england i thought that i had better go out to madeira catch his steamer there and secure a concession of it before he reaches england clarice gave a laugh then we are to expect you in a fortnight yes in a fortnight and he laid a significance upon the word which clarice did not mistake it was spoken with an accent of entreaty but indeed she needed no emphasis to fix it in her mind the word besieged her she caught herself uttering it and while she uttered it the time itself seemed to have slipped by she had but to say no at the end of the fortnight she assured herself and she knew that she would only have to say it once but the memory of that sunday afternoon in beaufort gardens lay upon her like a load crushing all the comfort out of her knowledge drake caught his steamer at southampton and the president at madeira he was received warmly as an old acquaintance warily as a negotiator however he extracted the concession as the boat passed up southampton water and disembarked with a signed memorandum in his pocket at southampton postoffice he received a bundle of letters which had been forwarded to him from his chambers in london he slipped them into his coat and went at once on board the guernsey steamer at guernsey the next morning he embarked on the little boat which runs between guernsey and sark the sun was a golden fire upon the water the race of the tides no more than a ripple the island stuck out its great knees into the sea and lolled in the heat halfway across drake bethought him of the letters he took them out and glanced over the envelopes one was in clarices handwriting it announced to him her engagement with sidney mallinson chapter xi of drakes arrival at the seigneurie mrs willoughby wrote some account to hugh fielding who was taking the waters for no ailment whatever at marienbad i was surprised to see him she wrote because clarice told me that she had written to him clarice was running down the stairs when he came into the hall she stopped suddenly as she caught sight of him clutched at the balustrade slipped a heel upon the edge of the step and with a cry pitched straight into his arms at the bottom mr mallinson came out of the library while he was holding her clarice was not hurt however and mr drake set her down i didnt pass through london he said and he seemed to be apologising my letters were forwarded to southampton and i only opened them on the sark steamer then he congratulated them both i spoke to mr drake the same evening on the terrace here foolishly hinting the feminine consolation that he was well free from a girl of clarices fickleness he was in arms on the instant one gets at truth only by experiment and through repeated mistakes why except womens hearts from the same law i give his opinion not his words he doesnt talk of womens hearts you know his trick of suggesting when it comes to talk of the feelings i slid into a worse blunder and sympathised with him he replied that it didnt make the difference to him which i might think i felt as if a stream of icewater had been turned down my back on christmas day however he went on in a sort of shamefaced style like a schoolboy caught talking sentiment one owes her a debt for having cared for her and the debt remains he stayed out his visit and left this morning he goes to switzerland and asked for your address his is the bear grindelwald write to him there better join him he talks of going out to matanga later in the year for a few months so theres the end of the business or rather one hopes so i used to hope that clarice would wake up some morning into a real woman and find herself isnt that the phrase i hope the reverse now that she and her husband will philander along to the close of the chapter but i prefer your word to the close of the comedy say it implies something artificial mallinson and clarice give me that impression as of watteau figures mincing a gavotte and made more unreal by the juxtaposition of a man lets hope they will never perceive the flimsiness of their pretty bows and ribbons but i think of your one oclock in the morning of the masquerade ball and frankly i am afraid i look at the three without well with as little prejudice as weak woman may mallinson you know him always on the artists seesaw between exaltation and despair doesnt that make for shiftiness generally clarice i dont understand but i incline to your idea of her as at the mercy of every momentary emotion and the more for what has happened this week since her engagement she seems to have lost her fear of stephen drake she has been all unexpressed sympathy and drake theres the danger i am sure a danger not of the usual kind had he been unscrupulous he might have ridden roughshod over clarice long before now but hes too scrupulous for that i think that he misses greatness as we understand it through excess of scruple but theres that saying of his about a debt incurred to clarice by the man caring for her well convince him that he can pay it by any sacrifice wont he pay it convince him that it would benefit her if he lay in the mud wouldnt he do it i dont know i made a little prayer yesterday night grotesque enough but very sincere that there might be no fifth act of tragedy to make a discord of your comedy fielding received mrs willoughbys command to join drake with a grin at her conception of him as fit company for a gentleman disappointed in his loveaffairs he nevertheless obeyed it and travelling to grindelwald found drake waiting him on the platform with the hands of an oakumpicker and a face toned uniformly to the colour of a ripe pippin you have been climbing mountains i suppose asked fielding yes nodded drake well dont ask me to join you it produces a style of conversation i dont like drake laughed and protested that nothing was further from his intention certain letters however which fielding wrote to mrs willoughby during this period proved that he did join him and more than once the two men returned to london halfway through september on the journey from dover to charing cross drake asked whether mrs willoughby was in town he was informed that at the moment she was visiting in scotland but she was expected to pass through london at the end of a fortnight drake wrote a note to her address asking her to spare him a few moments when she came south and receiving a cordial assent with the statement of the most favourable hour walked across one evening to knightsbridge mrs willoughby remarked a certain constraint in his manner and awaited tentacle questions concerning sidney mallinson and clarice she said you look well you have enjoyed your holiday i had an amusing companion you have given him some spark of your activity and the sentence was pitched to convey thanks then you have seen him drakes embarrassment became more pronounced he paused for a second and then rose and walked across the room you know i suppose he resumed that i am going out to matanga in a month i heard something of that from mr fielding she said gently yes he said with a change in his voice to brisk cheerfulness it seemed to me that i ought to go our interests there are rather large now i consulted my fellowdirectors and they agreed with me the sudden disappearance of the constraint which had marked him surprised mrs willoughby but can you leave london she asked oh yes i have made arrangements for that he replied i have got burl to look after things here mr burl yes its rather funny said drake with a laugh he came to ask me whether i was disposed to take up politics there was a constituency in yorkshire he could arrange for me to stand for bentbridge do you know it i have been there mr le mesurier has a brother just outside the town it was there i believe that he became acquainted with mr burl so i gathered well i wanted the question left open for a bit then burl made another proposal he said they wanted a paper in the district there were some people ready to back the idea but they didnt have quite enough capital burl wanted me to provide the rest he didnt get it but he nearly did and it struck me that he was just the man i wanted so after he had had his say i had mine and he has thrown up politics and joined me drake ended his story with a laugh and added i think i am lucky to have got hold of him then you dont mean to go away for good exclaimed mrs willoughby oh dear no what on earth made you think that but i will be away a year i think and and thats just the point his embarrassment returned as suddenly as it had left him i dont understand well i had an idea of persuading fielding to go with me he blurted the proposal brusquely hes interested you see in the success of the colony and well altogether i didnt think it would be a bad thing mrs willoughby walked to the window and looked out of it for a few seconds what does mr fielding say she asked i havent broached the subject to him yet i thought i wouldnt before he stopped and made no effort to finish the sentence its a year she said slowly lengthening out the word yes only a year said he briskly and mrs willoughby smiled in spite of herself she thought of the new air of alertness which fielding had worn since his return from switzerland she came back to drake and held out her hand to him you think very wisely for your friends she said its an inspiriting business to see a community in the making he answered especially when theres money to help it to make itself quickly he wished her goodbye and moved to the door as he opened it he said by the way is the date of the marriage fixed but without turning towards her she said yes the th of december and she saw his shoulders brace and the weight of his body come backwards from the ball of the foot on to the heel ah i shall be in africa by then he said it was in fact near upon the end of february that the riversteamer plying between the settlement and the coast of matanga brought to drake and fielding an announcement that the marriage had taken place there were letters for both the men and they carried them out to a grass knoll on the edge of the forest some quarter of a mile away from the little village of tin huts which shone in the sunshine like a tidy kitchen as fielding was used to say drake read his through and said to fielding you have a letter from mrs willoughby yes any news fielding looked him in the face yes he said slowly and putting the letter in his pocket buttoned it up drake understood alike from his tone and action what news the letter conveyed and made no further inquiry he fell instead to talking of some machinery which the boat had brought up along with the letters the letter indeed was written in a vein which made it impossible for fielding to follow the usual habit of reading mrs willoughbys letters aloud to his companion the wedding she wrote lacked nothing but a costumier and a composer the bride and bridegroom should have been in fancy dress and a new gounod was needed to compose the weddingmarch of a marionette one might have taken the ceremony seriously as an artistic whole under those circumstances mrs willoughby continued to keep fielding informed of the progress or the married couple and in may hinted at dissensions the hint fielding let slip one day to drake drake however received the news with apparent indifference and indeed returned to england in september with fielding without having so much as referred to the subject during the month which followed his return he preserved the same appearance of indifference seeming indeed thoroughly engrossed in working off arrears of business the fact however of this dissension was thrust before his notice one evening when he dined with mr le mesurier and that gentleman dealt out extravagant praise to the french for recognising that the marriages of the children are matters which solely concern the parents we english said he with a shrug of contempt at the fatuity of his countrymen men and women or rather boys and girls choose for ourselves and whats the result nine times out of ten well its the custom and its no use for a man by himself trying to alter it drake was familiar with mr le mesuriers habit of shifting responsibilities and while he said nothing at the moment called upon mrs willoughby the next day and questioned her openly mrs willoughby admitted that there were disagreements but believed them not to be deep the first year she said is as a rule a trying time there are illusions to be sloughed people may come out all the stronger in the end mrs willoughby generalised to conceal the little hopefulness she felt in regard to the particular instance i ask continued drake because i thought money might be at the bottom of it in that case something perhaps might be done mrs mallinson would be troubled i believe by a need to economise oh no she returned theres no trouble of that kind you see mr le mesurier sold the seigneurie for one thing sold it exclaimed drake why i was told that it was strictly entailed from father to child in one respect it is it cant be charged with annuities but any one who owns it can sell it outright mr le mesurier always intended to sell it if clarice married a man only moderately well off drake rose from his chair and walked once or twice quickly across the room he should have told his daughter that he said slowly mrs willoughby glanced at him in surprise well of course he did oh no he didnt said drake quickly you remember i told you at sark why she wanted our engagement to be kept secret because your position wasnt altogether assured you didnt mention the seigneurie no i thought you would understand she believed an engagement between us would cause trouble with her father just because it was necessary for her to marry a man who could keep up the seigneurie mrs willoughby started clarice told you that she said staring at him yes he replied simply so you see she didnt know mrs willoughby sank back into her chair she had heard mr le mesurier announce his intention more than once in clarices presence however she fancied that no particular good would be done by informing him of the girls deception and she dropped the subject what about conway asked drake he still walks up and down london i fancy he is secretary to something drake hesitated for a second does he go there very much a good deal i fancy she replied but you mustnt think the disagreement is really serious there is no cause outside themselves have you called no i go down to bentbridge tomorrow i must call when i get back then you are going to stand for parliament she exclaimed i am so glad yes they expect an election in july i believe you see now that fielding has been made a director and has settled down to work i have got more time in fact one feels rather lonely at nights mrs willoughby was willing to hear more concerning fieldings merits she promptly set herself to belittle the importance of his position and work for the sake of hearing them upheld and she was not disappointed its easy enough to laugh at finance and fashionable into the bargain he said but heres the truth of the matter money does today what was the work of the sword a century or so ago and as far as i can see does it better to my thinking it should be held in quite as high esteem you can put it aside and let it rust if you like but other nations wont follow your good example then the time comes when you must use it and you find the only men youve got to handle it are the men you cant trust the bandit instead of the trained soldier no put the best men you can find to finance i say and with that he said goodbye why doesnt he drop them altogether asked fielding with considerable irritation when mrs willoughby informed him of drakes intention to renew his acquaintance with the mallinsons it would only make matters worse if he did replied she clarice would be certain to count any falling off of her friends as a new grievance against her husband friends he is willing to take his place as one he will find it singularly uninteresting friendship between a man and a woman he shrugged his shoulders then he laughed to himself mrs willoughby got up nervously from her chair and walked to the opposite end of the room these things continued fielding in a perfectly complacent and unconscious tone are best understood by their symbols mrs willoughby swung round symbols she asked curiously fielding took a seat and leaned back comfortably the feelings and emotions he began have symbols in the visible world of these symbols the greater number are flowers i wont trouble you with an enumeration of them for in the first place i couldnt give it and in the second shakespeare has provided a fairly comprehensive list and by nature i am averse to challenging comparisons there are however feelings of which the symbols are not flowers and amongst them we must reckon friendship between man and woman passion we know has its passion flower but the friendship i am speaking of has its symbol too he paused impressively and that symbol is cold boiled mutton mrs willoughby laughed awkwardly what nonsense she said a mere jeu desprit i admit said he and he waved his hand to signify that he could be equally witty every day in the week if he chose his satisfaction indeed blinded him to the fact that his speech might be construed as uncommonly near to a proposal of marriage he thought with a cast back to his old dilettante spirit that it would be amusing to repeat it especially to a woman of the sentimental kind clarice mallinson for instance he pictured the look of injury in her eyes and laughed again chapter xii clarice was indeed even more disappointed than mrs willoughby imagined she had looked forward to her marriage and had indeed been persuaded to look forward to it as to the smiting of a rock in her husbands nature whence a magical spring of inspiration should flow perennially the future owes us a great deal mallinson had said it does indeed clarice had replied in her most sentimental tones only she made the mistake of believing that the date of her marriage was the time appointed for payment instead of that spontaneous flow of inspiration she had beneath her eyes a process of arduous work which was not limited to a special portion of the day like the work of a business man and which in the case of a man with mallinsons temperament inevitably produced an incessant fretfulness with his surroundings now since this work was done not in an office but at home the burden of that fretfulness fell altogether upon clarice she took to reading the morte darthur fielding found her with the book in her hand when he called and commented on her choice theres no romance in the world nowadays she replied but there has been he replied cheerfully lots clarice professed not to understand his meaning he proceeded to tick off upon his ringers those particular instances in which he knew her to have had a share and mentioned the names of the gentlemen he omitted drakes however and clarice noticed the omission for the rest she listened quite patiently until he came to an end then she asked gravely do you think that is quite a nice way to talk to a married woman no he admitted frankly i dont for a few minutes the conversation lagged this was however fieldings first visit since his homecoming and clarice yielded to certain promptings of curiosity i hardly expected you would be persuaded to go out to africa even by any one she concluded lamely neither did i he replied did you enjoy it she asked i went out a remus i return a romulus there were points in clarices behaviour which never failed to excite fieldings admiration amongst these was a habit she possessed of staring steadily into the speakers face with all the appearance of complete absence of mind whenever an allusion was made which she did not understand and then continuing the conversation as though the allusion had never been made of course you had a companion she said fielding agreed that he had i have not seen him she added no no clarice was driven to name the companion you seem to have struck up a great friendship with mr drake i should hardly have thought that you would have found much in common arcades ambo dont you know clarice did not know and being by this time exasperated she showed that she did not fielding explained blandly we both drive the same pigs to the same market clarice laughed shortly and stroked the cover of her morte darthur i suppose thats just what friendship means nowadays between man and man yes between woman and woman its different and its of course different too between man and woman but perhaps thats best to be understood by means of its symbol and he worked up to his climax of cold boiled mutton with complete satisfaction i gather then that you see nothing of mrs willoughby now said clarice quietly as soon as he had stopped fielding was for the moment taken aback it seemed to him that the point of view was unfair widows he replied with great sententiousness widows are different and he took his leave without explaining wherein the difference lay he wondered however if clarices point of view had occurred to mrs willoughby fieldings visit and in particular his teasing reticence as to his stay in matanga had the effect of recalling clarices thoughts to the subject of stephen drake she recalled her old impression of him as one selfcentred and selfsufficing a man to whom nothing outside himself would make any tangible difference but she recalled it without a trace of the apprehension with which it had been previously coupled she began indeed to dwell upon that idea of him as upon something restful and the idea was still prominent in her mind when a little more than a week afterwards drake galloped up to her one morning as she was crossing the park i have been meaning to call mrs mallinson he said but the fact is i have had no time i only got back from bentbridge last night clarice received a sudden and yet expected impression of freshness from him papa told me you were going to stand she replied you stayed with my uncle captain le mesurier didnt you yes funnily enough i have met him before although i didnt know his name he travelled in the carriage with me from plymouth to london when i first landed in england clarice wondered what made him pause for a moment in the middle of the sentence your chances are promising she asked i cant say yet i have a radical lord against me burl says theres no opponent more dangerous it will be a close fight i think he threw back his head and opened his chest his voice rang with a vigorous enjoyment in the anticipation of a strenuous contest so you are glad to get back to london she said rather i feel at home here and only here even in january he looked across the park with a laugh it stretched away vacant and dull in the gray cheerlessness of a winters morning the place fascinates me it turns me into a child especially at night i like the glitter of shops and gaslamps and the throng of people in the light of them one understands what the roman citizen felt i like driving about the streets in a hansom there are some one never gets tired of oxford street for instance and the turn out of leicester square into coventry street with the blaze of piccadilly circus ahead one hears that poets starve in london and are happy i can believe it well i am keeping you from the shops and myself from business he shook hands with her and mounted his horse you have not yet seen my husband she said and she felt that she forced herself to speak the word not yet i must look him up you live in regents park dont you close by will you come some evening and dine the invitation was accepted and drake rode off he rode well clarice noticed and his horse was finely limbed and perfectly groomed the perception of these details had its effect she stood looking after him then she turned slowly and made her way homewards across the park two of her acquaintances passed her and lifted their hats but she took no notice of them she did not see them a picture was fixed in her mind a picture of a rolling plain black as midnight exhaling blackness so that the air itself was black for some feet above the ground and into this cool and quiet darkness the moonbeams plunged out of a fiery sky and were lost they dropped she fancied after their long flight to their appointed haven of repose the street door of her house gave on to a garden clarice walked along the pathway in front of the house towards the door of the hall as she passed her husbands study windows she glanced in he was standing in front of the fireplace tearing across some sheets of manuscript clarice hurried forwards he was always tearing up manuscript while she was upstairs taking off her hat she heard his door open and his voice complaining to the servants about some papers which had been mislaid she felt inclined to take the servants part after all what was a man doing in the house all day there was a dragging shuffle of his slippers upon the floor of the hall the sound jarred on her she pinned on her hat again ran downstairs gave orders that she would not be in for lunch and drove at once to mrs willoughbys she arrived in a state little short of hysterical connie she cried almost before the servant who announced her was out of the room i know you dont like me but oh im so unhappy mrs willoughby softened at sight of her evident distress why whats the matter she asked and made her sit down beside her on the sofa its awful she said and repeated its awful yes child but what is asked mrs willoughby all is i mean everything is sobbed clarice mrs willoughby recognised that though the correction amended the grammar it did not simplify the meaning she pressed for something more precise dont be irritable connie quavered clarice because thats just what sidney is and always its so difficult to make you understand but hes just a lot of wires and they keep twanging all day he nags theres no other word for it he nags about everything the servants his publishers the dinner and oh oh why cant he wear boots in the morning the point of the question was lost on mrs willoughby she began to expostulate with clarice for magnifying trifles of course replied clarice sitting up suddenly she had been half lying on the sofa in mrs willoughbys arms i know they are trifles i know that but make every day full of them every day repeat them oh its awful i wonder i dont break down she turned again to mrs willoughby lapsing from vehemence to melancholy as the notion occurred to her connie i believe i shall break down altogether you know im not very strong she put her arms about mrs willoughby and clung to her in the intensity of her selfcompassion you cant imagine the strain it is and if that wasnt enough his mother comes up from clapham and lectures me i wouldnt mind that only shes not very safe about her hs and she stops to dinner and talks about the nobility shes had cooks from to impress the servants its so humiliating to be lectured by any one like that mrs willoughby scented a fact but what does she lecture you about the dinner she asked with an irrelevant recollection of drakes impression of clarice as one little adapted for housewifely duties and not rightly to be troubled by them oh no she says i dont give sidney the help he expected from me but what more can i do he has got me sidney says the same too he told me that he had never had so much difficulty to work properly as since we were married and when his work doesnt succeed i know he blames me for it oh connie is it my fault i think we had better get divorced and i i cccan go into a convent and never do anybody any more harm clarice glanced as she spoke down the neatest of morning frocks and the mental picture which she straightway had of herself in a whitewashed cell with iron bars clad in shapeless black her chin swathed her face under eaves of starched linen induced an access of weeping for all her sympathy mrs willoughby was forced to bite her lips clarice however was not in the mood to observe the effect which her words produced on others she continued its much the best thing to do because whatever i did it would always be the same i could never make him content connie if you only knew the strain of it all hes always wanting to be something different one day a clerk with a nice quiet routine another a soldier another a she hesitated and gave constance an extra squeeze a colonist and fire off maxim guns if you could only see him he sits in front of the fire with his glasses on and talks about the roaring world of things this time mrs willoughby really laughed she turned the laugh into a cough and cleared her throat emphatically once or twice clarice sat up and looked at her reproachfully then she said i know its absurd i dont know whether to laugh or cry myself bbbut i usually cry and then in his books hes hes always his own hero with that clarice reached at once the climax of her distress and the supreme charge of her indictment the rest was but sighs and sobs and disconnected phrases finally she fell asleep later she was caressed into eating lunch taken for a drive and sent home subsequently greatly mollified and relieved mrs willoughby refrained from tendering advice that afternoon there was nothing sufficiently tangible in the story which she had heard in fact the only thing really tangible was the girls distress in telling it and that mrs willoughby attributed to some dispute between her and sidney that morning she could not know that clarices outburst had been preceded by that chance meeting in the park with stephen drake for clarice had made no allusion to it of any kind she felt besides that advice in any case would be of little use the couple had to work out their own salvation and time and experience alone could help them events seemed to justify mrs willoughbys reticence for the winter blossomed into spring the spring flowered into summer and the mallinson household remained to the external view unshaken drakes visits to bentbridge increased in frequency as the prospect of the general election became more real a snap vote in the house of commons on a minor question of administrative expenditure decided the matter suddenly towards the end of june the government determined on a dissolution fielding took clarice mallinson into dinner at mr le mesuriers house on the day after the date of the dissolution was fixed he noticed that she looked worn there were shadows about her eyes her colour had lost its freshness and there was a melancholy droop about the corners of her mouth fielding suggested the advisability of a change im to have one said she im going down to stay with my uncle at bentbridge in a weeks time at bentbridge asked fielding sharply for the election she saw his lips tighten my husband goes with me she replied quickly and stopped flushing as she realised that she had meant and conveyed an apology i should have thought that the continent would have been more advisable as a change the continent i dont want to travel far i am so tired she spoke in a tone of weariness which touched fielding in spite of himself he looked at her more closely yes he said gently you look very tired you have been doing too much no it isnt that she replied one thinks of things thats all she bent her head and was silent for a little tracing a pattern on the tablecloth with a finger absently then she added in a low voice i suppose few women ever think at all until after they are married the voice was low and fielding was conscious of something new in the tone of it a deeper vibration a sincerity different in kind from that surface frankness which he had always known in her he wondered whether she had struck down from her pinchbeck sentimentality into something that rang solid in the depths of her nature he looked at her again her eyes were turned to his with the shadows about them they looked bigger darker more piteously appealing she was no less a child to him the child looked out of her eyes sounded in the commonplace sentiment she had spoken and the air of originality with which she had spoken it but the child seemed beginning to learn the lesson of womanhood and from the one mistress which could teach it her but why think then he asked lightly it ruins a complexion no less than before or does a complexion cease to count look he leaned forward a pink carnation was in a glass in front of him already withering from the heat he touched the faded tips of the petals that is the colour which conies from thinking clarice lifted her shoulders with more of sadness than impatience in the gesture you believe she said no woman at all has a right to dare to think i notice he answered with the same levity that the woman who thinks generally thinks of what she ought not to later in the drawingroom he looked for her again and looked unsuccessfully the window however was open and he advanced to it clarice was on the balcony alone her elbows on the rail a hand on either side of her cheek something in her attitude made him almost pity her mrs mallinson he said you will probably think me intrusive but do you think your visit really wise clarice turned towards him quickly with something of defiance in her manner you are tired he went on you want rest well an election isnt a very restful time even for the onlooker clarice did not reply for a moment and when she did she replied with an impulsive frankness to which his friendly tone had prompted her to tell you the truth i am not anxious to go i dont want to but sidney wants to your husband you dont believe me of course i do he left her on the balcony and went in search of mallinson so you go to bentbridge for the election he said yes replied the other lighting up i am looking forward to it like a schoolboy to a football match the prospect of activity exhilarates me bodily activity dont you know a town humming with excitement fielding cut him short my dear fellow youre a damned fool he said chapter xiii stephen drake had decided to stay during the period of the election at a hotel in the centre of the town rather than to accept an invitation from captain le mesurier who lived some miles beyond the outskirts he travelled down to bentbridge on the day that the dissolution was announced and during the journey mr burl gave him much sage advice keep the arguments for buildings theyre in place there massmeetings in the open air want something different many a good man has lost his seat from not observing that rule in the open air pitch out a fact or two not too many or a couple of round sums of figures first of all just to give them confidence in you and then go straight for your opponent no rapier play its lost then but crack him on the topknot with a bludgeon theyll want to hear his skull ring before theyll believe that you have touched him phrases those are the things to get you in not arguments pin a label on his coattails youll see them laugh as he squirms round to pull it off and mind you therell be no walking over youll want all you know the mans a radical and a lord the combination satisfies their democratic judgments and their snobbish instincts at the same time people forget to count the snob in the democrat but hes there all the same as in most englishmen a veneer of snobbishness over solid independence thats our characteristic lord cranston cant you hear their tongues licking it luckily there are things against him hes a carpetbagger like yourself and hes been more than once separated from his wife his fault too once it was an opera dancer ive got up the facts he only joined his wife again a few months ago probably for the purpose of this election mr burl pulled out a pocketbook and began to turn over the leaves in search of the damning details when drake interrupted him you dont expect me to discuss the mans private life my dear drake do be practical its no use being finicking the essential thing is to win the seat whatever the price look here i am not asking you to do anything so crude as to make platform speeches about the mans disgraceful conduct to his wife mr burl assumed the look of a rhadamanthus but and again he relaxed into the tactician you might take a strong social line on morals generally and the domestic hearth and that sort of thing he looked critically at drake youre one of the few chaps i know who look as if they could do that and make people believe they really mean it he finally discredited his advice by adding impressibly you neednt go into the instance at all you know theyll understand what youre alluding to never fear and drake flatly refused to dance into parliament to that tune however persuasively mr burl played upon the pipes the hotel at which drake put up was situated in a short broad street which ran from the market square from the balcony of his sittingroom on the first floor he could see the market sheds at the end of the street to his left the opposite end was closed in by the town hall which was built upon an ancient gate of the town from drakes windows you got a glimpse through the archway of green fields and trees almost facing him was a second hotel on the opposite side of the street the yellow boar it was tricked out he noticed with the colours of his opponent while he was standing at the window an open carriage turned out of the marketplace and drove up to the yellow boar lord cranston got down from it and a lady the candidate was of a short and slight build a pencil line of black moustache crossed a pallid and indecisive face and he seemed a year or two more than thirty the lady looked the younger and was certainly the taller of the two drake was impressed by her face which bore womanly gentleness stamped on features of a marked intellectuality the couple disappeared into the hall and appeared again in a large room with big windows upon the first floor from where he stood drake could see every corner of the room lord and lady cranston the landlord informed him were staying at the yellow boar the two candidates overlooked each other in this street morning and evening they met for a moment or two and took a breath of friendly intercourse drake was introduced to lady cranston but she would have none of the truce to her he was the enemy and to be treated as such consistently with a heartandsoul hostility until he confessed himself beaten drake liked her all the better for her attitude meanwhile he made headway in the constituency he was in earnest with a big theme to descant upon the responsibility of the constituency to the empire his fervour brought it home to his audiences as a fact he set the recognition of that responsibility forwards as the prime duty of the citizen sneering at the parochial notion of politics mr burl shook his head over drakes method of fighting the battle and hinted more than once at the necessity of that lecture upon morals drake not only refused to reconsider it but flatly forbade mr burl to allude to the subject in any speech which he might make burl shrugged his shoulders and confided his doubts to captain le mesurier said the captain i think hes wise a speech might offend whats wanted is an epigram a good stinging epigram we could set it about and if its sharp enough no need to fear it wont travel he paused dubiously after all though its a bit unfair on cranston hang it ive been a married man myself and he chuckled in unregenerate enjoyment however the seats got to be won lets think of an epigram and he scratched his head and slapped his thigh it was the captains way of thinking the satisfactory epigram would not emerge he could fashion nothing better as a description of cranston than a refreshmentroom sandwich two great chunks of sin and a little slice of repentance between mr burl condemned it as crude and for the moment the epigram was dropped the mallinsons arrived a week after the contest had begun captain le mesurier welcomed clarice with boisterous effusion and her husband with quarterdeck dignity you look ill he said to clarice its your husband worrying you ah i know i know those writing chaps to mallinson however he suddenly showed excessive friendliness and took the opportunity of saying to him loudly in a full room theres something i must tell you i know itll make you laugh it does me whenever i think of it you know drake well we travelled up from plymouth together when he came back from africa he bought your book at the bookstall and sat opposite me reading it what was it called i know a man of influence you should have seen drakes face lord he couldnt make head or tail of it how should he i asked him what he thought of it and imagine what he answered you cant though its the funniest thing i ever heard he said it was a very clever satire satire good lord i almost rolled off the seat it is funny isnt it mallinson with a wry face agreed that the story was funny i knew you would think so pursued the captain relentlessly everybody does i have told it to and thats everybody i know satire lord help us and he shook with laughter and clapped mallinson in the small of the back mallinson felt the fool that he was intended to look with the result that his dormant resentment against drake sprang again into activity that resentment became intensified as the date of the election drew nearer by an unconfessed jealousy they both made speeches but mallinson chiefly at the smaller meetings and when they stood upon the same platform he was continually forced to compare the difference in the acclamation with which their speeches were severally received as a matter of fact drake spoke from a fire of conviction and the conviction not merely burnt through his words but minted them for him gave him spontaneously the short homely phrase which sank his meaning into the minds of his hearers mallinson took refuge in a criticism of drakes speeches from the standpoint of literary polish he recast them in his thoughts turning this sentence more deftly whittling that repartee to a finer point the process consoled him for drakes misreckoning of his purpose in the matter of a man of influence since it pointed to a certain lack of delicacy say at once to crassness in the mans intellect mallinson began immediately to imagine himself in drakes position the candidate for whom brass bands played and hats went spinning into the air and it needed no conscious effort for one so agile in egotistical leaps to spring thence to the fancy that drake was a kind of vicarious substitute for himself doing his work too not without blemishes ten days before the pollingday fielding ran down from town and attended a meeting at the town hall at which both drake and mallinson were to speak he sat on the platform by clarices side and paid some attention to her manner during the evening he noticed the colour mount in her cheeks and her eyes kindle as on first entering the room she looked down upon the crowded floor the chairs had been removed and the audience stood packed beneath the flaring gasjets artificers for the most part their white faces smeared and stained with the grime of their factories the roar of applause as drake rose by the table swelled up to three cheers in consonance and a subsequent singing of for hes a jolly good fellow stirred even fielding to enthusiasm he noted that feeling of enthusiasm as strange in himself and had a thought in consequence that such scenes were hardly of the kind to help clarice to the rest she needed the hall for a moment became a sea of tossing handkerchiefs he took a glance at clarice she sat bent forward with parted lips and a bosom that heaved fielding turned on his coldwater tap of flippancy its a bad omen said he with a nod towards the waving handkerchiefs they hang out flags of surrender hardly she replied with a smile i cant recognise that the flags are white and she added i should like it less if they were these men are the workers the workers fielding could hear drake uttering the word in just the same tone and his compassion for clarice deepened why he asked himself the girl was undergoing not a jot more punishment than a not overrigid political justice would have meted out to her the question inexplicably raised to view a pair of the clearest blue eyes laughing from between the blackest of eyelashes he promptly turned his attention to the speaker at the table drake commenced that night with an apology it was necessary that he should speak about himself an utterly baseless story had within the last few days and doubtless with a view to this election been revived by the london evening paper which originally made it he regretted also to notice that his opponent had accepted the story and was making use of it to prejudice him in the eyes of the electors accordingly he felt bound to put the facts simply and briefly before his audience although the indifference of the colonial office to what if true was a crime committed by an englishman on english soil and against practically english subjects in effect acquitted him of the charge drake thereupon proceeded to describe his march to boruwimi the story modestly recited in simple nervous english did more to forward his candidature than all the political speeches he could have made during a twelvemonth it came pat at the right time when arguments were growing stale his listeners hung upon the words in the intense silence fielding could feel the sympathy between speaker and audience flowing to and fro between them like a current drake instinctively lowered his voice it thrilled through the hall the more convincingly there was a perceptible sway of heads forwards which started at the back and ran from line to line towards the platform like a quick ripple across a smooth sea it was as though this crowded pack of men and women was drawn to move towards the speaker where indeed there was no room at all to move and in truth the subject was one to stir the blood drake prefaced his account by a description of the geography of boruwimi he instanced briefly the iniquities of the arab slavedealers whom he was attacking thereupon he contrasted the numbers of his little force with the horde of his enemies and dwelt for a second upon their skill as marksmen so that his auditors following him as he hewed his path through the tangle of an untrodden forest felt that each obstacle he stopped at might mean not merely failure to the expedition but death to all who shared in it success and life were one and the same thing and the condition of that thing was speed he must fall upon the arabs unawares like a bolt from the blue they forgot that he who led that expedition was speaking to them now they were with him in the obscure depths of the undergrowth surging against gigantic barriers of fallen treetrunks twenty thirty feet high they were marching behind him like him at grips with nature in a sixweeks struggle of life and death and when finally he burst into the clearing on the rivers bank the ripple went backwards across the hall and a cheer of relief rang out as though their lives too were saved upon fielding the relation produced a somewhat peculiar effect he was fascinated not so much by the incident described or by the earnestness of the man who described it for with both he was familiar but by the strangeness of the conditions under which it was told this story of africa before these serried rows of white eager faces in this stifling hall where the gaslight struggled with the waning day from the raised platform on which he sat he could see through the open windows away across green fields to where the sun was setting in a clear sky behind quiet yorkshire wolds the combination of circumstances made the episode bizarre to him he was in fact paying an unconscious tribute to the orators vividness clarice paid the same tribute but she phrased it differently and the difference was significant she said isnt it strange that he should be here in a frockcoat i half thought the room would dissolve and we should find ourselves at boruwimi fielding started coming from her lips the name sounded strange yet she spoke it without the least hesitation for the moment it had plainly one association in her thoughts and only one it sounded as though every recollection of gorley had vanished from her mind oh he must get in she whispered clasping her hands upon her knees after drake had concluded mallinson moved a resolution he spoke fluently fielding remarked and with a finished phrasing the very finish however imparted an academic effect he was besides hampered by the speech which had preceded his the audience began to shuffle restlessly they were capping a rich burgundy with vin ordinaire and found the liquor tasteless to the palate fielding perceived from certain movements at his side that clarice shared in the general restlessness she gave an audible sigh of relief and patted her hands with the most perfunctory applause when her husband sat down you are staying with mr drake at the three nuns she asked turning to fielding only till tomorrow i leave by the nighttrain oh you are going back yes you see drake and burl are both here somebody must keep the shop open if its only to politely put the customers off he interpreted the look of surprise upon mrs mallinsons face yes i have been gradually sucked into the whirlpool and he laughed with a nod towards drake she turned to him with her eyes shining and you are proud of it fielding smiled indulgently thats a womans thought but you dont deny its truth clarice said nothing more until the meeting had terminated and the party was in the street they walked from the town hall to drakes hotel clarice and fielding a few paces behind the rest the first words which she spoke showed to him that her thoughts had not altered their drift yes you have changed she said and implied unmistakably for the better you only mean laughed fielding that i have given up provoking you no no she said besides you evidently havent given that up then in what way i shall offend you i can hardly think so well you were becoming a kind of say it paul pry to a gentleman whose ambition it had been to combine the hermits indifference to social obligations with an indulgence in social festivities the blow was a cruel one and the more cruel because he realised that clarices criticism contained a grain of truth he hit back cruelly drake tells me he thinks of taking a place here i suppose he means to marry i believe he does replied clarice promptly mrs willoughby fielding stopped and apostrophised the stars that is perfectly untrue he said he walked on again as soon as he perceived that he had stopped adding with a grumble i pity the woman who marries drake why asked clarice in a tone of complete surprise as though the idea was incomprehensible to her and she repeated insistently why well he said inventing a reason i think he would never stand in actual need of her clarice drew a sharp breath a sigh of longing it seemed to her companion as for something desirable beyond all blessings he continued in the tone of argument and she would come to know that surely she would feel it yes but feel proud of it perhaps replied clarice proud of him just for that reason all her womans tricks she would know useless to move him nothing she could do would make him swerve oh yes she would feel proud proud of him and proud of herself because he stooped to choose her she corrected the ardency of her voice of a sudden it dropped towards indifference at all events i can imagine that possible they were within fifty yards of the hotel and walked silently the rest of the way at the door however she said turning weary eyes upon fielding and think the repose of it for her ah here you are the robustious voice of captain le mesurier sounded from the hall look here to fielding we are going to take you back with us drake wont come hes tired so we dont miss him fielding protested vainly that he would crowd the waggonette besides he had business matters to discuss with drake before he left for london well you can talk them over tomorrow you dont go until tomorrow night and as to crowding the waggonette i have ordered a trap here so you can drive it back again tonight if you like from garples otherwise well be happy to put you up you must come we want to talk to you particularly mallinson will drive his wife in the trap so therell be plenty of room the party in the waggonette consisted of captain le mesurier burl fielding and five country gentlemen belonging to the district clarice riding some yards behind them through the dark fragrant lanes saw eight glowing cigars draw together in a bunch the cigars were fixed points of red light for a little then they danced as though heads were wagging retired this side and that and set to partners a minute more and the figure was repeated cigars to the centre dance retire set to partners a laugh from the captain sounded as though he laughed from duty and mr burl was heard to say not too subtle old man you know at the third repetition the captain bellowed satisfaction from a full heart and mr burl cried capital the country gentlemen could be understood to agree in the commendation whence it was to be inferred that the dance of the cigars was to have a practical result upon the election clarice however paid no great attention to the proceedings in the waggonette she was almost oblivious to the husband at her side the night was about her cool with soft odours wrapping her in solitude love at last veritably possessed her so she believed it had invaded her last citadel tonight that it sat throned on ruins she had no eyes to see it sat throned in quiescence and that was enough clarice in fact was in that compressed feverheat of the mushroom passions which takes on the semblance of intense and penetrating calm and her very consciousness of this calm seemed to ally her to drake to give to them both something in common she was troubled by no plans for the future she had no regret for anything which had happened in the past the vague questions which had stirred her why had she been afraid of him was the failure of her marriage her fault for these questions she had no room she did not think at all she only felt that her heart was anchored to a rock chapter xiv given a driver who is at once inexperienced and shortsighted a fresh horse harnessed to a light dogcart a dark night and a narrow gateway and the result may be forecast without much rashness mallinson upset his wife and the cart just within the entrance to garples luckily the drive was bordered by thick shrubs of laurel so that clarice was only shaken and dazed she sat in the middle of a bush vaguely reflecting that her heart was anchored to a rock and yet her husband had spilled her out of a dogcart between the incident and her state of mind immediately preceding it she recognised an incongruity which she merely felt to be in some way significant fielding and captain le mesurier picked her out of the bush before she had time to examine into its significance all she said was its so like him yes hang the fellow said the captain and under his breath he launched imprecations at all those writer chaps mallinson raised himself from a bed of mould upon the opposite side of the drive and apologised captain le mesurier bluntly cut short the apology why didnt you say you couldnt drive i cant whos ashamed of it you might have broken your wifes neck i might and my own too replied mallinson in a tone not a whit less aggrieved captain le mesurier raised his eyes to the heavens with the apoplectic look which comes of an intense desire to swear and the repressive presence of ladies will you kindly sit on the horses head until you are told to get up i want the groom to help here he said as soon as he found words tolerable to feminine ears a groom was already occupying the position designated but he rose with alacrity and mallinson silently took his place and sat there until the harness was loosed fieldings visit however had another consequence beyond the upsetting of a gig a few days later an epigram was circulating through the constituency the squires passed it on with a smack of the tongue it had a flavour to their thinking which was of the town the epigram was this lord cranston lives a business life of vice with rare holidays of repentance but being a dutiful husband he always takes his wife with him on his holidays from the squires it descended through the grades of society lord cranston at the close of a speech was invited to mention the precise date at which he intended to end his holidays believing that the question sprang out of an objection to a donothing aristocracy he answered with emphatic earnestness the moment i am returned for bentbridge the shout of laughter which greeted the remark he attributed at first to political opposition subsequently however a sympathiser explained to him delicately the true meaning of the question and as a countermove lord cranston made a violent attack upon empire building plus finance he drew distinctions between governing men and making money drake accepted the distinctions as obvious platitudes but failed to see that the capacity for one could not coexist with the capacity for the other he asserted on the contrary that money was not as a rule made without the exercise of tact and some aptitude for the management of men he was consequently not disinclined to believe that moneymaking afforded a good preliminary lesson in the art of government lord cranstons argument in fact did little more then alienate a few of his own supporters who having raised themselves to affluence felt quite capable of doing the same for the nation on the night of the pollingday captain le mesurier brought his houseparty into bentbridge to dine with drake and after dinner the ladies remained in the room overlooking the street while the gentlemen repaired to the town hall where the votes were being counted it seemed to clarice as she gazed down that all the seven thousand electors had gathered to hear the result announced the street was paved with heads as with black cobblestones occasionally some one would look up and direct now a cheer now a shout of derision towards the three nuns or the yellow boar but the rooms of both candidates were darkened and the attention of the crowd was for the most part riveted upon the red blinds of the town hall for clarice the time limped by on crutches she barely heard the desultory conversation about her she felt as if her life was beating itself out against those red windows a clock in the marketplace chimed the hour of nine she counted the strokes with a sense of wonder when they stopped she seemed to have been waiting for a century across the street she could see the glimmer of a light summer dress in lord cranstons apartment it moved restlessly backwards and forwards from one window to the other now it shone out in the balcony above the street now it retired into the darkness of the room clarice gauged lady cranstons impatience by her own and experienced a fellowfeeling of sympathy during this suspense she thought you and i ought to be together as the thought flashed into her mind her husband spoke to her she set a hand before her eyes and did not answer him she realised that she had been thinking of herself as drakes wife on the instant every force within her seemed to concentrate and fuse into one passionate longing if only that were true she felt the longing throb through every vein she acknowledged it she expressed it clearly to herself if only that were true and then in a second the longing was displaced by an equally passionate regret it might have been she thought again her husband spoke to her she turned towards him almost fiercely and saw that he was offering her a shawl she steadied her voice to decline it and turned back again to the window but now as she looked across the street she was filled with a new and very bitter envy the woman over there had the right to suffer for her suspense at last the clock doled out ten strokes with a grudging deliberation and less than five minutes later the shadow of a man was seen upon one of the red blinds in the street below the people surged forward there was a running flash of white as their heads were thrown back and their faces upturned to the hall and the shouts and cries swelled to a babel tearing the air the blind was withdrawn the window thrown open clarice could see people pressing forward in the room they looked in the glare of yellow light like black ninepins a gleam of bright scarlet shot out from amongst them and the mayor stepped on to the balcony above the archway the tumult died rapidly to absolute silence a silence deeper than the silence of desolate places because one saw the crowd and ones ears were still tingling with the echo of its shouts it was as though all sound all motion had been arrested by some enchantment and in the midst of that silence one word was launched down the street drake the announcement of the numbers was lost in the sudden renewal of conflicting shouts clarice made no effort to ascertain them that one word drake filled the world for her the very noise in the street came to her ears with a dull muffled sound as though it had travelled across a wide space and it seemed no more than an undertone to the ringing name she saw stephen drake come forward and give place to his opponent and after a little the street began to clear the number thirtyfive incessantly repeated by the retiring crowd penetrated to her mind and informed her of the actual majority in about half an hour a little stream of people trickled from the porch of the town hall and gathering in volume flowed into a narrow passage which led to the conservative club a few yards to the right of the hotel clarice caught a glimpse of drakes face at the head of the procession as he passed under a gaslamp above the mouth of the passage and was surprised by its expression of despondency a fear sprang up in her mind that some mistake had been made in the announcement but the fear was dispelled by the tone of her uncles voice as he shouted an invitation to some one across the street to join them at the club it was a tone of boisterous exultation there could be no doubt that drake had been elected and she wondered at the cause of his dejection a few minutes later a second stream flowed along the opposite pavement towards the liberal club in the market square and drew most of the remaining loiterers into its current the noise and bustle grew fainter and died away the lights were extinguished in the houses and only one small group clustering excitedly about the passage relieved the quarter of its native sleepiness clarice turned with a certain reluctance into the room it was empty and the voices of her companions rose from the hall below she did not follow them however there was time enough for the party could not leave until captain le mesurier returned from the conservative club she went back to her post through the open window opposite to her she perceived the glimmer of a light dress in the dark of the room but it was motionless now a fixed patch of white clarice experienced a revulsion of pity for lady cranston what must be her thoughts she asked herself she remained at the window until the party from the club emerged again from the passage and turned towards the hotel clarice heard her husbands voice asking where drake was and what in the world was the matter with him captain le mesurier replied and the reply rang boisterously hes behind hes a bit unstrung i fancy and reason enough too after all his work eh you see drakes not in the habit of taking holidays and the captain grew hilarious over his allusion across the street clarice saw the light dress flutter and move abruptly it was evident that lady cranston had heard and understood the words drake followed some few minutes later and alone he walked slowly to the hotel with an air of utter weariness as though the springs of his activity had been broken a moment after he had entered it she heard him ascending the staircase and she drew instinctively close within the curtains he pushed open the door walked forward into the embrasure of the window and stood within a foot of clarice apparently gazing into the street a pale light from the gaslamp over the front door flickered upon his face it was haggard and drawn the lips were pressed closely together the eyelids shut tightly over the eyes a white mask of pain or was this the real face clarice wondered and that which he showed to the world the mask she was almost afraid to move she even held her breath suddenly the echoes of the street were reawakened drake roused himself and opened his eyes a small group of people strolled out of the marketplace and stopped in front of the yellow boar there was interchange of farewells a voice said encouragingly better luck next time and one man entered the hotel in the room opposite a match flared up and lady cranston lit the gas she stood for a moment underneath the chandelier in the full light listening then she walked quickly to the mirror above the mantelpiece and appeared to dry her eyes and cheeks with her handkerchief she turned to the door almost guiltily just as it opened lord cranston advanced into the room and his wife moved towards him the whole scene every movement every corner of the room was visible to clarice like a scene on the stage of a theatre it was visible also to drake clarice could note the disconsolate attitude of lord cranston the smile of tenderness upon his wifes face she saw lady cranston set her arms gently about his neck and her lips move and then a low hoarse cry burst from drake at her side it sounded to her articulate with all the anguish and all the suffering of which she had ever heard there was a harsh note of irony in it too which deepened its sadness it seemed almost an acknowledgment of defeat in the actual moment of victory a recognition that after all his opponent had really won the cry was a revelation to clarice it struck her like a blow and she started under it so that the rings of the curtain rattled upon the pole drake bent sharply towards her she caught a gleam of his eyes in the darkness then with a catch of his breath he started back clarice heard the click of a matchbox the scraping of a lucifer and drake held the lighted match above his head you he said clarice moved out from the curtain and confronted him she did not answer and he did not speak again clarice was in no doubt as to the meaning of his cry his eyes even in that unsteady light told it to her only too clearly and this was the man whom she had believed to stand in no need of a womans companionship the thought at the actual moment of its occurrence sent a strange thrill of disappointment through her she had built up her pride in him so confidently upon this notion of his independence and having built up her pride she had lived in it using this very notion as her excuse and justification she ran no risk she had felt clarice the name was shouted impatiently from the hall and came to them quite audibly through the halfopened door but neither she nor drake seemed to hear it they stood looking silently into each others eyes at last she began to speak and as she spoke her sense of disappointment diminished and died she became conscious again of the suffering which his cry had confessed the contrast between this one outburst and his ordinary selfcontrol enforced its meaning upon her it seemed still to be ringing in her ears stretched out to a continuous note and her voice gradually took a tone as of one pleading for forgiveness i did not know she said i always thought of you as and she gave a queer little laugh as driving about london in hansoms and working quite contentedly i never imagined that you cared at all really i mean as i know now even right at the beginning that afternoon in beaufort gardens i never imagined that indeed i was afraid of you afraid drake echoed the word with an accent of wonderment yes yes afraid i believed that i should mean so little to you that i should be of no use or help to you and thats why i i married drake straightened his shoulders with a jerk as clarice uttered the word he became aware of the telltale look in his eyes and lowered them from the girls face to the ground you mustnt fancy he began in a hesitating tone you mustnt misunderstand i was thinking what men owe to women thats all thats all indeed and how vilely they repay it that way like cranston he nodded in the direction of the house across the street or worse or worse he clung to the word on a lift of his voice as though he found some protection in it as though he appealed to clarice to agree with and second him or worse the match burned down to his fingers and he dropped it on the floor and set his foot on it once in the darkness he repeated or worse with a note almost of despair and then he was silent clarice simply waited she stood feeling the darkness throb about her listening to the sharp irregular breathing which told her where drake stood in a few moments he stirred and she stretched out her hands towards him but again she heard the click of a matchbox and again the thin flame of light flared up in the room clarice her name was shouted up a second time there was a sound of quicker footsteps upon the stairs the door was flung back and sidney mallinson entered the room drake lighted the gas we have been waiting for you said mallinson to his wife i couldnt think where you had got to and he glanced from her to drake i have been here all the time she said with a certain defiance mallinson turned and walked down the stairs again without as much as a word to drake clarice followed him and after her came drake ah here you are said captain le mesurier now were ready drake you are coming back with us drake hesitated you said you would at the town hall so i have had your bag packed and put in the waggonette very well he assented and the party went outside the hotel now how shall we go asked the captain mallinson you of course in the waggonette and he chuckled with a cheery maliciousness clarice will you get in no she said with an involuntary vehemence the idea of driving back wedged in amongst a number of people listening to their chatter and forced to take her share in it became suddenly repugnant to her i would rather drive in the trap if i might very well but who is to drive you captain le mesurier turned to drake you can drive of course drake replied absently i have driven the coach from johannesburg to pretoria ten mules and a couple of ponies and a man beside you swinging a sixtyfoot lash captain le mesurier laughed out then therell be no upset tonight come along the guests took their seats while drake stood on the pavement come along drake shouted the captain from the box seat of the waggonette drake roused himself with a start i beg your pardon he said and he went to the side of the dogcart he drew back when he saw clarice already in it and looked from cart to waggonette i am so sorry he said in a low voice i was not listening i am afraid he mounted beside her whipped up the horse and drove ahead of the waggonette they passed out of the town into the open country behind them the sounds of wheels grew fainter and fainter and died away in front the road gleamed through the night like a white riband the hedgerows flung out a homely scent of honeysuckle and wild roses above the stars rode in a clear sky to clarice this was the perfect hour of her life all her speculations had dropped from her she had but one thought that this man driving her cared for her as she cared for him it was in truth more than a thought she felt it as a glory about her accidentally as the trap swung round a bend of the road she leaned her weight upon his arm and she felt the muscles brace beneath his sleeve the sensation confirmed her thought and she repeated her action deliberately and more than once she had but one wish that this drive should never end that they should go forward always side by side through a starlit night in a stillness unbroken by the sound of voices and that wish was more a belief than a wish they ascended the slope and came out upon an open moor it stretched around them dark with heather as far as they could see the night covered it like a tent it seemed the platform of the world clarice suddenly recollected her old image of the veld and she laughed at the recollection as one laughs at some queer fancy one has held in childhood across the moor the wind blew freshly into their faces drake quickened the horses paces and clarice imagined a lyrical note in the ringing beat of its hooves the road dipped towards a valley a stream wound along the bed of it and as they reached the crest of the moor they could see below them the stars mirrored in the stream upon one of the banks a factory was built and its six tiers of windows were so many golden spots of light like the flames of candles drake stopped the trap and sat watching the factory night and day he said night and day there is no end to it it is the law he spoke not so much dispiritedly but rather as though he was teaching himself a lesson which he must needs surely get by heart he lifted the reins and drove down the hill past the factory and along the valley to the gates of garples there he stopped the trap again for a moment clarice fancied that the gates must be shut but as she bent forward and looked across drake she saw that they were open she turned her eyes to her companion he was sitting bolt upright with an unfamiliar expression of irresolution upon his face and he was doubtfully drawing the lash of the whip to and fro across the horses back clarice felt that her life was in the balance yes she whispered no drake almost shouted the word he turned the horse through the gates and drove in a gallop to the door of the house clarice heard him draw a deep breath of relief as he jumped to the ground as he was pulling off his gloves in the hall clarice brushed past him and ran quickly up the stairs he was roused from his reverie by the arrival of the rest of the party clarice sent word downstairs that she was tired and would not appear at supper but an hour later sidney mallinson found her seated by the open window she had not even taken off her hat or gloves once or twice he seemed on the point of speaking but she faced him steadily and her manner even invited his questions mallinson turned away with the questions unasked but he lay long awake that night thinking and his resentment against drake gained new fuel from his thoughts the frankness of his wifes admiration for drake had before this awakened his suspicions and the suspicions had become certain knowledge he guessed too that to some degree drake returned his wifes inclination and he began immediately on that account to set a higher value upon the possession of her than he had lately done once clarice heard him laugh aloud harshly he was thinking of the relationship in which he had set drake to himself in that first novel which he had written actually the relationship was reversed no not yet he said to himself but it would be unless he could hit upon some plan the day was breaking when his plan came to him chapter xv the next morning drakes seat at the breakfast table was empty he caught the early train from bentbridge captain le mesurier explained business i suppose he told me last thing yesterday night that he had to go clarice coloured and lowered her eyes to her plate mallinson noticed her embarrassment and took it for evidence of some secret understanding between her and drake he became yet more firmly resolved to put his idea into action you are not in a hurry said captain le mesurier you had better stay the week out mallinson saw his wife raise her head quickly as though she was about to object and immediately accepted the invitation parliament would not meet for three weeks he reckoned since there were still the county members to be elected clarice spent the week in defining the relationship in which she and drake were henceforth to stand towards each other they were to be animated by a stern spirit of duty by the same spirit in fact which had compelled drake to courtmartial gorley in africa and subsequently to detail the episode to her duty was to keep them apart she came to think of duty as a row of footlights across which they could from time to time look into each others eyes clarice felt that there was something very reassuring and protective in this notion of duty it justified her in buying a copy of froufrou which lay upon the bookstall at bentbridge railway station and in studying it continuously all the way from bentbridge to london she was impelled to purchase it by a recollection that drake had first been introduced to her at a performance of that play and his criticisms returned to her thoughts as she read the dialogue the play had seemed true to him the disaster inevitable given the particular characters and she bore the qualification particularly in mind there was a difference between froufrou and a woman animated by a sense of duty a difference of kind rather than of degree sidney mallinson remarked the book which she was reading but he made no comment whatsoever the next morning he paid a long call upon the editor of the meteor meanwhile drake was devoting himself to the business of the matanga company with an assiduity unusual even for him fielding discovered that he seldom left the city before ten at night and felt it incumbent to expostulate with him you cant go on like this for much longer you know you had better take a rest theres no need for all this work there is replied drake i want to clear off arrears because i am not sure that i oughtnt to go out again to matanga you see i can do it quite easily parliament meets in a fortnight to vote supplies it will adjourn its thought three weeks later i could leave england in september and get back easily in time for the regular sessions but why should you go at all asked fielding you havent been back a year as it is i know said drake slowly but it seems to me that it would inspire confidence and that sort of thing if one of us were out there as much as possible you see thanks to you and burl i can leave everything here quite safely and he returned to his desk as though the discussion was ended a week later he received an invitation to dinner from mr le mesurier and the invitation was so worded that he could find no becoming excuse to decline it the dinner was given the note stated in order to celebrate his victory at bentbridge fielding and he went together and when they arrived they found mallinson taking off his coat in the hall where have you been all this time asked fielding i havent seen you about at clapham replied mallinson i dont know it its a suburb to the southwest thats why my mother lives there i am very sorry the words might have been intended to convey either an apology or an expression of sympathy with his mother mallinson preferred to take them in the former sense i took my wife down there he continued she wanted more quiet than one can get in london fielding noticed however that clapham quiet had not materially benefited mrs mallinson he commented on her worn appearance to mrs willoughby when they were seated at the dinnertable she has been staying she tells me with her husbands people replied mrs willoughby i fancy she finds them trying clarice was placed next to drake upon the opposite side to mrs willoughby and out of earshot and was endeavouring to talk to him indifferently you never take a holiday i suppose where are you going this year she asked to matanga said drake matanga oh no the words slipped from her lips before she was able to check them i think that my place is there returned drake at all events for the moment i shall go as soon as the house rises i thought you didnt mean to leave london again one gets over ideas of that kind after all my interests lie in matanga and one gets a kind of affection for the place which makes your fortune the recantation was uttered with sufficient awkwardness but clarice was too engrossed in her own thoughts to notice his embarrassment do you remember when i first met you she asked it was at a performance of froufrou i remember quite well said he i was rather struck with the play i have been reading it lately drake started at the significant tone in which the words were spoken really he said with an uneasy laugh what impressed me was that scene at venice where gilberte and de valras read over the list of plays in the paris newspapers and realise what they have thrown away and for how little it seemed to me the saddest scene i had ever witnessed yes interposed clarice quickly but because paris and its theatres meant so much to them i remember what you said that everything in the play seemed so true just to those characters gilberte and de valras she glanced at him as she uttered the last name drake understood that she was drawing a distinction between him and the fashionable lounger of the play besides she went on dropping her voice gilberte left a child behind her her unhappiness turned on that in a way no doubt but the loss of friends station home counts for something for enough to destroy her liking for de valras at all events for de valras insisted clarice he was not worth the sacrifice she paused for a moment and then continued diffidently theres something else i hardly like to tell you it you wouldnt notice it from seeing the play i didnt but it came to me when i read the book i think the plays absolutely untrue yes even to those characters in one respect and whats that asked drake clarice glanced round her neighbours she perceived were talking mrs willoughby was too far off to hear she dropped her voice to a yet lower key and said they make the husband kill the lover in the duel its always the end in books and plays but really the opposite of that would happen drake leant back in his chair and stared at her what do you mean hush she said warningly and turning away she spoke for a little to the man on the other side of her then she turned back i mean she said if two people really care for one another their love would triumph over everything everything de valras would have killed the husband she spoke with an intense conviction of the truth of what she said but my dear child replied drake you oh you dont really believe that i do she answered you see there are so few people who really care for one another if you find two who do i am sure they would conquer whatever stood in the way the conversation was interrupted to drakes relief by captain le mesurier he rose from the corner of the table to propose the health of the guest of the evening he said that he was proud to be represented in parliament by a man of stephen drakes calibre if there was anything of which he was prouder it was the way in which the election had been fought at bentbridge that election was the triumph not merely of a man or a cause but of a method and that method was honesty and fairplay we never indulged in personalities he continued with shameless sincerity i have always myself been very strong on that point fight of course for all youre worth but never indulge in personalities its a good rule its a rule that helped stephen drake to win his seat we followed it we left the lies for the opponent to tell and he told them but we never did and never will indulge in contemptible personalities the captain subsided to a gentle rapping of forks and spoons upon the table while fielding said pointedly yes captain you deserve your holidays and he emphasised the word the captain caught the allusion and laughed heartily it was evident that he saw no inconsistency between the epigram and his professed method of contesting an election drake replied shortly and the ladies retired mallinson moved round the table and seated himself in the chair which clarice had left do you think of speaking at all during this session he asked i am not quite sure replied drake but i rather think i shall on the colonial vote you see theres firstclass wheatgrowing land in africa quite near to the west coast we import practically all that we use in england well why shouldnt we import it from our own dominions besides the route would be so much safer in times of war unless of course we were at war with france ships could slip up the coast of africa across the bay and into plymouth with much less risk than if they have to sail from the argentines or some place like that i believe if the colonial office could be induced to move in the matter the idea might be carried out what do you think mallinson carelessly assented and returned to his seat for the remainder of the evening drake avoided clarice as he was taking his leave however she came up to him he shook her by the hand and she whispered one word to him matanga drake could not mistake the note of longing in her voice and as he drove to his chambers the temptation with which he had wrestled at the gates of garples assailed him again and with double force he had but to speak he knew and she would come the loneliness of his rooms made the struggle yet harder yet more doubtful he pictured to himself what he had never had a home and he located that home in matanga the arid plain blossomed in his imagination for he saw the weariness die out of clarices face he tossed restlessly through the night until one thought emerged from the turmoil of his ideas fashioned itself into a fact and stood framed there before his eyes he held the future of clarice in the hollow of his hand her fate rested upon his decision and he must decide drake rose and walked out on to the balcony as the dawn was breaking over london a white mist was crawling above the thames he could see a glimpse of the water here and there as the mist shredded he turned to the west and looked towards westminster recollecting how his name and purposes had centred there as though drawn by a magnet but in that clear morning light they seemed unreal and purposeless one immediate responsibility invaded him and contrasted with that his ambitions dwindled into vanities he filled no place he realised which would be vacant unless he occupied it he had to decide for clarice and solely for her drake took up his hat and walked out of london to elm tree hill there gazing down upon its spires asparkle in the early sunlight while the city gradually awoke and the hum of its stirring began to swell through the air he came to his decision clarice belonged to london he did not in matanga she would be content for how long the roughness the absence of her kind and class the makeshift air of transition would soon destroy its charm of novelty every instinct would draw her back to london and the way would be barred whilst for him matanga was a province in which every capacity he possessed could find employment and exercise he would leave england for matanga when this short session was over he would resign his seat and settle there for good for if he stayed in london every step which he took every advance which he made would only add to clarices miseries thus he decided and walked back with his mind at rest without regret for the loss of his ambitions without indeed any real consciousness of the sacrifice which he had it in his thoughts to make thus he decided but as he left his office on the afternoon of the day whereon he was to make his speech in the house of commons fielding rushed up to him with a copy of the meteor look he said and pointed to an article drake took the paper and read the article through his face darkened as he read the article had a headline which puzzled drake for a moment it was entitled the drabious duke and it proceeded to set out the episode of gorleys courtmartial and execution the facts drake recognised were not exaggerated but the sting lay in the suggestion with which it concluded we have no doubt the leaderwriter stated that both the courtmartial and execution were in accordance with the letter of the law but since mr stephen drake is now one of the legislators of this country we feel it our duty to submit two facts for the consideration of our readers in the first place we would call attention to the secrecy in which the incident has been carefully shrouded in the second gorley undoubtedly secured a considerable quantity of golddust now it is perfectly well known that the government of matanga pays a commission on all golddust brought down to the coast we have gone into the matter carefully and we positively assert that no commission whatever was paid in any such plunder during the two months which followed mr drakes return from boruwimi what then became of it we ask our readers to weigh these two facts dispassionately and we feel justified in adding that mr drake would have been quite within his rights in showing clemency to gorley or in bringing him back to undergo a regular trial however he preferred to execute him on the spot he makes me out a thief and a murderer said drake i wonder where he got the story from fielding answered slowly i am afraid that i can throw some light on that i told mallinson some time ago before he was married mallinson exclaimed drake stopping in the street oh you think the article comes from him then he turned to fielding and how did you know of it well said fielding with some hesitation mrs willoughby told me why we neither of us of course knew you very well then mrs willoughby had only just met you and she didnt feel quite certain that clarice ought to be kept in ignorance of the matter so she asked my advice quite so answered drake i understand you thought clarice ought to be informed and you were right i told her of the matter myself no exclaimed fielding ill tell you the whole truth while i am about it i advised mrs willoughby to say nothing but i behaved like a damned cad and told mallinson myself afterwards i had quite another reason for telling him oh never mind broke in drake the question is whats to be done now you must sue the paper of course i was thinking whether i couldnt mention the matter tonight in the house of commons you see it has got into the papers that i mean to speak and perhaps i ought to make use of the opportunity fielding jumped at the idea by jove yes he said i should think in fact the directors of the company will rather expect it they walked together until they reached the corner of parliament street there they stopped i am awfully sorry drake said fielding i behaved like a blackguard drake again cut him short oh i dont see that the thing looked fishy i dont doubt and you werent bound to me in any way goodbye and he held out his hand with a cordial smile goodbye said fielding and they separated on reaching his flat drake was informed that a lady was waiting to see him he crossed the passage and opened the door of his sittingroom mrs mallinson was standing by the window chapter xvi she turned quickly as the door closed and took a step towards the centre of the room drake perceived that she had a copy of the meteor in her hand you have seen this she asked yes he remained by the door with his hand on the knob and you guessed who wrote it i have been told he answered her coldly and quietly i know what you think she replied but its not true i never told him the story he knew it long ago before you went back to matanga before i married him her voice took a pleading tone you will believe that wont you it never occurred to me that you had told him i know in fact who did but even if you had well you had the right to tell him clarice gave a stamp of impatience he is your husband my husband she interrupted and she tore the newspaper across and dropped it on to the floor my husband ah i wouldnt have believed that even he could have done a thing so mean and to add to the meanness of it he went away yesterday for a week i know why now he dared not face me then of a sudden her voice softened but its my fault too in a way she went on he knew the story a long time ago and never used it i dont suppose he would have used it now if i hadnt since your election let him see she broke off the sentence and took a step nearer to drake stephen i meant to let him see drake drew himself up against the door it would be no longer of any service to her he thought if he left england and returned to matanga something more trenchant was needed he reflected again that he filled no place which another could not fill and the reflection took a wider meaning than it had done before yes he said its very awkward that it should all come out just now clarice stared at him in perplexity awkward that it should all come out she repeated vaguely and then with an accent of relief you mean that it will injure the company not so much that the company can run without me quite well now i am certain of it he spoke as though he was endeavouring to assure himself of what he said but it wont hurt you really she exclaimed you can disprove the charges and of course you must i know you hesitate for my sake to bring an action and expose the writer but you must and i dont think she lowered her eyes to the ground you would hurt me by doing that for a moment she was silent drake made no answer and she raised her eyes again to his face you can disprove it oh of course she said with a little anxious laugh that depends he answered slowly upon how much the meteor knows clarice drew back and caught at the table to steady herself once or twice she pressed her hand across her forehead oh dont stand like that she burst out as if it was all true but they cant prove its true exclaimed drake with a trace of cunning in his voice no they cant prove its true but is it clarice stood in front of him her hands clenched drake dropped his eyes from her face raised them again and again lowered them is it she repeated and her voice rose to the tone of a demand yes and he answered her in a whisper clarice recoiled from him with a cry of disgust she noticed that he drew a long breath of relief it seemed like the criminal when his crime is at last brought home to him then all that story she began you told me at beaufort gardens about about boruwimi was just meant to deceive me you talked about duty duty compelled you you would have hanged gorley just the same had you known that he had been engaged to me she began to laugh hysterically it was all duty duty from beginning to end and i believed you heaven help me i came to honour you for it and in reality it was a lie she lashed the words at him but he stood patiently and made no rejoinder i always wondered why you told me the story she continued you felt that i had a right to know i remember and you felt bound to tell me its clear enough now why you felt bound you had found out i suppose that my husband knew she stopped suddenly as though some new thought had flashed into her mind and i came here to give up everything just for your sake oh suppose that i hadnt found you out she stooped and picked up from the floor the torn pages of the meteor she folded them carefully and then moved towards the door drake opened it and stood aside clarice went out called a hansom and drove home when she arrived there she ordered tea to be brought to the drawingroom and sat down and again read the article in the meteor when the tea was brought she ordered it to be taken into sidneys study she walked restlessly about that room as though she was trying to habituate herself to it a green shade lay upon the writingtable which her husband was accustomed to wear over his eyes she took it up looked at it for a little and then threw it down again with an air of weariness and distaste a few minutes later percy conway called and was admitted chapter xvii fielding opened his newspaper the next morning with unusual eagerness and turning to the parliamentary reports glanced down column after column in search of drakes speech the absence of it threw him into some consternation he tossed the newspaper on to the breakfasttable and rose from his seat as he moved however he caught sight of drakes name at the beginning of a leader and he read the leader through it dealt with the accusation of the meteor and expressed considerable surprise that drake had not seized the opportunity of denying it in the house of commons it was mentioned that drake had not been seen there at any time during the course of the evening fielding jumped to the conclusion that he had met with an accident and set out for his chambers on the instant he found drake quietly eating his breakfast only half the table however was laid for the meal the other half was littered with papers and correspondence while a pile of stamped letters stood on one corner i was expecting you said drake quietly why what on earth has happened asked fielding why didnt you speak last night i thought it would be the wisest plan to leave the matter alone but you cant exclaimed fielding read this and he handed to him the newspaper you cant leave it alone i can and shall replied drake and he returned to his breakfast but my dear fellow you cant understand what that means read the leader then drake glanced quickly down it now do you understand it means utter ruin utter disgrace unless you answer this charge and answer it at once you will have created a false enough impression already drake however made no response beyond a shrug of his shoulders but good lord man continued fielding your names at stake you cant sit quiet as if this was an irresponsible piece of paragraphwriting you would have to resign your seat in parliament your connection with the matanga company everything you couldnt possibly live in england do you think i havent counted up precisely what inaction is going to cost me interrupted drake look here and he took a couple of letters from the pile and handed them to fielding one was addressed to the whip of his party and the other to the directors of the matanga concessions and i leave charing cross at ten oclock this morning fielding looked at his watch it was halfpast nine then you mean to run away he gasped but in heavens name why for an obvious reason yesterday i believed that i could meet the charge but something has happened since then and i know now that i cant fielding started back do you mean to tell me as man to man that the accusations true as man to man repeated drake steadily i tell you that it is true fielding stared at him for a minute then he said drake youre a damned liar we havent much time said drake and i would like to say something to you about the future of the matanga settlement you will take my place i suppose you can and ought to and he entered at once into details on administration the advice however was lost upon fielding once he interrupted drake how many white men were with you on the boruwimi expedition he asked four answered drake and he gave the names they are dead though two died of fever on the way back one was killed in a subsequent expedition and the fourth was drowned about eighteen months ago off walfisch bay a noise of portmanteaux being dragged along the passage penetrated through the closed door drake looked at his watch and started to his feet i must be off he said i am late as it is you might do something for me and that is to post these letters but man you are not really going drake for answer put on his hat and took up his stick goodbye he said but look here do you ask me to believe that you would have been giving me all this advice if you had really done what that infernal paper makes you out to have done ill give you a final piece of advice too give up philandering and get married with that he opened the door and went out and a few seconds later fielding heard the sound of his cabwheels rattle on the pavement drake on reaching charing cross found that he had more time to spare than he had reckoned he was walking slowly along the train in search of an empty compartment when from a window a few paces ahead of him a face flashed out and as suddenly withdrew the face was conways and drake felt that the sudden withdrawal meant a distinct desire to avoid recognition he set the desire down to the unrepulsed attack of the meteor and since he had no inclination to force his company upon conway he turned on his heel and moved towards the other end of the train he was just opposite the archway of the bookingoffice when a woman heavily veiled and of a slight figure came out of it at the sight of drake she came to a dead stop and so attracted his attention then she quickly turned her back to him walked to the bookstall and slipped round the side of it into the waitingroom drake wheeled about again conways head was stretched out of the window and he was gazing towards the bookstall drake was in no doubt as to who the woman was and he felt his heart turn to stone he walked quickly back until he reached conways compartment it was empty save for him but there was a reserved label in the window holloa said conway awkwardly enough are you going by this train you had better find a seat if you are but im not said drake i thought of going but i have changed my mind he leaned against the door of the carriage chatting incessantly to conway with an eye upon the waitingroom once he saw the woman appear at the door but she retired again meanwhile conways embarrassment increased he said goodbye to drake at least halfadozen times but on each occasion drake had something new to say to him at last the whistle sounded and the train began to move i say cried drake running along by the carriage my luggage is in the van you might bring it back with you from dover if you will and he stood watching the train until it disappeared under the shed then he walked into the waitingroom he saw clarice seated in a corner and went straight to her she noticed that his face was white and set and she rose with some instinct of defiance i owe you an apology he said abruptly the meteor is untrue from the first word to the last i mean to stay in london and fight it yesterday afternoon i told you lies why she asked sheer lunacy said he and he got into a cab and drove to the offices of his solicitor chapter xviii meanwhile fielding picked up the pile of letters from the table in drakes chambers and went down into the street he paused for a moment or two at the pillarbox weighing the letters in his hand then he slipped them into his pocket and hurried to mrs willoughbys mrs willoughby was moving restlessly about the drawingroom as he was shown in she turned impulsively towards him holding out both hands i so hoped you would come she said well you have seen him yes what does he mean to do she asked anxiously taking from a chair a copy of the meteor nothing replied fielding he resigns his seat he gives up his directorship he is leaving england mrs willoughbys first look was of sheer incredulity its impossible she exclaimed i have just returned from his chambers he has started from charing cross already mrs willoughby sat down in the windowseat and her look of incredulity gradually changed to one of comprehension and he took such delight in london she said with a break in her voice just like a schoolboy fielding nodded gloomily i did my best to dissuade him he said i practically told him he was a coward to run away but you know the man he had made up his mind not to face the charge and yet i cant believe its true believe it exclaimed mrs willoughby with a hint of something dangerously near to scorn in her voice i know i know answered fielding still drake pleads guilty he sacrifices everything an established position unusual prospects everything by pleading guilty you see thats the point he has every imaginable inducement to make him face the accusation even if he has only the merest chance of winning and yet he runs away he runs away drake does theres only one inference for the world to draw interrupted mrs willoughby and doubtless he meant the world to draw it but you and i should know him better yes fielding admitted yes he began to walk about the room but whats the reason drakes action if this statement is a libel is the action of a madman a madman yes don quixote was mad even in his century replied mrs willoughby i can give you the reason clarice was with him yesterday afternoon yesterday said fielding why i walked home with drake from the city myself but you didnt go in with him no i left him alone to arrange his speech he meant to mention this very charge mrs willoughby started to her feet then that settles it she said clarice was waiting for him in his rooms oh if you had only gone in with him you remember what i wrote to you that he would lie in the mud if he thought it would save her well that is what he has done clarice came here this very morning and told me what had happened she went to his chambers determined never to return to her husband prepared to sacrifice i give you her words not mine to sacrifice herself her name and for his sake but when she showed him the meteor her suspicions were aroused by his manner and she forced the truth out of him fielding gave a short contemptuous laugh forced the truth out of him she actually told you that and whats more she believes it oh the waste the waste of a man like that upon a doll like her i suppose theres nothing to be done nothing if he wont defend himself our defence wont carry any weight he went on with a change of tone but i dont see what real good he does even to her she goes back to her husband now but next month or next year therell be somebody else yes replied mrs willoughby but i hardly fancy stephen drake would consider that i believe he would feel that he had no right to speculate on what may not happen he would just see this one clear definite immediate thing to do and simply do it she spoke the sentence with a slow emphasis upon each word and fielding moved uneasily it seemed to strike an accusation at him he braced himself to make the same confession to mrs willoughby which he had made that afternoon before to drake but before he could speak it mrs willoughby put to him a question tell me did he seem to mind much no fielding answered with an air of relief his confession was deferred if only for a minute he seemed cheerful enough the last thing he did and he paused for a second was to give me advice about the management of the matanga company thats so like him she said gently then she looked up with a start of interest you are going to take his place she asked he said i ought to i know more about it than the other directors of course they maynt appoint me but i expect they will mrs willoughby was silent she moved away from the window and stood by the fireplace fielding crossed to her drake gave me one other piece of advice he said hesitatingly not about business it concerned me and just one other person he pitched the remark in an interrogative key mrs willoughby glanced quickly towards him with just the hint of a smile dimpling about the corners of her lips fielding found it very difficult to go on but there was one clear definite immediate thing for him to do as well he said before i act on it there is something i ought to tell you he paused for a second and the trouble in his voice perplexed mrs willoughby whom do you think mallinson got his knowledge about gorley from mrs willoughby took a step forward whom why and she gave a little anxious laugh from clarice of course no mrs willoughby looked at him for a moment in silence then she drew back again you told him she asked with a quiet wonder yes fielding nodded but i only told you she said because i wanted your advice what made you tell him there must have been some reason some good reason some necessity no there was no necessity no good reason no reason at all fielding replied doggedly i told him because he stopped abruptly the reason seemed too pitiful for him even to relate well because asked mrs willoughby there was a note of hardness in the utterance fielding raised his eyes and glanced at her face it comes too late he said unconsciously and he was thinking of drakes advice the reason she insisted taking no notice of the sentence the reason i told mallinson at the time when i was always meeting him here mrs willoughby gave a start and because of that she cried yes said he i thought the knowledge might give him a fairer he changed the word a better chance with clarice oh how mean exclaimed mrs willoughby not so much in anger as in absolute disappointment she turned away from him and stood for a little looking out of the window then she said goodbye and fielding took his hat and left the house he went down to the office and was told that drake wanted to see him drake he exclaimed he pushed open the door of drakes private office and the latter looked up from his papers you called me a damned liar this morning he said and you were right fielding dropped into a chair what do you mean that theres not a word of truth in the meteors charges and i am prosecuting the editor did you post those letters fielding pulled them out of his pocket and threw them on to the table thanks said drake thats fortunate fielding did not inquire into the cause of drakes change of purpose and it was some while before he understood it for mrs willoughby held no further discussions with him in the drawingroom at knightsbridge the end
