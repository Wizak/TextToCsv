 the bird of the difficult eye by lord dunsany observant men and women that know their bond street well will appreciate my astonishment when in a jewellers shop i perceived that nobody was furtively watching me not only this but when i even picked up a little carved crystal to examine it no shopassistants crowded round me i walked the whole length of the shop still no one politely followed seeing from this that some extraordinary revolution had occurred in the jewelry business i went with my curiosity well aroused to a queer old person half demon and half man who has an idolshop in a byway of the city and who keeps me informed of affairs at the edge of the world and briefly over a pinch of heather incense that he takes by way of snuff he gave me this tremendous information that mr neepy thang the son of thangobrind had returned from the edge of the world and was even now in london the information may not appear tremendous to those unacquainted with the source of jewelry but when i say that the only thief employed by any westend jeweller since famous thangobrinds distressing doom is this same neepy thang and that for lightness of fingers and swiftness of stockinged foot they have none better in paris it will be understood why the bondstreet jewellers no longer cared what became of their old stock there were big diamonds in london that summer and a few considerable sapphires in certain astounding kingdoms behind the east strange sovereigns missed from their turbans the heirlooms of ancient wars and here and there the keepers of crown jewels who had not heard the stockinged feet of thang were questioned and died slowly and the jewellers gave a little dinner to thang at the hotel great magnificent the windows had not been opened for five years and there was wine at a guinea a bottle that you could not tell from champagne and cigars at half a crown with a havana label altogether it was a splendid evening for thang but i have to tell of a far sadder thing than a dinner at a hotel the public require jewelry and jewelry must be obtained i have to tell of neepy thangs last journey that year the fashion was emeralds a man named green had recently crossed the channel on a bicycle and the jewellers said that a green stone would be particularly appropriate to commemorate the event and recommended emeralds now a certain moneylender of cheapside who had just been made a peer had divided his gains into three equal parts one for the purchase of the peerage countryhouse and park and the twenty thousand pheasants that are absolutely essential and one for the upkeep of the position while the third he banked abroad partly to cheat the native taxgatherer and partly because it seemed to him that the days of the peerage were few and that he might at any moment be called upon to start afresh elsewhere in the upkeep of the position he included jewelry for his wife and so it came about that lord castlenorman placed an order with two wellknown bondstreet jewellers named messrs grosvenor and campbell to the extent of pounds for a few reliable emeralds but the emeralds in stock were mostly small and shopsoiled and neepy thang had to set out at once before he had had as much as a week in london i will briefly sketch his project not many knew it for where the form of business is blackmail the fewer creditors you have the better which of course in various degrees applies at all times on the shores of the risky seas of shiroora shan grows one tree only so that upon its branches if anywhere in the world there must build its nest the bird of the difficult eye neepy thang had come by this information which was indeed the truth that if the bird migrated to fairyland before the three eggs hatched out they would undoubtedly all turn into emeralds while if they hatched out first it would be a bad business when he had mentioned these eggs to messrs grosvenor and campbell they had said the very thing they were men of few words in english for it was not their native tongue so neepy thang set out he bought the purple ticket at victoria station he went by herne hill bromley and bickley and passed st mary cray at eynsford he changed and taking a footpath along a winding valley went wandering into the hills and at the top of a hill in a little wood where all the anemones long since were over and the perfume of mint and thyme from outside came drifting in with thang he found once more the familiar path ageold and fair as wonder that leads to the edge of the world little to him were its sacred memories that are one with the secret of earth for he was on business and little would they be to me if i ever put them on paper let it suffice that he went down that path going further and further from the fields we know and all the way he muttered to himself what if the eggs hatch out and it be a bad business the glamour that is at all times upon those lonely lands that lie at the back of the chalky hills of kent intensified as he went upon his journeys queerer and queerer grew the things that he saw by little worldend path many a twilight descended upon that journey with all their mysteries many a blaze of stars many a morning came flaming up to a tinkle of silver horns till the outpost elves of fairyland came in sight and the glittering crests of fairylands three mountains betokened the journeys end and so with painful steps for the shores of the world are covered with huge crystals he came to the risky seas of shiroora shan and saw them pounding to gravel the wreckage of fallen stars saw them and heard their roar those shipless seas that between earth and the fairies homes heave beneath some huge wind that is none of our four and there in the darkness on the grizzly coast for darkness was swooping slantwise down the sky as though with some evil purpose there stood that lonely gnarled and deciduous tree it was a bad place to be found in after dark and night descended with multitudes of stars beasts prowling in the blackness gluttered at neepy thang and there on a lower branch within easy reach he clearly saw the bird of the difficult eye sitting upon the nest for which she is famous her face was towards those three inscrutable mountains faroff on the other side of the risky seas whose hidden valleys are fairyland though not yet autumn in the fields we know it was close on midwinter here the moment as thang knew when those eggs hatch out had he miscalculated and arrived a minute too late yet the bird was even now about to migrate her pinions fluttered and her gaze was toward fairyland thang hoped and muttered a prayer to those pagan gods whose spite and vengeance he had most reason to fear it seems that it was too late or a prayer too small to placate them for there and then the stroke of midwinter came and the eggs hatched out in the roar of shiroora shan or ever the bird was gone with her difficult eye and it was a bad business indeed for neepy thang i havent the heart to tell you any more ere said lord castlenorman some few weeks later to messrs grosvenor and campbell you arent arf taking your time about those emeralds
