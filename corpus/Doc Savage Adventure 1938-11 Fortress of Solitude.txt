 chapter the strange blue dome it was unfortunate that doc savage had never heard of john sunlight doc savages life work was dedicated to attending to such men as john sunlight preferably before they managed to get too near their goal but doc savage did not hear of john sunlight in time it was also too bad that john sunlight was destined to be the man who found the strange blue dome it seemed from the first that john sunlight had been put on this earth so that men could be afraid of him russia was the first government to become afraid of him it just happened that russia was the first john sunlight wasnt a russian no one knew what he was exactly they did know that he was something horrible with a human body serge mafnoff wanted to give john sunlight to a firing squad serge mafnoff was the russian official who captured john sunlight and prosecuted him before the soviet equiva lent of a court this thing known as john sunlight serge mafnoff said earnestly is incredible and shocking we owe it to humanity to see that he is shot serge mafnoff was an honest earnest idealistic man about john sunlight he was right john sunlight took a silent vow to some day take revenge on serge mafnoff but the jury was soft john sunlight was accused of using blackmail on his superior officers in the army to force them to advance him in rank and that might be only misdirected ambition serge mafnoff knew it was more grim than that anyway john sunlight didnt look the part not when he didnt wish at least he resembled a gentle poet with his great shock of dark hair his remarkably high forehead his hollow burning eyes set in a starved face his body was very long very thin his fingers particularly were so long and thin the longest fingers being almost the length of an ordinary mans whole hand the jury didnt believe serge mafnoff when he told them that john sunlight had the strength to seize any two of them and throttle them to death and would too if he could thereby get the power to dominate a score of mens souls john sunlight went to a siberian prison camp he had never as yet heard of the strange blue dome but he was determined some day to pay off serge mafnoff the prison camp was located on the outer northern siberian coast hundreds of miles of impassable ice and tundra lay south to the north was the arctic ocean and the north pole once each year an icebreaker rammed through to the prison colony with food and more prisoners no one had ever escaped the camp the icebreaker took john sunlight to the siberian camp one august it came back the next august a year later the icebreaker sailed for the camp again this time it did not come back it was two months before the soviets became excited and sent planes to see what had happened they might have saved the gasoline the plane engines burned for they found some piles of ashes where the prison camp had been and nothing else they didnt even find an ash pile to hint what had become of convicts icebreaker and icebreaker crew seven months later john sunlight stepped out on the bridge of the icebreaker and fortysix persons sank to their knees in craven terror this pleased john sunlight he liked to break souls to do his bidding no one had been killed yet the fortysix included the crew of the icebreaker and the convicts for one of the queerest quirks of john sunlights weird nature was that he preferred to control a mind rather than detach it from the owners body with a bullet or a knife the icebreaker had now been fast in the ice for four months it looked very much as if they were all going to die none of them yet knew that the strange blue dome existed civan was john sunlights chief aid civan had helped in the prison camp break it was he who emptied the powder from the guards cartridges working secretly over a period of days civan had fired the camp civan had a streak of sadism in his nature he liked to destroy things he had wanted to destroy the soviet government but he hadnt been in the prison camp for that he had been there for destroying a man whose wife and money he coveted civan was a bestial black ox to look at but he did have a certain amount of brains he had however absolutely no conscience and so that strange and terrible thing john sunlight had picked civan to be his lieutenant queerly too civan feared john sunlight infinitely more than anyone else john sunlight saw to that terror was the rope that john sunlight kept around mens necks the icebreaker drifted trapped in the arctic ice they shot a seal now and then but they slowly starved too women are supposed to be more hardy than men so the two giantesses titania and giantia these were their vaudeville names did not waste away their great muscles retained the strength to open horseshoes and bend silver rubles double giantia and titania their other name was jeeves they were americans they were great women very blond they were amazing women they were a little queer maybe because all their lives men had been scared of them they were such amazons they had gone to russia with a vaudeville act and had been accused of dabbling in a bit of profitable spy work on the side they were quite guilty so the united states government looked the other way when they were sent to siberia titania and giantia were afraid of john sunlight they had never been scared of any other man but they did not worry about john sunlight fifi they worried more about fifi titania and giantia did fifi was their little sister their tiny cute exquisitely beautiful sister fifi had been left in new york fifi was such a nitwitted little sweetykins and they were bothered all the time they were in siberian exile about how she would get along in big wicked new york and they were still worrying about it it did look though as if they had troubles enough of their own two months more and they had surrendered themselves to all being dead in another month but they didnt die because they saw the strange blue dome there was a fog a low fog no more than twenty feet deep and they could stand on the icebreaker upper deck and look out over it so they first saw only the top of the strange blue dome blue whale off the bow the lookout squalled weakly titania and giantia galloped to the upperdeck as if rushing on a vaudeville stage to bend iron bars and do handstands before an audience some of the others had to crawl ten couldnt make it at all john sunlight came walking with slow cold ominousness like a devil in black or a frankenstein or a dracula they shrank away from him and did not forget to sink to their knees they looked at the strange blue dome for a long time and they became very puzzled it was no whale blue or otherwise it was no rock either it was like nothing that should be its height must be all of a hundred feet and there was a shimmering luminance to it that was eerie even if they had not seen it standing as if completely disembodied above a gray carpet of fog generally it resembled the perfectly spherical half of an opaque blue crystal ball of incredible size of course they stood and stared breathing only when they had to the crushing of the icebreaker brought them out of their awed trance the icebreaker hull caved in suddenly there was no warning just a great grinding and screaming of collapsing metal a popping of pulled rivets the feeble screams of the men who had been too weak to come on deck and were trapped get those men out john sunlight ordered he did not want men to die a man dead was a man he could not dominate ten had been below decks they got six out but four had been crushed to death get the bodies out john sunlight directed a spark of awful determination in the eyes that now burned like sparks in the hollows of his dark poetic face they did it shuddering all the while for they knew what he meant there had been no food for days and days not even boiled shoes the ice was piling up against a stone island and this had caused the icebreaker to be crushed they found that out soon the rocky island was as smooth as a great boulder with no speck of soil anywhere no chance of anything green growing they crawled upon it in the fog and it was more bleak and cold and inhospitable than they had believed anything could ever be even after what they had been through they wanted to die except for john sunlight rest he ordered wait and rest he walked toward the strange blue dome it was now lost in the fog john sunlight went slowly seeming to select and plan each step with care for he was weaker than the others he had taken less food than any of them from the first and the reason was that he did not want them to die they were his his toys his tools and he prized them as a carpenter values his best planes and saws only infinitely more so he had given them most of his share of the food to keep them alive that he might dominate them he was sustained now only by the power of the awful thing that was his mind this john sunlight was a weird terrible being at the outer edge of the bleak stone island it seemed to be one great mass of solid gray rock the wind had swept all snow away but farther in there was snow that got deeper and was almost impassable to a man without snowshoes it was doubtful if a strong man of courage wellfed could have struggled through the snow to the side of the strange blue dome but john sunlight did so and stood beside the fantastic thing and made a low growling sound chapter a mans black ghost it was still not too late had doc savage known of john sunlight doc savage had the finest planes and knowledge and courage and scientific skill and he could have reached this arctic rock in time doc savage combination of mental wizard scientific genius muscular phenomena would not have been too late yet for john sunlight could find no way into the weird blue half ball he looked first at the base of the thing but the glasslike blue walls seemed to continue on down into the solid rock john sunlight clawed at the glazed blue it felt as hard and cold as steel he put his face against it and tried to see through the blue substance whatever it was it seemed that he should be able to peer through it the stuff had a certain transparent aspect but he could see nothing next john sunlight made a complete circle of the thing he found no door no window no break of any kind the blue dome was not made of bricks or even great blocks it appeared to be one solid substance of a nature unknown not glass and yet not metal either something mysterious it took a long time to satisfy john sunlight that he could find no door he went back to the others get sledge hammers off the wrecked icebreaker he said coldly the sledge hammers were brought him titania and giantia alone had the strength to fetch them john sunlight took the heaviest sledge stay here his eyes smoldered in the almostblack cups which his eye sockets had become stay here he stood and gave each of them hypnotic attention in turn none of you must ever go near that blue dome he said with stark intensity he did not say what would happen if they disobeyed did not voice a single threat it was not his way to give physical threats no one had ever heard him do so because it is easy to threaten a mans body but difficult to explain how a terrible thing can happen to a mind that kind of a threat would not sound convincing or even anything but silly but they knew when they heard him and he knew too that not one of them would go near the strange blue dome he had not exerted his hideous sway over them for months for nothing it took a longer time for john sunlight to make his way back to the vast blue thing he planted his feet wide and raised the sledge hammer and gathered all his great strength his strength was more incredible than anyone could have imagined even starved as he was and hit the blue dome there was a single clear ringing note as if a great bell had been tapped once and the sound doubtless carried for miles although it did not seem loud john sunlight lowered the sledge hammer examined the place where be had struck he made his growling it was a low and beastly growl almost the only emotional sound he ever made too the bestial growl was almost the only meaty physical thing he ever did otherwise he seemed to be composed entirely of a frightful mind his sledge blow had not even nicked the mysterious blue substance of which the dome was composed john sunlight hit again again and again he was still hitting when the eskimo said something guttural it was a sinister indication of john sunlights mental control that he did not show surprise when the eskimo grunted he did not know what the eskimo had said he did not speak the eskimo tongue and an eskimo was one of the last things he had expected to appear particularly a wellfed round butterball of an eskimo with a happy smile holding a large frozen chunk of walrus meat john sunlight smiled he could smile when he wished how eskimo he said you fella savvy us fella plenty happy see you fella the eskimo smiled from ear to ear then he spoke in the best of english how do you do he said one of my brothers reported sighting you landing from a wrecked ship and stated that he believed you were without food so i brought you some walrus meat john sunlights bony dark face did not change a particle he was not a man who showed what he thought you live close john sunlight asked the eskimo nodded and pointed over there a few hundred yards he said how many eskimos are in your camp inquired john sunlight an even dozen including myself replied the eskimo john sunlight leveled a rigid arm at the strange blue dome what is it he asked the eskimo stared straight at the blue dome and looked faintly puzzled i do not see anything he said john sunlight gave a violent start in spite of the fact that he rarely showed emotion this was different insanity was the one thing he feared insanity that would take away the incredible thing that was his mind he thought for a horrible instant that he was imagining all this that no blue dome was there you do not see a great blue dome john sunlight asked tensely the eskimo shook his head elaborately i see nothing of the kind he said john sunlight took hold of his lip with teeth that were unnaturally huge and white and gave him the aspect of a grinning skull when he showed them what do you see he asked only snow said the eskimo calmly john sunlight moved quickly then he seized the eskimo the eskimo was round and strong and wellfed but he was no match for john sunlights mad strength john sunlight hurled the eskimo against the side of the blue dome the eskimo moaned and fell back to the snow unconscious that must have felt pretty hard for something you couldnt see john sunlight snarled he then dragged the eskimo back to the others along with the large chunk of walrus meat there was not enough walrus meat for everyone so john sunlight divided it among not the weakest this time but the strongest he wanted to make them stronger so they could overcome the colony of eskimos they cooked up the walrus meat and the weak sat back in shaking silence and watched the strong eat although they were starving john sunlight did not eat any himself he was a strange man meantime the eskimo regained consciousness he rolled his little black grape eyes and said nothing he still had said nothing even after john sunlight had kicked in half of his ribs he only lay silent coughing a little scarlet when he could not help it the eskimo had not even admitted that he could see the strange blue dome they had saved rifles off the icebreaker they took those and went to capture the rest of the eskimos the capture was easy enough they merely walked in and presented the rifle snouts for the eskimos inspection and the eskimos after first laughing heartily as if they thought it was one huge joke realized it wasnt and became silent and beadyeyed with wonder there were four igloos very large and fashioned with picturebook perfection from blocks of frozen snow each igloo had a long tunnel for an entrance and along these tunnels were smaller igloos used to store food there were also other very small igloos scattered around in which the dogs slept there were not many dogs what is that blue dome john sunlight asked they stared at him wonderingly what blue dome dont you see it the eskimos all talked like that and it made john sunlight more gaunt and grim until finally to satisfy himself of his own rationality he broke down his order that no white person but himself should go near the strange blue dome he took civan and giantia and titania and some of the others to the dome and made them feel of it made them kick the sledge hammer out of the snow pick it up and each strike a great ringing blow on the mysterious sides of the dome you see it john sunlight asked you feel it dah soodar civan said yes sir said titania and giantia which was the same thing only in english not russian john sunlight thereafter felt much better although there was no visible change in him he knew now that he wasnt demented or seeing something that wasnt there two things were now possible one the eskimos were lying for a reason two they were hypnotized john sunlight knew something of hypnotism knew more than it was good for any man of his kind to know and he soon satisfied himself the eskimos were not hypnotized so the eskimos were lying not lying just not admitting anything john sunlight began breaking them and he found that breaking an eskimo was not as easy as doing the same thing to a white man or woman the eskimos had lived amid physical peril all their lives their minds did not get afraid easily the eskimos got no more food fuel for their blubber lamps was taken from them so was their clothing except for bearskin pants naturally john sunlight seized their weapons six weeks passed john sunlight all those off the icebreaker fared well grew fat the eskimos kept fat too that was mysterious it worried john sunlight the eskimos got nothing to eat and thrived on it it was a human impossibility and john sunlight did not believe in magic he wondered about it and watched the eskimos secretly watched them a lot more than anyone imagined his spare time john sunlight spent trying to get into the strange blue dome he swung the sledge hammer against the blue stuff for hours and bored away with steel drills off the icebreaker and shot a lot of steeljacketed highpowered rifle bullets against the mysterious material the results well he would have had better luck with a bank vault the strange blue dome became a fabulously absorbing mystery to john sunlight he kept on with almost demoniac persistence trying to get into the thing if it had not been for the eskimos staying so fat he might never have succeeded one night an eskimo crawled out of an igloo and faded away in the darkness it was not really dark all the time this being the sixmonth arctic night but they called it night anyway because it was the time when they slept the eskimos had been making a fool of john sunlight he had watched them days and days they were eating they must get food somewhere he had not seen them get it and the reason was simple a long robe of white arctic rabbit when an eskimo crawled away the white rabbit robe made him unnoticeable against the snow this time the eskimo accidentally got a brown hand out of the robe john sunlight followed the eskimo he watched the eskimo go to the strange blue dome stand close beside it saw a great portal swing open in the dome and watched the eskimo step inside to come out later with an armload of something the blue portal closed behind the eskimo john sunlight caught the eskimo clubbed him senseless the stuff the eskimo was carrying looked like sassafras bark food compressed dehydrated food no doubt of that but strange food such as john sunlight had never heard of upon this earth john sunlight stood thinking for a long time he took the eskimos white rabbitskin robe he put it on he stood against the blue dome where the eskimo had stood and the portal opened john sunlight walked into the mysterious blue dome it was now almost too late for doc savage even had he known of john sunlight to prevent what was written on the pages of the book of fate john sunlight vanished for a day two days a week he was not heard of not for two weeks on the second week he was still not heard of but something incredible happened titania giantia civan and some of the others saw an eskimo turn into a black ghost the eskimo who became a black ghost was the one who had vanished when john sunlight disappeared and had not been seen or heard from either it was night that is it was darker night because there were clouds titania giantia civan and the others were wondering what they would do for food now that the supply taken from the eskimo was running low and they were standing on a small drift and discussing it when they saw the eskimo running toward them screaming made them notice the eskimo he was shrieking screeching and running he came toward them suddenly the eskimo stopped he stood facing them his arms fixed rigidly in a reachingouttowardthem gesture his mouth gaped a hole incredibly still he stood he might have been an old copper statue which was greased the next instant he might have been made of black soot the change occurred instantaneously one instant a copper man the next a black one then smoke black smoke flying coming apart swirling away in cold arctic wind spreading fading going mysteriously into nothingness there was no question about it the eskimo had turned into a black smoke ghost and the smoke had blown away now it was too late for doc savage and john sunlight had not forgotten the score he had to settle with serge mafnoff chapter is a diplomat dead serge mafnoff was an idealistic man a fine citizen of the soviet and ambitious all of these facts his superiors in the russian government recognized they kept a kindly eye on serge mafnoff and shortly after he did his fine stroke of work by catching john sunlight and sending him to siberia a reward was forthcoming serge mafnoffs reward was being appointed as an important diplomatic representative to the united states of america with headquarters in new york city it was a pleasant job one an ambitious man would like and serge mafnoff enjoyed it and worked zealously and his superiors smiled and nodded and remarked that here was a man who was worth promoting still again serge mafnoff was very happy in new york city then one evening he ran home in terror actually ran dashed madly to the door of his uptown mansion pitched inside slammed the door and stood with all his weight jammed against the door as if holding it shut against something that pursued him his servants remarked on the way he panted while he was doing that they told the police later how he had panted with a great sobbing fright it was interesting and serge mafnoff had servants who liked to gossip they gathered in the chauffeurs quarters over the garage the most private place and discussed it they were concerned too they liked serge mafnoff everyone liked serge mafnoff he was quite a newspaper figure a fine representative of the type and character of man the soviet is trying to create he was called liking serge mafnoff made what happened that night infinitely more horrible to the servants the house of serge mafnoff in new york city was one long popular with residing diplomats because it had an impressive dignity and a fashionable location and other things that were desirable for a diplomat it was made of gray stone and sat unlike most new york houses in quite a considerable yard of its own in which there was neatly tended shrubbery there were two gates from one gate a driveway led around to the rear where there was plenty of lawn and landscaped shrubbery and the twocar garage with the chauffeurs quarters above the other gate admitted to a walk which led straight to the mansion door the house itself was generally square had two stories and an attic part of which serge mafnoff had walled off and airconditioned for his private study behind the house was a sloping park which slanted down unbroken except for two boulevards to the wide teeming hudson river and the inspiring palisades beyond serge mafnoff screamed in his study every servant in the great mansion heard the shriek and each one of them jumped violently the cook cut the forefinger of her left hand to the bone with the butcher knife so great was her start the finger leaked a thread of crimson for some time thereafter which turned out to be important the scream brought all the servants running upstairs they piled into the study they stopped it was impossible to believe their eyes impossible to comprehend that serge mafnoff could have become a black man serge mafnoff was all black not only his skin his fingernails his eyes his teeth his mouth was open in the most awful kind of a strangling grimace all black that evening he had put on pants and vest of a gray suit and a robe the nationalistic red color of the soviet but these were now the hue of drawing ink a jetblack statue standing the butler moaned the chauffeur made a croaking noise the cooks hand shook and her cut finger showered red drops over the floor comrade mafnoff shrieked the maid who was a communist the black statue turned to a writhing black ghost or so it seemed to the servants the whole man they knew it was serge mafnoff because the features of the allblack statue had been recognizable as his appeared to turn into a cloud of sepia vapor a black ghost it was like it swirled and changed shape a little then came swaying toward them a ghostly disembodied unreal monstrosity straight toward them it floated the cook screeched and threw more crimson over the walls and floor but the chauffeur snatched a pair of heavy pliers out of his hip pocket and hurled them at the black horror the pliers went through the thing and dented the plaster of the opposite wall then suddenly impossibly and before their eyes the black thing silently vanished it did not spread it seemed to fade disintegrate go into nothingness i killed it the chauffeur screamed then the only sound in the room for long moments was the frightened rattling of the breath in their throats the cooks hand dripped they were looking for some trace of serge mafnoff hurting their eyes with looking and seeing nothing i i couldnt have killed him the chauffeur croaked ugh the butler said they were all primed for the next shriek it came from downstairs a mans voice in a long peal of imperative supplication and terror the cook barked out something hoarse and fainted she fell directly in the center of the door just inside the attic den which was serge mafnoffs study the other servants left her lying there and raced downstairs to find out who had given that last scream and what about there was a second bellow just about the time all the servants excepting the unconscious cook reached the ground floor this whoop was out in the back yard and the whole neighborhood heard it out into the back yard dashed the servants to investigate they didnt know what they expected to find certainly it wasnt what they did find which was nothing nothing at all only dark cold night and the gloomy clumps of shrubbery which was evergreen and hence unaffected by the fact that the time was winter crouching black wads of bushes and the sounds of the cityhonking of automobile horns a distant elevated and the bawling of a steamship down on the hudson they searched and searched then they told the police about it the police told the newspapers who printed a great deal about the affair doc savage read the newspapers regularly chapter bronze man attacked not everybody in the world had heard of doc savage but too many had doc savage clark savage jr had of late been trying to evade further publicity and he had an understanding finally with the newspaper press associations with some of the larger newspapers and with most of the factstory magazines extant they werent to print anything about him they were to leave his name out of their headlines now if anyone heard of doc savage it would be by wordofmouth only havent you heard doc savage has invented a cure for cancer they say the surgical and medical skill of doc savage was probably his greatest ability i hear that new wrestler from czechoslovakia is a human hercules built something along the lines of doc savage the physical build of doc savage got attention wherever he appeared for he was a giant although so well proportioned that seen from a distance he resembled a mail of ordinary proportions talk talk there was always plenty of talk about doc savage i hear the man of bronze has invented an atom motor that could drive the queen mary across the atlantic with a spoonful of coal they called him the man of bronze because of the unusually deeptan hue which tropical suns had given his skin they their talk attributed fantastic inventions to him conversation made him a superman a mental colossus really doc savage was a normal fellow who had been taken over by scientists as a child and trained until early manhood so that he was rather unusual but still human enough he had missed the playlife of normal children and so he was probably more subdued conscious that he hadnt gotten everything out of life talk talk it attributed all kinds of fantastic doings and powers to doc savage but it was only talk nobody for instance listening to it could find out exactly where doc savage was at a given time no enemy could listen to the gossip and get enough real information to lay a plan to kill the man of bronze his enemies were many they had to be because his life work was an unusual one that was why he had been scientifically trained he had been prepared from childhood in every possible way to follow a career of righting wrongs and punishing evildoers even in the far corners of the earth a strange career his fathers idea his father who was no longer living his father had located a fabulous source of gold in the central american mountains realized such a wealth should do good and had trained his son clark savage jr doc savage to use the wealth to do good also to use it to right wrongs this was the real doc savage who found it safer not to be too wellknown doc read the newspaper account of what had happened to serge mafnoff the bronze man often spotted unusual wrongs that could stand righting from reading the newspapers doc savage did not know as yet about the man waiting in the lobby ddwnstairs or the other men looking at books in a nearby bookstall doc savage was impressed by the mafnoff thing he was so impressed that he did something which he only did in moments of great mental or physical stress he made a strange exotic trilling sound a note that was created somehow in the throat and which had a low quality of ventriloquism that made its vibrations seem to suffuse the entire surrounding atmosphere the sound was often described as being as eerie as the song of some rare bird in a tropical jungle or like the noise of a wind through an arctic ice wilderness there was nothing spooky or supernatural about this sound doc had acquired it as a habit in the orient where the oriental wise men sometimes make such a sound deep in the throat for the same reason approximately that the rest of us say ohhh i see i see i seeee when understanding dawns doc savage had been seated at a great inlaid table in his reception room he stood up quickly through the windows this was the eightysixth floor of one of the citys tallest buildings an inspiring view of manhattan was visible doc passed through a huge library crammed with scientific tomes and entered a laboratory so advanced that scientists frequently came from abroad to study it the bronze man picked up a microphone in case you wish to get in touch with me he said into the mike it is my intention to investigate the serge mafnoff story which is on the front pages of the newspapers this morning what he said was automatically recorded could be played back at will it also went out on the shortwave radio transmitter doc savage had five assistants in his strange work each of the assistants kept a shortwave radio tuned in on docs transmitter wavelength as much as possible the bronze man then rode his private speed elevator to the lobby he was instantly noticeable when he stepped out in the lobby not only because of his size there was something compelling about his carriage and also about his unusual flake gold eyes calm eyes fascinating like pools of flake gold being continuously stirred the man waiting in the lobby noticed doc instantly the man had been loitering there for hours he was a short man blond with a face that looked somehow starved his story was that he was a process server lying in ambush for one of the skyscraper tenants when he told that he spoke with a pronounced russian accent the instant he saw doc savage this man stepped outside hurried a dozen paces to the door of a small bookstore entered and walked right out again several men who had been pretending to browse over books in the store followed him these men began getting in taxicabs taxicabs always waited in a long string before the skyscraper because it was a good stand the bookstore loiterers took the first four cabs and these pulled away from the curb this left the fifth cab in the line as the next one up the fifth cab was the one they wanted doc savage to take driving this machine was a viciouslooking black ox of a man doc savage had walked out of the building by now having accomplished the job to which they had been assigned the bookstore browsers and the fellow who had claimed to be a process server strolled away doc got in the planted cab drive to the hudson river water front the bronze man directed quietly he had a voice which gave the impression of being infinitely controlled a voice that could do some remarkable things if necessary the cab rolled among the high buildings passed through the less presentable west side tenement section and neared the rumblingly busy street which ran along the hudson here it stopped for a traffic light the window between driver and passenger was open doc savage reached through this he took the black oxlike man by the neck that was an ambitious trick you tried to pull the bronze man said quietly he squeezed the neck trained fingers finding the proper nerve centers the black ox fellow kicked around violently just before he became senseless doc savage got behind the wheel shoving the unconscious passenger over to make room he kept a sharp lookout around about while doing this but saw no sing of more trouble no cars following as an afterthought he got out and examined the taxicab the bronze mans powers of observation had been trained from childhood and he still took almost two hours of complicated exercises each day aimed at developing his faculties he had to notice little things like a man wheeling suddenly and walking from a skyscraper lobby when the bronze man got out of an elevator if be wanted to go on living he saw under the cab floor lashed to the chassis a thick steel pipe which was closed at both ends doc snatched the unconscious man out of the cab carried him and ran away from the machine this was a oneway street he kept in the middle so as to stop any cars that might enter but it was a littleused street and no cars came he waited the explosion was terrific doc stood at a distance from the cab but the blast jarred him off his feet anyway the cab came apart flew up in the air some of the parts going so high that they became small a deep hole opened in the street itself fragments of pavement went bounding along the street after the first slam of the concussion there was a ringing of broken glass falling front windows all over the neighborhood doc savage went away from there in a hurry with his prisoner he had a high honorary commission in the new york police force but there was nothing in it that said he didnt have to answer questions it was obvious of course that the bomb under the cab was attached to a timefiring device which was probably switched on when the driver took his weight off the cushions no doubt the idea had been for the driver to stop somewhere and go in a store to get something leaving doc in the cab to be blown up doc savage carried the captive around the block north two blocks along the hudson water front and reached a warehouse the sign on this warehouse said hidalgo trading company it was an enormous brick building which appeared not to have been used for years it was doc savages hudson river hangar and boathouse doc carried the captive into the warehouse closed the doors put the man down on the floor and did things with his metallic fingers to the mans spinal nerve centers the pressure which was keeping the fellow helpless could be relieved by these chiropractic manipulations doc went through the mans clothing while he was reviving found nothing except a flat automatic pistol the dark ox of a fellow sat up he batted lids over eyes that resembled peeled hardboiled pigeon eggs didnt i come to the end of the chain with a bang he muttered that was the first warning in the case of this man it was either one of two things he was too stupid to be scared or he had a brain that could control his nerves and make him wisecrack under circumstances such as this who are you doc savage asked calmly the man did not answer at once he stared at the bronze man steadily when he did speak it was not to answer the question they say no one has ever fought you successfully he said slowly i begin to believe that looking at you now doc noticed the mans rather strong russian accent a tkooda vy preeshlee doc asked yes i dont doubt that you would like to know where i come from the man said but lets speak english he frowned at the giant bronze man and could not keep a flicker of terror from his eyes you spoke that russian with no accent at all he muttered they say you can talk any language in the world doc said we are not discussing what you have heard the subject is why did you try to kill me the man shook his dark oxlike head were discussing he said whether i had better talk or tough it out talk doc said threatening me no doc said quietly it is becoming apparent that you are not the type of man who can be frightened readily the remark it was merely a statement of truth as far as doc savage was concerned seemed to shock the prisoner his big white teeth set in his lips and unexpected horror jumped briefly into his eyes you dont know john sunlight he croaked doc watched him john sunlight the man swallowed several times and forced the terror out of his eyes no no you misunderstood me he said i said you dont know so you lie what i meant is that you are trying to kid me along telling me im brave its a buildup doc said why did you and the man hit him the fellow hit hard and he was strong but the bronze man got his shoulder up and the fist hit that instead of his jaw then he fell on the man they stormed around on the floor the man began to scream in agony why did you try to kill me doc repeated my name is civan the man began civan sat up on the floor inched back a few feet from doc savage and felt over his bruises wincing as his fingers touched the places that hurt two or three times he peered at the bronze man as though puzzled and trying to fathom where such incredible strength came from i was the strongest man in my part of russia civan said stupidly doc said why try to kill me the man with the long nose hired me to do it civan said who eli camel was the name he gave me civan said he was a tall man bowlegged as if he had ridden horses in his youth he had a high forehead a mouth with no lips and there was his nose of course it was very long and kind of loose on the end like an anteaters nose doc savage had never heard of an eli camel who had a long nose but then he had never heard of many men who might want to kill him voice unchanged doc said what did this eli camel want to kill me for he did not say civan said he just gave me twenty thousand dollars and i agreed to get rid of you then he sailed for south america yesterday what about those other men the ones who saw to it that i took your taxicab i hired them who are they civan shook his head i wont tell you theyre not important theyre just men i hired to help me doc savage did not pursue that point eli camel of the long nose sailed for south america you say doc asked yesterday what boat the amazon maid that is all you know doc asked thats all doc savage went to the telephone he knew there was a steamer on the south american run named the amazon maid be knew what line owned her he called their offices when he explained who he was he got service without delay yes the steamship line official told him a man named eli camel sailed yesterday on the steamer amazon maid for south america radio the captain of the amazon maid doc savage directed and learn if the sea is calm enough for me to land a seaplane alongside his vessel and be taken aboard well do that ill call you for the information later doc said civan stared at the bronze man youre going after eli camel civan demanded what does it sound like doc asked quietly doc savage went next to a shortwave radio transmitter receiver outfit he had them scattered around at almost every convenient point for himself and his associates used that means of communicating almost exclusively monk doc said into the microphone the answer came in a squeaky voice that might have belonged to a child or a midget yeah doc it said doc savage spoke rapidly and ill a calm voice using remarkably few words to tell exactly what had happened and to give monk instructions hold on monk squeaked let me get this straight you started out to investigate this serge mafnoff mystery yes and this guy civan tried to kill you and youve caught him and hes in the warehouse hangar now and you want me and ham and johnny to drop by and pick him up exactly doc do you think theres a connection between the mafnoff thing and this attempt on your life doc savage did not answer the question that was one of the bronze mans peculiar habits when he did not want to reply directly to a query he simply acted as though no question had been asked pick up this civan doc said then go on out and investigate the mafnoff mystery ummm monk said wherell you be doc at that point the other telephone there were several lines into the place rang and doc said a moment monk and answered the other instrument listened for a time said an agreeable thank you and hung up monk the bronze man said the line that owns the amazon maid just called and said the sea was calm enough for a plane to land alongside the steamer and be lifted aboard with a cargo boom oh monk said so thats where youre going to get that eli camel who hired this civan doc asked you will be here shortly monk shorter than short monk said this terminated the radio conversation doc savage tied civan securely with rope and left him lying in the middle of the hangar floor lashed to a ring embedded in the concrete the bronze man walked to a seaplane a number of aircraft stood in the hangar including a small dirigible but the ship he selected now was small sturdy and designed for landing on bad water rather than for speed or maneuverability in the air he started the plane motor taxied out on the river fed the cylinders gas the craft got up on the step lifted into the air and went droning away and lost itself in the haze over the atlantic ocean civan lay on the hangar floor and swore long strings of very bad russian words chapter the unwilling idol men do things because of love always without exception some men love to work so they work others love the things money will buy so they work to get the money there are men who love to loaf and loaf slaves did not love to be beaten so they worked in order that they wouldnt get beatings doc savages five assistants loved excitement and adventure and that bound them to the bronze man monk particularly monks looks were deceptive he was one of the worlds greatest industrial chemists when he took time off from his adventuring to putter around with test tubes and retorts he looked rather like something that had been dragged out of a jungle tree recently startling near as wide as he was tall with arms longer than his legs too much mouth small eyes a furry coarse reddish hair he looked like a large ape you look said ham like something an expedition brought back it dont worry me monk grinned ill bet it worried your mother ham grinned ham was brigadier general theodore marley brooks who practically supported the fanciest tailor in the city with his patronage who carried an innocentlooking black cane which was really a swordcane and who was also admittedly one of the cleverest lawyers to come from harvard listen monk said you keep on ridin me and ill take you by the neck and shake a writ a petition and a couple of torts out of you any time ham glared you gossoon if these two had ever spoken a civil word to each other it was an accident they drove past radio city and picked up major thomas j long tom roberts who had been hired as consultant on an intricate problem having to do with television they found a group of eminent electrical engineers staring at long tom roberts in amazement no one would stare at long tom because of his looks he was a scrawny fellow with complexion ranging between that of a fish belly and an uncooked mushroom so they must be admiring his brains they were long tom had just pulled an electrical rabbit out of a hat monk ham and long tom arrived at the warehouse on the hudson water front drove their car inside got out and listened in amazement to civans swearing none of them understood russian but they could tell that civan was doing some very good work with words that were unlikely to be in the russian dictionaries when civan ran dry they read a newspaper account of how serge mafnoff the diplomat had apparently turned into a black ghost and vanished very mysterious long tom commented i believe im going to like looking into it ham remarked then i wont like it monk said contrarily first they settled the question of what to do with civan drown him monk suggested tie ham to him for a weight throw em in the river thats very funny ham sneered ill bet i come nearer solving this mystery than you do you see what i mean monk told long tom hams opinion of himself is heavy enough to hold them both under water they compromised by taking a hypodermic needle from an equipment case in the warehouse hangar and injecting a harmless chemical concoction in both of civans legs and both his arms they waited several minutes until the chemical took effect thereafter civan could not move his arms or legs he could only talk and he did so giving detailed opinions of them monk picked civan up and sat him in various places and civan remained there he could not stir he sat stiffly resembling an ugly image made out of dark meat kind of like an unwilling idol monk commented only a little noisy they loaded civan in their car and drove uptown to the home of serge mafnoff vanished diplomat their credentials got them through the ring of police guards around the place how much have you learned they asked the police are you gonna start that too the cop demanded sourly then we are to take it youre mystified look around the cop invited were always willing to learn well watch they questioned the servants they got a bloodcurdling haircurling description of the black ghost which serge mafnoff had become nothing else they pulled on rubber shoes and entered the attic study where the mystery had happened the room was about thirty feet long a little over half as wide with a large gable window at each end and small doors on each side these doors admitted to the unused part of the attic windowless and dark theres been rats and mice running around here monk poked a flashlight beam over the rafters and sills in the unused part of the attic you can see their tracks in the dust yes the cop said we found mouse and rat tracks too your tone monk said sourly insinuates that im not gonna find anything you havent the cop grinned ive always heard monk mayfair was a whiz he said im waiting around to see a whiz working monk did nothing to justify the cops expectations in the attic study in fact they succeeded in confusing the issue a trifle this happened when monk put the pliers the same pliers the chauffeur had thrown through the black ghost of serge mafnoff under a microscope huh monk squinted at the pliers thats strange he took a file and rasped a nick in the pliers then looked through the microscope at them again yep he decided i was right right about what long tom asked the metal of these pliers monk said is strangely crystallized the cop said what do you mean crystallized monk addressed the chauffeur asking have you been in the habit of using these pliers regularly sure the chauffeur said theyre my favorite pliers do any hammering with em monk inquired of course look monk said he tapped the pliers with his file and they broke into several pieces it was as though they were as brittle as glass why thats funny the chauffeur gulped they turned up nothing else in the attic study so they shifted attention to the scream which had been heard behind the house first they gave the back yard and the alley a thorough search but all they got out of this was a good deal of exercise at squatting and peering blast it monk complained the cop said im still waitin for you guys to do somethin to live up to your reputations when they stood inside the house later and the cop was not with them monk confided to ham that cop is gettin in my hair goin around makin cracks hes beginnin to think im stupid the cop probably cant help it ham said after looking at you im gonna show im up monk squeaked he cant make a rnonkey out of me if hed put you in a tree ham said unkindly id hate to try to tell the difference monk grumbled and stalked around peering in unlikely places for clues he was in tile kitchen when the cop came up to him look the cop said im gonna have to help you out a little whiz you dont need to bother we found this the cop interrupted in the back yard the article the policeman presented was a novelty pencil a combination of pencil and tiny flashlight and the clip which was designed to hold it in the pocket had been broken off close to the barrel the clip had not come unsoldered it had broken off none of serge mafnoffs servants admit owning it the cop explained and it didnt belong to mafnoff monk took the pencil with bad grace ill examine it for fingerprints weve already done that the cop said and found none ill do it scientifically monk said monk had little confidence in the pencil as a clue he carried it carelessly as he went back and joined the others and he was thoroughly astounded when civan gave a violent croak pointed his popping eyes at the pencil they had set civan on the floor where hed remained helpless but occasionally quite noisy that pencil civan ejaculated where did you find it the cops found it in the back yard monk replied what about it civan said if i wasnt in this too deep to help myself i wouldnt tell you but i saw eli camel with a pencil something like that hold it closer eli camel was the man who hired you to kill doc eh monk asked and held the pencil close to civans eyes yes civan said thats eli camels pencil monk exploded then eli camel was probably the man who screamed in the back yard here right civan agreed and now hes on the steamer amazon maid bound for south america monk squatted in front of civan and asked the man quite a number of questions but added nothing to the plain fact that civan knew this pencil had belonged to eli camel the mysterious man with the long nose monk was much pleased he permitted himself to gloat now ill show that cop im not as dumb as i look he chortled he went looking for the cop monk found the cop gaping in admiration at him ham was saying the man you want is named eli camel he is tall bowlegged has a high forehead a long nose and he is on the steamer amazon maid headed for south america you learned all that the cop gasped you bet ham said amazing the cop exclaimed delightedly the cop then looked at monk and sniffed if you had lived up to your reputation shortandhairy he said youd have dug up something important like mr ham brooks here monk glared at ham glory hog monk howled you knew i was tryin to impress this cop this was the beginning of a wrangle of some duration between monk and ham seven other policemen were guarding the serge mafnoff diplomatic residence the guarding consisting of turning back curious people who had read the newspaper stories and wanted to have a look at the house and possibly play amateur detective two officers stood at one end of the street two at the other end one was stationed at the northern extremity of the alley one at the southern extremity and the seventh watchman roved over the grounds they were surprised when two large touring cars rolled up stopped and a group of men alighted the newcomers wore plain blue suits and had rather grim faces their spokesman confronted the cops were special plainclothes men from the district attorneys office he growled were to take over here but the d a isnt satisfied with the progress youve been making on this the newcomer snapped there was never a great deal of love lost between the regular police and special detective squads in this case the uniformed cops were secretly enthusiastic about the idea of turning the serge mafnoff case over to specials they were glad to pass the buck the case was a lemon utterly baffling luck be with you the uniformed cops said and betook themselves away the leader of the special plainclothes men from the district attorneys office beckoned his men together his whisper was a hasty hissing them cops will find out we lied to em he said weve got to move fast cant move too fast to suit me a man muttered get civan the leader snapped rescue him thats the most important then wipe out these three doc savage aids rescue civan a man repeated then croak the savage helpers now that they all understood they separated quickly taking up positions at various points around the grounds of the serge mafnoff residence inside the house monk was still lambasting the dapper lawyer ham but the homely chemist was beginning to run out of breath you know what a lawyer is monk yelled im not interested ham said a lawyer monk roared is a guy who persuades his client to strip for a fight then runs off with the clients clothes monk always bellowed when he got excited normally his voice was a mouse among voices but when he became agitated or got in a fight his howling was something remarkable monk stopped for breath and all light disappeared chapter the grim black world all light disappeared nothing else quite described it although it might have been said that the serge mafnoff house and its immediate surroundings abruptly and inexplicably became trapped in intense blackness one moment it was a sunlight day moderately bright the next instant everything was blacker than black hams first thought was that monk had hauled off and knocked him cold and that the blackness was unconsciousness you hairy hooligan he yelled he heard his own voice so he knew he wasnt senseless has something grabbed you monk demanded shut up ham said embarrassed can you see anything no monk said that is i can see black they could all see black and nothing else they lifted their hands before their eyes and discerned not the slightest vestige of their presence their first involuntary impulse was to try to feel of the blackness for it was so intense that it seemed solid but it wasnt for their fingers touched nothing more tangible than air then their eyes began stinging its some kind of black gas yelled long tom the electrical wizard but that was wrong because they smelled nothing and tasted nothing monk let out a frightened howl he had remembered something remembered the way they had been told that serge mafnoff had turned into a black ghost of a figure maybe weve turned into them black ghosts monk shouted the terror of that held them spellbound until civan laughed it was an ugly delighted muchrelieved laugh that tore across civans lips that laugh was the wrong thing for civan to do probably he couldnt help it but it shocked monk ham and long tom back to a grip on common sense grab that guy long tom yelled monk sprang upon civan i got im ham said we better lock the door i dont know what this is about but i ham never would have spoken another word then except that he wore a bulletproof undergarment of alloy chain mesh doc savage and all his men wore them habitually for they were light enough not to be uncomfortable they were also knifeproof a knife blade struck hams chest skidded on the chain mesh ruining his expensive coat and vest ham grabbed the knifewielders wrist held it tightly twisted and turned an arm broke the attacker started screaming and kept screaming almost continuously fighting was suddenly all through the room fist blows the grrit of knife blades striking chain mail and shots the shots were deafening a voice crashed out in mayan gas masks it ordered put them on it was doc savages voice mayan was the littleknown language which doc and his men spoke almost no one in the civilized world spoke it besides themselves when they wished to communicate without being understood there was no time to be astonished that doc savage had turned up in the middle of this weird black melee he had a habit of appearing unexpectedly anyway the gas masks they carried were simple gastight goggles springwire nose clips and breath filters something like overgrown police whistles which they held in their mouths they were effective enough providing you didnt snort off a nose clip or get a filter knocked out of your mouth or down your throat the goggles were nonshatterable however doc savage called where is civan in mayan monk took out his breath filter long enough to say also in mayan here doc went toward monks voice and straight into violent turmoil the assailants apparently every one of them in the room had charged toward monks voice probably because it was so distinctive when monk said something in a fight there was no doubt about who said it monk barked painfully hit or kicked his breath filter clinked against a wall monk fell down he felt a powerful wrench on civan so monk let civan go he thought doc had taken the man monk was plenty willing to turn him loose he wanted to fight there was no more shooting but there was everything else blows furniture breaking someone tore the rug up with a ripping sound and plunged with it upsetting people doc savage broke anaesthetic gas grenades the stuff was extremely potent and abrupt it would make a man unconscious almost invariably in less than a minute but it didnt this time it had absolutely no effect except that monk stopped howling and hitting and went to sleep falling heavily the assailants wore gas masks evidently they wore more than that doc began to have an ugly suspicion his fight efforts were too futile his senses his muscles were trained he should be able to fight in the dark as well as the next man the attackers apparently could see in the blackness and doc couldnt nor his men doc savage plucked the breath filter from his lips and ordered get into the next room quick without taking gascharged air into his lungs he put the filter back he got down felt and found monk he dragged monk to the door of the next room long tom and ham were already in the next room doc joined them they banged the door and doc found a key and turned it upstairs he said taking the filter out of his mouth briefly they rushed across the room through a door found the stairs up these they went behind them there was a crashing as the locked door was caved in at the top of the first flight of stairs doc said go on his men went on doc flipped a small highexplosive grenade down the stairs he wore a padded vest which was mostly pockets to contain the gadgets came a crack of an explosion crashing and splintering was mixed in with the blast and the lower half of the stairs came to pieces and fell down a considerable number of bullets came lip the stairway during the next three or four minutes then the strange attackers went away after a while it was suddenly daylight again daylight brought stillness it just had to what had happened was so eerie so impossible that it left an aftermath of shocked awe sunshine slanted in through the windows somewhere out in the shrubbery a bird emitted a frightened cry in the distance city traffic still rumbled and farther away there was a ghostly undulating whining noise police sirens the walls of the room in which doc savage stood were papered blue the ceiling was cream the carpet was very dark blue and the furniture upholstered in plush monk lay on the floor at docs feet and snored around about was some debris which had flown up from the blasted stairs doc held a long thin telescoping periscope at the door and saw no one was now at the foot of the stairs lower half of the stairway was a complete wreck scalable only with a ladder long tom and ham were peering cautiously around an upper landing where they had taken shelter they came down i thought you hid civan ham exclaimed doc savage shook his head slightly our own lives were more important but they could see in that blackness the bronze man said they concentrated on rescuing civan then they were going to turn their attention to getting rid of us we got away just as they started the last the tension of shocked awe subsided ham and long tom began to think of rational questions ham pointed at monk is he hurt considering how the two quarreled hams anxiety over monk was surprising he got some of the anaesthetic gas doc explained oh ham felt of his own person for damage he groaned at the rip in his expensive suit you havent had time to go to the amazon maid doc the bronze man shook his head slightly the amazon maid story was a gag gag to send us off on the wrong trail how did you figure that ham demanded civan doc said was too eager to explain about a longnosed man named eli camel and the amazon maid moreover his tongue slipped once he mentioned someone named john sunlight john sunlight the unknown quantity so far doc savage started mounting the stairs toward the attic he explained instead of flying to the amazon maid i watched this place from a house across the street to see what would happen doc savage reached the attic looked out of the windows they gave the best available view of the neighborhood there was no sign of their late assailants they had fled successfully they brought monk up to the attic administered a stimulant and when the fogging effects of the anaesthetic gas had been knocked out of the homely chemists brain he sat up and made noises then asked a question the question uppermost in the minds of ham and long tom what was the black monk demanded they all looked at doc savage if there was to he an explanation it would have to come from the bronze man monk ham and long tom were utterly at a loss then they stared in amazement at the bronze man his face they had never seen quite such an expression on his face before it was something stark queer they could not at first tell what it was then they knew that the bronze man was feeling an utter horror doc monk gasped what is it doc savage seemed to get hold of himself with visible effort then he did a strange thing he held both hands in front of him and made them into tense metallic fists he looked at the fists they trembled a little from strain finally he put the fists down against his sides and let out a long breath it cannot be anything but what i think it is he said his voice had a hollowness such a macabre quality that the others were too startled to put questions they had never before seen the bronze man this disturbed they knew now that he would not answer questions they watched him pick up the fragments of the pliers which had broken in such a brittle way when monk tapped them with the file microscope doc asked monks pocket magnifier had remained miraculously unbroken he handed it over and doc examined the bits of shattered steel crystallized he said which also seemed to be what be had expected next he gave attention to the unused part of the attic the portion that was dark and windowless just mouse and rat tracks in there monk volunteered the bronze man examined the mouse tracks closely and gave the homely chemist a shock some of the rat tracks doc pointed out are impressed in the wood huh they were probably made by small pieces of metal driven into the underside of boards the boards having been laid on the rafters probably the metal bits were to disguise the fact that boards had been laid on the rafters for someone to stand upon monk swallowed as he digested this you mean somebody hid in there apparently doc savage went next to the entrance of the attic study where his interest centered on the crimson stains now dried left by the mafnoff cook who had fainted they understood when the shriek was heard downstairs there were two sets of the dark stains two stains doc remarked indicate the cook might have been moved while unconscious monk eyed the stains one in front of the door the other to one side until docs meaning dawned on him hey monk exploded somebody was hiding in the attic the scream downstairs drew the servants away whoever was in the attic fled moving the unconscious cook out of the way ham said but why go to all of the trouble of moving the cook perhaps the one who fled was carrying a heavy burden doc said slowly they could not get him to elaborate on this remark chapter big women the police came so there naturally had to be extensive explanations with much of the explaining devoted to making the police comprehend that the whole chain of events had happened if there had been a shooting or a stabbing the police would have accepted the fact that a crime had been committed but this case was unusual it was incredible a noted diplomat serge mafnoff had vanished under since he had apparently turned into black smoke impossibletobelieve circumstances a stranger with a russian accent that was civan had come to doc savage and tried to kill him wait a minute the police captain said whyd they try to kill you that can be part of the mystery doc said the attack on the serge mafnoff home to rescue civan the police could grasp that but they couldnt grasp the strange blackness that had clamped down on the neighborhood it was as bad as serge mafnoff turning into black smoke it was impossible it couldnt have happened and there must be a catch somewhere doc savage left the representatives of the law with their headache the bronze man monk ham and long tom went to their cars they had two machines one that doc had driven and the automobile used by his three men all three associates it developed wanted to ride with doc and discuss the mystery but someone has to drive the other car doc reminded let the gossoon do it ham suggested pointing at monk well draw lots monk said promptly which was wasted effort because when they drew monk lost anyway monk seated himself grumblingly at the wheel of the second car and drove all alone in the wake of doc savages machine because the mystery they were embroiled in was so fantastic so far that it completely confused him monk decided to keep his mind off it by thinking about something else he thought about ham he tried to dope out a new insult to throw at ham ham was proud of his harvard background his membership in certain exclusive clubs he often boasted to monk that he was one of the four hundred four hundred monk snorted he comes nearer hem one of the fiftyseven varieties thinking up verbal spears to stick in ham was always an absorbing pastime with monk he grew completely occupied with the avocation he paid no great attention to following the others they were all enroute back to headquarters anyway monk fell behind and entirely lost sight of the other machine containing doc long tom and ham on a very deserted street a shabby old sedan suddenly cut in front of monks car and the result was a resounding crash both machines came to a stop monk craned his neck blast women drivers he grumbled er that is he took another look to see if the woman was pretty and she wasnt yeah blast em monks car was one of doc savages special machines body of armor steel wheels of punctureproof sponge rubber and it had not been damaged the other car had not fared so well not one woman but two got out of the other car they came striding toward monks machine looking apologetic gosh monk said he was seeing two of the biggest women he had ever glimpsed in his life not fat women big two herculean females not badly proportioned but built with at least a triple or quadruple measure of everything woe is me monk gasped and hurriedly rolled up the bulletproof glass car windows however when he heard the two feminine titans saying how sorry they were he rolled down one window were awfully sorry one female tower said you bet we are the other added their voices were distinctly feminine but as might be expected had tremendous volume well monk said of course your car suffered the most one big woman reached suddenly and got monk by the hair she held him search im giantia she said the other female tower went through monks pockets slapped the places where men generally carry guns monks squawking and writhing didnt seem to bother her nothin on im titania she said giantia released monks hair simultaneously giving him a shove in the face this skidded monk over to the middle of the seat one giantess got in on monks left the other on his right and they closed the car doors monk howled now look here both big women put their arms around monk but they werent hugging exactly they were squeezing monk heard his joints cracking felt his breath whistle between his teeth and thought his eyes were going to pop out when they released him the argument was all squeezed out we used to wrassle a bear in one of our acts giantia said so we know how to handle you titania looked at monk speculatively only youre more like a baboon she decided monk felt of his neck tenderly i can see im gonna like you two he muttered giantia started the engine backed up turned and drove away it was evident to monk that the two remarkable big girls intended leaving their own wrecked machine and taking him somewhere whats the idea he asked fearfully giantia said were gonna make you tell us where we can find john sunlight john sunlight monk questioned whats that some guys name dont kid us giantia thundered no titania rumbled dont kid us we saw you goin around takin care of civan we know youre one of his pals shut up giantia roared well tell you when to talk and youll talk then plenty i bet titania boomed that he knows john sunlight grabbed our little sister fifi and is holdin her to make us keep our mouths shut sure exclaimed giantia i bet he knows it all i bet he knows about the strange blue dome an everything betcha he knows we only promised to throw in with john sunlights an help him so we could get back to new york an take care of little fifi monk started off to do some roaring of his own fifi be danged he got a slap that made his ears sound as though they contained steamboat whistles dont you talk that way about fifi giantia thundered dad blast my kind of luck monk grumbled as a driver giantia belonged decidedly to the barney oldfield school when the speedometer needle got below fifty it seemed to bother her monk was confronted with amazement as he watched speed cop after speed cop let them go by with never an attempt to halt them or even to follow then he remembered that the car carried the special doc savage plates which entitled the machine to make its own speed laws the destination seemed to be no particular place just any remote spot where there was a thick growth of concealing trees monk began to have a grim suspicion that they were seeking a locality where his screams of agony would not be heard there has been a little mistake he ventured uneasily your mistake titania said was in being born judgin from his looks giantia added there was a mistake somewhere monk squirmed and debated mentally over the things he could do jumping out of the car was certainly not one of them since the machine was now doing seventyfive im one of doc savages crew monk explained earnestly the two giantesses were puzzled but not impressed doc savage never heard of him titania said monk swallowed this pill of surprise persons who had not heard of doc savage at least through rumor were becoming scarce who is he giantia demanded there was a subject on which monk could wax eloquent he had a sincere admiration for the bronze man which very fact probably saved him a great deal of grief on the present occasion his sincerity was expressed in his voice so effectively that giantia and titania were impressed they stopped the car now tell us that again giantia ordered doc savage monk said is a man whose business is shooting other peoples troubles he was trained from childhood for the job i know it sounds queer but its a fact monk waved eloquent he had a bill of goods to sell and he suspected it was rather imperative that he sell it ham the silvertongued lawyerorator could have taken lessons from monks speech to the two herculean women monk left out very little docs scientific training physical ability his five assistants monk touched on it all with an earnestness that was completely effective strong man eh titania muttered with an unmistakable gleam of interest yep monk said how big did you say titania asked bigger than you are monk assured her titania sighed you know she remarked ive never met a man i could fall er that is a fellow who is as big as i am monk took a deep breath doc he said has never been able to find a girl quite his own equal either doc would probably exile him for that remark if the bronze man ever found out about it titania and giantia were obviously intrigued they exchanged glances which monk had no trouble reading correctly maybe titania said thoughtfully this doc savage is the man to rescue fifi from john sunlight he sure is monk exclaimed quickly we know all about this john sunlight and the strange blue dome and everything giantia said doc will sure be glad to get the information monk declared earnestly giantia stopped the car turned it around and headed back toward new york city you tell us where to go she ordered monk monk was expecting a sensation when he ushered giantia and titania into the presence of doc savage ham and long tom he was not disappointed ham sprang up and dropped the sword cane whats this ham gasped little present i brought you monk explained he felt of his neck which still ached then an idea hit him he nudged giantia and titania called their attention to ham when we rescue fifi monk said you want to watch this shyster ham hes a ladykiller from way back giantia strode to the astonished ham gave him a shove and ham sailed back and fell over a chair that giantia said is just a sample of what youll get if you make one single sheep eye at fifi wuhwuh was the best the astounded ham could do giantia and titania suddenly lost interest in ham they were looking at the man of bronze they stared not exactly with their mouths open but with almost its equivalent doc savage wore tan trousers and a matching tan shirt which was open at the neck and the effect of his metallic figure seemed unusually striking his vitality strength size and the quality of unbounded power which was somehow a part of his personality were impressive giantia glanced at monk you aint the liar i thought you was she said monk performed introductions ham retreated to the other side of the reception room and acknowledged the introduction from that safe distance and titania and giantia were left with nothing to do but stare at doc savage which they proceeded to do with enthusiasm your accent indicates you have been speaking russian recently doc savage said there were some slight indications that already giantia and titania were beginning to make him uncomfortable women made doc uncomfortable rather easily monk said doc these two young women know all about this infernal mystery they know all about civan and some guy named john moonbeam john sunlight titania interrupted suppose they tell us about it doc suggested titania nodded its a long story it began in russia where where we got mixed up in a spy racket were caught and sent to siberia interposed giantia who seemed anxious to do any talking that was to be done to doc savage we were sent to siberian exile where we we met john sunlight put in titania who seemed to have the same idea about monopolizing any talk with the bronze man john sunlight organized an escape from the siberian prison camp aboard aboard an icebreaker interpolated giantia and shut up giantia said titania im telling it shut up yourself ordered giantia i can tell it as well doc put in quietly perhaps if we closed the windows there would be less noise to interfere since the headquarters was located on the eightysixth floor there was ordinarily not enough noise to interfere in the least with a casual conversation but just now there was an unusual amount of uproar doc savage stood for a moment at the window listening his interest was caught a plane was flying slowly over new york city at an altitude of at least two thousand feet it was a ballyhoo plane one of the type that had a great aerial loudspeaker or probably a battery of them mounted in the cabin their openings downward such a plane could fly a mile in the air and someone speaking into a microphone aboard it could make words heard by an entire city a ballyhoo plane over new york city was an unusual sight there was an antinoise ordinance against them this one was talking this is fifi it kept saying over and over giantia and titania please do not tell doc savage anything it was a womans voice chapter quest for fifi the idea of a ballyhoo plane flying over the city warning someone not to talk to doc savage was preposterously fantastic yet effective too more effective than newspaper advertisements or any other quick way of giving warning doc whipped the double soundproof windows shut but he was too late what was that titania shouted she flung the windows open again giantia jumped to the window too the two big women listened this is fifi said the voice from the sky giantia and titania please do not tell doc savage anything giantia and titania stared at the ballyhoo plane with stark intensity and horror came over their faces fifi titania gulped fifis voice john sunlight has her in that plane moaned giantia they stood there listening as if hypnotized until the plane reached the far side of the city and banked around and came back the ballyhoo craft was sweeping back and forth covering the entire metropolis doc said go ahead with the story of john sunlight giantia and titania looked at him with their lips tight we cant tell you anything now giantia said hoarsely john sunlight would kill fifi titania added it was plain they had no intention of continuing with any story fears for their little sisters safety had silenced them completely doc turned to monk how much did they tell you before you got here monk scratched his bullet of a head not much doc the homely chemist admitted they did say somethin about a thing they called the strange blue dome the what docs face became frozen metal the strange blue dome monk explained or so they called the homely chemist stopped speaking swallowed for doc savage had spun and flung into the library the bronze man snapped the library door shut behind him then did nothing more exciting than stride to one of the great windows and stand stiffly staring into the hazy northern sky docs sinewcabled arms were down as rigid as bars at his sides and his powerful hands worked slowly clenching and unclenching he was doing something that none of his men had ever seen him do before he was taking time out to get control of himself had his men seen they might have guessed the reason they were clever men each one a headliner in his chosen profession probably they would have realized that doc savage knew more about the strange blue dome than any of them dreamed he knew monk ham long tom none of docs men had ever heard of any such thing as the strange blue dome but doc knew of it obviously knew so much about it that he was shocked more profoundly than his men had ever seen him shocked before by the mere mention of the strange blue dome in connection with this mystery strangest of all doc savage seemed to be blaming himself for what was happening doc went back into the other room ham he said you and long tom watch these two women giantia and titania ham had no liking for that task he gulped a hasty but monk and myself are going after that ballyhoo plane doc said aw ok ham grumbled monk grinned derisively at ham touched his hand to his forehead in a boyamllaughingatyou gesture then monk followed doc savage into the big laboratory they wended through long tables laden with intricate glass and metal devices many cabinets stood filled with chemicals doc opened a wall panel disclosing a steel barrel several feet in diameter there was a door in this which he opened he stepped through into a bulletshaped car which was wellpadded and traveled through the steel barrel driven by compressed air when monk got in there was little room to spare closing hatches doc pulled levers which tripped the air pressure on there was a shock a whining noise and the vibration of great speed then they were jammed against the lower end of the cartridgelike ear as air cushioned it to a stop holding devices clicked and a red light came on doc and monk stepped out in the bronze mans hudson river waterfront hangar boathouse monk ran for the plane which stood nearest the water sprang in got the propeller turning over hey doc he yelled aint you comin doc savage said you go after the ballyhoo plane alone monk monk didnt understand why doc wanted to remain behind but he was not displeased the prospect of chasing the ballyhoo plane maybe an aerial dogfight intrigued monk keep your radio cut in doc called monks arm shot up to acknowledge that he gunned the plane down into the water the craft was an amphibian when it got close to the big doors it cut a photoelectriccellandbeam device which caused the doors to open monks plane scudded across the river and was in the air about the time the hangar doors were closing doc savage was already in a car in the hangar he kept a car in the hangar for emergency use and it was one of his fully equipped machines the car had among many other gadgets a very good radio directionfinder a finder that could cover the entire band of ether wavelengths doc turned the tuning dial slowly changed wave coils kept on tuning carrier wave after carrier wave was picked up as a violent hissing finally doc picked up a transmitter which seemed to be sending nothing but at intervals of two or three minutes an apparently meaningless combination of dots and dashes the bronze man took a careful bearing on that station he started the car drove furiously covered about half a mile and took a second bearing on the transmitter which was sending dotanddash combinations doc watched the ballyhoo plane as he took this second radio bearing the plane was a distant bumblebee against the sky another bumblebee monks ship was wheeling around it the ballyhoo plane changed its course in obedience to the dotanddash signal on which doc was taking bearings the bronze man made his small characteristic trilling sound briefly it had a satisfied quality his surmise had been correct his suspicion that grew out of the fact that fifis voice from the ballyhoo plane was repeating the same words over and over doc drew bearing lines on a scale map of new york city the lines crossed in the section immediately below fortysecond street he drove for the spot only at street intersections could doc savage see monks plane and the ballyhoo ship at other times high buildings hid both craft time after time monk flew around the loudspeaker ship doc was anxious about that at first but monk was cautious he did not get too close to the strange craft this jockeying went on for minutes then it appeared that monk had surrendered caution and was flying very near the other ship monks plane was on the opposite side it seemed to blend with the ballyhoo craft and then a splattering volley of dots and dashes came from the radio transmitter which doc was tracking down with the directionfinder instantly the ballyhoo ship exploded doc saw the flash a flash that jumped in all directions it was like looking at a distant mirror which had unexpectedly reflected sunlight into his eyes the flash faded doc watched the smoke it might have been from an archie shell then came the blast sound a distinct concussion despite the distance and echoes followed bouncing around among the skyscrapers like thunder then monks plane appeared it had been safely beyond the other ship only the distance had made it seem close doc tuned the radio to monks wave length damaged any monk he asked of his own transmitter mike startled out of six years growth monks voice stated shakily you know what doc there was no one in the plane doc said it was being flown by a radio robot the girls voice was coming off a record that was being repeated and they exploded a bomb in the plane with radio control you must be a crystal gazer monk said his distant plane spun down in the sky and swooped in toward the hudson river doc savage reached the spot where as closely as he could judge the radiocontrol transmitter had operated he tried to tune it in again it had been shut off that was not so good the plane might have been controlled from any building within a block doc savage made a quick survey of surrounding buildings their height their position with reference to the spot where the plane had blown up in the sky a smudge of dark smoke still marked that point one tall building it had to be that one it was the only roof that offered a view of the spot where the plane had exploded doc savage drove away two blocks parked and got his makeup case from under the rear seat the bronze man getting out of the fear some minutes later was a large darkskinned man with artistically long black hair nostrils with an almost negroid flare the celluloid nostril inserts did not hamper breathing and added a remarkable touch and a nervous habit of twitching his lips doc carried a leather tool bag which was worn he walked into the lobby of the building he suspected saw no one there entered an elevator when it arrived and said top floor from the topfloor corridor a door gave into a flight of stairs that led up to the roof the door to the stairway was open and a man lounged there obviously a guard he was a thin dark man the lookout stared at doc narrowly the bronze man walked up to the fellow dangling his worn tool bag prominently have you noticed any peculiar smells doc asked the other scowled youve got me there buddy he said smells doc said i am making a building inspection so what you dont understand doc explained patiently there is a chemical firm on a lower floor of this building and it is possible that a leakage of chemicals occurred the chemicals form a gas and it might have risen to the upper floors following the elevator shafts in such a case it would be noticed here or on the roof have you noticed anything not a thing the man said sourly he spoke with a strong russian accent very well doc said the gas may not have reached this high yet or there may not even be any gas at all as yet the bronze man then walked swinging his tool bag and whistling to the stairway opened the door stepped through and left the door ajar a crack he made tramping sounds with his feet so that it would appear he had gone on down the stairs out of the bag he took a gas mask which he donned then he took a gallon jug of villainously colored liquid from the bag and poured it on the floor he waited fifteen minutes approximately there was a strong draft up the stairs and through the door and through the stairs that led up to the roof the liquid doc had poured on the floor slowly turned into gas and was swept up to the roof after the fifteen minutes were up he went investigating there was one man asleep in the topfloor hallway there were six men and a girl asleep on the roof the girl was very small very pretty if you liked the kewpiedoll type chapter lost women doc savage had a way as those who knew him put it of walking up and taking death by the beard and not only getting away with it but in unexpected fashions all his own of leaving the old man with the whiskers and scythe wondering just whether he had been treated with disrespect but docs working methods were not as reckless as they appeared he knew this strange trade which he followed he had received years of training for it and he carried with himself always an astounding number of scientific gadgets calculated to cope with emergencies whenever possible he tried not to do what was expected of him there was a portable radio transmitter of some power standing on the roof in a case beside it was the additional mechanism necessary to make an ordinary radio into a plane control doc freed fifi she was bound and gagged and left rope and gag lying on the roof doc carried the men from the roof to the top floor hallway and put all seven of them in the freight elevator which operated automatically and thus did not have an operator next doc carried fifi down and put her with the others he had no doubt that he was carrying fifi he locked the door leading to the roof then sealed it with a bit of chewing gum not ordinary gum exactly this would turn white when he touched it with a drop of chemical and if it didnt turn white he would know it was different gum fifi had the cutest form of any small girl doc had ever seen short girls are usually spread out a bit the bronze man got down to the alley got his car around there got his passengers loaded into it without attracting anyones attention he drove toward his headquarters fifi slipped over and her head rested against his shoulder she was the type of little thing that could look delicious when she was sleeping docs car traveled quietly and did not take long to reach the high building which housed his headquarters the machine rolled into the private basement garage he loaded in seven prisoners into the speed elevator then he put fifi in fifi seemed if anything smaller and more exquisitely pretty she looked like trouble she looked like nothing else but trouble doc piloted the elevator and his load up to the eightysixth floor and got out he began unloading neither ham nor long tom came out to help him suddenly concerned doc savage hurried to the door opened it and went into the reception room he stopped stared about in astonishment two thoroughly angry bulls might have put the place in the shambles he saw before him two bulls it was hardly likely one could have done as thorough a job ham and long tom were skinned lacerated contused they had black eyes were minus some hair and their noses leaked crimson another expensive suit had been ruined for ham the two were also bound and gagged doc untied them titania ham yelled giantia long tom shouted they got away they groaned in chorus doc savages metallic features did not change expression which was a tribute to his selfcontrol titania and giantia had been going to tell everything about john sunlight the instant they knew their sister fifi was safe well fifi was safe she would have no more than a slight headache when she recovered how did it happen doc asked quietly they saw that plane explode the plane monk was after long tom muttered and they went wild ham added ruefully you never saw such a performance they landed on us before we knew whatd happened insisted we had gotten fifi killed they thought she was in the plane you know well that is anyhow they got the best of us they left long tom explained swearing they were going to join john sunlight and help him get you to pay you back for causing fifis death in the plane ham stood up felt of himself ran to a mirror and got a good look at the damage which had been done to his garments he made a croaking noise he loved his clothes as if they were his children another hideous thought hit ham monk if monk heard of this the homely ape would have the time of his life kidding ham and he was certain to hear of it hams groan was so loud it sounded like a honking doc savage said nothing more on the subject of the two giantesses escaping he never criticized his crew for errors or shortcomings the bronze man made mistakes himself mistakes his metallic face settled into the grimmest of lines mistake this whole thing was the result of a mistake he had made a horrible error he had not told them that as yet but the fact had taken shape in his own mind and was there whenever his thoughts relaxed to torment him like a spiketailed devil in grave silence the bronze man carried the captives into the laboratory ham and long tom helped him before the job was done monk put in an appearance with an aviators helmet and goggles perched on his bullet head he listened as long tom told what had happened then monk looked at ham and roared with mirth you look like an accident goin someplace t happen monk howled at least ham said unkindly i dont look and act like something six months out of a jungle monk scowled listen shyster my ancestors came here on the mayflower its a good thing ham sneered the country has immigration laws now they did not notice doc savage closing the laboratory door and later when they tried the door it was locked and although they called out the bronze man returned no answer from within they sat down in the reception room to wait puzzled doc savage preferred to work alone whenever possible this did not grow out of an overconfidence in his own ability nor did it mean that his aids were inefficient they were not they were highly intelligent if unusual fellows and of enormous assistance at times but doc still liked to work alone when he could there were things that one man could do better it takes an army to fight an army but sending one scout out to locate the enemy is the sensible way the effects of the gas would wear off shortly if the prisoners were left alone but doc did not leave them alone he gave each one of them fifi included a treatment with truth serum truth serum at the best and doc savage had done considerable work toward developing the stuff as had monk was not always dependable it functioned by causing the patient to lapse into a coma so that the mind exercised no conscious control over the will when the subject heard a question put insistently the impulse was to answer it and the dulled will power was unlikely to interfere fifi was the type of character most susceptible to truth serum so doc began his questioning with her fifi knew absolutely nothing of value doc went to work on the others he kept questioning them for almost an hour and when the bronze man unlocked the laboratory door there was an expression on his face which shocked his men it was a stricken look one of such intensity that it was startling for doc savage so rarely showed his emotions doc ham gasped what the bronze man shook his head we havent much time he said you might help me they carried the men prisoners out one at a time and put them in the speed elevator monk maneuvered himself into carrying fifi not a bad little number he said admiringly keep her here doc said monk burst out in a big wreath of grins ham complained that ugly clunk is havin all the luck doc said ham you and long tom stay here be ready for a call they nodded puzzled the strangely set expression on his face deterred them from asking questions doc savage got a larger makeup box out of the laboratory he took also two equipment cases then he lowered the prisoners to the basement garage loaded them in the car drove back to the building where he had captured them and managed to return them to the roof still without being noticed the prisoners lay limp and snored where he placed them he put the thin dark one at the foot of the roof stairs he scattered the others over the roof near the radio plane control where he had found them he emptied another bottle of chemical on the roof at once the air became filled with a reeking odor which certainly smelled like a chemical vapor potent enough to overcome men doc savage then left the roof chapter war lords the first john sunlight man to sit erect on the roof looked around himself in a dazed way his next act was an impulsive glance at his wrists as though he expected to find handcuffs there he began shaking his head hey he yelled he shook the limp form nearest to him the shaken man groaned doc savages skill with drugs was highly developed he had calculated the combined dosages in proportion to the bodily resistance of the men so closely that they were all reviving at approximately the same time half an hour saw them all on their feet stumbling around asking each other foolish questions then the man came crawling up from the stairs gas this man gasped gas that came from a chemical firm downstairs the fumes musta got us howd you know that there was an inspector come around just before i keeled over a man rubbed his forehead bewilderedly i kinda feel as if somethin happened to me when i was unconscious he mumbled what the man tried to think gave it up finally nothin i guess he said which was as near as any of them came to imagining that they had been taken to doc savages headquarters had talked under the effects of truth serum and had been returned wheres the girl one yelled suddenly she wasnt there obviously she must a failed to get as much gas as we did and crawled off one man decided they saw the ropes and gag lying where the girl had been but no girl there was a furious rush in search of the girl and when it netted them nothing they were uneasy john sunlight aint gonna like this seemed to be a general consensus they conferred holding their heads which ached splittingly and decided there was nothing to do now but take their radio outfit and leave they did this their cars were parked in a nearby side street they drove north for over an hour along the bank of the hudson river then parked their cars at a wharf near the waters edge there was a speedboat tied to the wharf into this they climbed it carried them out on the river and toward an island the island was mostly stone although there was enough soil to support a few trees the island was crowned by a house crowned there was no other word for it nothing else quite described how the house sat on the peak of the island or described the house itself the structure was like a crown round with four ornamental spires one at each corner and windows which due to the reflections of afternoon sun from their colored glass resembled jewels of course the house could have been called a fortress too but not at first glance the machine guns mounted inside the windows were not visible at any first glance the house might have been termed a spot for a quick getaway as well but to realize this it was first necessary to know that the big boathouse on the south held a fast plane as well as a hundredmileanhour speedboat john sunlight did not believe in taking chances john sunlight sat on a deep chair which was covered with a rich purple velvet cloth he wore a matching set of purple velvet pajamas and purple velvet robe and on the forefinger of his right hand was a ring with a purple jewel john sunlight had very few changeable habits but one of them was his fondness for one color one time and perhaps a different one later just now he was experiencing a yen for purple particularly the regal shade of the color the man could go in for colors like a male movie star and still be dangerous he did not look dangerous as he listened to his men tell him they had been gassed on the building roof and had awakened to find the girl fifi gone and that nothing else had happened to them except that they hadnt succeeded in blowing up anybody with the bomb plane john sunlight never looked dangerous that is too bad he said he resembled with his thin aesthetic face a dreamer of a poet who had listened to an editor turn down one of his rhymes too bad he said you will have to be punished the terrified uneasiness which jumped over the faces of the gas victims at this was a tribute to the grisly qualities of the innocentlooking tall thin man before them there was something hypnotic about it he had not touched them had not ordered them shot or even beaten put them each in a separate dark room of the basement john sunlight said after they have been there fortyeight hours i will talk to them one of the men made a croaking sound john sunlight had done that to him once before put him in darkness for a long time then came and talked to him and the talk of john sunlight spoken quietly and steadily had contained such a combination of horrors and obscenities ghastly implications and frightful verbal statements that the man remembered he had been a gibbering wreck of terror for many hours afterward an impartial observer would have called john sunlights method a form of hypnotism the horrified gas victims were led away john sunlight was thorough attention to details he had long ago learned is important overlook a seed and it may grow into a great tree of thorns he consulted a manhattan directory why he said mildly there is no chemical firm registered as being in that building he got on the telephone he could speak english with almost no accent at all so he made out fairly well with a deception that he was a federal agent yes do he said soon a voice said this is the eureka products chemical house what address john sunlight asked the address given was the proper one did you have an accident there today john sunlight inquired why yes the other said some gas got loose in the plant but as far as we can tell it did no damage we were afraid that it would rise to the upper floors and cause people to become unconscious however the gas is harmless unless one has a very weak heart thank you john sunlight said thank you said the voice the voice was long tom his thanks were sincere he was still a little breathiess from rushing around warning the telephone people that there was a chemical firm in the building in case anyone asked and using his electrical skill to get a telephone connection in the building in a hurry he hoped he had fooled john sunlight he had john sunlight was deceived but he did not put the telephone aside at once because he had another call to make hello baron he said pleasantly i wonder if you could arrange to hold an immediate consultation with me the baron was silent cautiously considering is it dangerous he demanded it is to avoid danger said john sunlight that i wish to see you this is very important baron one of my men will call for you immediately in a car again the baron thought it over all right he said finally in a tone that said he doubted very much if it would be all right this baron was one of john sunlights contacts john sunlight had many contacts more than anyone would have believed he was not a young man and he had worked all his evil life toward one hideous goal and he had made his arrangements as he went along always with an eye to the future john sunlights idea about his destiny on this unfortunate earth was far from being as changeable as his fancy for colors the baron was a representative of a balkan country the secret representative his position at home was high but the work he did was of the lowest kind he was the head of his nations spy system he also personally handled the purchase of information or anything that would be of value to his vicious little government this baron karl he was known as baron karl for short was bosom buddy to the prime minister of his government and the prime minister was as bloodthirsty and intolerant a tyrant as ever seized lifeanddeath control over an unsuspecting population the prime minister had his eyes on his neighboring balkan country and he would willingly give the lives of a few hundred thousand of his soldiers to grab the other country the only redeeming feature about the situation was that the other balkan nation was ruled by as vicious a rascal as either the prime minister or baron karl who dominated the neighboring democracy the ruler was known to the world as the playboy prince because of his hilarious career but what the world didnt know was that he was a bloodthirsty powerhungry kind of weasel and the first throat he wanted to cut was the neighboring democracy of the prime minister and baron karl fortunately the two countries armed to the teeth had so far been too evenly matched for either to risk a war but if anything gave either a balance of power there would be a war at the drop of a hat no one knew that the socalled playboy prince had landed in new york yesterday he was traveling incognito very much incognito this playboy prince was the next man john sunlight called ill have my car call for you in about an hour john sunlight said john sunlight made several other telephone calls and appointments each of these was to a representative of a government which wanted above all things to have the power to whip somebody else in a war baron karl arrived at six oclock it was getting dark around the island chapter arctic rendezvous baron karl was a smooth customer he even wore a monocle and of course the best of clothes he was quite a hand with the chorus girls in the revolution in his country it was rumored he had personally shot to death some fifty or so political enemies having them brought one at a time to a dark little room under the castle when he wished he could look and act like a candy salesman but when he relaxed and was his normal self he was so much like something made out of snake flesh that even his boss the prime minister didnt like to be around him socially baron karl sat with military erectness in the stern of the motorboat which brought him out to the island and made rather a distinguished figure he gave the island and its castlelike house a glance of approval it looked like a safe place as a matter of fact his own castle in his native land was along the same order sometimes i think he remarked that this john sunlight is destined to be historys greatest evil genius he thought along that line while he was being led up to the castle like all evil men he liked to think that other persons were worse than himself and in the case of john sunlight he was eminently correct baron karl was only a menace to a pair of small balkan nations whereas john sunlight was a menace to practically all humanity baron karl made a little speech when he met john sunlight i salute again he said the man who has inherited the qualities of the erinyes the eumenides of titan and of friar rush with a touch of dracula and frankenstein those were very bad people john sunlight said dryly baron karl peered sharply at the other a little apprehensive lest he had angered john sunlight he was afraid of the man let us call you a genius he said and i say that sincerely er may i sit down he sat in a comfortable chair crossed his legs and dropped his candy salesman manner he was ready to get down to business what do you want he asked john sunlight was blunt i wish to make an appointment to meet you at a point north of hudson bay in exactly five days he said the stooge for one of europes worse tyrants looked startled hudson bay you dont mean the hudson bay in canada yes our meeting place is near the arctic circle youre crazy baron karl exclaimed why its still winter up there its cold only about fifty below zero john sunlight said the other shook his head meet you in the arctic not me particularly not unless you explain why john sunlight did not lift his voice he said this is very very important on your meeting with me in the arctic will depend the future of your country that is big talk the european agent said dryly fail to meet me and your country john sunlight held up five fingers of one hand wont last that many months baron karl sat quite still and thought of the things he knew about john sunlight and of the whispers he had heard about the strange terrible man baron karl was given to quick impulsive decisions he stood up ill meet you in the arctic he said although im mystified royalty visited john sunlights island in the hudson at ten oclock that night which was two hours after baron karl had departed in an extremely puzzled state of mind royalty was the playboy prince who had come dashing to america in secrecy and much haste the prince sat in the launch and pouted as the boat ran toward the island he was a large young man and his personal opinion was that he was handsome the newspapers called him dashing what they meant was that the things he did were dashing or sappy it depended on how you looked at such things as drunken chorus girls bathing in champagne tubs on the royal table he had a mouth made for pouting large wetcalf eyes and in a few years if he kept putting on weight he would look like a large brown worm my cabinet he told john sunlight peevishly advised me to come as your message requested hed filled his cabinet with the coldest cleverest rogues in his country and he had gumption enough to take their advice one week from today john sunlight said i want to meet you at a rendezvous near the arctic circle north of hudson bay the prince didnt like cold weather he refused then he listened to john sunlight assure him that if he didnt keep the appointment his country wouldnt last john sunlight held up five fingers that many months the prince thought of what his cabinet advisers had told him about this weird man before him and remembered that they had assured him that if john sunlight said a thing was important it was assuredly important how do i get there he asked grumpily by plane secretly that was all and the prince left he was mad at himself because he was royalty and here he was taking orders from a man who had no royal blood whatever he was taking the orders simply because he had heard enough about the man to make him afraid not to do as he was told he was puzzled he had no idea why john sunlight wanted him in the arctic as a matter of fact the prince was not the only one who was puzzled andrew blodgett monk mayfair was also baffled and so was theodore marley ham brooks the two remarkable friends were stationed behind a bush on a cliff which formed a bank of the hudson river opposite john sunlights island monk and ham were behind the bush because they had received a radioed request from doc savage to appear there they knew nothing more than that monk and ham had not seen doc savage since he had left headquarters with seven unconscious members of john sunlights gang they did not know that doc had taken the seven sleepers back to the same rooftop off which he had collected them all they did know was that long tom had been left back at headquarters to watch fifi they werent too happy about that fifi was pretty monk had been prowling around taking a brief look at their surroundings the brush was thick the night fairly dark and monks mind was on fifi when monk came back to ham he grumbled i almost lost my way you never had a way ham said unkindly monk continued to think of exquisite fifi being guarded by long tom thank heavens long tom aint got a way with im either the homely chemist said heartily starting to sit down in the darkness without having his mind on it monk had a rock roll under his feet and he fell heavily ooh he croaked i hit on my crazy bone oh dear ham said solicitously your whole skeleton must hurt monk was feeling around for a stone entering vague ideas of seeing whether it would bounce off ham when the shadow of a boulder beside them seemed to grow much larger there was no perceptible sound the boulder shadow just seemed to grow mysteriously doc monk gasped doc savages quiet controlled voice came from the shadow which had grown did you bring equipment cases im sitting on them ham said doc where have you been what became of the seven unconscious men what doc said the seven revived on the roof under circumstances which made them think the whole thing was an accident they are now on that island you can see yonder fortunately they did not see me following them oh then john sunlight is on the island doc savage interposed gravely it is up to us to raid the place and seize him they picked up the equipment cases these were of metal waterproof shockproof with handles for convenient carrying and crept down the face of the cliff to the edge of the hudson river doc savage stopped and gave a solemn warning john sunlight the bronze man said is probably as complete a fiend as we ever met he is extremely clever monk spoke for himself and ham we dont scare easy he said doc knew that but he wanted to impress on them the need for caution and success baron karl does not scare easily either doc said baron karl is the representative of a small warhungry european government neither does the playboy prince scare readily ive heard of them two guys monk admitted they were enough afraid of john sunlight that they came from europe to see him the moment he demanded it doc savage said monk peered in astonishment at doc savage how come you know so much about whats been happenin on that island doc he muttered chapter island raid monks problem was solved shortly doc savage opened one of the equipment cases they had brought extracted diving lungs and they donned these the devicesnose clips breathing tube that ran to a chemical purifier pack would enable them to remain under water for hours if necessary they weighted themselves by carrying a rock under one arm an equipment case under the other and waded into the river doc wore a luminous wrist compass he consulted this until they reached the island then turned the luminous compass face against his wrist so it would not betray his presence in the darkness they climbed silently from the water and crouched in a riverworn pocket in the stone above them was a low cliff standing limned in the faintest of light only at intervals when it was touched by the beam from a distant navigation blinker far up the river the castlelike house must be beyond that there was a faint click as doc opened an equipment case again then other clicks and monk and ham found telephone headsets thrust into their hands they put on their headsets civan they heard a voice saying you recall what serge mafnoff meant to me there was something about that voice that caused monk and ham to shove out their jaws although they had never heard it before serge mafnoff was your greatest enemy civans voice said exactly said that other voice the hideous one and now i have another greatest enemy who civan asked doc savage the other growled civan there is nothing i would rather do than stay in the neighborhood of new york and fight this doc savage to the finish but it is not wise i have other plans and i do not want them ruined doc savage might ruin them therefore we are fleeing to the arctic yes sir civan said i have made appointments with the men i wish to do business with the other explained they will appear in the arctic one by one i see civan said dutifully monk and ham bent close to doc savage and monk said doc who is civan talking to john sunlight doc savage said how doc explained quietly i managed to creep close to the walls and fasten supersensitive contact microphones to several of the windows i did that as soon as i had trailed the men who thought they were gassed on the roof it was impossible to get inside the house he has every inch of the place under guard for that matter he has the entire surrounding river guarded by photoelectriceye arrangements mounted in buoys it would be impossible to approach unobserved in a boat monk growled aint we wastin time here he never liked to put off a fight there was a guard at the head of the stairway that led up the last sheer few yards of rock to the castle front door he was a dark man he leaned on a rifle and he was preoccupied with thoughts of the months he had spent on the icebreaker in the arctic he was recollecting some of the things they had eaten and it had made him a little sick at the stomach beregeeles a voice ripped from a window take care fool dont you see that fire the guard came to life with a start saw a luridred glow of flames a few yards down the trail and raced to the spot the fire was not much the guard pointed a flashlight beam saw a smouldering cigarette stub at the base of the burned wedge he fell to stamping out the flames somebody threw a cigarette into the brush he shouted reassuredly by that time doc savage monk and ham were inside the castlelike house doc had started the fire but not with a cigarette the cigarette was just trimming doc went ahead he whipped across a reception hall that was as large as some schoolrooms knocking open the door with quick silence he went through john sunlight was not inside civan however was civan ogled doc savage let out a howl and dived backward for a door probably civan had never seen a figure quite like the one the bronze man presented doc savage wore a bulletproof helmet gasprotector a transparent globe of a thing made of tough glasslike composition holding the bronze mans entire head the rest of docs great form was enveloped in a coverall garment of bulletproof chain mesh there even being mesh gauntlets civan got through his door got the door shut just as doc hit it the panel was dark old oak studded with iron and it held doc dropped a hand grenade against the door got back the grenade let loose rock and wood fragments hit his armor grittingly he went through the smoke found the door and part of the stone frame demolished the bronze man had a stout canvas sack slung from a shoulder by a strap from it he began taking gas bombs he broke these on the floor the bombs contained a gas that would take effect through the skin pores only protection against it was an airtight suit a garment such as the rubberized lining of docs alloy mesh armor doc reached another door this one also closed he reached into the canvas sack and brought out an object resembling a small metal apple equipped with a vacuum suction cup he stuck that against the door the device was one of the supersensitive contact microphones and a wire ran from it to an amplifier in the canvas sack and from the amplifier wires ran to a headset which doc wore inside the helmet the mike picked up voices beyond the door john sunshine said dont fight them you fool get the men out yes sir civan barked doc savage threw small switches quickly disconnecting his headset from the sonic amplifier and connecting it to a tiny microwave radio transceiver that had half the bulk of an ordinary shoe box he spoke into a tiny mike mounted inside the transparent helmet monk ham the two acknowledged over their own transmitter almost instantly get out of the place doc ordered monk howled but doc weve just started out the bronze man rapped he retreated himself and overtook monk and ham at the outer door they went as fast as they could in the darkness down the path behind them the castle jumped off the top of the island more properly most of the island tip went up and took the castle with it the blast seemed to knock the rocky earth down a foot shove it sidewise or maybe it was the impact of air against them that made the earth seem to shift amid the castle sections sheet flame stood or lunged the flame sheets seemed to shove the walls and rooms apart push them outward the debris came showering down the steep slope making a shuddering rumble doc seized monk and ham yanked them down in the narrow trench that was the path they lay flat boulders flooded over them like water and bounced on to land with splashing violence in the river smaller stones and earth settled on them until they were almost covered toward the end of the holocaust monk made a remark that john sunlight monk muttered must like to destroy things with that comment and without having seen john sunlight as yet monk drew as true a word picture of the mans character as probably could have been drawn doc said down to the boathouse they started leaping and sliding for the boathouse at the water edge it was then that the night suddenly got darker everything went intensely black it had been a dark night without stars but there were lights from distant houses and lights on the river now these vanished monk got out a flashlight he and ham both carried the canvas knapsacks and thumbed the light switch but nothing happened my flashlights broke monk barked ham use yours ham said im trying but it wont light the lights will do no good doc savage said quietly they knew then they had half guessed it anyway the black the eerie incredible impossible darkness that had enveloped serge mafnoffs mansion it was here now they stood silently gripped by awe in spite of themselves and in that quiet they were aware of a faint hissing in their radio headsets a low windy noise something close to static but still different doc savage removed his transparent helmet the thing would keep out sound as well as bullets he listened from the river came another noise this one might have been steam rushing but it was a silenced airplane motor monk and ham took off their helmets listened also doc monk exploded that motor that silencer the homely chemist fell silent go ahead and say it doc suggested it sounds like the type of silencer you use on your planes monk exploded doc savage instead of answering made for a brief interval the small exotic trilling sound that was his peculiar habit when mentally disturbed the trilling was low indescribably vague after that they went down to the boathouse and they could tell that it had contained a plane probably the plane they had heard take off from the river the lights of distant houses the lights on the river were suddenly visible the black had gone away chapter adonis and beauty doc savages trained eyes picked up the stabilizer light of a plane far away in the sky it was soon lost and as thoroughly as that airplane light vanished so did all trace of john sunlight civan giantia titania and all the rest of the siberian convicts the island was a wreck at least the top part of it was people who had heard the explosion came from miles up and down the river and some of them put out in boats to investigate while the others maneuvered their automobile headlights around so that they pointed at the island doc savage and his two men put on their hoods and waded down the bottom of the river half a mile came out unobserved and went on back to their skyscraper headquarters long tom had been doing some investigating in their absence this was at doc savages suggestion ive been talking to moscow on the telephone long tom said and i have learned moscow russia monk demanded of course long tom said the soviet orneials furnished me with descriptions of the convicts who disappeared from that siberian camp there is no doubt but that john sunlights men are the same crowd well monk said sadly they got away from us where did they go monk looked at doc savage the homely chemist had been told by doc that john sunlight had made appointments in the arctic with at least two men baron karl and the young european ruler known as the playboy prince where was that meeting to be doc monk asked the bronze man shook his head i never did hear the exact spot doc savage said quietly the calmness of his tone belied the importance of his words you mean monk exploded that were completely at a loss as to where john sunlight went yes doc agreed monk groaned blast it then were stymied were out of luck at this juncture there was a plaintive feminine appeal from the library what about poor little me was this helpless inquiry long tom made a face ugh whatcha mean ugh monk demanded thats little honey lambkins long tom explained he made another face fifi you dont like fifi monk asked incredulously listen long tom said sourly all the time you guys were gone i kept trying to add things up so this mess would make sense every time i came to fifi i added a zero no appreciation of feminine pulchritude monk declared and started in to comfort fifi ham put his hands in his pockets it seems strange he said unkindly that our friend here the homely gossoon should drop everything and go comfort fifi monk stopped scowled and pointed at hams pocketed hands it aint any stranger he sneered than the sight of a lawyer with his hands in his own pockets monk then stalked on in to comfort fifi ham glaring hurried to help with the job doc savage seated himself at the great inlaid table in the reception room with three telephones close at hand he called the central telephone office and placed in quick succession a series of transatlantic telephone calls at last as the world knew doc savage worked at his strange career of righting wrongs and punishing evildoers aided only by his five associates of which monk ham and long tom were three the two remaining members of the group of five were major john renny renwick the engineer and william harper johnny littlejohn the archaeologist and geologist these two were at present not in america renny was in france serving as consultant in the construction of a number of new flying fields designed for highspeed modern transport planes johnny was in egypt opening up another pharaohs tomb which had just been discovered doc savage consulted renny and johnny by longdistance telephone and requested they make inquiries about the past of a man known as john sunlight next doc contacted the foreign representatives of a famous worldwide private detective agency doc had organized this agency its real work was to gather information for the bronze man when not doing that the agency did a very profitable business along regular private detective lines doc put the private detectives to learning what they could about john sunlight john sunlight is working on some kind of a plan doc explained if i can learn enough about his character i may be able to guess the nature of his plan there was a lapse of time while renny johnny and the private detectives worked doc trusted his private detectives implicitly and for a strange reason doc trusted each private agent because each one had once been a vicious criminal whenever doc savage captured a crook he sent the fellow to a strange institution in upstate new york a place monk and the rest called the college at the college the crook underwent a delicate brain operation which wiped out all memory of the past after which the patient was trained taught to hate crime and criminals the private detectives were all graduates of the college reports began coming in from europe by transatlantic telephone john sunlight it seemed was more rumor than man an evil rumor a name that was whispered from mouth to mouth in the circles of international intrigue the agents had found men who feared him and would not talk many of those but here and there they had unearthed a scrap of real information you say doc savage said that john sunlight has always been hungry for power and money the european agents explained it seems that he always believed that if he had money he could get the power all the reports seemed to agree on that angle renny and johnny having made inquiries of their own they both had high government contacts in the countries in which they were working verified the point about john sunlight being hungry for power over men that doc savage said helps a great deal long tom frowning at doc in the new york headquarters could not see where the bronze man had learned much of value monk and ham were interested in fifi but they could not see where doc had learned so much either doc however seemed satisfied now he said we find a king a king long tom exploded a king incognito the playboy prince of european royalty the newspapers called him the former playboy prince because he was now a king would have greatly enjoyed his incognito visit in new york except for one thing he did not relish having to fly into the arctic to keep an appointment with john sunlight tomorrow he would have to take off by plane for the arctic and in the meantime he intended to enjoy himself his idea of enjoyment was a series of night clubs where he spent money furiously and drank himself looplegged he made a thoroughly disgusting spectacle of himself and managed to indulge in repeated fights that is he started repeated fights it was up to his bodyguards to finish them hed brought his bodyguards from home two of them they were big men one a little larger than the other they were obviously tough their hides seemed to be made of the same stuff as wellworn riding boots they had enormous scarred fists and their faces were somewhat like the wax casts in museums labeled head of a prehistoric cromagnon man the fight in the wacky club was about typical of several the roistering prince started except that one small thing happened which was different and queer it began when the prince spanked a showgirl he liked to spank them he thought it great fun but in this case he got hold of some young fellows girlfriend the prince was too intoxicated to notice the difference and wouldnt have cared anyway the girls boyfriend knocked the prince over a table the two hideous bodyguards sprang onto the boyfriend knocked him down began kicking him horribly someone unshaped a chair over one bodyguards head but it didnt seem to bother the fellow there was quite a bit of hullabaloo before the nightclub attendants dragged the boyfriend out and got things quieted down taking pains that the police were not called when the prince revived he at once demanded a drink he was handed a drink instantly one of the waiters in the night club did the handing and the prince gulped the drink down at one swallow then the prince got up and cursed his bodyguards and threw bottles at them and they took the abuse with stupid patience because this mouthing drunken fool was their king so far there had been nothing particularly queer about the incident the queer thing happened when the waiter drifted over and tapped on a door which gave into a private dining room the door opened a crack i gave im the stuff in his drink the waiter said a bank note promptly came through the door it was a fiftydollar bill the waiter picked it up and went away well satisfied the private room had a window that opened into an alleyway the prince was staying naturally in the citys most flamboyant hotel he had the finest suite and he had ruined most of the furniture in his wild orgies and the hotel management was going to be heartily glad when he was gone even if he had promised to pay for the ruined furniture the following morning the prince awakened feeling badly his conscience wasnt bothering him it was his body it ached and judging from the taste a cat had slept in his mouth he snatched a water carafe and smashed it against the door adonis he snarled adonis was one of the two evilfaced bodyguards the fellow appeared shuffling and kotowing at every other step shut the damn windows the prince screamed the room is full of fog the bodyguard shut the window then stood looking uneasy and changing feet may this humble one speak sire he asked fearfully speak about what there is no fog in this room sire the bodyguard got around to explaining the prince did some cursing and threw a telephone at the bodyguard then he got a little frightened for it became obvious that there was really no fog he could hardly see the objects before him were discernible only as hazy presences he called a doctor you must have got hold of some bad liquor the doctor said your eyesight is temporarily impaired you blasted fool the prince said do something the doctor explained stiffly that he could do nothing it would just have to wear off the prince broke up some furniture smashed a few pictures and became resigned if not pleased beauty he howled beauty was the other bodyguard the prince heard someone approach and there was a rather unpleasant gurgling noise talk up you fool the prince yelled the voice of adonis said may this lowly one advise you of an unfortunate fact eh beauty had his throat hurt last night adonis said fawningly and now it seems he cannot talk but he is here and ready to serve you sire the prince was delighted he had that kind of a mind he roared mirthfully and forgot for a few seconds his own lack of eyesight then he fell to whining and complaining and swearing ive got to take off for the arctic today he grumbled and here i cannot see sire you cannot go adonis said the idea of a vassal bodyguard telling him what he could not do enraged the prince get my clothes on me he snarled they got his clothes on him then they led him down to a taxicab and the prince told the driver where to go newark airport the prince ordered the cab drove for a long time but it did not go to newark airport it went instead to a smaller field on long island the cab went to the other field principally because beauty sat in the front seat and beauty was holding a large pistol against the ribs of the taxi driver the prince got out of the cab cursing the fact that he could not see is the plane i ordered here he yelled peevishly yes sir said a crisp voice whore you im the pilot the crisp voice said you have plenty of fuel yes sir get me in the cabin then and take off where do you wish to fly to the crisp voice asked the prince said ill tell you that you fool its a latitudeandlongitude figure very well sir the voice said no doubt the peevish prince would have been rather astounded had he known that the crisp voice he was hearing came from the hideous lips of the fellow he had been calling adonis they got in the plane and it took off the prince was spared further surprise by not realizing the plane was being flown by the creature who had been making the croaking noises the one he had called beauty as a matter of fact only the prince adonis and beauty were in the plane as it flew northward the prince was a complaining quarrelsome passenger and when he was not abusing adonis he insisted on drinking or howling obscene tunes at the top of his lungs later adonis went forward to see how beauty was making out with the flying doc monk who was beauty said i dont envy you the job of takin care of that thing back there he has given me the latitude and longitude of the place where we are to go doc who was adonis said and wrote the figures on the chart board think you can find the spot monk swell said monk in a squeaky voice now im in favor of dumpin im overboard no well continue to be his bodyguards mention of the word bodyguards seemed to arouse a bit of musing recollection in monks mind doc i guess the two real bodyguards are arrivin at our college about now he said thoughtfully then he grinned ill never forget what a job we had knockin em senseless when we called em to the door of the princes suite last night the chemical we had the nightclub waiter put in the princes drink had exactly the effect we hoped for doc said there is not much chance of his recognizing us i dont think hed recognize us anyway considerin how were disguised to look exactly like adonis and beauty probably not monk flew in silence for a while then he sighed what burns me up he complained is the idea of long tom and ham followin in another plane with fifi fifi will be left in some little town upstate doc assured monk she will be safe there later a plane piloted by long tom with ham and fifi as passengers was circling a tiny landing field near a small town in vermont ham had been making headway with fifi landing fifi exclaimed she gave hams arm a squeeze you didnt tell me we were going to stop anywhere ham took off and put on the natty aviators helmet which he wore er i we he said well its not my idea aw tell her were leavin her at a little hotel here long tom snapped oh but i dont want to be left fifi gasped she gave ham her most toecurling look you dont want to leave fifi do you er it may be too dangerous up north ham said weakly but youre going fifi pointed out thats different ham said aw throw her out long tom flung in disgust ham patted fifis arm scowled at long tom ham enjoyed having kewpiedoll girls hanging onto him the plane landed and fifi changed her tactics she showed an unexpected bullheaded streak fifi screamed listen you two im going along i want to help my sisters now get this you leave me behind and ill tell john sunlight what youre doing long tom glared at her you want me to fan your skirts with a frying pan fifi glared right back at him ill trade john sunlight information about you for the release of my two sisters she shouted you dont know where john sunlight is long tom yelled ill advertise in the newspapers fifi screamed ill broadcast on the radio women and trouble long tom groaned he tuned on the shortwave radio and contacted doc savage doc he said fifi has turned cocklebur how is that doc asked the nitwit says if we dont take her along shell trade information about us to john sunlight for her sisters freedom that is bad its terrific long tom said sourly bring her with you doc said reluctantly as doc savage made the decision monk groaned that burns me up monk complained the idea of ham followin in that plane with fifi if we understood women we might have argued her out of it doc said huh monk said disgustedly that ham understands em too well chapter spot in the arctic there is something completely monotonous about riding in an airplane certainly it is fully as uneventful as a train ride across a nebraska prairie despite even the mental pastime in which the most seasoned air traveler finds himself engaging the pastime being to pick out possible landing fields on the earth below in the case of the princes plane flown by doc and monk they managed to go on playing the parts of adonis and beauty air travel became doubly monotonous because from the time they left new york citys cloudtickling spires behind there was a blanket of haze over the earth that at the height they were flying made the wooded hills and rivers an unending gray blur which might have been anything the prince was as peevish as an ugly baby and seemed satisfied only when they gave him his bottle not milk for if not satisfied then he at least occupied himself only with thinking up loud profane opinions of the kind of scheme that would let him a king get in a shape where when he put his hands before his eyes all he saw was a dark blur that might have been his hand or as he expressed it a dirty buzzard just why he referred to a dirty buzzard in that connection was obscure unless it was simply he subconsciously connected the hands with something they had done in the past the plane seemed slow doc savage and monk were accustomed to the specially designed speed ships which the bronze man used this was an ordinary type of craft and comparatively clumsy and conceivably not nearly as safe but they had not thought it wise to substitute one of their own because such a ship would have been distinctive enough to attract suspicion it began to get colder they stopped twice and refueled and it was very chilly and there was snow on the ground at the last halt where they took plane skis out of the cabin and fastened them to the landing gear hereafter landings would have to be made on snow they flew on for hours and doc savage knew they must be getting near the arctic rendezvous with john sunlight doc contacted long tom and ham by radio the prince sat back in the cabin but could not hear because the plane was so noisy long tom doc said what is your position now there was a scrambler here in docs plane and another one in long toms ship one scrambler mixed up the voice until it was an unintelligible gobble and the other unmixed it and made it understandable that was so john sunlight could not comprehend in case he did tune in on them long toms position proved to be approximately one thousand miles southward stay back about a hundred miles doc directed once you draw near the rendezvous land and wait for some word from us k long tom said maybe once we get down on the snow fifi will cool off fifi what is wrong with fifi listen doc that fifi is a pain long tom complained all she does is cuddle up against ham and wail poor little me monk heard that and he was so indignant he forgot himself and snatched the microphone out of docs hands did you say fifi is cuddlin up to ham he howled yes and you tell ham to cut that out monk squalled wrathfully long tom evidently conveyed the order to ham because he came back to the mike in a moment with an answer ham says long tom explained for you to go jump in a snowbank monk collapsed and made strangling noises opening and closing his hands as though he had his fingers around the neck of his favorite enemy his agitation must have been considerable because he came to the point of criticizing a doc savage tactic something he rarely did not because doc couldnt take it but because the bronze mans judgment was usually firstrate doc monk said why the dickens didnt we leave fifi in new york the bronze man had explained that before but he expounded it again for monks benefit fifi he said is our hold over her two freak sisters giantia and titania who are probably with john sunlight monk subsided since only the future would show whether fifi would be of any value the prince grew worse they hadnt thought that possible but the prince demonstrated that it was he howled and roared doc savage was kept very busy doc had to be the pilot as well as adonis the bodyguard monk had to be only beauty the other bodyguard but that grew complicated when the prince began to express an insane desire to choke beauty and see if that would bring back his voice monk could not afford to have beautys voice brought back because he could not speak beautys language wheres that beauty the prince screamed ill beat a voice back into him doc savage said using the imaginary pilots voice i think we are approaching the landing place the prince jammed his face against the cold plane windows and swore at his inability to see what is it like doc savage scrutinized the terrain through the plane window he saw an expanse which appeared to be nothing but pack ice covered by snow a cold white waste across which swirling ghosts of snow were carried by the wind doc described what he saw you fool the prince screeched this cant be the place we are within fifteen minutes flying of the spot to which you have directed us the bronze man explained i have checked the latitudeandlongitude figures carefully call me the prince snarled when you reach the spot i want you to describe what you see doc went back to the cockpit monk flew on monk had drawn a black dot on the chart to mark the latitude and longitude of their goal and a red line to indicate their progress the red line had about reached the black dot and monk was wondering this territory is all unexplored he remarked has been for the last thousand miles doc did not comment on that monk had evidently been thinking about their chance of getting back in case they had engine trouble for he continued this is about the most remote corner of the earth he grumbled they talk about the polar seas being explored but believe you me thats an exaggeration nobody is supposed to have ever been within a thousand miles of this point doc savage was silent his strange flake gold eyes were focused ahead rather intently there he said and pointed monk grabbed a pair of binoculars knowing very well that his own vision was not equal to the bronze mans trained eyes monk focused the glasses peered into the misty grayness that was the perpetual arctic daytime blazes he croaked he stood up and leaned forward in an effort to see more of the strange object he had sighted what what is that he gasped doc said nothing and in a moment monk emitted an astounded gasp and sagged back on the cockpit seat the strange blue dome for miles and miles in all directions the white waste looked absolutely barren except directly ahead where there was obviously an island the island seemed to be solid stone with no bit of soil and no vegetation just a high bald knob of stone a mass of rock rearing up from the floor of the arctic ocean it must be as solid as gibraltar for it stood firm against the ice pack the ice had piled up against the island and for leagues it was broken in great bergs the floes had squeezed and piled one on top of the other and the ice had lumped up in masses that were sometimes as large as factory buildings the strange blue dome stood a weirdlooking thing on the rock island it was like half a blue agate marble like a marble that some fabulous titan had lost here in this unknown part of the globe to become buried in stone and surrounded by fantastic ice it was strange lying where it did it should logically have been about the most completely lost thing upon the earth uh i well monk said uh that is hmmm he fell silent then he looked at doc savage stared at the bronze mans face at close range and suddenly he knew he was positive doc savage not even doc could maintain composure in the face of such an incredible discovery as that queer blue thing yonder unless doc had known it was there doc monk said the bronze man did not seem to hear doc the bronze mans eyes left the blue mystery doc monk said what is that thing the bronze man was silent and grimfaced monk suddenly seized doc savage tightly with both hands and all the puzzled amazement came out of him in a shouted demand you know what the blue thing is monk bellowed what is it doc doc never answered because the prince shoved his head into the pilots compartment i heard you he said loudly chapter half a blue ball there was monk was a long time forgetting that moment an interval when it seemed certain that their hoax was discovered that all their careful planning had gone for nothing then i sometimes talk to myself doc savage said quietly in the pilots voice monk held his breath oh the prince said i could only get a voice the damned plane makes so much noise monk began breathing again it was all right the prince was too stupidly drunk to fool them what do you see below the prince demanded there is a rocky island doc said quietly enough and on the island is a strangelooking blue dome a blue dome it seems a very queer thing to find in the arctic doc said the prince announced in a profane inebriated voice that he didnt like queer things and the thing he liked least of all was the fact that he had come here without knowing why he was doing it land he ordered very well doc said monk itched to ask a legion of questions but the prince stood close and he dared not speak completely flabbergasted monk examined the blue halfsphere the plane was dropping now the ice waste the solid rock island the blue mystery seemed to swell as they came upward the berg pinnacles appeared to grow it was startling the pack ice was even more formidable than it had appeared from a great height it occurred to monk again that this was as inaccessible a spot probably as existed on earth you had better get back in the cabin doc told the prince and fasten your safety belt have your bodyguards help you monk helped the prince back into the cabin doing his best to seem like two men handling the prince was about like handling a warm worm monk thought then monk went back to the cockpit and stood by for the next move in their plan he watched the island snow covered most of it and in places there was ice obviously it was no spot for a landing except along the southern edge where there was a level area where the snow looked deep and level a smooth white stretch which terminated against a ridge of high broken pack ice that had jammed up against the island the plane leveled skimmed the gleaming ice fangs swung past the blue dome monk was made breathless by the queer shimmering luster of the thing then the craft dipped for the level area of snow there would be no room to spare but the less room the better for what they had in mind the plane skis touched the craft landed fast too fast doc knew that he deliberately had too much speed monk he rapped monk knew what to do he jerked his fascinated gaze off the blue dome dashed back to the rear then came rushing forward again doubled low so he could not be seen from outside he had a bundle a strange manshaped bundle monk slapped the bundle in the spare pilots cockpit seat the plane slid on across the clearing it climbed up the side of an ice pinnacle moving slowly now it slid sidewise turning one ski runner snagged the plane went over a wing buckling the craft dropped down behind an ice ridge somewhat of a wreck monk snatched the prince dragged him out of the door he pulled behind him one of docs equipment cases of metal doc wrenched at a tab overhead in the pilots cockpit he tore the tab off gasoline burst through from the tanks in a flood that soaked the cabin standing in the plane door doc struck a match tossed it with a low whoop flames enveloped the plane interior doc bounded backward but not before he was singed enough to make it convincing the fur burned off around his parka hood his bearskin trousers scorched and smoking doc gestured at the case monk let the prince drop in the snow carried the equipment case to a snowdrift near by made a hole with great haste and buried the box monk used his hands to scoop great banks of snow over the case then went back to doc our nest egg monk whispered is all planted fire devoured the plane with roaring greed in the cockpit particularly it burned and blackened the long bundle which doc had left there a fake thing made of beefsteak imitation bones of composition enclosed in a pilots flying suit they had to have some way to account for no pilot getting out of the plane the prince showed further that he was a spineless cruel fool the roaring flames scared him and he ran away or tried to clawing at an ice ridge and slipping back screaming all the while adonis he screeched beauty then wheres the pilot he wanted to know the pilot did not get out doc said using the voice of the bestial adonis it serves the clumsy soandso right the prince gritted i hope he burns to death a moment later civan appeared giantia and titania were with civan so were some others but no john sunlight their coming gave monk a vast start he had no idea from whence they came they came in haste plowing in the snow slipping on ice where it was bare they had guns big revolvers with mechanisms that would not freeze and become useless in this cold as automatics sometimes did the guns went back into clothing when civan recognized the prince and gave the word they got the odor coming out of the burning plane there were also faint cries for help coming from the plane now the pilots burning to death civan bawled let him burn the prince snarled after a while the low awful cries that seemed to come from the plane were no longer audible doc savage was a skilled ventriloquist and he had done a very good job putting the cries for help into the plane but be did not believe in pushing his luck too far and anyway it was about time they thought the pilot had burned to death civan looked over the damage kakoi srahm he said what a shame it was a good plane he gave adonis and beauty a close inspection they did not look at all like doc savage and monk mayfair to civan they looked like two tough lads with whom it might be a good idea not to be found alone who are these cookies asked civan who could speak american slang with a russian accent adonis and beauty were not supposed to be able to speak any english and they murdered their mother tongue when they spoke it they merely glared at civan and made ugly noises they are my bodyguards said the prince sharply take me to john sunlight civan turned and walked back the way he had come the fact that he slipped almost at once and fell flat on his back did not improve his dignity but seemed to do no harm to his disposition it developed that progress on the ice was likely to be a succession of spills none of them expected the prince cursed every time he fell down and struck his bodyguards oh boy monk said what can that blue thing be anyway monk did not say this out loud but doc savage was lip reader enough to catch the words even though monks lips looked stuffy and unnatural because of an injected chemical which produced a harmless form of swelling and was infinitely better than internal padding of parafin or some other substance which might be discovered the bronze man did not explain about the blue dome john sunlight had covered his planes with white tents that was why they had not been discernible from the air there was a wind of some force blowing and the air was full of driving snow and that had helped make the tents invisible the men seemed to be camped in white tents fully a quarter mile from the weird blue edifice covered planes white housetents and igloos were located on the south side of the level natural landing field in the arctic pack ice the prince was conducted into one of the tents civan made an effort to prevent the two hideous bodyguards from sticking with the prince but he got a shove that sat him down in the snow for his pains they cannot understand english the prince said indignantly john sunlight sat in the largest of the white tents he had caused a block of icebard snow to be cut and brought into the tent and he had spread a polar bearskin over this to make a seat doc and monk stared at john sunlight in astonishment the prince would have stared too only he couldnt see john sunlight wore light duck trousers and a white silk shirt which was open at the neck tropical attire and yet it must be thirty below zero outside a warm day in the arctic for this season but still thirty below john sunlight was not unaware of the effect he liked effects probably his whole weird macabre life was devoted to getting them sit down he said politely and do only one thing do not ask questions about the blue dome then the placidity left his dark poetic face and burning eyes for he could see that something was wrong with the princes eyesight your eyes he rasped what is it the prince said a great deal that was uncomplimentary about the brand of liquor served in new york hhow long will you be blind john sunlight demanded about twentyfour hours more the doctor thought the prince explained john sunlight was not pleased but there was nothing he could do about that you will have to wait he said grimly until your vision has returned wait wait for what my demonstration the prince was befuddled why he had come to the arctic was still a complete mystery to him and he had come only because his ministers at home had told him anything in which john sunlight was involved would be important demonstration the prince repeated what kind of a demonstration you must see it to appreciate its value john sunlight said see what the thing john sunlight said for which you and your government are going to pay me ten million dollars chapter snow tricks that was all the satisfaction the prince got he yelled and swore and john sunlight gave him liquor to quiet him usually john sunlight could quiet men without using outside means either liquor or a club but in this case the prince couldnt see john sunlight you had to see john sunlight to appreciate him the prince was shoved into a tent doc and monk were shoved in with him this was not to their liking and they started to come right out of the tent a guard put the muzzle of a rifle close to their noses and waggled it in the tent you stay he growled and if you go near the strange blue dome youll get plenty dead savvy doc and monk sat down on polar bearskins there seemed to be nothing else to do for the time being and it was bitterly cold the prince howled and sang and swore for a while then fell over in a stupor and they rolled him up in more bearskins doc and monk began talking with their hands this is insane business monk fingered not so crazy doc replied john sunlight feels safe this far from new york city they were skilled in use of the finger alphabetic system used by deafanddumb persons but whats he doing here monk demanded making arrangements to sell something to various european nations it would appear doc responded doc that blue dome monk did not go any farther into this at the moment because there was an interruption giantia and titania came into the tent one carried a kettle of what seemed to be hot stew and the other had cups and a pot of hot coffee steam from the warm food boiled around the two big women cooks giantia grumbled here titania snapped and shoved the food at doc and monk evidently the large ladies were not satisfied with their lot they looked monk and doc over with distaste but no fear the two big women seemed to have infinite confidence in their own ability to handle any situation no normal women could have looked at doc and monk in the kind of disguises they now wore without feeling frightened suddenly doc straightened looked interested in something outside and cupped hands to his ears his pantomime was plain he meant that he had heard something outside very faint and he was listening it was perfectly natural that titania and giantia should also listen there was at the moment a lull in the arctic wind a voice drifted to them it was a voice that could be unmistakably identified as belonging to john sunlight giantia and titania this john sunlight voice said are fools they do not know their sister fifi is safe and in the hands of doc savages men there was a mumbling answer no words distinguishable both voices seemed far away reaching the tent only through some freak of the lulling wind but giantia and titania were staring at each other with the most stark shock that monk had ever seen fifi alive giantia croaked but she was in that ballyhoo plane doc savage blew her and the plane to bits titania said i then went silent for the john sunlight voice was going on as long as the two fool women think doc savage got their sister killed the voice said they will work with me they may be useful the voice cackled delightedly ive even made them think it ended that doc savage blew up that ballyhoo plane they dont know there was a radiocontrolled bomb in the plane and that fifi wasnt even in it that her voice was coming off a phonograph record that was the end of the john sunlight voice for the arctic wind had started to blow again with whining chill giantia and titania stood and stared at each other in incredulous amazement delight it had soaked in that fifi was alive leaped over their faces and titania opened her mouth doubtless to emit a yell of joy but giantia stopped her by clapping a hand over her mouth fool giantia hissed do you want him to know weve learned the truth titania subsided she assumed an expression of grim purpose im gonna break john sunlights back with my two hands she gritted giantia shook her head warningly shhh too risky i dont think we could get away with it then whatll we do i dont know giantia said well think it over but one thing sure well do something the two huge women stumbled out of the tent monk waited until they must be well away then rolled over close to doc savage doc monk breathed that was as nice a job of voice imitation and ventriloquism as i ever saw it should do no harm at least doc admitted which was probably as close as he ever came to admitting that he considered he had done a difficult piece of work rather well monk still had the strange blue dome on his mind but again he was sidetracked off that subject he listened then he threw a quick glance at doc savage half suspecting the bronze man might be imitating this new sound but obviously he wasnt a plane monk muttered then abrupt anxiety seized him maybe its ham and long tom he croaked maybe they misunderstood instructions and have come on here the arriving plane did not carry ham long tom and fifi it carried porto novyi that was the mans name although his name wasnt important since this was the only time he stood out particularly in the grim scheme of things the rest of the time he was just another harpy in the pack of soulsnatchers porto novyi was a squat wide man who had not been a siberian convict and had not been on the icebreaker he was a freelance pilot a swashbuckling daredevil who fought in wars for hire or did any other kind of flying that paid well neither laws nor human rights meant much to porto novyi he was scared of only one man in the world and that was john sunlight there was probably not a living person he would not have doublecrossed for money except john sunlight the plane swung down and landed it was a slim ship of remarkably advanced streamlining it was painted a color which camouflaged it against the sky it could hardly be seen from the earth when it flew at any considerable height moreover the two motors were scientifically silenced flying two miles up in the sky this plane could be a ghost porto novyi bounded out of the plane he was excited he ran a rolypoly figure in flying furs to the tent occupied by john sunlight he even neglected to give the blue dome thing his accustomed number of puzzled looks john sunlight looked sharply at the pilot did something happen to baron karl john sunlight demanded the aviator shook his head i took baron karl to a montreal airport he said john sunlight still looked concerned baron karl had been here to the arctic rendezvous and john sunlight had put on a demonstration of what he had to sell and everything had gone off well baron karl had seemed satisfied enthusiastic in fact that was important john sunlight needed ten million dollars from baron karls government he needed of course infinitely more money than that for what he had in mind but ten million of it was to come from baron karls government and it was imperative that nothing should interfere with that baron karl had promised to buy what john sunlight had to sell so it was very essential that baron karl remain satisfied i landed baron karl at montreal the pilot repeated he was enthusiastic about your proposition john sunlight frowned then what he demanded are you worried about a plane the flier growled plane whats wrong with that ship youre flying its the best i dont mean that one he growled you i refer to the plane the flier said which is resting on the snow about a hundred miles south of here john sunlight looked dumbfounded but i know of no such plane he exclaimed thats what i was afraid of the pilot agreed john sunlight got up and took a quick turn around the tent his feet causing the frozen snow under the tent floor to make squeaking noises it was bitterly cold and he had been putting on a show going around in light trousers and thin silk shirt pretending not even to notice the chill but now he forgot himself and gave a violent shiver he shook in fact until he all but fell down then he got control of himself and glowered it always aggravated him to have his control on himself slip it will be dark soon he said judging from the clouds it is going to be as dark as night before long porto novyi looked up through the misty grayness at the dark clouds gathering on the southern horizon and climbing up into the sky like stalking animals as dark as night the pilot agreed well drop some men off by parachute john sunlight said and have a look at that mysterious plane you marked the location exactly did you i can take off blindfolded and find that plane the flier said because its standing beside an open lead in the ice the only open water i saw for a thousand miles chapter delilah long tom and ham were finding it comfortable waiting beside the open lead in the ice the open lead meant open water a crack where the ice pack had spread apart leaving a narrow salty lake which had not frozen long tom and ham had landed on this water after first looking it over to make sure there were no floating ice blocks it was the only suitable landing place they had been able to find so they had come down although the spot was too close to a direct line to the southward for their liking their plane was a type that could land on water snow or earth the cabin was snug and readily kept warm moreover they wore special arctic gear which doc savage had developed garments that were chemically heated the plane stood on the ice they had driven it up there with the motors and it was poised for a quick takeoff should the ice lead threaten to close or should they get a call from doc savage fifi was pouting she had turned out to be consistent with her pouting and it aggravated long tom although ham didnt seem to mind ham indeed seemed to enjoy listening to fifis complaining just now long tom was listening to ham tell fifi what a sweet pretty brave patient little creature she was ahrrr long tom said disgustedly he got out of the plane wind caught his clothes and shook them and the snow particles stung his face he walked around the plane to make sure that no light was showing from the shaded windows it was intensely dark the clouds that had been hunched in the south now turned the whole sky black the small waves in the open lead made slapping noises from time to time there was a long nimbling grunt as the ice floes cracked sometimes the ice made gunshot reports a characteristic of freezing floes long tom felt along the side of the plane for a wire he found it but an instant before just as he came near the wire there was a whining sound inside the plane the wire was spread in a huge circle around the plane in the same fashion that cowboys spread a rope around their bedrolls when they bed down on the range thinking to keep away the snakes but this wire was more efficient the wire was a capacity burglar alarm if anyone came near it carrying a rifle or some piece of metal of like size a delicately balanced electrical field around the wire was disturbed and carefully adjusted apparatus in the plane would give an alarm satisfied the alarm was operating the machine pistol long tom carried in an armpit holster was metal enough to set it off the feeblelooking electrical wizard climbed back into the plane that capacity alarm was his pet he had an infinite amount of confidence in the thing they were just deciding to go to sleep when the buzzer whined again ham and long tom went into action as if a starting gun had fired ham sailed into the cockpit grabbed switches the big motors chemical heaters had kept them warm exploded into life long tom landed spreadlegged in the center of the cabin knocked another switch this ignited flares the flares had been planted in the ice near the plane they were high on light collapsible rods and reflectors threw the light away from the plane kept it from blinding those in the craft a glare as white as the sun spread hundreds of yards in all directions from the plane the white blaze disclosed three furclad figures they were about seventyfive yards distant friends no that was soon settled down they went their rifles came up and jacketed bullets began hitting the plane the lead slugs made big drumstick noises but did not come into the plane because its cabin was alloyarmored take off long tom yelled ham barked theres only three of take off long tom roared i dont like this ham fed the engines gas long tom picked his machine pistol out of its bolster used the muzzle to prod open the lid of a firing port in the plane cabin he latched the pistol in singlefire position he shot the gun noise was not big but the sound its bullet made was astounding the slug was highexplosive a cloud of ice flew up in front of the three riflemen long tom shot again this time at one of the men this second bullet was a mercy slug it would cause unconsciousness without doing much damage but apparently he missed with that one the third shot he put in front of the trio this bullet hit and became a cloud of black smoke that was how the supermachine pistol charge alternated one explosive one mercy one smoke barrage the plane tore its runners loose from the ice wallowed forward like a duck splashed into the water well lay em out from the air long tom yelled but first we gotta find out what this means the plane scudded along the lead the water was black heaving ominous in the light but it was good enough for a takeoff goodenough water but the plane never made it the reason it didnt was a bomb a bomb that fell from a plane which came down in a silent dive the bomb was almost a direct hit a geyser of water climbed the plane almost in the middle of it the plane wings folded downward like a sick bird then the plane seemed to complete a convulsive jump and fell over on its back porto novyi war pilot for money was good at his trade water gushed into the plane cabin the bomb had opened a rip in the side help fifi screeched help help and she went off into senseless hysterical shrieking ham and long tom fought to get the girl to the plane door to get the door open the door on that side had jammed they tried the other water pressed against it then they got it open and water jumped in with a great gurgling whoop and mauled them around in the cabin they fought back to the door hung to its edge pulled themselves and fifi outside the plane was under sinking the water felt incredibly cold for they had been warm and comfortable in the plane it chopped at them like a million knives that water it seemed frozen ages before they got to the surface the three men with rifles were standing on the edge of the ice one lifted a rifle and the bullet hitting the water beside long toms head sounded as though a firecracker had gone off hold it one of the riflemen shouted savage isnt there no more bullets bit the men with the rifles gestured shouted there was nothing to do but for long tom and ham to swim to the men hauling fifi she screamed and tried to climb on top of them she fought them madly overhead the plane came diving back its superbly silenced motor made a noise only a little greater than the wind satisfied the pilot made another circle then came down in a landing glide toward the open lead of water that plane too was equipped to land on ice snow water or earth come out the rifleman who gave that order was civan climbing out of water onto slick ice was hard work long tom and ham knowing how it was done threw their arms up on the ice and waited for the quick cold to freeze the fur of their garments to the ice then they got themselves out and dragged fifi onto the ice fifi kicked and struck at them cried at the top of her voice stop that long tom gritted she paid them no attention you little idiot long tom hissed you made us bring you along she kept on squealing civan growled an order one of the two riflemen went away and came back shortly dragging three parachutes obviously chutes by which the men had descended quietly from the plane the plane taxied up a man out on the nose kept it from bumping the ice too hard using a boat hook porto novyi the pilot put his dark unpleasant face out of the cockpit windows are those flares about burned out he demanded just about porto novyi turned on his plane landing lights and thereafter these illuminated the scene question them porto novyi ordered im running this civan said civan jabbed his rifle at ham and long tom strip to your underwear he gritted ham was cold but he suddenly got much colder well freeze he gasped you cant id love to see you freeze civan snarled wed all love to see you freeze strip ham and long tom got their soaked fur garments off after which they knew they would freeze to death in at the most half an hour where is doc savage civan demanded that obviously was a question that long tom and ham could not afford to answer they were actors enough not to glance at each other not to give any sign that they were making up a story turning slowly ham stood shivering and looking at the dark squirming water of the lead he did nothing but that for a moment then suddenly he fell to his knees and broke into realistic sobs dont take it so hard long tom said miserably i kukcant huhhelp it ham sobbed what the hell is this civan snarled doc savage was in that plane long tom gulped he was killed by the bomb this was an out and out untruth but under the circumstances long tom did not feel like letting a lack of veracity trouble him doc savage dead civan began to grin yuh yes ham sobbed suddenly ham sprang to his feet and gave every indication of intending to spring upon civan and the others in a griefcrazed rage you killed doc he shrieked it was good acting and civan was convinced all right he said we might as well shoot them and finish off all the blasted trouble theyve caused long tom suddenly relieved said thanks thanks civan was startled what for for shooting us long tom said grimly i wouldnt care about being left to freeze to death i figured that was about your caliber so thanks for the shooting go ahead civan ordered shoot them fifi screamed then all her other screams were mere kitten mewings compared to this one if there were polar bears within miles they must have started running no she screeched you they lied to you doc savage wasnt in the plane long tom yelled shut up but fifi was scared she didnt see the slightest chance of going on living she didnt know that ham and long tom were gathered to leap backward into the water and that they had other plans if that was successful i can tell you where doc savage is fifi screeched where civan demanded fifi was not too scared to bargain you take me to john sunlight she gasped cunningly and ill show him doc savage civan said take her in the plane they boosted the cute little delilah into the plane civan and the other two riflemen climbed into the craft hey long tom squalled you said you wouldnt leave us to freeze and i change my mind sometimes civan shouted at them long tom and ham stood in thin cotton underwear and woolen socks on the ice and watched the plane scud down the lead and take the air the craft once it was off cut its lights so that there was only the hissing of engine exhaust to mark its presence then that sound left and there remained nothing but darkness and intense cold the noise of waves slopping the ice and the chill whining of the arctic wind that blew interminably carrying a fine fog of snow particles that hit their naked skin and felt like needles in that chill darkness in this lost waste there was one thing that stood out with the staring certainty of death the nearest civilization was thousands and thousands of miles to the south and they were two practically naked men left alone swell long tom said it could be worse ham admitted say if you hadnt given him that speech about not leaving us to freeze i dont think he would have done this contrary isnt he long tom remarked he had a little difficulty with his speech because his teeth insisted on hitting together lets get busy ham croaked before our teeth get knocked flat they walked judging their directions carefully in the darkness until they reached a drift of snow they kicked into the drift scooped with their hands searched hidden in the drift was the cache of equipment they had placed there against possible emergencies taking a leaf out of doc savages book they had overlooked no bets they found the cache there was clothing food a tent rifles a sled the sled could be covered with the tent thus converting it into a boat with which they could cross open leads there was a compass sextant for finding their way to a destination they dressed then ran and jumped until their circulation was restored best of all there was a portable shortwave radio with which they could contact help the plane came back while they were setting up the radio it dived dropped a flare the flare swung from a parachute and stayed in the air a long time and when it hit the ice the plane dropped another one the plane also dropped a few bombs and sent down many bullets long tom and ham eventually had to throw away their rifles and hold up their arms otherwise they would have died the plane landed on the lead and civan came to confront them and cackle pleasantly i got to thinking civan growled about the reputation this doc savage crowd has got they didnt get that rep for nothing i thinks so we came back lucky for us eh long tom and ham were loaded into the plane and tied hand and foot you see civan explained we contacted john sunlight by radio and he says to keep you alive we may be able to use you as hostages to keep this doc savage off our neck if worse comes to worse fifi whimpered in the cabin i wonder if we shouldnt just shoot you and put you out of your misery civan growled but im going to show doc savage to you fifi wailed one of the bullets ham and long tom had fired up at the plane had damaged the wiring of one motor it could be repaired but it would take a little time porto novyi the pilot set about making the repairs chapter the poisoned seal john sunlight having contacted civan and the plane by radio knew about the delay caused by the necessary motor repairs he said pleasantly enough that he didnt mind but he did he spoke pleasantly because he considered that his expedition had done a very nice piece of work wasnt fifi going to show them where doc savage could be found of course the silly little fool of a girl wouldnt tell anybody but john sunlight she probably thought she could save herself in that fashion fifi did not know john sunlight very well john sunlight took a walk over to the tent wherein slept the prince he kicked the prince in the ribs got him awake can you use your eyes yet john sunlight demanded the prince did not relish being kicked in the ribs i can see much better he snarled john sunlight was pleased in half an hour he said i shall make my demonstration for you you mean the prince gritted that youll show me why i made this crazy trip up here exactly john sunlight then walked out of the tent the prince still rankling over being kicked in the ribs rushed over and kicked monk beauty several times to relieve his feelings ill kick your voice hack into you he roared he had no success but he felt better get out of here he screamed i hate the sight of your ugly faces doc and monk did not like the sight of the princes face any better by now and they were very willing to get out of the tent providing the guard outside would let them they scrambled out through the tent door and confronted john sunlight john sunlight stood a tall dark tower of a figure he had given up his show of not feeling the cold and had donned dark clothing and a black cape and an aviators black helmet he presented a picture that was not in any sense pleasant he showed his teeth your master treats you roughly he said he spoke these words in the tongue which adonis and beauty were supposed to use doc replied he spoke the tongue fluently as he spoke many others our lot is not a bad one doc replied in the language he used the illiterate form of the tongue as adonis might be expected to do you have been with his highness long john sunlight asked a long time doc replied promptly he didnt know whether that was the correct answer there had been no time to check on all details of the princes two bodyguards where were you born john sunlight asked doc immediately named a small mountain town in the princes native land i have heard of the place john sunlight said then he added well you will be out of the cold weather before long your master will probably start back at dawn i shall send you all in one of my planes he walked away monk breathed doc we could grab him now no the bronze man whispered we have to learn exactly what he is doing we have to be sure we suspect the truth but we are not sure k monk said but this prince is gonna get strangled if i hafta bodyguard im much longer doc said we had better make a try for that equipment case want me to help you go get it doc said i will stay here and try to alibi your absence in case you are missed doc savage watched monk move away the homely chemist was lost in the blackness of the brooding dark clouds almost at once and the drifting snow covered his footprints there was no sign of the guard who had been watching the tent and doc wondered about what had become of the fellow that mystery was not long being clarified there was a sudden frightened outcry from a nearby igloo there was genuine horror in the voice it was the guard the fellow had evidently gotten cold crawled into an igloo to keep warm and dozed off john sunlight had found him missing and put men hunting for him another guard appeared shortly he had an electric lantern and he was too concerned over the failure of the other guard not staying on the job to order doc back in the tent the poor fool the new guard muttered he should have known better evidently he referred to the other guard monk would be coming back soon something had to be done about that doc began to sing there was not much music in his singing but there was volume and sense if one understood ancient mayan the language which he and his men used for private conversation over and over he told monk to be careful to wait until a propitious moment to show himself doc allowed plenty of time time enough that he knew monk was lying low out in the darkness then the bronze man took a coin out of his pocket and began to play with it he tossed it high and caught it cackling like the halfwitted oaf he resembled in his disguise directly what looked like the inevitable happened the coin flew over hit the side of the tent and skidded down into the snow doc gasped ran to look for the coin the guard watched idly when doc beckoned him to help the man came over on that side of the tent and began kicking around in the snow monk your chance doc called in mayan he made it sound as if he were saying something disgusted about losing the coin when doc found the coin and entered the tent monk was inside looking innocent the guard thanks to the diversion had not seen him return the prince apparently had rolled up in his blankets again and gone back to sleep he must be a physical wreck it was not hard to believe doc shook him gently and the dissolute fellow snored he was asleep where is the case monk doc breathed its cached in a snowbank about forty feet from the tent monk whispered if you could follow my tracks you can find all right doc said you hold the fort down for a while now but how you gonna leave that guard doc used a sharp knife he and monk had not been searched and opened a slit in the rear of the tent he opened it close to the floor and after he crawled out tied the canvas together again with a spare four inches of shoestring monk inside placed bearskin sleeping covers against the spot and it was temporarily unnoticeable doc faded away quickly in the darkness keeping low he circled and found not without some difficulty monks tracks the wind was filling them rapidly it was only by bending low and watching the reflection of the tent guards electric lantern that doc was able to locate monks footprints at all once he had found them he managed to help along the business of following the prints by utilizing the sense of touch later the bronze man located the equipment ease which monk had buried carrying it doc retreated a short distance then opened the case principal item in the equipment box was a portable shortwave radio outfit doc spent ten minutes in a futile effort to contact ham and long tom he was worried enough over that after he had checked the radio and was sure it was putting out a signal to make his strange low trilling sound he made it unconsciously and the instant he realized what he was doing he stopped the exotic note had an unusual carrying power he listened but it was evident no one had heard probably everyone but john sunlight would have been astounded at what doc savage did next and what happened as a result doc concealed about his person such articles of equipment as he might need there was nothing astounding about that nor about the fact that he concealed the radio outfit in the snow again next the bronze man moved off in the darkness crawling much of the time and came to an igloo it was an eskimo ieloovegak an igloo doc found the long tumid that was part of the igloo entrance crept in and moved past small foodstorage igloos called suksos into the bigger room of iceblocks where the eskimos lived there were animal skins on the floor the walls and ceiling had been darkened by blubber lamp soot and around the smoke vent in the ceiling a swelling of frost had gathered almost circling the interior of the igloo was the iceblock shelf which served the same purpose for the eskimos as the studio couch serves new york apartment dwellers a blubber lamp burned in the center of the igloo giving off a dark worm of smoke there were sleeping froms around the shelf doc went to one of the sleepers touched him aput the bronze man said do not be alarmed i am doc savage aput opened his eyes he was a sturdy man whose face was rutted by the years he stared at doc savage unbelievingly doc savage aput muttered you do not look but it is your voice aput was one of the group of eskimos whom john sunlight had found living on the rocky island of the strange blue dome aput was one of those who had first looked john sunlight in the eye and insisted they could not see any weird blue dome that it didnt even exist that had been of course a clever trick to further bewilder and confuse john sunlight aput was a venerable man still a great hunter in spite of his years and a man who was looked to for advice and leadership he was not correctly speaking the chief because this little group of eskimos had no chief the eskimo word angakocet better described aputs position among his people aiigakoeet was the vernacular for medicine man which meant that aput was a combined oracle and fatherconfessor the man who had the most influence aput knew doc savage very well obviously it was several moments before aput recovered from his astonishment at seeing the bronze man clijino aput muttered fervently welcome thank you doc savage said quietly in the eskimo tongue it moves me deeply to hear you make me welcome when it is plain that i have caused you much sorrow and trouble aput shrugged and got out of his sleeping skins took doc savages hand and shook it we have been hoping you would come he said elarle indeed yes doc saw that aput had nothing to wear but a sealskin singlet your clothing the bronze man asked this john sunlight aput said took away our clothing long ago it is to prevent our escaping they count each bearskin and sealskin daily so that we will not be able to make any of them into garments we are given clothing to go out to hunt and armed men go along and after the hunting our clothing is taken away again doc savage was grimly silent when did sunlight come akkane aput replied the word akkane meant last year they were on a great boat a boat as big as a hundred urmiaks aput continued it was crushed in the ice they come ashore we take them food but this strange dark one called john sunlight got to want only to enter the strange blue dome that was bad doc said very bad aput agreed john sunlight tried to starve us into telling him what the strange blue dome was we pretended to be very ignorant eskimos that was good doc said aput smiled wryly we were doing as you told us we were doing the thing for which you brought us here we were following your orders not to allow anyone to enter the strange blue dome and to take care of what was inside the dome doc said aput nodded yes but we failed for john sunlight watched one of us and saw that the secret door opened when we came near it with the white rabbit cape he seemed to guess how it operated john sunlight doc said is clever enough to know all about magnetically operated relays and dooropeners particularly since he would have little difficulty finding the tiny permanent magnets sewed in the lining of the white rabbit cape aput was silent a moment his face clouded with grim memory this john sunlight got into the strange blue dome he said and thereafter weird and horrible things began to happen aput closed his eyes and shuddered there was the time one of my people turned into a black ghost of smoke and blew away that happened to an eskimo here doc asked yes aput said and shuddered again doc savages metallic features went grave john sunlight was making a test he decided test aput was puzzled you do not understand aput doc said quietly there are many mysterious and terrible things in that strange blue dome you would not understand them the bronze man shook his head slowly few people in the world would understand many of them so it is too bad that a man with john sunlights type of mind had to discover the dome aputs curiosity was sharpened what were those things in the dome that you told us never to touch he asked things that the world was better off without doc said i do not understand aput said doc savage patted the old medicine mans shoulder if you found a seal that was poison aput doc said what would you do with it aput answered promptly i would bury the poisoned seal he said where none would ever find it doc made a short grim sound that was my idea too he said he went on he spoke quickly for time was getting short and advised aput how to help when the fight against john sunlight started aput said he would spread the word among his people to be ready chapter demonstration when doc savage his adonis disguise was holding up very well in the coldcrawled back into the princes tent he had hardly replaced the slitted canvas when there was a commotion outside it meant that john sunlights men had come for the prince monk doc breathed ham and long tom did not answer my radio call monks mouth fell open but what on earth could a happened to em he gulped there was no time to discuss that because a swarthy head shoved into the tent and said john sunlight wants the prince the prince was still in his drunken sleep monk winked slightly at the others then gave the prince a terrific kick on the part of the anatomy most generally kicked monk sprang back looked quite innocent as the prince awoke and turned the adjacent arctic air blue with profanity monk had been aching to kick the besotted prince they were not taken to a tent their escort led them to an igloo a large one made expertly of snow blocks wellfrozen actually there was one large igloo and three more built against it like a cluster of grapes with one big grape john sunlight lost no time in getting down to business i am going to tell you a story he said the prince blinked stupidly story it concerns an amazing man john sunlight said this man was do i have to listen to your bragging the prince asked impolitely john sunlight frowned and looked as though he had made a mental note to raise his price to the prince an extra million dollars for that crack this is not the story of myself john sunlight said coldly no one will ever know that story this is another tale a brief synopsis of the fantastic life of one human being it is a story which illustrates to what extent a human mind can be developed im not very interested the prince said john sunlight ignored the interruption this man he said was taken from the cradle literally and put into the hands of scientists who were ordered to train the child they did so and the child grew into a young man who possessed a fantastic brain people sometimes call him superhuman but he is not that he is only a scientific product humph the prince grunted about that demonstrationthis scientifically trained young man john sunlight continued dedicated himself to a strange career a career of aiding mankind and of increasing his own knowledge that he might help the human race in other words this young man continued to studystudystudy the prince shook his flabby shoulders impatiently it sounds damned dry and uninteresting to me he said john sunlights dark poetic face remained composed study he said studystudythat was the young mans occupation in every spare moment the most intense kind of study study that demanded solitude no interruptions the prince shrugged lit a cigarette solitude said john sunlight was what this unusual young man had to have so he came here into the arctic and found this island the prince abruptly became interested here he said yes say who is this this scientific marvel youre talking about doc savage john sunlight said the prince started violently doc savage you seem to have heard of him john sunlight said dryly as a matter of fact the prince had heard of doc savage and so had the rogues who composed his cabinet in his native land a number of times they had discussed doc savage and the possibility of the man of bronze appearing in their nation to attempt to remedy certain cruel malpractice on the part of the prince and his government doc savage had a habit of doing such things theyd heard and that was why a strict censorship had been clapped down on news that left the country they didnt want the mysterious almost legendary man of bronze to learn too much about the succession of political assassinations in the land i have heard of doc savage the prince admitted er faintly john sunlight smiled wolfishly i imagined you had the prince swallowed uneasily doc savage you mean he scratched his head worked his loose mouth around in several shapes then got an inkling of the truth you mean that doc savage he constructed that blue dome the blue dome john sunlight said is the fortress of solitude fortress of huh the fortress of solitude john sunlight said is the place which doc savage created so that he would have a place to do his studying in solitude the prince gulped and muttered that it all seems fantastic john sunlight nodded you must understand that doc savage is something of a fantastic person a man who is many generations ahead of the day in scientific knowledge this place here this fortress of solitude was unknown to the world it was built by eskimos under doc savages direction with materials brought in by a huge transport plane the construction took a long time at this point monk mayfair realized his mouth was hanging open and he closed it this story that john sunlight was telling might sound fantastic to the prince monk however knew it was true he had known the fortress of solitude existed he had not known where it lay or exactly what it was doc savage had never told the bronze man simply disappeared from his usual haunts sometimes for months at a time and during these absences it was absolutely impossible to get in touch with him when doc came back from these absences he explained simply that he had been at his fortress of solitude and usually too he brought back some new invention or the solution of some complicated problem of science or surgery the fortress of solitude monk knew it must be a marvelous place a great laboratory probably monk who was something of a chemical wizard himself had often wished he could see what kind of a chemical laboratory doc kept in the fortress it must be amazingly complete undoubtedly the finest in existence an interruption shocked monk out of his reverie a plane there was a plane circling in the arctic gloom overhead a man put his head into the big igloo civan and the others are arriving in the plane he announced john sunlight gathered his darkred cape around him he had worn black earlier in the evening but now he had changed colors again and wore an impressive bloodyred ensemble it gave him the aspect of a satanic alchemist he was probably aware of that bring civan and the others here he ordered as soon as they land he laughed then a laugh that was a quick ugly report i want everyone in the plane here for my demonstration he added the messenger went away now john sunlight continued i shall finish my story of doc savage and the fortress of solitude which the bronze man thought no one would ever discover the prince licked his lips uneasily he was learning for the first time that he was involved in something that concerned doc savage and the idea was giving him a worse case of the jitters than he had ever gotten out of a bottle for some time now john sunlight said doc savage has been following his unusual career and in the course of it he has captured a number of amazing inventions the princes mouth fell open inventions said john sunlight which doc savage considered a menace to the world among these is the machine which through creation of an unusual type of concentrated magnetic field stops atomic motion entirely monk took a deep breath a great many things were coming clear to the homely chemist john sunlight said ill explain about atoms he took a onecent piece out of a pocket this coin for instance is made of copper and copper is made up of molecules the molecules are in turn composed of atoms and each atom is a nucleus of electrons just what the electrons are composed of is a matter about which science is not certain but it is believed they are electrical in nature at any rate the electrons travel in gravitational orbits with a good deal of space between them somewhat like our solar system the earth the moon sun and planets in case john sunlight went on the motion of the electrons is stopped the result is to all practical effects and purposes a complete disintegration of matter monk swallowed that stuff about molecules atoms and electrons was straight stuff so was the surmise about what would happen if electronic movement could be stopped but as far as monk knew no one had ever stopped it still john sunlight was continuing doc savage perfected a device he said which by creating a magnetic field of superlative intensity completely stops atomic motion and results in the collapse of any matter in that field the prince wrinkled his bulbous forehead what is this leading up to he demanded you read about serge mafnoff the russian diplomat john sunlight demanded i the prince looked stunned look here did he did serge mafnoff was the victim of doc savages death machine as we will call it john sunlight moved his red cloak a little you see i had a score to settle with serge mafnoff and i also wished to call the worlds attention to my mur ah death device at this point the plane which had been circling repeatedly landed it taxied up outside its motors died excuse me john sunlight said he went out he was gone about five minutes then he came back in several of his men trailed behind all carrying rifles along with them they brought the prisoners ham long tom and fifi no one happened to be looking at homely monk at that instant that was fortunate because monks selfcontrol slipped he couldnt help showing his shock at seeing ham and long tom prisoners doc savages metallic features remained inscrutable having failed to contact ham and long tom by radio he had half feared something like this line them up john sunlight growled the prince looked at the captives and was puzzled he had never seen them before john sunlight asked where are giantia and titania theyre in their igloo a man said i looked a minute ago go and make sure john sunlight ordered they must not know that this sister fifi is alive they would turn on me later we will take care of them the man left to see about giantia and titania now john sunlight said well proceed the prince put in peevishly why not get around to the demonstration whatever it is this is getting me confused you realize john sunlight said sharply that i have just described a scientific death machine to you so what i dont see war eh war you fool war the prince yelled who you calling a fool im a king dont forget that john sunlights grip on his patience slipped a trifle and the snapping evil of the man showed in his eyes he calmed himself with this electronstopping war machine be said you can conquer your neighboring nation ruled by the prime minister whose agent is the baron karl i believe you would like to do that a flash of greed jumped over the princes dissolute face that he said is true ill sell you the war machine john sunlight said for eleven million dollars eleven the prince ejaculated you said ten earlier i hadnt been insulted then john sunlight told him calmly whatever the prince was going to say it was obviously to be explosive remained unuttered because a man dashed wildly into the igloo he was the fellow who had been sent to see about giantia and titania the big women are gone he squalled john sunlights poetic face became ugly i thought you looked into the igloo a few minutes ago they had piled up snow under their sleeping robes the man groaned made it look like they were asleep john sunlight yelled orders civan he howled take four men with guns and begin hunting those women civan shoved four men out of the big igloo and followed himself john sunlight had been trembling a little he was a nervous man and when excitement came he sometimes lost some of his control he forced himself to become calm now he said i shall if you think ill pay you eleven million for anything youre crazy the prince yelled john sunlight looked at the poor sample of royalty and being shorttempered at the instant he did not mince words remember the newspaper stories about the mysterious blackness that appeared around serge mafnoffs house in new york city he asked yes the prince growled but that that was another war machine john sunlight snapped the blackness was caused by a combination of short electrical waves and highfrequency sonic vibrations which paralyze the functions of the rodandcone mechanism of the optic nerves in eyes in other words a blinding ray i that too is a doc savage invention i sold it john sunlight said to baron karl and your enemy the neighboring nation they will use it against you the prince blanched his mouth worked could not make words you will have to buy the electron machine john sunlight said coldly to defend your country the prince looked around for a seat and sagged to it damn you he gritted john sunlight was satisfied he jerked his head slightly now we show the prince what happens when the electrons are stopped in a human body he said i suppose we had better tie the victim john sunlight slanted an arm at the huge grotesque creature whom the prince had accepted as his bodyguard adonis we will use that man doc savage john sunlight said fifi he is the one isnt he yes fifi said that is doc savage chapter mad hour there were a few occasions in his life when doc savage had been caught flatfooted this was one of them he began doing things about it rifles were coming up doc whipped forward he made for john sunlight but the strange poeticfaced man with the distorted mind was fast he was faster than even doc had dreamed he pitched widewise got behind some of his men went on toward the snow hole that led into one of the smaller connecting igloos a rifle crashed the bullet hit docs chest and he would have died then except for the bulletproof vest from the equipment case which he had donned as it was the slug tilted him sidewise doc went on down hit ham and long toms ankles they toppled doc had a knife out of his clothing by then his i doc savage adventure fortress of i speed was blinding he slashed got hams wrists loose long tom and ham were bound with ropes doc left the knife in hams hands left ham to finish freeing himself and long tom monk had hold of a man now the hairy chemists great hands made the victim scream monk lifted the fellow slammed him against others two men fell on doc they tried shortrange clubbing with rifles doc rolled with them all in a tangle the bronze man was trying to reach the hole into which john sunlight had gone unexpectedly john sunlight came back out of the hole he came fast and an instant after he was through it a gun blasted in the smaller igloo which he had just left the bullet missed john sunlight but a man in the larger igloo screeched and started a jig trying to plug a leak in his chest with his hands titania came out of the small igloo she had a rifle her huge sister giantia was close behind also with a rifle they both shot at john sunlight again but he got out of the big igloo into the arctic night without being hit giantia and titania ran to their little sister fifi and thereafter gave no thought to anything but protecting her monk ham long tom were all fighting now not a man was on his feet they flailed around on the floor and a gun banged now and then doc got on his feet turned around and around like a discus thrower and slammed his two opponents against the ice walls of the igloo they dropped back somewhat broken then old aput the eskimo came through the igloo door like a greased brown bullet he had few clothes but he did have a short oonapik the little hunting spear of his people other eskimos followed some with oonapiks others with only the small halfmoon knives used in domestic work called ooloos they joined the igloo fray there was no real need of doc after that john sunlight was outside so was civan the pilot porto novyi and doc did not know how many others but a score at least the men who had been on the soviet icebreaker on which the convicts had escaped from siberia how many of those would turn against john sunlight now was a question some of them surely then there were the rest of the eskimos friends but unarmed the odds were still terrible doc dived into the adjoining small igloo into which john sunlight had tried to get his guess was right the apparatus for stopping electronic motion the machine that had killed diplomat serge mafnoff was there the powerful coils and tubes were heating that took a little time john sunlight had evidently switched on the device but giantia and titania had been hiding in there and had driven out john sunlight the device operated from heavy highvoltage storage batteries doc picked up a battery smashed it down on the contraption picked up the battery smashed again crushed broken destroyed until finally the death machine was a hopelessly ruined tangle that would never function again it was not as mad as it looked the scientific device as remarkable as it was had no great value as a weapon john sunlight had been perpetrating a species of hoax on the prince for the electronicstopping machine would not work at a distance of much more than twenty feet when it had killed serge mafnoff it had been hidden in the unused part of the attic the marks on the sills had been left by boards on which the device stood when it killed it had killed through the attic wall for it was only where the magnetic and sonic beams met their focal point that the effect was obtained having smashed the apparatus doc picked a single bar of steel a permanent magnet out of the mess then he dived back into the larger igloo fighting there was done victims were spread out on the floor and monk was dancing around tying himself into knots in an effort to learn the depth of a cut he had received in the back john sunlight doc rapped get him old aput before doc could stop him shot for tile igloo door hit on his stomach sledded he must have gone out of many an igloo in a hurry in his time to become that skilled a rifle whacked old aput came sliding back in just as fast and when he stopped sledding began trying to straighten out his right arm which a bullet had broken they wait with guns he yelled back wall doc said they went to work on the rear wall ice blocks were thick there was no time to chip they hit the wall doc and monk who were strongest they learned that ice could be like steel then the ice broke a great mass of blocks toppling outward and they landed in the snow and cold for forty yards or so doc and the others traveled with all their speed and doc covered the whole distance before some of the others made half of it then they were down behind an ice ridge giantia and titania had remained in the igloo with fifi there was a crash a grenade the igloo jumped apart blocks of ice flying then giantia and titania came running and dragging fifi guns snapped but they made it and got down behind the ice ridge with doc and the others doc lifted his voice turn against john sunlight now he called and you will be free of the fellow the bronze mans voice was enormous a rumble that carried with the volume of a public address loudspeaker his words were for the benefit of those who had courage to turn on john sunlight and they had an effect a rifle banged and a man screamed a man it was porto novyi the pilot set off a flare banging it by its parachute from one of the plane wings the glow ignited the fighting half a dozen men or more had turned on john sunlights group they were fighting a strange kind of civil war of their own in the icy wind and drifting flourfine snow eskimos came running to join the fray monk reared up and roared boy i aint gonna miss this upwind doc ordered we have some gas grenades but the gas grenades did them no good john sunlight saw them running guessed their intent and shouted orders john sunlight and his faction broke away and fled in retreat toward the strange blue dome that was doc savages mysterious fortress of solitude it was a chase then a wild mad race with death made of lead passing through the air of hitting ice and glancing off with violinlike whining it was dark the polar sky packed with clouds that was why john sunlight and his men managed to reach the strange blue dome had there been light they would have been picked off doc racing furiously taking chances saw the panel in the side of the strange blue dome closing it was shut when he hit it he snatched the permanent magnet from a pocket it was the magnet he had taken from the death device but it had no effect when he held it close to the dooropening mechanism inside they had jammed the door apparatus doc whirled met monk and the others back he rapped get way back he was running with the words going out across the stone island in what was apparently a senseless direction most of them stared at the bronze man in amazement but monk making speed with his short legs trailed doc he lost ground steadily and began to think that doc was going to continue out across the arctic ice but doc stopped and when monk reached him the bronze man was on his knees at the edge of the rocky islet doc was knocking snow aside with his hands maneuvering the naked stone obviously searching monk watched there was silence except for his breathing and the breathing of the bronze man the steaming plumes of their breath blew away from their lips once far out in the ice fields there was a cannon report as a floe cracked then doc found what he was seeking a crack apparently he began to lay the permanent magnet on various parts of the stone as if he were using its attraction to work a combination there was a crunching and a section of the rock flew up lid fashion doc dropped into the aperture it was only a box in it were two switches doc threw one of them monk knowing something was going to happen turned his eyes toward the great dome of glasslike blue he waited seemingly an age finally doc nothing nothing he breathed and couldnt find the words to go on gas the bronze man said in a low voice it may work may not when the place was built the gas was installed against such an emergency as this the bronze man suddenly looked weary and battered the trouble was he added the place was so remote that i got to thinking no one would ever find it so i stored those infernal machines here i should have destroyed them monk said weve captured some pretty devilish scientific devices in our time yes monk doc said queerly the strangeness of the bronze mans tone caused monk to glance at him are all those contraptions in that blue dome doc monk asked wryly every one of them doc said hollowly they waited there was no sign of life from the arching blue halfsphere of the fortress of solitude ham and long tom and the eskimos tired of waiting moved back some of them and went to inspect the igloos and tents of john sunlights camp searching for enemies treating the wounded and binding those who might offer resistance later ham approached doc savage the prince got his ham said grimly yes that grenade john sunlights men threw into the big igloo ham explained probably killed the prince instantly chapter will terror come thirty minutes later doc savage opened the fortress of solitude they had to destroy a plane to do it they sent the craft full speed against the side of the strange blue dome doc savage did this selecting the spot then leaping out of the racing craft and the impact of the heavy motors smashed a hole large enough for them to crawl inside one at a time only doc monk ham and long tom were allowed to enter they wore gas masks they had found the masks in john sunlights equipment once inside they saw senseless forms lying about and knew the gas had been effective they had often wondered monk ham and long tom what this fortress in solitude was like they saw now and it exceeded if anything what they had imagined monk saw a chemical laboratory which for completeness and advanced equipment was far beyond anything he had ever seen or expected to see in america and abroad monk had a reputation as one of the greatest living chemists particularly in advanced chemistry but here in this laboratory he saw apparatus after apparatus so advanced that the nature of which he couldnt even grasp blazes monk breathed in awe long tom the electrical wizard saw an electrical experimental setup which took his breath it made his fingers itch drew him like a magnet his own laboratory in new york city and the one doc maintained in the new york skyscraper headquarters was a childs experimenting set compared to this ham the lawyer did not see any law books ham was no great enthusiast as a scientist so it was ham who wandered around gathering up the unconscious john sunlight faithfuls and passing them out through the hole in the side of the blue dome the construction of the dome the strange blue glasslike material of which it was made did interest ham he asked doc about that and learned it was a form of glass composition which could be welded with heat and which had strength far beyond that of true glass the welding operation explained how the dome had been constructed without joints the stuff had the advantage of being a nonconductor which meant that it kept out the cold but construction details suddenly ceased to worry ham he ran to doc savage doc ham exploded john sunlight hes not here john sunlight not here the bronze man sounded incredulous then they searched searched furiously doc savage who knew every cranny of the fortress of solitude went over everything repeatedly he examined the prisoners to make sure none of them was john sunlight in disguise then with breathless intensity they began a widespread search they did not find john sunlight they did not find his body it was doc savage who located footprints that must have been john sunlights and by the tracks they knew that john sunlight had not entered the strange blue dome with his men he had gone around the dome and hidden in the snow then when he saw his men had been defeated he had fled john sunlights tracks led out across the arctic ice pack doc savage followed the footprints for two days and came to a patch of frozen red gore on the edge of an open lead in the ice there beside the water the traces showed that a monster polar bear had come out of the lead and attacked john sunlight they found john sunlights rifle a little of his clothing that was all standing there on the edge of the lead wondering if they were faced with evidence that john sunlight had finally died monk sighed deeply i pity the bear that eats that guy the homely chemist muttered doc savage spoke quietly if john sunlight is not dead the bronze man said we may have something pretty terrible ahead of us they stared at him what do you mean doc then he told them something they had not known before there were almost a score of deadly scientific devices stored in the fortress of solitude he said theyre gone that didnt quite soak in you mean i mean doc said grimly that john sunlight removed the death machines from the fortress of solitude and hid them somewhere if he is alive and recovers them the bronze man turned away without finishing the pursuit party returned to the island with subdued spirits they returned quickly a plane came out for them they could not help but wonder and the wondering was not pleasant evidence that john sunlight had been killed by a polar bear seemed conclusive and yet they landed on the island and guided the plane into a great hangarroom in the side of the fortress of solitude it was from here that john sunlight had secured his first plane the craft in which he and his party had flown to new york doc always kept two extra planes on hand at the fortress one a spare craft and the other an experimental machine on which he tried out new aeronautical developments for the next three weeks monk ham and long tom flew over the arctic searching vainly for some trace of a cache where john sunlight might have hidden the death machines he had stolen from the fortress of solitude they never found a cache what about the darknessmaker that john sunlight sold to that baron karl ham demanded one day we will have to recover that doc said grimly as soon as we can there was one other problem they had to settle most of the value of the fortress of solitude lay in its existence remaining unknown to the world many people now knew about it the eskimos did not count they had always known but they lived here and took care of the place doc had trained them for that and they would continue for they were well satisfied but the others they wont keep their mouths shut monk muttered not every one of em doc savage was thoughtful when all gathered for the next meal the bronze man made a talk it was probably the most compelling speech monk ham or long tom had ever heard the bronze man make doc pointed out that the whole experience from the time the convicts escaped the siberian prison camp was so terrible that their minds would be better off if all memory of the past was wiped away then he explained about his brain operation guaranteed no one would die and promised that all memory of the past would be gone incidentally no one would recall the fortress of solitude either he sold the memorywiping operations en masse it was such a good talk that monk and ham and long tom were almost impelled to join in its a swell idea for monk ham said enthusiastically why me monk demanded rid your mind of the idea ham said that youre evolutions gift to the ladies ham left monk sputtering and went away to make a little progress with fifi after all fifi had repented and after all fifi was a very cute trick not to add that pretty soon she was going to be relieved of her memory what more could a confirmed bachelor such as ham look for the flies in the ointment elephants in the ointment was more like it ham thought ruefully were giantia and titania ham thought hed better get on the good side of giantia and titania before proceeding with fifi ham went looking for giantia and titania to discuss the matter ham was minus a front tooth when monk saw him next what happened monk asked giantia ham said ruefully cracked a smile huh my smile ham explained the end
