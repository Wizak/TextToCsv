i bens inheritance ive settled up your fathers estate benjamin said job stanton youll find it all figgered out on this piece of paper there was that twoacre piece up at rockville brought seventyfive dollars the medder fetched a hundred and fifty the two cows how much does it all come to uncle job interrupted ben who was impatient of details hadnt you better let me read off the items nephew asked job looking over his spectacles no uncle job i know youve done your best for me and theres no need of your going through it all how much is there left after all expenses are paid thats what i was acomin to ben i make it out that theres three hundred and sixtyfive dollars and nineteen cents thats a dollar for every day in the year its a good deal of money ben so it is uncle job answered ben and he was quite sincere there are not many boys of sixteen to whom this would not seem a large sum youre rich that is for a boy added uncle job its more than i expected uncle i want you to take fifteen dollars and nineteen cents thatll leave me just three hundred and fifty why should i take any of your money nephew youve had considerable trouble in settling up the estate and its taken a good deal of your time too my time aint of much vally and as to the trouble its a pity ef i cant take some trouble for my brothers son no ben i wont take a cent youll need it all but you said yourself it was a good deal of money for a boy uncle job so it is but its all youve got most boys have fathers to take care of em while youre alone in the world yes i am alone in the world said ben sadly his cheerful face clouding over but youve got an uncle lad continued job stanton laying his hand gently on the boys shoulder hes a poor man but as much as in him lies hell be your friend and helper i know it uncle job youve always been kind to me and allus will be ben now ben ive got a plan for you i dont know what youll think of it but its the best ive been able to think of what is it uncle job ef youll stay with me and help me in the shop ill give you a home such as it is and fifty dollars a year toward your clothes your aunt hannah and your cousin jane want you to make your home with us im very much obliged to you uncle job said ben slowly you neednt be boy its a sort of mutooal arrangement itll be as good for me as for you you can put your money in the bank and let it stay till youre twentyone why itll be nigh on to five hunderd dollars by that time im much obliged to you uncle job as i said before but theres one thing in the way whats that ben i dont like shoemaking perhaps it isnt genteel enough for you ben said his uncle i dont care for that uncle job but i dont like being shut up in a shop besides it doesnt give steady work last year you were without work at least a third of the time so i was ben said job im willin to own thats a great drawback and it isnt likely to be any better hereafter last year was as good as the average it was better job admitted the year before i was out of work five months well uncle job i want to work at something thatll give me employment all the year round so do i ben but i dont see what you can find unless you go to work on a farm youre used to that and i guess you could find a chance before long theres deacon pitkin wants a boy and would be glad of the chance of gettin you i suppose he would said ben laughing would you advise me to go there well there might be some objections but you know i wouldnt get enough to eat uncle job interrupted ben why deacon pitkins the meanest man in the village you mustnt be hasty in your judgments nephew im not i know what im talking about i worked for the deacon two days once he gave me ten cents a day and boardand such board why i got up from the table hungry every meal and yet the deacon reported afterward that i was a great eater mrs pitkin cuts a small pie into eight pieces each about two mouthfuls and when i asked for a second piece she asked if i was allowed to have two pieces at home what did you say asked uncle job evidently amused i said yes and that each piece was twice as big as she gave im afraid that was rather forward ben did she say anything to that she said i must be very greedy and that boys always ate moren was good for em no uncle job i dont care to work for deacon pitkin have you formed any plans ben you dont want to go on a farm and you dont want to go into a shoeshop and thats about all you can find to do in hampton i dont mean to stay in hampton said ben quietly dont mean to stay in hampton exclaimed uncle joe amazed no uncle theres a good many places besides hampton in the world so there is ben answered uncle job with a disregard of grammar more excusable than his nephews for he had never had any special educational advantagesso there is but you dont know anybody in them other places it wont take me long to get acquainted returned ben not at all disturbed by this consideration where do you want to go i want to go to california gracious sakes want to go to california gasped job what put that idee into your head a good many people are going there and theres a chance to get rich quick out among the goldmines but youre only a boy im a pretty large boy uncle job said ben complacently and im pretty strong so you be ben but it takes more than strength what more uncle job it takes judgment cant a boy have judgment waal he may have some but you dont often find an old head on young shoulders i know all that uncle but i can work if i am a boy i know youre willin to work ben but itll cost a sight of money to get out to californy to start with i know that it will take two hundred dollars and thats moren half of all youve got it seems to me temptin providence to spend such a sight of money for the chance of earning some on tother side of the world when you can get a livin here and put all your money in the bank in five years it would only amount to five hundred dollars and if i go to california i expect to be worth a good deal more than that before two years are past im afraid youve got large idees ben you wont interfere with my going uncle job asked ben anxiously i wont actooly interfere but ill do all i can to have you give it up but if my mind is set upon it youll let me go wont you uncle i suppose i must said job stanton a wilful lad must have his way but you mustnt blame me if things turn out unlucky no i shall only blame myself theres one promise you must make me said his uncle what is that take a week to consider whether you hadnt better take my advice and stay at home yes uncle ill promise that and youll think it over in all its bearins yes uncle it aint best to take any important step without reflection ben youre right uncle this conversation took place in job stantons little shoeshop only a rod distant from the small plain house which he had occupied ever since he had been married it was interrupted by the appearance of a pretty girl of fourteen who presenting herself at the door of the shop called out suppers ready father so are we jennie said ben promptly you are always ready to eat ben said his cousin smiling thats what mrs pitkin used to think jennie she used to watch every mouthful i took chapter ii deacon pitkins offer bens father had died three months before he had lost his mother when ten years old and having neither brother nor sister was left quite alone in the world at one time his father had possessed a few thousand dollars but by unlucky investments he had lost nearly all so that bens inheritance amounted to less than four hundred dollars this thought troubled mr stanton and on his deathbed he spoke about it to his son i shall leave you almost destitute ben he said if i had acted more wisely it would have been different dont trouble yourself about that father said ben promptly i am young and strong and i shall be sure to get along you will have to work hard and the world is a hard taskmaster i dont feel afraid father i am sure i shall succeed the dying father was cheered by bens confident words our hero was strong and sturdy his limbs active and his face ruddy with health he looked like a boy who could get along he was not a sensitive plant and not to be discouraged by rebuffs the fathers brow cleared i am glad you are not afraid to meet what is in store for you he said i believe you will do your part and god helps those who help themselves after his fathers death ben became an inmate of his uncles family while the estate was being settled he paid for his board partly by work in the shop and partly by doing chores this brings us to the day when the conversation detailed in the first chapter took place on the following morning ben was sent on an errand to the village store on his way he overtook deacon pitkin good mornin ben said the deacon where are you goin to the store sir so am i ef you aint in a hurry less walk along together all right sir answered ben i think i know whats comin he said to himself youre stayin at your uncle jobs aint you asked deacon pitkin yes sir you dont calclate to keep on there do you no sir he would like to have me stay and work in the shop but i dont fancy shoemaking jest so i wouldnt ef i was you its an onsartin business theres nothin like farmin for stiddy work the old man kept me at work pretty stiddy thought ben hed always find something for me to do ive been thinkin that i need a boy about your age to help me on my farm i aint so young as i was and ive got a crick in my back i dont want a man youd have to pay him too high wages ben said to himself a strong capable boy like you could give me all the help i need i expect i could said ben demurely i was sayin to mrs pitkin this mornin that i thought it would be a good plan to take you till you was twentyone what did she say asked ben interested waal she didnt say much answered the deacon slowly but i guess she hasnt no objections didnt she say that i had an awful appetite asked ben smiling she said you was pretty hearty answered the deacon rather surprised at bens penetration boys should curb their appetites i dont think i could curb mine said ben thoughtfully i guess there wouldnt be any trouble about that returned the deacon whose meanness ran in a different channel from his wifes and who took less note of what was eaten at his table ef you think youd like to engage and we could make a bargain you might begin next week jest so said ben the deacon looked at him rather sharply but ben didnt appear to intend any disrespect in repeating his favorite phrase did your father leave you much inquired deacon pitkin a few hundred dollars said ben carelessly indeed said the deacon gratified what are you goin to do with it uncle job thinks it would be best to put it in the bank jest so it would fetch you some interest every yearenough to clothe you likely ill tell you what ill do ben ill give you your board the first year and your interest will buy your clothes the second year ill give you twenty dollars and board and maybe twenty more the third year ben shook his head i guess we cant make a bargain deacon pitkin he said deacon pitkin knew that he had made a very mean offer and felt that he could afford to increase it somewhat but he was a close hand at a bargain and meant to get ben as cheap as he could what was you expectin he asked cautiously you must remember that youre only a boy and cant expect mens wages ben had no idea as we know of engaging to work for deacon pitkin at all but he decided that the easiest way to avoid it was to put such a value on his services as to frighten the old man i am almost as strong as a man he said and i can earn a great deal more than my board the first year i might be willin to give you twenty dollars the first year said the deacon ive been thinking said ben soberly that i ought to have a hundred and fifty dollars and board the first year deacon pitkin fairly gasped for breath he was fairly overpowered by bens audacity ahundredandfiftydollars he ejaculated turning his wrinkled face toward our hero thats about the figure said ben cheerfully a hundred and fifty dollars and board or three hundred dollars and ill board with my uncle is the boy crazy asked the deacon in a bewildered tone youd have to pay a man as much as twenty dollars a month pursued ben thats about a hundred dollars a year more benjamin said the deacon solemnly do you want to ruin me no sir i hope not answered our hero innocently then why do you ask such an unheardof price i think im worth it said ben boys havent much jedgment said the deacon youd better let me talk over this matter with your uncle job it wont be any use deacon pitkin uncle job wont interfere with me you cant get such wages anywhere youll have to work for less perhaps i cant get my price in hampton said ben of course you cant there aint no one goin to pay you mens wages perhaps you are right deacon pitkin in that case my mind is made up what will you do asked the deacon showing some curiosity ill leave town its a resky thing benjamin you aint old enough to take care of yourself i think i can do it deacon pitkin i am not afraid to try still if youll give me a hundred and fifty dollars and board you must think im crazy said the deacon hastily i dont throw money away that way then im afraid we cant make a bargain deacon here is the store and ill bid you good morning if you think better of my offer you can let me know benjamin you can talk it over with your uncle all right sir if you think better of mine just let me know within a week or i may be gone from hampton thats a curus boy said the deacon meditatively hes got the most conceited idea of his vally to work of any boy i ever came across a hundred and fifty dollars and board whatll mrs pitkin say when i tell her she aint much sot on the boys comin anyway she thinks hes too hearty but i dont mind that so much hes strong and good to work an hes the only boy in town that would suit me i wonder what the deacon thinks of me soliloquized ben i thought i should scare him a little when i named my price if id thought he would take me at that figure id have said more it wouldnt suit me to work for him at all in the evening deacon pitkin came over to see job stanton and renewed his offer for bens services the boys got wild idees about pay he said but boys havent much jedgment youre a sensible man mr stanton and you and me can make a fair bargain it wont be of much use deacon pitkin bens got his idees an he sticks to em but youre his uncle you can make him see his true interest bens young said job suspending his work but hes got to look out for himself he may make mistakes but ive promised not to interfere ive got confidence in him that hell come out right in the end truth is deacon he dont want to work at farmin and thats why he asked you such a steep price he knew you wouldnt agree to give it this put the matter in a new light and deacon pitkin reluctantly concluded that he must abandon the idea of obtaining ben as a helper on his farm chapter iii sam sturgis new idea during the week which ben had agreed to take before coming to a final decision he had another offer of employment this is how it came about a little out of the village in a handsome house the best in hampton lived major sturgis a wealthy landholder who had plenty to live upon and nothing in particular to do except to look after his property he was a portly man who walked with a slow dignified step leaning on a goldheaded cane and evidently felt his importance his son sam was a chip of the old block he condescended to associate with the village boys because solitary grandeur is not altogether pleasant he occasionally went to new york to visit a cousin of about his own age from such a visit he had just returned bringing back with him a new idea father he said cousin henry has a boy about his own age to wait on him black his boots and run errands has he asked the major mechanically not looking up from the daily paper which he was reading yes sir he dont pay him much you know only five dollars a month and his board and henry finds it very convenient major sturgis did not reply in fact he was too much interested in the article he was reading aint you as rich as uncle asked sam who was gradually leading up to his proposal yes sam i think so answered his father laying down the paper and removing his goldbowed spectacles then why wont you let me have a servant too what do you want of a servant there are servants enough in the house i want a boy to follow me round and do just what i bid him i dont see any necessity for it he could do errands for you too father said sam diplomatically we would have to send to the city for a boy in case i let you have one no we wouldnt answered sam do you know of any one around here yes there is ben stanton hes got to find something to do i thought you didnt like ben stanton said the major in some surprise i have heard you say oh hes rather uppishfeels too big for a poor boy but i would soon train him id make him know his place your remarks are well founded my son only yesterday i met the boy on the village street and instead of taking off his hat and making a low bow as he should do to a man of my position he nodded carelessly and said how are you major really i dont know what the country is coming to when the rising generation is so deficient in veneration the fact is father ben thinks himself as good as anybody youd think by the way he speaks to me that he considered himself my equal that is one of the evils incident to a republican form of government said the major pompously for my part i prefer the english social system where the gentry are treated with proper deference well father may i engage ben as my servant i am afraid you would not find him properly subordinate just leave that to me said sam confidently if i cant teach him his place then nobody can i should enjoy having him to order about sam generally carried his point with his father and the present instance was no exception i dont know that i have any particular objection said the major how much wages may i offer father the same that your cousin henrys servant gets all right sir said sam with satisfaction i guess ill go round and see him about it this afternoon i suppose he can come any time yes my son as sam went out of the room his father thought complacently my son has all the pride and instincts of a gentleman he will do credit to the family few persons in the village would have agreed with the major sam sturgis was decidedly unpopular no boy who puts on airs is likely to be a favorite with any class of persons and sam put on rather more than he was entitled to from time to time he received a rebuff but still money will tell he had his followers and sycophants but we may be sure that ben was not numbered among them it was quite useless for sam to patronize himhe would not be patronized but persisted in treating the majors son with the most exasperating familiarity of course this would be impossible if he became sams servant and this more than anything else was the motive of the young aristocrat in wishing to engage him as to conferring a favor on ben that was the last thing in his thoughts sam bent his steps toward the humble home of job stanton but he did not have to go the whole distance he met ben with a fishingpole over his shoulder how are you sam was bens familiar greeting want to go fishing with me hes entirely too familiar thought sam ill cure him of that when he is under my orders at present sam did not think it politic to express his feelings on the subject ben was so independent that it might frustrate his plan i will walk along with you ben said sam condescendingly all right havent you got a fishingpole at home yes i have a very handsome one it cost five dollars then its rather ahead of mine said ben i should say so remarked sam surveying bens pole with contempt but ill bet you cant catch as many fish with it said ben promptly i dont think it makes much difference to the fish he added with a laugh whther they are caught with a fivedollar pole or a fivecent one very likely said sam briefly but i prefer to use a nice pole oh theres no objection said ben if you fancy it it doesnt make any difference to me when are you going to work asked sam abruptly i am working every daythat is i am helping uncle job but i suppose you mean to get regular work somewhere dont you whats he after i wonder thought ben maybe i do he said aloud perhaps i can throw something in your way said sam in a patronizing way you are very kind said ben who supposed sam had heard of some business position which he could fill our hero decided that perhaps he had misjudged the majors son and he was prepared to make amends if you get me a position i shall be much obliged the fact is said sam i should find it convenient to have a boy go about with me and be at my orders my cousin henry has one and father says i may engage you ben faced round and looked steadily at sam he felt that he would far rather work for deacon pitkin in spite of his meager table or toil twelve hours a day in his uncles shoeshop than accept such a place as was now offered him he penetrated sams motive and felt incensed with him though he did not choose to show it what are you willing to pay asked ben in a businesslike tone five dollars a month and your board said sam youll live better than you ever did before in your life and your duties will be easy what would you want me to do asked ben why i would take you with me whenever i went out rowing or fishing that would be easy enough then in the morning you would black my shoes and keep my clothes well brushed and go of any errands i had for you oh well i cant tell you all you would have to do but youd have an easy time yes i dont think it would tire me out said ben youd want me to black your boots yes well i might agree to that on one condition what is that that you would black mine what do you mean demanded sam his face flushing angrily just what i say do you mean to insult me not a bit any more than you mean to insult me do you dare to propose that i a gentleman should black your lowlived shoes exclaimed sam furiously i think youre rather hard on my shoes said ben laughing ill come for four dollars a month if youll do that i never heard such impudence said sam in concentrated wrath i never was so repaid for kindness before look here sam said ben i understand just how kind you are you want the satisfaction of ordering me round and you cant have it i decline your offer id rather beg for bread than accept it you may starve for all me said sam its ridiculous for a poor boy to put on such airs youll die in the poorhouse yet i wont live there if i can help it what are you going to leave me i wont condescend to be seen with you goodby sam i hope you wont have to black your own boots sam did not deign a reply he looks mad thought ben id live on one meal a day rather than let him order me round chapter iv a brilliant chance the week was over and ben persisted in his determination to leave hampton im sorry you are going ben said his cousin jennie i shall miss you awfully as jennie was the prettiest girl in the village though she did not inherit any good looks from her plainlooking father ben was gratified youd forget me soon he said no i wont especially when sam sturgis comes round to see you i dont want to see him hes a stuckup boy and thinks himself too good to associate with common people he wanted to have me black his boots said ben he isnt fit to black yours said jennie energetically oh yes he is said ben laughing thats where you and i disagree i guess we both mean about the same thing said jennie who saw the point bens resolve to go to california was modified by an advertisement in a new york daily paper which he saw at the village tavern it ran thus wanted six boys from fifteen to eighteen years of age to fill positions of trust ten dollars per week will be paid but a deposit of fifty dollars is required as a guarantee of honesty this sum will be repaid at the close of term of service address fitch perguson no nassau street this advertisement looked quite attractive to ben he copied it and showed it to uncle job isnt that a good chance uncle job he said just think ten dollars a week youd have to pay your board out of it said his uncle i know that but my board wouldnt cost more than four dollars a week that would leave me six so it would i declare it does seem to be a good chance maybe theyve got all the boys they want why you see uncle theres a good many boys that couldnt pay the deposit money that would limit the number of applicants now i have the money and i guess id better write to new york at once about it maybe you had ben ben immediately procured a sheet of paper and wrote to the advertisers stating that he would like the position and assuring them of his ability to furnish the required sum the letter went to new york by the afternoon mail naturally ben was a little excited and suffered a little from suspense he feared that all the places would be filled and such another chance was hardly to be expected again very soon however on monday morning he was gratified by the receipt of the following letter no nassau street new york mr benjamin stanton your letter of yesterday is at hand fortunately we have one vacancy the other places being already filled we have rejected three applicants for it on account of unsatisfactory penmanship yours however is up to the mark and we will engage you on the strength of it it will be necessary for you to report as soon as possible at our office for duty we require the deposit on account of the sums of money which you will handle we do not doubt your honesty but it seems desirable that you should furnish a guarantee particularly as we pay a much larger salary than is usually given to young clerks yours respectfully fitch ferguson p s your engagement will not commence until the fifty dollars are in our hands ben was quite elated by his success i must start tomorrow morning he said or i shall be in danger of losing the place it seems very sudden said his aunt i am afraid i shant have time to get your clothes ready some are dirty and others need mending if id had a little notice it wont make any difference aunt sarah said ben ill take a few clothes in a carpetbag and you can send the rest by express when they are ready yes sarah that will be the best way said uncle job ben dont want to run the risk of losing the place by delay mrs stanton acquiesced rather unwillingly and for the remainder of the day ben was busy making preparations to leave his country home chapter v in search of a place ben took the early train to new york on tuesday morning and in due time arrived in the city he carried with him seventyfive dollars out of his small patrimony fifty were to be deposited with messrs fitch ferguson as required and the balance was to defray his expenses till he began to receive a salary ben didnt expect to need much of it for at the end of a week he would be paid ten dollars for his services and until then he meant to be very economical ben had only been in new york twice before but he happened to know his way to nassau street and went there at once with his carpetbag in his hand as he entered nassau street from printinghouse square a bootblack accosted him how are you country are you very anxious to know asked ben stopping short yes im well enough and strong enough to give you a licking good for you country have you come to stay long ben laughed he concluded not to take offense but to answer seriously that depends on whether i get the place i am after what is that asked the bootblack in a friendly tone now on the way to the city ben had overheard a conversation between two gentlemen relative to certain swindlers in new york which for the first time had aroused in him a suspicion that possibly there might be something wrong about the firm whose advertisement he had answered he felt the need of an adviser and though his choice may be considered rather a strange one he decided to consult his new acquaintance the bootblack he briefly told him of the advertisement and what it offered the bootblack surveyed him with pitying curiosity you dont mean to say you swallow all that he said dont you think its all right asked ben anxiously look here said the street boy do you think anybodys going to pay a boy ten dollars a week when theres hundreds ready to work for three or four why a man in pearl street advertised last week for a boy at three dollars and there was a whole shoal of boys went for it i was one of em dont you earn more than that by your business sometimes i do but it aint stiddy and id rather have a place why do they advertise to give ten dollars then asked our hero they want to get hold of your fifty dollars said the bootblack them fellers is beats thats what they are what had i better do asked ben in perplexity go and see em and have a talk if theyre not after your fifty dollars youll know what it means it may be all right after all said ben who did not like to give up hope i may be general grant retorted the bootblack but if i know myself i aint well ill go round and talk with them where can i meet you afterwards ill be standin here if you aint gone too long whats your name tom cooper i am ben stanton thank you for your advice youre a good feller if you do come from the country just look out for them fellers dont let em hook you in all right tom ben moved on watching the numbers as he walked slowly along till he came to the one mentioned in the advertisement there was a hallway and a staircase with a directory of persons occupying offices on the floors above from this ben ascertained that fitch ferguson occupied room on the fourth floor i wonder what business they are in thought our hero as he mounted the stairs they must have considerable or they wouldnt need so many boysthat is if they are on the square presently he stood in front of a door bearing the number he knocked for admittance chapter vi mr pitch the senior partner come in said a loud voice ben opened the door and entered he found himself in a square room almost bare of furniture in an office chair at a table sat a darkcomplexioned man of near forty he appeared to be reading the morning paper is this the office of fitch ferguson inquired ben a glance at bens carpetbag indicated that he had come in answer to the advertisement and he was received very graciously come in said the man in the chair smiling affably this is the office of fitch ferguson i am mr fitch my name is stantonben stanton said our hero i wrote you from hampton about your advertisement for a boy at ten dollars a week suggested the dark man with a pleasant smile yes sir we agreed to take you did we not asked mr fitch yes sir have you had any business experience inquired pitch no sir i am sorry for that said mr fitch gravely experience is important i am not sure whether we ought to pay you ten dollars a week ben did not reply he was not so much concerned about the amount of his compensation as about the reliable character of fitch ferguson still mused mr fitch you look like a boy who would learn fast what do you think about it yourself i think i could answered ben i should try to serve you faithfully that is well we want to be served faithfully said mr fitch what kind of a business is it ben ventured to ask surveying the empty office with a puzzled look which mr fitch observed and interpreted aright we do a commission business he said of course we keep no stock of goods here business is not done in the city my young friend as it is in the country no i suppose not returned our hero without entering into details as to the character of our business said mr fitch i may say that you would be chiefly employed in making collections it is because considerable sums of money would pass through your hands that we require a deposit in order to protect ourselves by the way have you the fifty dollars with you ben admitted that he had mr fitchs face brightened up for he had not felt quite sure of that i am glad to hear of it he said it shows that you mean business you may hand it to me and i will give you a receipt for it i would like to ask you one or two questions first said ben making no movement toward his pocket mr fitch frowned really i fail to catch your meaning he said in a changed tone do you wish to enter my employ or do you not i should like to earn ten dollars a week precisely then all you have to do is to hand me the fifty dollars and go to work you might keep me only a week suggested ben we shall keep you if you suit us and you can if you try if you are discharged we give you back your money and pay you for the time you work for us that is fair isnt it yes sir then we may as well settle the matter at once and he waited for ben to draw forth his money our hero would undoubtedly have done so if he had not been cautioned by tom cooper as it was he could not help feeling suspicious i should like to propose something to you sir he said what is it asked fitch impatiently suppose you keep five dollars a week out of my wages for ten weeksthatll make fifty dollarsand only pay it to me when i leave you young man said mr fitch sternly this is trifling and my time is too valuable for such discussion have you or have you not brought fifty dollars with you i have then you can secure the placea place such as few new york boys are fortunate enough to fill you must decide for yourself he threw himself back in his chair and looked at ben he seems very anxious about the money thought our hero and i dont see any signs of any business id better back out there are plenty of boys who want the place continued fitch trying to look indifferent i guess you can give it to one of them said ben coolly mr fitch could not conceal his disappointment the fifty dollars had a great attraction for him he saw that ben was in earnest for he was already opening the door to go out he must make an effort to detain him wait a moment my young friend i like your appearance and we may be disposed to take you on a little easier terms fifty dollars is probably a large sum to you ben admitted that it was probably your means are limited yes sir i am a poor boy just so i will then relax our rules a little in your case of course you wont mention it to our other boys as it might create dissatisfaction no sir we will take you on a deposit of forty dollars then ben shook his head and moved as if to depart in fact said mr fitch hastily i believe i will say thirty dollars though i am afraid my partner will blame me ben was not versed in city ways but now he distrusted mr fitch more than ever i would rather take a situation where no deposit is required he said but you cant get any unless you agree to accept three or four dollars a week can you afford to pay me ten dollars a week on account of my deposit asked ben shrewdly mr fitch flushed for bens question was a home thrust we dont want cheap boys he said pompously we want boys who are worth high wages and no others and you think i am worth high wages asked ben i think so but i may be mistaken ben was not required to answer for the door opened hastily and a man entered in visible excitement what is your business sir asked mr fitch rather nervously are you fitch or ferguson demanded the intruder i am mr fitch two days ago my son james cameron entered your service yes sir where is he now we have sent him to brooklyn to collect a bill he paid you a deposit of fifty dollars certainly we require it as a guarantee of honesty and fidelity well i want you to pay it back i dont understand you sir said mr fitch looking very much disturbed it will be given up when your son leaves our employment well hes going to leave it today said the other can you get him another place as good ten dollars a week are not often paid to boys no sir its that that makes me suspicious give me back the fifty dollars and james shall leave your employment that is entirely irregular sir said fitch your son has been only two days in the office at the end of the week he can leave us and receive back his money that wont do said the angry father it will have to do said fitch you are doing a very foolish thing mr cameron ill risk that when your son returns from brooklyn we will consider what can be done when will that be in a couple of hours i will come in then cameron went out and ben followed him the discomfited fitch making no effort to detain the lad i was thinking of engaging myself to mr fitch said ben to his companion do you know anything against him i hear that hes a swindler said cameron i was a fool to fall into his snare keep your money and youll be better off thank you sir fifteen minutes afterward mr fitch left his office and when mr cameron came back the door was locked he found his son waiting in the entry did you collect any money in brooklyn asked his father no i guess mr fitch gave me the wrong number there was no such man living at the house he sent me to weve been fooled said the father bitterly come home james i doubt weve seen the last of our money if i ever set eyes on that man pitch again ill give him in charge for swindling the senior partner of pitch ferguson was at that moment on his way to philadelphia with the remains of the fifty dollars in his pocket but for bens caution he would have had another fifty dollars in his possession chapter vii bens dinnerguest ben slowly retraced his steps to where he had left his friend tom cooper well said the bootblack did you see fitch and ferguson yes answered ben soberly that is i saw one of them did you take the place no i found he was too anxious for my fifty dollars though he offered after a while to take me for thirty tom cooper laughed derisively ill do better nor that he said if youll give me twenty dollars ill make you my private secretary payin you ten dollars a week how long will you keep me asked ben smiling six days answered tom then ill have to sack you without pay cause you dont understand your business is that the way they manage asked ben the bootblack nodded ben looked grave the disappointment was a serious one and he felt now how much he had relied upon the promises of fitch ferguson he had formed no other plans and it seemed likely that he must return to the country to resume his old life yet that seemed impracticable there was no opening there unless he accepted one of the two offers already made him but he was neither inclined to enter the employ of deacon pitkin nor to become the valet and servant of sam sturgis he was not quite sure whether he would not prefer to become a bootblack like his new acquaintance what are you goin to do asked tom i wish i knew said ben earnestly what can i do you might go into my business suggested tom ben shook his head i dont think i should like that no more would i if id got fifty dollars in my pocket if i was you id go into business what kind of business well said tom reflectively you might buy out an apple or a peanutstand and have lots of money left is there much money to be made that way inquired ben well i never knowed anybody get rich in that line i guess youd make a livin that wouldnt satisfy me tom what i want most of all is to go to california the bootblack whistled thats off ever so far isnt it yes its a long way how do you go there are three ways answered ben who had made himself familiar with the subject the first is to go by landacross the plains then there is a line of steamers by way of panama the longest way is by a sailingvessel round cape horn what would you do when you got to california asked tom go to work i suppose i would go to the mines and dig gold i wish it wasnt so far off id like to go myself do you think a feller could work his passage by blacking boots yes i dont believe he could sailors dont care much about having their boots blacked how much does it cost to go i dont know why dont you go to the office and find out so i will said ben brightening up at the thought do you know where it is yes will you show me i would if id make enough to buy me some dinner i only had a fivecent breakfast and i feel kinder holler i feel hungry myself said ben if youll go with me ill buy you some dinner to pay you for your trouble nough said remarked tom briefly as he shouldered his box im your man come along where shall we go first to an eatinghouse we might have to wait at the office tom conducted ben to a cheap restaurant not far away where the two for a moderate sum obtained a plentiful meal had either been fastidious some exception might have been taken to the style in which the dishes were served but neither was critical a dapper young clerk however who sat opposite tom seemed quite disturbed by the presence of the bootblack as his eye rested on tom he sniffed contemptuously and frowned in truth our friend tom might be useful but in his present apparel he was not fitted to grace a drawingroom he had no coat his vest was ragged and his shirt soiled with spots of blacking there were spots also upon his freckled face of which tom was blissfully unconscious it didnt trouble him any to have a dirty face dirt is only matter in the wrong place as a philosopher once remarked tom was a philosopher in his own way the young clerk pulled out a scented handkerchief and applied it to his nose looking at tom meanwhile whats the matter of yer inquired tom suspecting the cause of the dandys discomfort be you sick its enough to make one sick to sit at the table with you answered the clerk why you are absolutely filthy dont you know any better than to come in where there are gentlemen i dont see any except him said tom indicating ben with his glance this is really too much here waiter a waiter answered the summons what is it sir just remove my plate to another table will you is anything the matter sir i am not accustomed to associate with bootblacks said the clerk loftily all right sir i am really surprised that you admit any of that low class as long as they pay their bills we are willing to receive them i dont believe that boy has got enough to pay for his dinner the waiter at this suggestion looked at tom rather suspiciously after removing the plate of the sensitive customer he came back to the table where the two boys were seated have you given your order he asked yes if you havent got money enough to pay your check youll be bounced dont you trouble yourself old woolly head said tom coolly my friend pays the bills hes a banker down in wall street and hes rich enough to buy out your whole place the dinner will be paid for said ben smiling all right gentlemen said the waiter more respectfully well be glad to see you any time tom said ben im afraid you dont always tell the truth why not you told the waiter i was a wall street banker and rich oh whats the odds youre rich enough to pay for the dinners and thats all he wants you came near spoiling the appitite of that young man over at the opposite table id like to spoil his beauty he feels too big i dont like to see a feller put on so many airs whats the matter of me id like to know why you see tom your face isnt very clean there are spots of blacking on it a feller cant be always washin his face ill wash it tomorrow mornin at the lodge does it take away your appetite too not a bit said ben laughing nothing but a good dinner will take away that youre the kind of feller i like said tom emphatically you dont put on no airs i cant afford to said ben im a poor boy myself i wouldnt feel poor if i had fifty dollars returned tom i hope youll have it sometime and a good deal more so do i when im a rich man ill wash my face oftener and put blacking on your boots instead of your face added ben it might look better tom admitted when dinner was over the two boys directed their steps to the california steamship office on one of the north river piers chapter viii a strange acquaintance tom cooper was too familiar with the streets of new york to pay any attention to the moving panorama of which he and ben formed a part but everything was new and interesting to ben who had passed his life in a quiet country town i should think it was the fourth of july he said why asked the bootblack because theres such a lot of people and wagons in the streets theres always as many as this except sundays said tom where do they all come from said beu wonderingly youve got me there answered tom i never thought about that look out he exclaimed suddenly dragging ben from in front of a team coming up the street do you want to get run over i was looking the other way said ben rather confused youve got to look all ways to once here said tom i guess youre right dont people often get run over once in a while theres a friend of mine patsy burke a newsboy was run over last year and had his leg broke they took him to bellevue hospital and cut it off is he alive now oh yes hes alive and to work the same as ever hes got a wooden leg poor boy said ben compassionately oh he dont mind it patsy dont hes always jolly by this time they reached the office of the california steamship company there was a large sign up so that there was no difficulty in finding it the two boys entered the room was not a large one there was a counter behind which were two young men writing and there was besides a man of middle age who was talking to two gentlemen who appeared to be engaging passage seated in a chair apparently awaiting her turn was a young lady whose face was halfconcealed by a thick green veil when the two gentlemen were disposed of the agent spoke to the young lady what can i do for you miss he asked i am in no hurry sir she answered in a low voice i will wait for those boys whats your business boys demanded the agent shrugging his shoulders when does the next steamer start sir inquired ben in three days what is the price of passage firstclass no sir the cheapest one hundred dollars do you wish to secure passage not this morning sir the agent shrugged his shoulders again as if to say i thought so and turned again to the young lady now miss he said i beg your pardon sir she said hurriedly i will call again as she spoke she left the office following the two boys so quickly that they almost went out together ben had not taken particular notice of the young lady and was much surprised when he felt a hand laid on his arm and turning his eyes fell npon her face may i speak a few words with you she said certainly answered ben politely though he could not conceal his astonishment the young lady looked uneasily at tom and hesitated wont you move away a few steps tom said ben understanding the look thank you said the young lady in a low voice are you intending to sail for california by the next steamer i should like to miss but i am poor and i dont know whether i can afford the expense of a ticket would you go if your ticket were paidby a friend you bet i wouldi mean i certainly would answered ben correcting his phraseology as he remembered that he was addressing a young lady and not one of his boy friends would you be willing to take care of me that is to look after me ben was certainly surprised but he answered promptly and with native politeness it would be a pleasure to me you were going aloneyou had no friends with you none at all miss that is well she said what is your name ben stanton do you live in the city no miss i came from the small town of hampton where are you staying nowhere i only arrived in the city this morning will you be able to go by the next steamer ben hesitated it almost took away his breath it seemed so suddenbut he reflected that there really was no reason why he should not and he answered in the affirmative then go back with me and i will engage passage for us both the young lady and ben reentered the office tom cooper looking on with astonishment she approached the counter this time with confidence and the agent came forward i have concluded to engage passage for myself and this lad she said the agent regarded her with surprise both firstclass he asked certainly sir i should like the lad to occupy a stateroom near mine very well i will show you on the plan those that are unengaged i cannot give either of you a stateroom to yourselves i can give you a room with a very agreeable lady a mrs dunbar and the boy can occupy part of the adjoining room very well sir what name continued the agent ida sinclair answered the young lady with visible hesitation and the boys name miss sinclair had forgotten but ben promptly answered for himself the young lady drew out her pocketbook and produced several large bills out of which she paid the passage money then turning to ben she said now we will go ben followed her out of the office feeling completely bewildered well he might the young lady had paid two hundred and fifty dollars for his passage and for this large outlay only required him to take care of her no wonder he thought it strange you say you are not staying at any hotel said the young lady as they emerged into the street no miss sinclair i am staying at the astor house and it is important that you should be with me as i may have some errands on which to employ you is it an expensive hotel asked ben that will not matter to you as i shall pay the bill thank you miss sinclair but you are spending a great deal of money for me i have an object in doing so besides i have no lack of money shall i go with you to the hotel now yes may i speak a moment to the boy who was with me certainly may i tell him where i am going yes but ask him to keep it to himself i will miss sinclair and ben was about to walk away on the whole call the boy here said miss sinclair tom tom cooper answered the summons i am going to california with this lady said ben she has paid my passage youre in luck exclaimed tom say miss you dont want a boy to go along to black your boots do you miss sinclair smiled faintly i think not she answered tom continued ben you wont say a word about my going will you not if you dont want me to besides there aint nobody to tell miss sinclair looked relieved she drew out her pocketbook and took from it a tendollar bill what is your name she asked tom cooper maam then tom allow me to offer you a small present is it all for me exclaimed tom in amazement yes tom thrust it into his vest pocket and immediately executed a somersault rather to miss sinclairs alarm excuse me maam said tom assuming his natural posture i couldnt help it i felt so excited i never was so rich before may i tell tom where we are going to stop asked ben certainly if he will keep it to himself i shall be at the astor house tom come round and see me tom watched the two as they preceded him on their way to broadway i wonder if im dreaming he said to himself if i am i hope i wont wake up till ive spent this ten dollars i guess ill go to the old bowery tonight chapter ix at the astor house as they walked up to the hotel together miss sinclair said you are probably surprised at what has taken place but i have strong reasons for acting as i have done i dont doubt it miss sinclair returned ben it is desirable that i should tell you dont tell me anything unless you like miss sinclair i am not troubled with curiosity thank you but in the confidential relations which we are to hold toward each other it is necessary that you should understand my position i will reserve my explanation however till we reach the hotel we are to stop at the astor house yes and i wish you to put down my name and your own on the register and obtain two rooms as near together as convenient very well miss sinclair you may put me down as fromwell from philadelphia all right shall i put myself down from philadelphia too not unless you choose your native village will answer by the way you are to pass for my cousin and it will be better therefore that you should call me by my first nameida i wouldnt take the liberty but for your wishing it i do wish itotherwise it would be difficult to pass you off as my cousin all right miss sinclairi mean ida that is better i shall call you ben you couldnt very well call me mr stanton said our hero smiling not very well but here we are at the hotel we will go in together i will go to the ladies parlor and you can join me there after securing rooms at the office very wellida of course ben was not used to city hotels and he was a little afraid that he should not go to work properly but he experienced no difficulty he stepped up to the desk and said to the clerk i should like to engage rooms for my cousin and myself the clerk pushed the register toward him ben inscribed the names at first he could not remember his companions last name and it made him feel awkward fortunately it came to him in time we can give you rooms on the third floor will that do yes sir i think so we would like to be near together very well i can give you two rooms directly opposite to each other that will do sir the clerk touched a bell and a porter presented himself here are the keys of sixtysix and sixtyeight said the hotel clerk take this young gentlemans luggage to sixtysix and show the lady with him to number sixtyeight ben followed the porter pausing at the door of the ladies parlor where his companion awaited him come ida he said feeling a little awkward at addressing miss sinclair so familiarly the servant is ready to show us our rooms very well ben said miss sinclair smiling she did not seem so nervous now as the clerk had said the rooms were directly opposite each other they were large and very comfortable in appearance as miss sinclair entered her room she said join me in the ladies parlor in fifteen minutes ben i have something to say to you ben looked around him with considerable satisfaction he had only left home that morning he had met with a severe disappointment and yet he was now fortunate beyond his most sanguine hopes he had heard a great deal of the astor house which in hampton and throughout the country was regarded at that time as the most aristocratic hotel in new york and now he was actually a guest in it moreover he was booked for a firstclass passage to california its like the arabian nights thought ben and miss sinclair must be a fairy he took out his scanty wardrobe from the carpetbag and put it away in one of the drawers of the bureau i might just as well enjoy all the privileges of the hotel he said to himself he took out his brush and comb and brushed his hair then he locked the door of no and went downstairs to the ladies parlor he did not have to wait long in five minutes miss sinclair made her appearance ben she said here is the check for my trunk you may take it down to the office and ask them to send for it then come back and i will acquaint you with some things i wish you to know ben speedily reappeared and at miss sinclairs request sat down beside her on a sofa you must know ben she commenced that i am flying from my guardian i hope its all right said ben rather frightened he was not sure but he was making himself liable to arrest for aiding and abetting miss sinclairs flight you have no cause for alarm he has no legal control over me though by the terms of my fathers will he retains charge of my property till i attain my twentyfifth year before this fourteen months must elapse meanwhile he is exerting all his influence to induce me to marry his son so that the large property of which i am possessed may accrue to the benefit of his family he couldnt force you to marry his son could he asked ben no but he has made it very disagreeable to me to oppose him and has even gone so far as to threaten me with imprisonment in a madhouse if i do not yield to his persuasions he must be a rascal said our hero indignantly he is said miss sinclair quietly i dont see how he can do such things in a free country he has only to buy over two unscrupulous physicians and in a large city that can easily be done on their certificate of my insanity i might any day be dragged to a private asylum and confined there i dont wonder you ran away ida i feel perfectly justified in doing so liberty and the control of my own person are dear to me and i mean to struggle for them what makes you think of going to california is it because it is so far off partly but there is another reason said miss sinclair i will not conceal from you that there is a person there whom i wish to meet is it a young man asked ben shrewdly you have guessed it richard dewey is the son of a former bookkeeper of my father he is poor but he is a gentleman and there is a mutual attachment between us indeed he asked my guardians consent to his suit but he was repelled with insult and charged with being a fortunehunter that name would better apply to my guardian and his precious son is mr dewey in california yes he went out there some months since he promised to write me regularly but i have not heard a word from him i know very well that he has written and that my guardian has suppressed his letters that is shameful said ben warmly it is indeed but with your help i think i can circumvent mr campbell yet mr campbell is your guardian i suppose ida yes you may reply upon me to help you in every way possible miss sinclair ida corrected the young lady i mean ida thats right cousin ben now that miss sinclairs veil was removed our hero could see that she was very pretty and perhaps he felt all the more proud of being selected as her escort but on one point he was in the dark may i ask you a question ida he said how is it that you have chosen mea stranger and so youngas your escort i am only a green country boy partly because i like your looks you look honest and trustworthy thank you but i am only a boy thats all the better for me it would not do for me to accept the escort of a man and it would be awkward for me to propose it even if it would do at any rate i am lucky to be selected i hope you will be satisfied with me i feel sure of it you are spending a great deal of money for me you may feel surprised that i have so much money to spend independent of my guardian but he has control only of the property left by my father my mother left me thirty thousand dollars of which i am sole mistress that is lucky for you under present circumstancesyes here two ladies entered the parlor and the conversation was suspended i believe i will go in to dinner now said miss sinclair will you come ben i ate dinner an hour ago then you can go where you please meet me here at six oclock all right ida chapter x ben receives a call ben had scarcely left the room when it occurred to him that he ought to send home for the remainder of his clothes he did not like to do so however without first consulting miss sinclair well ben said the young lady inquiringly i would like to write home for my clothes if you have no objection certainly but dont say anything about me all right ben went to the readingroom and procuring writingmaterials penned the following letter to his uncle astor house new york dear uncle job will you send me the rest of my clothes at once by express you may direct to this hotel where i am now staying the firm that i came to see turned out to be swindlers and i was at first quite disappointed but i have made other friends and am to sail for california next saturday this may seem sudden to you at any rate it does to me and i dont expect to realize it till i am fairly at sea it will be some time before i can write you but i will send you a line from panama if possible you neednt send me any more of my money for i have with me all i shall need at present give my love to aunt and cousin jenny i should like to see you all again before i start but i cannot spare the time i am in good health and spirits and i think my prospects are good your affectionate nephew ben this letter excited considerable surprise in hampton im afraid bens gettin extravagant said uncle job ive always heerd that the astor house is a fashionable hotel where they charge big prices ben ought to have gone to a cheap place and saved his money he says hes got money enough with him father said mrs stanton how much did he take away with him seventyfive dollars and he had to pay his passage to california out of that of course he wont have much left when he gets to california then no he wont dont you think youd better send him some no wife ben says no and im goin accordin to his directions i suppose he knows best what he wants sam sturgis did not often condescend to notice job stanton but his curiosity got the better of his pride and meeting the old man a short time afterward he asked have you heard anythiug from ben yes he writ me a letter from new york i got it this mornin has he got a chance to black boots asked sam with a sneer hes stayin at the astor house said job enjoying sams surprise staying at the astor house exclaimed the young aristocrat in astonishment why that is a tiptop hotel i always heerd it was returned job how can he afford to stay there he didnt say oh i understand said sam with an air of relief hes got a place to black boots or clean knives that must be the way of it i dont think it is for he has engaged passage to californy is that so when does he sail on saturday were goin to send him his clothes do you want to send him any word or message no why should i i thought you was one of his friends yes i will send him a message said sam just tell him that when he has spent all his money ill give him the place i offered him before he left hampton youre very kind said job concealing his amusement but i dont think ben will need to take up with your offer i think he will said sam i wonder whether ben is really staying at the astor house and paying his expenses there he said to himself if he is hes a fool ive a great mind to ask father if i may go up to new york and see maybe hes only humbugging his uncle so when sam got home he preferred a request to visit new york and obtained permission we now return to the astor house miss sinclair and ben went in to supper together the young lady had scarcely taken her place and looked around her when she started and turned pale ben she said hurriedly i must leave the table do you see that tall man sitting by the window yes cousin ida it is my guardian he has not seen me yet but i must be cautious direct a servant to bring me some supper in my room and come up there yourself when you are through all right miss sinclair left the room but ben maintained his place he took particular notice of the gentleman who had been pointed out to him he was a tall slender man with irongray hair and a stern unpleasant look ben judged that her guardian had not seen miss sinclair for he seemed wholly intent upon his supper i dont wonder she wanted to run away from him thought our hero ben smiled as it flashed upon him that this young lady was running away with him i didnt expect when i left home to meet with any such adventure as this he said to himself but i do mean to help miss sinclair all i possibly can it doesnt seem quite natural to call her ida but i will do as she wants me to meanwhile mr campbell had made inquiries at the office if a young lady from albany was staying at the hotel no said the clerk it will be remembered that miss sinclair had registered from philadelphia or rather ben had done so for her have you any young lady here without escort asked mr campbell no sir there is a young lady from philadelphia but she arrived with her cousin a lad of fifteen or sixteen that cannot be the one i am in search of said the unsuspecting guardian of course as the reader will readily surmise ida sinclair was not the young ladys real name but it is the name by which we shall know her for the present after supper ben went to miss sinclairs room as directed i think ben she said it will be best for me to take all my meals in my room during the short time i stay here should my guardian catch sight of me he might give me some trouble and that i wish to avoid i guess youre right said ben i shall wish you to come to my room two or three times a day as i may have some errands for you to do all right miss sinclair you had better call me cousin ida so as to get used to it the next day as ben was standing on the steps of the hotel he saw with surprise sam sturgis approaching it did not occur to him however that he was responsible for sams presence in the city he was glad to see a familiar hampton face and he said cordially how are you sam sam nodded you dont mean to say that you are stopping here do you yes i do said ben smiling why not because its a firstclass hotel why shouldnt i stay at a firstclass hotel sam because you are a poor boy maybe youve got some relations among the servants if i have i dont know it your uncle told me you were stopping here but i didnt believe it do you believe it now asked ben perhaps you just stay round here to make people believe you are a guest of the house why should i care what people think nobody knows me here however sam if you want to be convinced just come up to my room with me sam concluded to accept the invitation and accompanied ben to the desk please give me the key to number sixtysix said ben here it is sir sam began to think bens statement was true after all there was no room for doubt when ben ushered him into the handsome chamber which he occupied make yourself at home sam said ben enjoying his companions surprise its very queer thought sam i wonder whether he wont run off without paying his bill sam rather hoped that this might be the case as it would involve ben in disgrace your uncle tells me you are going to sail for california on saturday yes sam have you bought your ticket yes how much did you pay excuse me i would rather not tell just now i suppose he goes in the steerage thought sam as he could learn nothing more from our hero sam soon left him it was certainly remarkable that the boy to whom he had recently offered the position of his bootblack should be a guest of a fashionable new york hotel chapter xi miss sinclairs stratagem mr campbell had no particular reason to think that miss ida sinclair registering from philadelphia was the ward of whom he was in pursuit still he thought it worth while to find out what he could about her and managed to waylay ben in the corridor of the hotel the next morning good morning boy he said stiffly not having the art of ingratiating himself with young people good morning man ben thought of replying but he thought this would be hardly polite and said good morning sir instead he suspected mr campbells purpose and resolved to answer cautiously this is a nice hotel said the guardian resolving to come to the point by degrees yes sir i suppose you are too young to have traveled much i never traveled much sir didnt i see you in the company of a young lady very likely sir your sister i suppose no sir a relation i suppose i call her cousin ida said ben truthfully indeed and she is from philadelphia ben was placed in a dilemma he saw that he should be forced to misrepresent and this he did not like on the other hand he could not tell the truth and so betray miss sinclair to her persecutor you can tell by looking at the hotel register he said coldly mr campbell judged by bens tone that our hero meant to rebuke his curiosity and having really very little idea that he was on the right track he thought it best to apologize excuse my questions he said but i have an idea that i know your cousin in that case said ben if you will tell me your name i will speak to cousin ida about it now mr campbell was in a dilemma if ida sinclair were really the ward of whom he was in pursuit his name would only put her on her guard he quickly thought of a ruse i will send a card he said he stepped to the clerks desk and asked for a blank card after an instants hesitation he penciled the name james vernon and handed it to ben the young lady may not remember my name he said but in an interview i think i can recall it to her recollection please give it to your cousin all right sir ben went upstairs and tapped for admission at miss sinclairs door well ben she said inquiringly here is a card which a gentleman downstairs asked me to hand you james vernon repeated the young lady in surprise why i dont know any gentleman of that name he said you might not remember it but he thought he could recall it to your recollection in a personal interview i dont want a personal interview with any gentleman not with your guardian asked ben smiling was the man who handed you this card my guardian yes he tried to find out all he could from me but wasnt very successful then he said he thought he knew you and handed me this card so he thinks to delude me by masquerading under a false name he must suspect that i am his ward of course you wont see him no what shall i say that i dont remember the name and decline to see him wont that increase his suspicions i cant help it very well ben went below but thought he might as well put off the interview it was not till afternoon that mr campbell met him again did you deliver my card boy he asked my name is benjamin returned our hero who did not fancy the manner of address very well did you deliver my card benjamin yes sir what did your cousin say that she knew no gentleman or family of your name i did not expect she would remember but i have reasons for asking an interview you mustnt be offended sir but she declines to meet a stranger mr campbell was baffled she mistakes my motive he said in a tone expressive of annoyance how long do you stay here i cant say sir said ben coldly mr campbell bit his lip and walked away he did not fancy being foiled by a boy it occurred to him however that by waiting patiently he might see the young lady at dinner he kept watch therefore till he saw ben entering the diningroom and then entering himself secured a seat nearby but the young lady greatly to his chagrin did not appear ben observed his vigilant watch and after dinner reported to miss sinclair the young lady smiled i have thought of a way to deceive him and quiet his suspicions she said ben looked curious if i remain away from the table he will feel sure that i am his ward yes i suppose so listen to my plan then i have the new york herald here with half a column of advertisements of seamtresses i will give you a list of three and you shall engage one to be here early tomorrow morning select one with a figure as much like mine as possible all right i see you look puzzled said miss sinclair smiling i am a little i dont know what good that will do then i will explain i shall dress the seamstress in one of my own dresses and let her go to the table with you mr campbell will naturally suppose that she is miss ida sinclair and will be satisfied i see that is splendid exclaimed ben entering with hearty enthusiasm into the conspiracy it happened luckily that the first seamstress on whom he called was sufficiently like miss sinclair in figure to justify him in engaging her he directed her to call at the hotel at eight the next morning without fail the poor girl was glad to make this engagement having been without employment for two weeks previous when she arrived miss sinclair without confiding too much in her made known her desire and the girl who had had but a scanty breakfast was glad to embrace the opportunity of enjoying the hospitality of a firstclass hotel miss sinclair had really work enough to employ her during the day when mr campbell caught sight of ben approaching the diningroom in company with a young lady he advanced eagerly and peered into the young ladys face he turned away in disappointment i have made a fool of myself it is only a common country girl i must look elsewhere for my ward directly after breakfast ben had the satisfaction of seeing the obnoxious guardian depart in a hack goodby mr vernon he said politely i see you are leaving the hotel goodby muttered campbell i hope youll excuse my cousin for not seeing you i dont think shes the one i supposed said campbell its of no consequence ben hastened to inform miss sinclair of her guardians departure now the field is clear said ida breathing a sigh of relief i say ida you managed him tiptop said ben admiringly i never should have thought of such a plan miss sinclair smiled faintly i dont like to employ deceit she said but it seems necessary to fight such an enemy with his own weapons he wanted to deceive you he put a wrong name on his card that is true ben i must thank you for the manner in which you have aided me in this matter i should not have known how to act if i had not had you to call upon bens face brightened i am glad to hear you say that cousin ida he said you are spending so much money for me that i shall be glad to feel that i have earned some of it have no trouble on that score ben i foresee that you will continue to be of great service to me i regard the money expended for you as well invested ben heard this with satisfaction it naturally gave him a feeling of heightened importance when he reflected that a wealthy heiress had selected him as her escort and righthand man and that she was satisfied with her choice on saturday morning miss sinclair and ben went on board the california steamer and when the tide served they started on their long voyage chapter xii in san francisco ben was not seasick and enjoyed the novel experiences vastly miss sinclair was less fortunate for four days she was sick and confined to her stateroom after that she was able to appear among the other passengers ben was very attentive and confirmed the favorable opinion she had already formed of him at last the voyage came to a close it was a bright cheery morning when the steamer came within sight of san francisco it was not a populous and brilliant city as at present for bens expedition dates back to the year only a few years after the discovery of gold still there was a goodsized town on the site of the future city the numerous passengers regarded it with rejoicing hearts and exchanged hopeful congratulations probably with the exception of miss sinclair all had gone out to make or increase their fortunes her fortune was already made she had gone to enjoy personal liberty and to find her plighted husband well ben we have nearly reached our destination said miss sinclair as she looked earnestly in the direction of the embryo city you are glad are you not yes cousin ida said ben slowly but you look thoughtful is there anything on your mind i feel sorry that i am to part from you cousin ida thank you ben but we are not to part permanently you dont mean to forsake me utterly not if you need me said our hero i shall still require your services you remember that i came out here in search of a friend said miss sinclair hesitating yes i know cousin ida i am desirous that he should know that i am in san francisco but unfortunately though i know he is in california i have no idea where or in what part of it he is to be found once in communication with him i need have no further apprehension of interference or persecution on the part of my guardian to be sure said ben straightforwardly i suppose you would marry him that may come some time said miss sinclair smiling but he must be found first you will travel about i suppose said ben no i shall engage some one to travel for me it would not be suitable for a young lady to go from one miningcamp to another have you thought of any one you can send asked our hero yes said miss sinclair he is rather young but i shall try the experiment do you mean me asked ben quickly yes are you willing to be my agent in the matter i should like it of all things said ben with sparkling eyes then you may consider yourself engaged the details we will discuss presently and where will you stay cousin ida in san francisco i have become acquainted with a lady on board who proposes to open a boardinghouse in the city or rather to take charge of one already kept by her sister in my circumstances it will be better for me to board with her than at a hotel there i shall have a secure and comfortable home while you are exploring the miningdistricts in my interest that is an excellent plan said ben so i think here the conversation was interrupted by the bustle of approaching departure ben landed in the company of miss sinclair and mrs armstrong and the three proceeded at once to the boardinghouse over which the latter was in future to preside a comfortable room was assigned to miss sinclair and a small one to ben they were plainly furnished but both enjoyed being on land once more our young hero finding that his services were not required for the present began to explore the city it was composed almost wholly of wooden houses some but one story in height even on the leading streets with here and there sandhills where now stand stately piles and magnificent hotels he ascended telegraph hill which then as now commanded a good view of the town and harbor yet how different a view from that presented now ben was partly pleased and partly disappointed just from new york he could not help comparing this straggling village on the shores of the pacific with the even then great city on the atlantic coast he had heard so much of san francisco that he expected something more today a man may journey across the continent and find the same comfort luxury and magnificence in san francisco which he left behind him in new york in his explorations ben came to a showy building which seemed a center of attraction it seemed well filled and people were constantly coming in and going out bens curiosity was excited what is that he asked of a man who lounged outside with a mexican sombrero on his head and his hands thrust deep in his pockets thats the bella union my chicken i dont know any better now just go in there with a pocketful of golddust like i did and youll find out i reckon is it a gamblinghouse inquired ben rather excited for he had heard much of such places but never seen one its the devils den said the man bitterly i wish id never seen it have you been unlucky look here boy jest look at me said the stranger an hour ago i was worth a thousand dollars in golddusttook six months hard work to scrape it together at the minesnow i havent an ounce left did you lose it there asked ben somewhat startled well i staked it and its gone have you nothing left not an ounce i havent enough to pay for a bed what will you do for a place to sleep inquired ben to whom this seemed an alarming state of things the stranger shrugged his shoulders i dont worry about that he said ill stretch myself out somewhere when night comes im used to roughing it wont you get cold sleeping out of doors asked ben the other gave a short quick laugh what do you take me for boy i dont look delicate do i not very answered ben smiling ive slept out under the stars pretty reglar for the past six months i only wish i was back to the mines do you think i can go in ben said hesitatingly yes youngster theres nothin to bender but take a fools advice and ef youve got money in your pocket dont do it you dont think id gamble do you said ben horrorstruck ive seen youngsters smaller than you bet their pile you wont catch me doing it i am a poor boy and have nothing to lose all right then youre a country boy aint you yes so was i once but ive had the greenness rubbed offn me i was jest such a youngster as you once i wish i could go back twenty years youre not very old yet said ben in a tone of sympathy why dont you reform no im not oldonly thirtysixand i aint so bad as i might be im a rough customer i expect but i wouldnt do anything downright mean ef youre goin into this den ill go with you i cant take care of myself but mayhap i can keep you out of danger thank you sir so ben and his new acquaintance entered the famous gamblingden it was handsomely furnished and decorated with a long and gaily appointed bar while the mirrors pictures glass and silverware excited surprise and would rather have been expected in an older city there were crowds at the counter and crowds around the tables and the air was heavy with the odor of chinese punk which was used for cigarlights the tinkle of silver coin was heard at the tables though ounces of golddust were quite as commonly used in the games of chance i suppose a good deal of money is won here said ben looking around curiously theres a good deal lost said bens new acquaintance gentlemen will you drink with me said a young man with flushed face rising from a table nearby both hands full of silver and gold ive been lucky tonight and its my treat i dont care if i do said bens companion with alacrity and he named his drink whatll the boy have nothing thank you answered ben startled that wont do i insist upon your drinking hiccuped the young man who had evidently drunk freely already take it as a personal insult if you dont never mind the boy said his new friend to bens great relief hes young and innocent he hasnt been round like you an me thats so assented the young man taking the remark as a compliment well heres to you i wouldnt have done it said bens new friend rejoining him but itll help me to forget what a blamed fool ive been tonight you jest let the drink alone thats my advice i mean to said ben firmly do people drink much out here whiskys their natral element said the miner some of em dont drink water once a month an old friend of mine joe granger actlly forgot how it tasted i gave him a glass once by way of a joke and he said it was the weakest gin he ever tasted are there no temperance societies out here asked ben the miner laughed its my belief that a temperance lecturer would be mobbed or hung to the nearest lamppost he answered it is hardly necessary to say that even in intemperance was hardly as common in california as the statements of his new friend led ben to suppose his informant was sincere and spoke according to his own observation it is not remarkable that at the mines in the absence of the comforts of civilization those who drink rarely or not at all at home should seek the warmth and excitement of drink whats your name boy asked the miner abruptly ben stanton where were you raised though the term was a new one to ben he could not fail to understand it in the state of connecticut thats where they make wooden nutmegs said the miner isnt it i never saw any made there answered ben smiling i reckon youve come out here to make your fortin i should like to answered ben but i shall be satisfied if i make a living and a little more youll do it you look the right sort you do no bad habits and willin to work hard and go twentyfour hours hungry when you cant help it yes wherell you go firstto the mines i reckon yes answered ben reflecting that he would be most likely to find richard dewey at some miningsettlement ef i hadnt been a fool and lost all my money id go along with you i should like the company of some one who had already been at the mines said ben then it occurred to him that his new acquaintance might possibly have encountered dewey in his wanderings at any rate it would do no harm to inquire did you ever meet a man named dewey at the mines he asked friend of yours no i never saw him but i have promised to hunt him up i have some important news for him dewey mused the miner somehow that name sounds familiar like can you tell what he was like i never saw him but i can get a description of him im sure ive met a man by that name said the miner thoughtfully but i cant rightly locate him i have it he added suddenly it was at murphys over in calaveras that i came across him a quiet stiddy young manlooked as if hed come from a citynot rough like the rest of usmight have been twentyseven or twentyeight years olddidnt drink any moren you do but kept to work and minded his own business that must be the man i am after said ben eagerly do you think he is at murphys now how can i tell its most a year sence i met him likely hes gone miners dont stay as long as that in one place bens countenance fell he did not seem as near to the object of his journey as he at first thought still it was something to obtain a clue perhaps at murphys he might get a trace of dewey and following it up find him at last how far is murphys from here he asked two hundred miles i reckon then id better go there first not ef you want to find gold theres other places thats better and not so far away it may be so but i care more to find richard dewey than to find gold in plenty you said he wasnt a friend of yours said the miner in some surprise no i dont know him but i am engaged by a friend of his to find him that friend will pay my expenses while i am on the road has dewey come into a fortin asked the miner has a rich uncle died and left him all his pile not that i know of answered ben then theres a woman in it said his new acquaintance in a tone of conviction its his sweetheart that wants to find him im right yes i know it but theres one thing that i cant see through what is that why does the galif it is a galsend a boy like you on the trail suppose there was no one else to send suggested ben that makes it a little plainer where is the gal ought i to confide in this man thought ben i never met him before i only know that he has lost all his money at the gamblingtable yet he may help me and i must confide in somebody he is a rough customer but he seems honest and sincere here in san francisco he answered i cannot tell you more until i have her permission thats all right ef i can help you i will ben you said your name was ben yes mine is bradleyjake bradley i was raised in kentucky and ive got an old mother living there now i hope i havent heard anything from her for nigh a year it makes me homesick when i think of it got a mother ben neither father nor mother answered ben sadly thats bad said the miner with rough sympathy youre a young chap to be left alone in the world yes i do feel very lonely sometimes mr bradley dont call me mr bradley i aint used to it call me jake all right ill remember it where can i meet you again jake here will do as well as anywhere will you be here tomorrow morning at nine oclock yes answered bradley ill ask the porter to call me early he added with rough humor ben remembered that his new acquaintance had no money to pay for a nights lodging and would be forced to sleep out cant i lend you enough money to pay for a lodging he asked you kin but you neednt jake bradley aint that delicate that itll hurt him to sleep out no ben save your money and ef i actilly need it ill make bold to ask you for it but i dont throw away no money on a bed if you hadnt lost your money in there said ben pointing to the building they had just left wouldnt you have paid for a bed i might have put on a little style then i allow it dont do for a man with a thousand dollars in his belt to lie out i aint afraid now ben on leaving his new acquaintance thought it best to go back at once to miss sinclair to communicate the information he had obtained rightly deeming it of importance well ben have you seen the whole town so soon asked miss sinclair looking up from her trunk which she was unpacking no cousin ida but i think i have learned something of mr dewey you have not seen him asked miss sinclair quickly no i have not seen him but i have seen a man who met him nearly a year since at the mines tell me about it ben said the young lady where was it that this man saw richardmr dewey at murphys where is that two hundred miles away that is not far are you willing to go there yes but you must remember cousin ida that it is nearly a year since he was there and miners never stay long in one place at least so my miner friend tells me at any rate you may learn something of him there that is true will this man go with you he would but he has no money to get out of the city i will pay his expenses as far as murphys and farther if he is likely to prove of service i think it will be best if you can afford it said ben he knows the country and i dont three months from now i should be willing to start off alone but now it is much better that you should have company it will cost you a good deal of money cousin ida i shall not grudge a large sum if need be to find richard when can you see this man again tomorrow morning bring him here and i will make arrangements with him chapter xiii preliminary arrangements at nine oclock on the following morning ben found jake bradley at the appointed rendezvous youre on time my lad said jake i didnt know as youd think it worth while to look me up i promised said ben and youve kept your promise thats moren many a man would do how did you pass the night asked ben i stretched out on the soft side of a board it isnt the first time i slept like a top have you had breakfast well there youve got me said jake i reckoned on findin an old friend that keeps a saloon on montgomery street but hes sold out to another man and i hadnt the face to ask him for a bite what a consarned fool i was to throw away all my pile where is the saloon said ben we will go there and while you are eating we can arrange our business thank you boy i aint above acceptin a favor of you and i allow that im empty and need fillin up you neednt thank me mr bradley jake jake then i am only acting as the agent of miss sinclair the gal you spoke of ben nodded then you can thank her if theres anything i kin do for her jest let me know i mean to that is the business i want to speak to you about after a hearty breakfast the two turned their steps to the private boardinghouse where miss sinclair was eagerly awaiting them though jake referred to her as the gal in his conversation with ben he was entirely respectful when brought face to face with the young lady i want to thank you for my breakfast miss first of all said the miner if i hadnt been such a thunderin fool i neednt have been beholden to any one but you are entirely welcome mr bradley said the young lady ben tells me that you know something of richard dewey yes miss he is a valued friend of mine and i am anxious to hear all that you can tell me of him you dont know where he is now no miss when did you see him nigh on to a year ago that is a long time you have heard nothing of him since no miss i should say yes he added with sudden recollection one of our boys saw him some months later and reported that he was well and prosperin i disremember where he was but somewhere at the mines that is something do you think you could find him i could try miss i am going to send out ben but he is only a boy i should like to have you go with him you know the country and he does not besides you have seen mr dewey yes i should know him agin if i met him how did he seem when you knew him asked ida hesitating because conscious that the question was vaguely expressed and might not be understood he was a quiet sober chap workin early and late answered jake who rough as he was comprehended the drift of her questions he wasnt exactly poplar with the boys because he wouldnt drink with em and that made them think he was proud or grudged the expense they were very greatly mistaken said ida hastily we found that out said the miner a young chap fell sick he was a newcomer and had neither friends nor money and was pretty bad off dewey sat up with him night after night and gave him fifty dollars when he got well to help him back to frisco you see his sickness made him tired of the mines that was like richard said ida softly he was always kindhearted after that continued jake none of us had a word to say agin him we knowed him better and we liked him for his kindness to that young chap if jake bradley had sought to commend himself to ida sinclair he could not have found a better or more effectual way than by praising her lover she became more cordial at once and better satisfied with the arrangement she had formed to send off the exminer in bens company in search of her lover the arrangements were speedily made the two were to start out equipped at miss sinclairs expense on an exploringtour the main object being to find richard dewey and apprise him of her arrival in california they were permitted however to work at mining wherever there was a favorable opportunity but never to lose sight of the great object of their expedition from time to time as they had opportunity they were to communicate with miss sinclair imparting any information they might have gathered i shall have to leave much to your discretion said ida addressing them both i know absolutely nothing of the country and you mr bradley are tolerably familiar with it i have only to add that should you become unfortunate and require more money you have only to let me know in any event i shall take care to recompense you for all your efforts in my behalf we dont want to bear too heavy on your purse miss said jake bradley once we get to the mines we kin take care of ourselves cant we ben i hope so mr bradley bradley eyed ben reproachfully and our hero at once smilingly corrected himself i mean jake that suits me better i spose the young lady wouldnt like to call me jake i think not said ida smiling i aint used to bein called mister the boys always called me jake but i am not one of the boys mr bradley said miss sinclair right you are miss and i reckon richard dewey would rather have you as you are ida laughed merrily to her the miner was a new character unlike any she had ever met and though rough and unconventional she was disposed to like him find him for me and you can ask him the question if you like tell him from mebut you must first know me by my real name ben looked surprised he had forgotten that ida sinclair was only assumed to elude the vigilance of her guardian my real name is florence douglas i am of scotch descent as you will judge can you remember the name i can cousin idai mean cousin florence said ben then let ida sinclair be forgotten richard mr deweywould not know me by that name i tell you ben that gals a trump said jake bradley enthusiastically when they were by themselves and so ill tell dick dewey when i see him shes been a kind friend to me jake i hope we can find mr dewey for her well find him if hes in california answered jake chapter xiv the canon hotel late in the afternoon of the third day subsequent a man and a boy might have been seen riding slowly through a rocky canon probably eighty miles west from san francisco both were mounted on the small native horses of california generally called mustangs these animals possess a strength disproportioned to their size and show great endurance at times they have a playful habit of bucking not quite agreeable to an inexperienced horseman the reader will already have guessed that the two riders are jake bradley and ben the mustangs were on a walk being apparently weary with the days tramp well ben said bradley what do you say to camping out for the night i have no objection said ben and i dont think my horse has he is better off than mine having less to carry are you tired not very tired but my limbs are rather stiff what hotel shall we put up at ben asked bradley with a humorous glance about him there isnt much choice said ben the canon hotel seems to be the only one that is open hereabouts the only objection is that we shall have to sleep on the floor with the windows all open thats about so ben assented bradley laughing i shouldnt mind sleeping in a christian bed tonight myself well here goes as he spoke he jumped from the back of his horse and taking out a rope tethered it to a tree hard by ben followed his example now for the grub said bradley im powerfully empty myself this ridin all day up and down hill is wearin to the stomach what do you say ive got a healthy appetite myself jake this yere canon hotel that you was talkin about aint firstclass it dont supply anything but cold victuals now ef we had a cup of coffee to wash it down and kinder warm us up it would go to the right spot eh ben you are right jake but please dont speak of it again it makes my mouth water stay here a few minutes ben and ill reconnoiter a little perhaps i can find a better place for campin all right jake while bradley was absent ben threw himself on the ground and began to think it was the third day of the expedition ben enjoyed riding through this new unsettled country he almost felt in the solitudes of the woods and hills as if he were the original explorer of this fardistant country he was more than three thousand miles away from his native town entrusted with a mission of importance the thought was gratifying to his boyish fancy and inspired him with a new sense of power and increased his selfreliance he was glad however to have the company of jake bradley he was ready to acknowledge that his chances of success had he started alone would have been much smaller and certainly he would have found it exceedingly lonesome his companion was not a man of culture nor were his tastes elevated but there was a rough honesty about him and a good humor which made him an agreeable companion besides he knew the country and ben felt secure in leaving the conduct of the trip to him i am glad i came out here thought ben as with his head pillowed on his knapsack he looked up through the branches of the tall trees to the blue sky beyond its better than staying at home and working for deacon pitkin or blacking boots for sam sturgis here i am my own man free and dont need to run at anybodys bidding probably most boys of bens age share his love of independence but it is neither practicable nor desirable that at sixteen a boy should be his own master much as he may desire it in the case of our hero circumstances had thrown him upon his own resources and it may be added that he could better be trusted with the management of himself than most boys bens reverie was broken in upon by the return of his companion what are you dreamin about ben queried jake i was thinking about home jake this dont look much like it eh ben not much well my lad ive found something continued bradley found something what a nugget exclaimed ben in excitement not much this aint the place for such a find as that what then jake ive found a hotel where asked ben eagerly get up and stand by me there look yonder what do you see it looks like smoke it is smoke theres a cabin yonder ive reconnoitered and i seed the door open and a woman inside now im going to ask her to give us some supper and a bed wont that be fine splendid jake then unhitch that animal of yours and well put our best foot forrards and maybe well get a hot supper and a christian bed to sleep in chapter xv a polite hostess the cabin was a rough one built of logs with an adobe chimney it contained two rooms and a loft the inducements to live in such a lonely spot must have been small enough but so many undesirable localities are inhabited that it is hardly worth while to feel or express surprise at mens taste in such matters the approach of ben and his companion was not observed by the inmate or inmates of the cabin it was only when bradley dismounting from his mustang struck the doorpost with the handle of his whipfor it is needless to say that bells were not to be found in that neighborhood that their presence became known a woman tall spare and with harsh features came to the door she eyed bradley askance well whats wanted and who are you she demanded we are bound for the mines maam said bradley we expected to camp out tonight but we happened to see the smoke rising from your chimbly and we made bold to ride up and ask you for supper and a nights lodging we dont take in tramps said the woman roughly were on a tramp said bradley resolved not to be rebuffed but weve got money to pay for our accommodations this aint a hotel said the woman but less roughly of course not said bradley in a conciliatory manner but i guess you wont object to get us some supper and give us a bed well pay for all the trouble we make thats fair aint it i dont know what my husband will say returned the woman in an undecided manner wont you ask him maam hes gone out just now he wont be back for an hour while youre waitin for him cant you get us some supper then you can send us off if he aint willin to keep us ill do that said the woman youd better stay outside till i get supper ready there aint much room here and youll be in the way jest as you say maam i spose it would be too much to ask if you kin give us a hot cup of coffee we havent tasted any since we left frisco i can give you coffee answered the woman my husband likes it and we always keep it on hand good said bradley his face lighting up with satisfaction weve rid far today and a cup of coffee will go to the right spot bradley and ben threw themselves on the ground nearby and awaited with complacence the call to supper were in luck ben said his companion whod have expected a hot supper out here in this lonely place i dont much like the looks of our landlady jake said ben she aint handsome i allow ben but if she gives us a good supper that dont matter we must make the most of this for its uncertain when we get another wont she give us breakfast in the morning i didnt think of that maybe she will and thatll be a good start on our tomorrows journey in about threequarters of an hour the woman came to the door and called the travelers in to supper an unpainted wooden table was set in the middle of the floor on which was spread a simple but appetizing meal there was a plate of meat which appeared to have been fried a loaf of bread and a pot of coffee but there was neither milk nor butter this naturally detracted from the attractiveness of the bread and coffee but our travelers were not disposed to be fastidious ben tasted the meat and it evidently puzzled him in taste it differed from anything he had eaten before bradley smiled at his perplexity dont you know what it is ben he asked no do you like it i am hungry enough to enjoy anything well lad its bear steak bear steak repeated ben in surprise exactly ive eaten it before two or three times you see we havent any markets here to depend on and we must take what we can get it isnt bad said ben meditatively during this conversation the landlady had been out of the room as it concluded she reentered your supper is good maam said bradley now if you only had a cow to supply you with milk and butter youd be fixed complete if you want em youll have to go somewhere else said the woman excuse me maam i wasnt complainin of the farenot by no means i was only thinkin of you theres no call to think of me stranger have you lived long in these parts maam inquired bradley socially fools ask questions and fools answer them i aint a fool responded the polite hostess excuse my curiosity maam i didnt know that it would be disagreeable to you to answer who told you it was i thought from your way of speakin its none of your business thats all said the hostess even bradley was silenced it was clear that their hostess was not inclined to be social the remainder of the meal passed in silence chapter xvi a new acquaintance after supper the two travelers emerged from the cabin and stretched themselves out under the trees once more bradley produced a clay pipe filled the bowl with tobacco and began to smoke its a pity you dont smoke ben he said his face expressing the satisfaction he felt would you advise me to jake questioned our hero no ben i guess youre better off without it but theres nothing makes me feel so good as a smoke after a good supper i feel comfortable without it jake then let well enough alone i wonder whether our sweettempered hostess is goin to give us a bed tonight not that it matters much id rather have a good supper and sleep under the trees than have the best bed in californy without the supper here their attention was drawn to a man who was leisurely approaching he was dressed roughly in a red shirt trousers tucked in his boots and a hat with a broad flapping brim as he strode along his revolver and bowieknife were carelessly exposed his complexion was dark he wore an abundant beard and whatever he might be he looked like a desperado whom one would not care to meet on a dark night unless well armed and on the alert he stopped short when he caught sight of the two travelers who are you he asked abruptly were bound for the mines answered bradley your good lady if so be as you live there indicating the cabinhas just provided us with a capital supper the newcomer glanced toward the door of the cabin at which the woman now made her appearance givin you some supper eh i hope shes saved some for me yes jack said his wife in a conciliatory tone theres plenty for you these strangers offered to pay well for supper and lodging and i thought you wouldnt object i gave them the supper but i wouldnt say anything about the lodging until you came well stir round old gal and get me something to eat for im dead hungry supper is ready now jack the man entered his cabin and the next twenty minutes were consumed in repairing the ravages of hunger how do you like his looks jake asked ben in a low voice hes just the sort of man id expect to find in a state prison answered bradley that mans a rascal if looks mean anything ill tell you what he reminds me of jake did you ever read oliver twist all of a twist thats a queer name what is it its a story by dickens he describes a brutal villain named bill sykes who murders his wife this chap looks as if he wouldnt mind doing it his wifes afraid of him though half an hour ago i would have said she wasnt afraid of anything thats so they seem pretty well matched presently the master of the cabin came out it was not easy for his harsh features to look amiable but his manner was no longer offensive he even seemed inclined to be social traveled fur today he inquired about thirty miles as near as i can guess said bradley is that your boy no hes no kin to me were travelin togetherthats all goin to the mines we are goin to murphys come from frisco yes the proprietor of the cabin at this reply fixed his eyes reflectively upon ben and his companion id like to know what hes thinkin about said bradley to himself somehow i mistrust him a man with that face cant help bein a scoundrel dont you find it lonely livin out here he asked jack carter shrugged his shoulders i dont care for company he said as long as me and the old woman get enough to eat our own companys good enough for us are there any mines nearby asked bradley not very what inducement can he have to live out here in the wilderness thought bradley if he were workin a mine now i could understand how does he make a livin i wonder have you lived here long he asked quite a while it was clear that jack did not care to answer definitely and was disposed to give as little information as possible about himself it was yet early when the two travelers felt an inclination to sleep they had had a hard days tramp and wished to be stirring early the next day as yet however they were uncertain whether they would be permitted to sleep in the cabin bradley resolved to put the question to the man if you havent got room for us to sleep he said ben and i will camp out as we have done before the old womans makin up a bed for you said jack we dont keep a hotel but weve got room for you two thank you wait here and ill see if the beds ready he entered the cabin probably to consult with his wife i dont know why it is ben said bradley in a low voice but i mistrust that man dont you think it safe to sleep here asked ben gravely i think if we are prudent we shall keep a careful watch over our host and hostess they may mean us harm what motive would they have for harming us jake to get possession of our money theres a gang of robbers hereabouts who make their livin by stopping stages and lyin in wait for solitary travelers and i strongly suspect that this man is one of them do you judge from his looks not wholly but i cant think of any other motive he can have for livin in this outoftheway place there are no mines near and the huntin wouldnt pay him i may be mistaken but thats what i think what shall we do asked ben a little startled by his companions suggestion thats more than i can tell you ben we might camp out and be surprised in our sleep no we shall be as safe in the cabin as outside besides i may be wrong but hush here comes our agreeable friend jack carter had in his hand a bottle and a tin mug strangers said he jack carters a poor man but hes not so poor that he cant offer a glass of wine to a friend as he spoke he poured out a liberal mug of wine and offered it to bradley our friend bradley was not a member of a temperance society and he could not resist the temptation his conscience smote him when he thought of the suspicions he had cherished and there was a sudden revulsion after all thought he jack carter is a good fellow he dont look it to be sure but a man cant help his looks what is it the poet says a man may smile and be a villain still jacks a rough customer but hes treatin ben and me tiptop i drink your health jack he said cordially youve treated ben and me like gentlemen and were glad to know you youre the right sort and he drained the mug jack carter filled it again and passed it to ben take a drink boy he said it will make you feel good no thank you said ben politely whats the matter asked jack frowning why wont you drink i never drink answered ben i promised my father i wouldnt and i cant break my word this wine is weak it wouldnt hurt a baby i would rather not drink said ben aint you goin a little too fur ben remonstrated bradley your father meant rum and whisky and sich he wouldnt mind wine yes he would said ben resolutely i had an uncle who died a drunkard and it was that that made my father so particular i promised him faithfully and now that hes dead i cant break my work to him the boys right jack said bradley it wont hurt you and me but if he dont want to drink we wont press him its blasted nonsense exclaimed jack angrily the boys puttin on airs thats whats the matter hes a good boy said bradley you dont know him as well as i do jest as you say muttered jack in a dissatisfied tone if you want to go to bed now you can im ready for one said bradley rising with alacrity im powerful sleepy come in then they followed their host into the cabin chapter xvii a tight place the lower part of the cabin was divided into two rooms over which was a loft there was no staircase but there was a short ladder by which the ascent was made youre to sleep up there said jack pointing to the loft me and the old woman sleep below all right said bradley gaping i can sleep anywhere tonight im powerful sleepy he ascended the ladder first and ben followed there was no bedstead but a straw pallet was stretched in one corner with a blanket in place of a quilt i shant undress ben said bradley throwing himself down on the rude bed i cant keep my eyes open long enough i think i never felt so sleepy in the whole course of my life i am tired but not sleepy returned ben i wont undress either i can sleep just as well in my clothes scarcely a minute had passed when bradley was breathing in the unconsciousness of slumber as ben lay down beside him he could not help feeling surprised at his companions yielding so suddenly to the power of sleep that he should be tired was not surprising but when seated outside he had not seemed unusually drowsy that is up to the time of his drinking the wine a quick suspicion flashed upon bens mind had the wine anything to do with this sudden drowsiness ben had not much experience of life but he had heard of liquors being drugged and it seemed possible that the wine which had been offered to bradley might have been tampered with if so it was only too evident what was the object of their host it was natural to suppose that the two travelers were provided with money and it was undoubtedly the intention of jack carter to rob them in their sleep this was not a pleasant thought nor one calculated to soothe ben to sleep he was only a boy and to find himself in a robbers den was certainly rather a startling discovery if he had been able to consult with his companion it would have been a relief but bradley was in a profound sleep ben nudged him but without the slightest effect he was insensible as a log finding more vigorous measures necessary the boy shook him but succeeded only in eliciting a few muttered words i cant wake him thought ben more and more disturbed in mind i am sure it must be the wine which makes him sleep so heavily what can i do this question was more easily asked than answered ben was quite aware that singlehanded he could not cope with a powerful man like carter with bradleys help he would have felt secure but no assistance could now be expected from his companion so far as he could see he must submit to be robbed and to see his companion robbed of course there was a chance that he might be mistaken it was possible that bradleys might be a natural sleep induced by excessive fatigue and there might be nothing sinister in the intentions of their host ben however found it difficult to convince himself of this much as he desired to do so the existence of a gang of robbers in the vicinity referred to by bradley was not calculated to reassure him if carter did not belong to this gang his personal appearance was certainly calculated to foster the suspicion of his connection with them and the suspicion was strengthened by the fact of his living in this lonely place without any apparent inducement for the first time perhaps since he had left the east he wished himself in the security of home as deacon pitkins hired boy living on frugal diet he would have been better off than here at the mercy of a mountain bandit but ben was a boy of spirit and not inclined to submit in a cowardly manner without first considering if in any possible manner he could guard against the danger which menaced him fatigued as he was by the days ride he would under ordinary circumstances have fallen asleep quickly but now anxiety and apprehension kept him broad awake if i could only rouse bradley he said to himself i should feel more comfortable i dont like the responsibility of deciding what is best to be done his thoughts were interrupted by the sound of low voices below evidently carter and his wife were conversing and probably about them anxious to hear what was said as this might give him a clue to their plans ben rose softly from his low couch and drew near the edge of the opening through which he had mounted into the loft in this position he was able to hear what was said they must have money said carter they would need it to get them out to the mines whatever it is i am bound to have it the man seems strong replied the wife you may not find it an easy task to master him what can he do returned carter contemptuously he is in a dead sleep i put enough stuff into his wine to keep him in a stupor for twelve good hours if im not a match for a sleeping man ill go and hang myself but the boyhe took no wine no hes one of them temperance sneaks but hes only a baby i could lay him out with one hand dont harm him jack said the woman i cant help feeling kindly to him our boy had he lived would have been about his age i cant help thinking of that dont be silly because we had a boy once mustnt interfere with business but you wont hurt him jack pleaded the woman who hard as she seemed appeared to have a soft side to her nature no i wont hurt the brat if he behaves himself and doesnt get bumptious likely enough hell be fast asleep boys at his age generally sleep well in the morning they will discover that they have been robbed what will you say to them tell them its none of my business that i know nothing about it but if the boy is awake and sees you at work jack then it will be different it would have been better for him to have taken the wine do you think he suspected anything no how could he suspect that the wine was drugged he is one of them temperance sneaks i tell you how soon are you going up jack in half an hour i want to give the boy time enough to get asleep that will make matters easy dont you think i had better go up jack why should you why should i let a woman do my work then i should know the boy would receive no harm oh thats it is it you make a great fuss about the boy yes i cant help thinking about my own boy oh drop that it makes me sick wasnt he my boy as well as yours im sorry hes gone i could have brought him up to be a help to us in our business never jack never exclaimed his wife fervently hello whats that i mean that i should have been unwilling to have our son grow up no better than we are he at any rate should have been a good man whats up now old woman you havent been attending sundayschool lately have you demanded jack with a sneer i did once jack and i havent quite forgotten what i learned there though it dont look like it now are you going back on me demanded jack fiercely no jack its too late for that i have helped you and i mean to help you but tonight the sight of that boy and the thought of our son who died so long ago have given me a turn if it was a man it would be different but you have promised you wont harm him and no more need be said too much has been said already to my thinkin growled jack however thats over and i expect you to help me if i need help ben heard every word that was said and it confirmed his suspicions there was no doubt that an attempt would be made to rob him and his companion before morning and the prospect was not pleasant by submitting quietly he would come to no harm and the loss of the money would not be irreparable he and bradley had each started with a hundred dollars supplied by miss doughlas and thus far but little of this sum had been spent their employer would doubtless send them a further supply if they were robbed but they would be reluctant to apply to her since the loss would be partly the result of their imprudence ben felt that he was in a tight place and he was not quite certain what he should or could do chapter xviii an evening call to lie awake in momentary expectation of a hostile attack from which there is apparently no escape is by no means a comfortable position the cabin was in the heart of the woods with no other dwelling within twenty miles so far as ben knew in fact if it were true as jack had said that there were no mines near at hand there were probably no neighbors except possibly of jacks kind the question recurred to ben was he willing to surrender his money and go forth penniless or should he attempt to escape or resist if jake would only wake up he thought surveying with perplexity the recumbent form at his side but jake was as senseless as a log and the attempt to rouse him would inevitably attract attention below and precipitate the attack besides leaving them utterly penniless there was another idea which occurred to our hero could he secrete his own money and jakes or the greater part of it and thus save it from the clutches of his dishonest host if it had been in the form of bankbills there might have been some chance of doing this but it was not so easy to conceal gold pieces while considering this question ben rose softly and looked out of the window strictly speaking there was no window but a hole about fifteen inches square screened by a curtain of coarse cotton cloth this ben moved aside and looked out it was not a very dark night in the halflight ben was able to see a considerable distance the height of the opening from the ground was probably not much over twelve feet as well as the boy could estimate there would have been no difficulty in his getting out and swinging to the ground but to this move there were two objections first he would be sure to be heard by his enemy below and secondly he was unwilling to leave jake in the power of the enemy while he was standing at the window he heard the noise of some one moving below the heavy step convinced him that it was jack he could not leave his place and lie down without being detected and he hastily decided to remain where he was in this way he might possibly gain time jack softly stepped from round to round of the ladder and presently his head peered above the floor he started angrily when he saw the boy at the window what are you about there boy he demanded roughly ben turned and said composedly i am looking out why are you not in bed and asleep like your friend i tried to sleep sir but i couldnt do you expect to get to sleep looking out of that hole i thought id see how light it was well i cant have you trampin round keepin the old woman and me awake i wouldnt have let you sleep here ef i had known thats the way you spend the night i beg pardon if i disturbed you said ben politely well that dont do no good your apologizin jest lay down and get to sleep in a hurry or ill know the reason why all right sir said ben submissively whats the name of that chap thats with you continued jack its jake bradley hes a sensible man he is he lays down and goes to sleep while youre trampin round the room and lookin out of doors you wont see nothin to pay you i think youre right sir ill lie down and go to sleep youd better me and the old woman cant be kept awake all night when ben had resumed his place on the floor the intruder descended the ladder though it would have been easy enough to execute his plan of robbery now he evidently preferred to wait till both the travelers should be asleep it was not true as he had said that he had heard ben moving about in fact it had been a surprise to him to find the boy up but this afforded a convenient and plausible pretext for his intrusion and he had availed himself of it chapter xix bens midnight excursion when jack carter went downstairs it was his intention to wait from half an hour to an hour and then to make another visit to his lodgers this would allow time for ben to fall asleep and although jack would have had no difficulty in overcoming his resistance he preferred to commit the robbery when both the travelers were in a state of unconsciousness but he overestimated his ability to keep awake usually he was a sound sleeper and during the day preceding he had taken a long walk across the mountains the natural result followed while he was waiting for ben to fall asleep he fell asleep himself ben was not long in ascertaining this welcome fact a series of noises not very musical announced that jack was asleep he had a confirmed habit of snoring to which fortunately his wife had become accustomed so that it did not disturb her rest ben crept near the edge of the loft and looked over the bed on which his amiable host reposed was in full view both husband and wife were fast asleep and their sleep was likely to be protracted under this change of circumstances what was ben to do this was the question which he anxiously asked himself now there would be no difficulty in escaping if he saw fit but here there was a difficulty jake could not be roused and if he could it would not be very agreeable to lose a nights sleep for ben as well as his host felt very sleepy yet if he allowed himself to remain in the loft the danger of robbery would recur in the morning for jack would be sure to wake earlier than bradley who had been drugged as ben was convinced sometimes in the midst of perplexity a way of relief is suddenly opened a lucky suggestion sent perhaps by an overruling providence provides a path of escape from some menacing evil this happened in the present instance why thought ben cant i take our money steal downstairs and out of the cabin and hide it in some secure place where we can find it in the morning then i can sleep in security for the remainder of the night and my thievish friend will be disappointed no sooner did the idea occur to ben than he prepared to carry it out as has already been said bradley had about a hundred dollars in gold pieces and ben as much more this would have made a very good haul for jack who did not anticipate obtaining so much it was more than our young hero felt willing to lose and he was prepared to run a large risk in the effort to save it the risk of course was that he might wake jack or his wife in coming downstairs there would be no difficulty in opening the door for it was not fastened in any way as to the danger of rousing his entertainers ben was not much afraid of waking jack for he was evidently in a sound sleep his wife was more likely to be disturbed and in that case ben was provided with an excuse he would say that he was thirsty and in search of some water which would have been true enough though this was not the main object of his expedition ben had not taken off his shoes and stockings and began to descend the ladder with his shoes on but it occurred to him that his steps might be audible and he quietly removed both shoes and stockings he had previously taken bradleys money with the exception of a few dollars without in the least arousing his sleepy comrade who in consequence of the potion he had unsuspiciously taken was still wrapped in unconscious slumber now thought ben i must do my work as quickly as i can he was not insensible to the risk he ran and it was not without a thrill of excitement that he set foot on the floor of the cabin and looked at the sleeping faces of jack carter and his wife but there was no time to waste he stepped softly to the door and opened it just then the woman stirred in her sleep and uttered something unintelligible ben was alarmed lest she were about to wake up and stood stockstill with his fingers on the latch but there was no further sound the woman partially turned over and soon her quiet regular breathing notified ben that sleep had resumed its power over her probably she had stirred in consequence of some uneasy dream with a deep breath of relief ben opened the door passed out and closed it softly after him he was out of the house and in the freedom of the woods before morning he might have put fifteen miles between him and the cabin of his foes he would have felt disposed to do so and avoid all further trouble if bradley had been with him and in condition to travel as this was not to be thought of he proceeded to search for a suitable place to secrete his troublesome treasure the cabin stood in a valley or canon in the shadow of gigantic pinetrees rising straight as a flagpole to the altitude of nearly two hundred feet they were forest giants impressive in their lofty stature and ben regarded them with wonder and awe they were much smaller in every way than the socalled big trees to be found in the calaveras and mariposa groves but these had not at that time been discovered and the pines were the largest trees our hero had ever encountered ben looked about him in vain to find a suitable hidingplace in the immediate neighborhood of the cabin if there had been a large flat rock under which he could have placed the gold pieces that would have suited him but there was absolutely nothing of the kind in sight so ben wandered away hardly knowing whither his steps were carrying him till he must have been at least a quarter of a mile distant from the cabin here his attention was attracted by a tree of larger circumference than any he had seen nearer which showed the ravages of time the bark was partly worn away and approaching nearer ben saw that it had begun to decay from within there was an aperture about a foot above the ground through which he could readily thrust his hand thats the very thing exclaimed ben his eyes lighting up with pleasure nobody would ever think of looking for money there here i can hide our gold and tomorrow when we set out on our journey we can take this tree on our way ben took from his pockets the gold which belonged to bradley and himself and wrapping them securely in a paper which he happened to have with him he thrust the whole into the cavity in the tree there said he our treasure is much safer there than it would be in our possession for tonight at least ben carefully took the bearings of the tree that he might not forget it there was little difficulty about this as it was larger than any of its neighbors not so tall perhaps but of greater circumference i shall remember it now he said to himself as ben walked back to the humble cabin he became very drowsy he was quite fatigued with his days march and it was now nearly or quite two hours since his companion had fallen asleep it was fortunate for him that ben had been more wakeful i shall be glad enough to sleep now thought ben i dont know when i have felt more tired he reached the cabin door and listened outside to learn whether any one were stirring he could still hear the sonorous snore of jack and could distinguish the deep breathing of his hostess all seemed to be safe he softly opened the door and closed it after him without arousing any one he made his way up the ladder to the loft where bradley lay precisely as he had left him ben threw himself down beside him with a deep sigh of satisfaction and in ten minutes he too was sound asleep chapter xx a thiefs disappointment jack garter regardless of his plans respecting his guests slept through the night and it was not till after the sun rose that he opened his eyes his wife was already up and moving about the room jack stretched himself negligently but all at once his purpose flashed upon him bess what time is it he demanded past six oclock as you can see by the sun curse it what made me fall asleep ejaculated jack with an oath now it may be too late how long have you been awake bess he asked an hour or more why didnt you wake me up demanded jack sharply i didnt know you wanted me to answered his wife only yesterday you swore at me for waking you up an hour later yesterday isnt today and i had something to do said jack looking significantly upward didnt you attend to it last night no curse my drowsiness i fell asleep like a naturalborn fool that i was how could i know that i was asleep myself you always have some excuse said jack rather unreasonably just quit movin round and makin a noise it may not be too late yet no sound was heard in the loft above happily the two lodgers might still be asleep so jack said to himself and in that case he might still be able to carry out his plan at any rate there was no time to lose and he began softly to ascend the ladder when his head reached the level of the flooring he looked eagerly at the rude couch where his guests lay both were fast asleep bradley was still held in the power of the powerful drug which had been mingled with his wine and ben had yielded to the sound and healthful slumber which at his age follows fatigue his boyish face lay on his hand and he looked innocent and happy there was a smile about his lips for he was dreaming of his faraway home the sight might have appealed to any one less hardened than jack carter calling up memories of his own dead boy and powerfully appealing to what heart he had left but jack felt simply relieved to find that the boy whose wakefulness he had feared was sound asleep all the better he muttered it isnt too late after all now jack carter is your time i hope youll make a good haul treading softly jack stepped to the side of bradley he thought it best to rid him first for there was no danger of his waking up but he was destined to disappointment the most thorough search brought to light only five dollars in gold what has he done with his money muttered the thief with a frown of course he must have more the idea came to him that the bulk of the money might have been given to the boy who was less likely to attract the notice of plunderers this was a point easily settled and jack turned his attention to ben ben was asleep when the search commenced but his sleep was not as profound as bradleys and he woke up but luckily recollection came with consciousness and summoning all his selfcommand he counterfeited sleep not interfering with jack or his designs he was willing to lose the little he had in his pocket and besides he was curious to hear what jack would say when he found out how inconsiderable was the booty which he secured it must be admitted that ben found it difficult to restrain himself from some movement which would have betrayed to the thief that he was awake jack however being fully convinced that ben was asleep did not fix his eyes upon the countenance of his young lodger and so remained ignorant of his wakefulness the second search proved no more satisfactory than the first the boy was no richer than the man in a low voice jack indulged in an oath indicating his deep disgust i didnt think they were such poor tramps he said to himself or i wouldnt have taken all this trouble only ten dollars between the two of them why theyre little more than beggars stay they might have concealed their money there was no place in the loft for it was wholly bare of furniture but their luggage was thrown down carelessly there were no lodes and jack was able to extend his search to their knapsacks but he found nothing that repaid him he was forced finally to the conclusion that they were as poor as they seemed had jack carter been one of those generous highwaymen of whom we sometimes read he would have disdained to rob ben and his friend of their little all but indeed that was not his style he coolly pocketed the two gold pieces which were all he had been able to find and sullenly descended the ladder his wife looked at him inquiringly look at that he said grumblingly as he displayed the two gold pieces was it all you could find yes they must be poor poor they are beggars the woman who was not as hard as she looked was struck with compassion give it back to them jack she entreated it is little enough and they will have need of it so do i have need of it growled her lord and master no you dont jack it isnt worth your taking im the best judge of that woman they will suffer i cant bear to have that boy suffer he reminds me so of our dead son youre a fool said her husband roughly and you have no heart said his wife bitterly i dont want one if its going to make a fool of me come hurry up the breakfast for i must be out of the way before they come down theyll miss their money and i dont want to be asked any questions what shall i say if they ask me where it is jack anything you like he answered impatiently say the cat did it or anything else do you think a woman needs teachin what she is to say they will think we did it persisted his wife let them they cant prove anything just hurry up that breakfast i tell you the wife did as she was ordered and jack sat down to his breakfast he ate heartily having a conscience that did not trouble him about such trifles as plundering the guests who had slept beneath his roof and rose to leave the house give em some breakfast he said as he opened the door and tell em you wont take no pay on account of their loss thatll about make things square i reckon ive taken my pay in advance he shouldered his gun and went out into the woods chapter xxi bens savingsbank it was not till an hour afterward that ben rose from his lowly couch and by dint of violent shaking succeeded in rousing bradley come bradley wake up he cried the sun is high and it is time we were on our way bradley stretched himself took a long breath and said i must have had a long sleep yes you dropped off as soon as you lay down and have slept ever since and did you sleep as soundly no i was awake twice during the night answered ben i dont know how it is but i am sleepy still seems to me i dont stand fatigue as well as you i am sleepy yet and feel as if i could sleep all the forenoon the effects of the drug thought ben ben considered whether he should tell bradley what had happened during the night he decided briefly to say a few words about it in a whisper and postpone a full explanation till later for their hostess was below and could hear any loud word that might be uttered bradley was instructed that he must claim to have lost five dollars but i had a hundred said bradley feeling in his pockets its all right whispered ben ill explain by and by not a word of the loss till after breakfast bradley was quite bewildered and utterly failed to understand the situation but he had considerable faith in his young companion and was willing to follow bens instructions they descended the ladder ben in advance the woman looked at them sharply to see if they had yet discovered the robbery but each seemed unconcerned they dont know it yet she said to herself madam can you give us some breakfast asked ben politely ill give you such as i have said mrs carter feeling a little remorse for her husbands theft and pity for what she supposed their penniless condition that will be perfectly satisfactory and we shall be much obliged to you the breakfast was nearly ready in anticipation of their needs and they partook of it heartily now came the critical moment ben thrust his hand into his pocket appearing to search for his money and after a brief space withdrew it in apparent dismay i cant find my money he said mrs carters face flushed but she said nothing she anticipated their suspicion and was ashamed bradley said ben have you your money jake bradley repeated the search and he too expressed surprise i had it when i went to bed he added what is it asked the woman slowly turning to them a troubled face have you lost anything i dont seem to find my money maam answered bradley nor i mine said ben its curious mrs carter could not tell by their manner whether they suspected anything but she had her story ready it was an invention but life with jack carter had left her few compunctions about such a simple matter as telling a lie i missed something myself she said we dont lock our door of nights and i reckon some tramp got in last night when we were asleep and robbed us all have you lost much you two not much maam there wasnt much to take its a pity i am sorry it happened under my roof but we slept very sound last night jack and me and thats the way it must have come she looked at them critically to detect if she could whether they suspected her husband or herself but both the travelers were on their guard did you have much taken maam asked bradley no she answered hurriedly rather ashamed of the imposture we aint rich jack nor i what i am most sorry for said ben is that we have nothing to pay for our accommodations youre welcome to your lodging and what youve ate said the woman sincerely and if you like ill put up some luncheon for you to eat by and by thank you maam it will be very acceptable answered bradley shes better than her husband thought ben after all we havent lost much for we shall get nearly the worth of our lost money the woman remarked with some surprise that they did not take their loss much to heart how do you expect to get along without money she could not help asking were used to roughing it maam said bradley im an old miner and i think i can find some of my old chums before long by this time luncheon was ready and they soon left the cabin bradley could no longer repress his curiosity now ben tell me all about it he said where is our money ben looked back to make sure that he would not be overheard and answered i put it in the bank for security jake what do you mean if i am not very much mistaken we shall find it hidden in a hole in a tree quarter of a mile away who put it there asked his companion in surprise i did when last night about midnight as near as i can guess ben laughed at his companions evident perplexity and told him in detail the story of the nights adventure ben im proud of you said bradley slapping our hero on the back there are not many grown men that would have known what to do under the circumstances i confess that i was very much puzzled myself said ben modestly i could have done nothing if our honest host hadnt fallen asleep he would feel rather provoked if he knew that nearly all of our money is untouched said bradley that is if we find it again theres no fear of that said ben do you see that tree yonder the large one yes that is my savingsbank they quickened their steps till they reached the stately monarch of the forest ben quickly thrust his hand into the cavity and drew out the precious parcel which he had committed to it during the night it was precisely as he had placed it there no one had touched it now said ben i will give you ninetyfive dollars that is the amount of which i picked your pocket last night you are a pickpocket of the right sort said his companion you took my money in order to save it their money recovered they started on their days march and nightfall found them twenty miles nearer their destination chapter xxii the arrival at murphys one morning about eleven oclock they came in sight of murphys it was only a miningsettlement of the most primitive description a few tents and cabins with rough bearded men scattered here and there intent upon working their claims gave it a picturesque appearance which it has lost now it was then a more important place than at present however for the surface diggings are exhausted and it is best knowntoday by its vicinity to the famous calaveras grove of big trees so this is murphys said ben rather disappointed it doesnt seem to be much of a place you didnt expect to see a regular town did you asked bradley i dont know i hardly knew what to expect it seems a rough place and i suppose the people seem rough too yes so they are in appearance but you cant tell what a man has been by his looks here why the man that worked the next claim to me was a college graduate and not far away was another who had been mayor of a western city and were they dressed like these men here asked ben quite as roughly it wont do to wear storeclothes at the mines no i suppose not but these men look like immigrants just come over bradley laughed wait till we have been at work a little while and we shall look no better he said laughing what is that asked ben suddenly stopping short while an expression of horror came over his face bradley followed the direction of his finger and saw suspended from a tree the inanimate body of a man the features livid and distorted and wearing an expression of terror and dismay as if his fate had come upon him without time for preparation i reckon thats a thief answered bradley unconcernedly a thief do they hang people for stealing out here yes they have to you see my lad there aint any laws here nor courts if a man steals the miners just take the matter into their own hands and if there aint a doubt of it they hang him as soon as they catch him its horrible said ben who had never before seen the victim of a violent death maybe it is but what can we do put him in prison suggested ben there aint any prisons and if there were there would be nobody to keep them just then bradley was hailed by a roughlooking man whom at home ben would have taken for a tramp what bradley back again i didnt expect to see you here i didnt expect to come hunter but i fooled away my money in frisco and have come back for more and whos this boyyour son or nephew no hes no kin to me i ran across him down to frisco ben let me make you acquainted with my old chum frank hunter he isnt much to look at but i have seen better days interrupted hunter smiling i was rather a dandy in my college days at old yale though i dont look like it now ben regarded him with surprise he had not dreamed that this sunbrown bearded man in the roughest of mininggarbs had ever seen the inside of a college hunter smiled at the boys evident surprise i dont look like a college graduate do i but i assure you i am not the worstdressed man in camp my friend the mayor is rougherlooking than i some time i hope to return to the haunts of civilization and then i will try to conform to habits which i have almost forgotten how are you making out hunter asked bradley pretty well i have made more here in six months than i did by three years practise of law before i came out here do you like it as well mr hunter ben could not help asking curiously no i dont but then its only for a time as i say to myself when i get tired of the rough life i am leading when ive made a respectable pile i shall start for frisco and take passage home put up my shingle again and wait for clients with money enough to pay my board while im waiting a young lawyer needs that always perhaps youll be judge hunter in time said bradley ive served in that capacity already said hunter unexpectedly and that not longer ago than yesterday do you see that poor wretch up there and he pointed to the suspended body already referred to yes what did he do he was a notorious thiefserved a term in the penitentiary east for stealing and came out here to practise his profession but this climate is unhealthy for gentlemen in that line of business did he rob anybody here yes you remember johnson is he still here he is about ready to go home with money enough to lift the mortgage from his farm we all knew it for johnson was so happy that he took everybody into his confidence he had all his money tied up in a bag which he kept in his tent imprudent of course but we havent any banks or safes here added hunter meeting the question in bens eyes well this rascal ross wormed himself into his confidence found out exactly where the bag was kept and night before last in the middle of the night he crept to the tent and was in the act of carrying off the bag when as luck would have it my friend the mayor who was taking a night walk in the hope of curing a severe headache came upon him ross showed fight but was overpowered and tied securely till morning when morning came we tried him i being judge he was found guilty and sentenced to be hung the sentence was carried into effect in the afternoon he wont steal any more i reckon ben took another hasty look at the dangling criminal whose end had been so sudden and horrible and he shuddered why dont you take him down he asked it was ordered that he hang for twentyfour hours as a warning to any others in camp who might be tempted to steal the time isnt up yet you are a young goldhunter said hunter scanning over heros youthful face yes i am ben confessed but i had to earn a living and i thought i could do it better here than at home are you from the east i am from hampton in new york state i know something of hampton said hunter i have never been there but i have a distant relative living there who is it asked ben with interest i know everybody there i dare say you know my relative for i am given to understand that he is the great man of hampton mayor sturgis yes that is his name he married a cousin of my mother so the relationship is not very close he is rich isnt he he is the richest man in hampton i suppose he is aware of that fact said hunter laughing if he isnt his son sam is replied ben sam wanted to engage me as his servant before i came away he wanted me to black his boots and you objected i suppose i wouldnt work for sam sturgis for a hundred dollars a month said ben emphatically then you dont like him he is very bigfeeling said ben using a boys word and likes to boss all the rest of the boys he thinks he is far above us all he ought to come out here california takes the airs out of a man if he has any we are all on an equality here and the best man winsi mean the man of the most pluckfor success doesnt depend on moral excellence exactly well old friend are you going to settle down among us again it was to bradley this question was addressed i dont know im here on a little matter of business along of this boy is richard dewey here now dewey no he had poor luck and he dusted a month ago ben and his companion exchanged glances of disappointment where did he go asked bradley who was evidently getting discouraged he was going to the mountains he said he had been studying up something about minerals and he had an idea that hed find a rich ledge among the sierras that would pay better than this surfacemining is there anybody that knows what direction he took my friend the mayor knows as well as any man dewey was his next neighbor and often talked over his plans with him then we will go and see the mayor no need of going here he comes chapter xxiii among the sierras ben had heard of mayors and once he had seen one a pompouslooking man who had once served in that capacity in an inland city of some twenty thousand inhabitants and he supposed that all mayors were alike he could hardly believe his eyes therefore when he saw before him a man of medium height dressed in a ragged shirt and trousers and wearing a hat once white but now dirtbegrimed friends of yours judge said the newcomer speaking to hunter and indicating by a nod ben and his companion you ought to know one of them mayor said hunter why its bradley said the mayor extending his hand cordially glad to see you back again bradley shook hands and introduced ben im told you can tell me where to find richard dewey colonel said bradley employing another title of the mayor i cant just say where he is said the mayor but i can tell you where he meant to go that will help us you dont mean him any harm asked the mayor quickly far from it we have the best news for him because dick dewey is a friend of mine and i wouldnt bring him into trouble for the richest claim in californy thats where we agree colonel the fact is theres a young lady in frisco who has come out on purpose to find himhis sweetheart and an heiress at that me and ben have agreed to find him for her and thats the long and short of it then im with you bradley ive seen the girls picture dick showed it to me one day and she does credit to his taste hes had bad luck at the mines but that wont matter when them two meet said bradley shes better than any claim he can find this side the mountains bradley and our young hero spent the remainder of the day and the night at murphys hospitably provided for by the judge and the mayor and ben listened with avidity to the stories of the miners and their varying luck if he had not been in search of richard dewey he would have tarried at murphys selected a claim and gone to work the very next day he was anxious to have his share in the rough but fascinating life which these men were leading to him it seemed like a constant picnic with the prospect of drawing a golden prize any day provided you attended to business that will come by and by he thought to himself we must find cousin idas beau and then we can attend to business somehow it seemed more natural to use the first name by which he had known the young lady who employed him than the real name which he had learned later it may be necessary to remind the reader that her name was florence douglas the next morning after breakfast the two friends left murphys and bent their course toward the mountains where they were told that richard dewey was likely to be found the direction given them was it must be confessed not very definite and the chances seemed very much against their succeeding in the object of their search a week later we will look in upon them toward nightfall they were among the mountains now after the close of a laborious day they had tethered their animals to a tree and were considering a very important subject namely where to find anything that would serve for supper their supply of provisions was exhausted and there was no means of purchasing a fresh supply bradley took out his supply of gold and surveyed it ruefully ben said he i never knew before how little good there is in bein rich here weve both got money and we cant get anything for it its cheap traveling for we havent spent anything sence weve left murphys i wish we could spend some of our money said ben uneasily if there was only a bakers or an eatinghouse here id be willing to pay five dollars for a good square meal so would i somehow gold dont look as good to me as it used to we may starve to death with money in our pockets bens eyes were fixed upon a slender brook not far away that threaded its silvery way down a gentle incline from the midst of underbrush i wonder if we cant catch some trout he said dont they have trout in these mountains to be sure they do and the best in the world said bradley briskly the california mountain trout cant be beat but we have no fishingtackle suggested ben never mind we have our guns how will that help us we can shoot them to be sure ben looked surprised didnt you ever shoot pickerel we can shoot trout in the same way come ben follow me and well see if we cant have a good supper after all leaving their mustangs to gather a supper from the scanty herbage in their neighborhood the two friends made their way to the brook it had seemed very near but proved to be fully a quarter of a mile away when they reached it they brought their guns into requisition and soon obtained an appetizing mess of trout which only needed the service of fire to make a meal fit for an epicure i can hardly wait to have them cooked sard ben im as hungry as a hunter i understand what that means now i shant have any trouble in keeping up with you ben said his companion well have a supper fit for a king they gathered some dry sticks and soon a fire was blazing which in the cool night air sent out a welcome heat after supper they lay down on their backs and looked up into the darkening sky ben felt that it was a strange situation they were in the heart of the sierras miles perhaps many miles away from any human being thousands of miles away from the quiet village where ben had first seen the light yet he did not feel disturbed or alarmed his wanderings had inspired selfreliance and he did not allow himself to be troubled with anxious cares about the future if by a wish he could have been conveyed back to his uncles house in the far east he would have declined to avail himself of the privilege he had started out to make a living for himself and he was satisfied that if he persevered he would succeed in the end what are you thinking about ben asked bradley after a long pause i was thinking how strange it seems to be out here among the mountains answered ben still gazing on the scenery around him i dont see anything strange about it said his less imaginative comrade seein we came here on our horses it would be strange to be anywhere else i mean it is strange to think we are so far away from everybody i dont foller you ben i suppose its sorter lonelylike but that aint new to me i never realized how big the world was when i lived at home said ben in a slow thoughtful way yes its a pretty largish place thats a fact what were you thinking of jake asked ben in his turn i was thinkin of two things whereabouts dewey has managed to hide himself and then it occurred to me how consolin it would be to me if i could light on a pound of smokintobacco ive got a pipe but it aint no good without tobacco that dont trouble me much jake said ben with a smile its the next thing to a good supper ben said bradley but i might as well wish for the moon you neednt wish in vain for that said ben pointing out the orb of evening with its paleyellow light peeping over the tall treetops and irradiating the scene with its pensive shimmer i can see it but that dont help me any said bradley if i saw a world made of tobacco up in yonder sky it would only make me feel worse because i couldnt get any what was it you was awishin for friend asked an unfamiliar voice bradley sprang to his feet and ben followed suit they saw two strange figures clad in spanish style with large napping sombreros on their heads who unheard had descended the mountains and were now close upon them who are you asked bradley doubtfully friends was the reassuring reply well join your little party if you have no objection id invite you to take a drink if there was any saloon handy as there isnt jest help yourself to this and he drew out a pouch of smokingtobacco just what i was wantin said bradley delighted youre welcome whoever you are ben cant you get together some sticks and light the fire its coolish chapter xxiv beaten at his own game bradley was of a social disposition and even without the gift of tobacco would have been glad of an addition to their small party im glad to see you he said repeating his welcome i wonder i didnt hear you comin have you been long in californy well onto a year said the one who seemed the elder of the two how is it with you stranger i have been here about as long answered bradley ben has only just come out what luck have you had pursued the questioner good and bad i made quite a pile and went to frisco and gambled it away like a fool now ive come back for another trial what might your name be bradleyjake bradley it isnt much of a name but itll do for me the boy is ben stanton come from the east my name is bill mosely said the other my friends tom hadley were both from missouri and though i say it were about as wideawake as they make em we dont stand no back talk tom and me when a man insults me i drop him and the speaker rolled his eyes in what was meant to stimulate ferocity bradley eyed him shrewdly and was not quite so much impressed as mosely intended him to be he had observed that the greatest boasters did not always possess the largest share of courage isnt that so tom asked bill mosely appealing to his friend i should say so answered tom nodding emphatically youve seen me in a scrimmage more than once i should say i have did you ever see me shoot a man that riled me dozens of times returned hadley who appeared to play second fiddle to his terrible companion thats the kind of man i am said bill mosely in a tone of complacency still bradley did not seem particularly nervous or frightened he was fast making up his mind that mosely was a cheap bully whose words were more terrible than his deeds ben had less experience of men and he regarded the speaker as a reckless desperado ready to use his knife or pistol on the least provocation he began to think he would have preferred solitude to such society he was rather surprised to hear bradley say quietly mosely youre a man after my own heart thats the kind of man i be if a man dont treat me right i shoot him in his tracks one day i was drinkin in a saloon among the foothills when i saw a man winkin at me i waited to see if he would do it again when he did i hauled out my revolver and shot him dead you did exclaimed mosely uneasily of course i did but i was rather sorry afterward when i heard that his eyelids were weak and he couldnt help it did you get into any trouble about it stranger asked mosely with a shade of anxiety no none of the party dared touch me besides i did the handsome thing i had the man buried and put a stone over him i couldnt do any more could i no said mosely dubiously and he drew a little farther away from bradley what do you find to eat he inquired after a pause tom and i are as hungry as if we hadnt eaten anything for a week you havent got any provisions left over no but you can have as good a supper as we had and we had a good one what do you say to trout now bill mosely smacked his lips jest show me where ill find some he said bradley pointed to the brook from which he had drawn his supply i dont mind helping you he said ben are you tired no jake then come along and well try to get some supper for our friends all right said ben cheerfully in a short time a fresh supply of trout was drawn from the brook and they were roughly cooked at the fire bradley officiating as cook now my friends set up said he im sorry i cant give you any potatoes but the barrels out and its too late to get any at the store likewise you must excuse the puddin as its too late to make any the two visitors appeared to think no apologies were needful for they made short work with the trout from the manner in which they devoured their supper it was quite evident that it was some time since they had eaten ben and bradley did not join them having already eaten heartily i hope you relished your supper gentlemen said bradley politely i should say we did responded tom hadley i say them trout beat the world ill shoot the man that says they dont said bill mosely relapsing into his old tone so will i exclaimed bradley springing to his feet and brandishing his revolver ben began to see that he was playing a part and with assumed gravity he looked to see what effect it would have on their new friend i say stranger dont handle that weapon of yours so careless said mosely uneasily i guess youre right said bradley appearing to calm down once i was swingin my gun kinder careless and it went off and hit my friend jim saunders in his shoulder might have been worse he had a narrer escape but jim couldnt complain i jest took care of him night and day till he got well i couldnt do any moren that now could i i reckon hed rather you hadnt shot him said mosely dryly i reckon youre right said bradley with equanimity such little accidents will happen sometimes mosely somehow you cant always help it its best to be keerful observed mosely uneasily i should say so echoed his friend tom hadley right you both are said bradley affably i say mosely i like you youre jest such a sort of man as i am youd jest as lieve shoot a man as to eat your dinner now wouldnt you if hed insulted me said mosely hesitatingly of course come now how many men have you killed first and last about twenty i should think answered the bully who seemed to grow meeker and more peaceable as bradleys apparent reckless ferocity increased only twenty exclaimed bradley contemptuously why thats nothing at all how many have you killed asked mosely uneasily seventy or eighty i should say answered bradley carelessly of course a man cant keep an account of all these little affairs i did once think id keep a list but i got tired of it after a short time and gave it up after id got up to fortyseven where was you raised stranger asked mosely in kentuckyglorious old kentuck and if theres a man dares to say a word against my state ill take his life and bradley sprang to his feet lay down again stranger interposed bill mosely hastily theres no one here wants to say a word agin kentuck its a glorious old state as you say isnt it tom i should say so responded tom hadley using his customary formula are you in search of gold mosely asked bradley in a more quiet manner were kinder prospectin among the hills answered mosely you havent come across anything yet have you not yet have you were looking for a friend thats gone ahead maybe hes struck it rich when we find him well turn in and help him youve got one advantage of us stranger youve got hosses and weve had to walk why didnt you buy animals we did but they were stolen from us a little way back if our hosses should be stolen said bradley the thieves would die within a week mosely and his friend looked at each other in silence and the conversation languished ben said bradley after the two visitors were fast asleep shall i tell you what i think of these two men well bradley they are thieves and they meant to steal our hosses wont they do it now bradley laughed theyll be afraid to he answered ive beaten them at their own game and they think im as desperate a bully as they pretend to be no they wont think it safe to interfere with our property how many men did you say you had killed jake asked ben with a smile that was all talk thank heaven i havent the blood of any fellow creature on my hands chapter xxv the horsethieves all four slept soundly but the visitors awoke first are you awake tom inquired mosely i should say so answered his friend bill mosely raised himself on his elbow and surveyed ben and bradley their deep tranquil breathing showed that they were sound asleep mosely next glanced at the mustangs which were tethered nearby tom said he i wish we had them mustangs its a deal easier ridin than walkin i should say so when i struck this party last night i meant to have em but this man is such a bloody ruffian that i dont know as it would be safe hadley said nothing his customary phrase would not apply and he was a man of few words besides what did he say he would do if a fellow stole his horses tom said hed die within a week answered hadley with unfailing memory bill mosely looked discouraged he privately thought bradley was just the man to keep his word and he did not fancy getting into difficulty with him that depends on whether he caught him he said after a while hopefully i should say so bill now said mosely lowering his voice if we could get away while they are asleep there wouldnt be much chance of their knowin where we were thats so bill anyway if we dont take em we may be overtaken by the party that we borrowed some golddust from tom hadley responded in his customary manner and that would be mighty bad luck continued mosely with a shudder i should say so bill in fact mosely felt that their situation was not likely to be made worse by a new theft only thirty miles away was a party of miners with whom they had worked in company but without much success till emboldened by temptation and opportunity they had stolen a bag of golddust from a successful comrade and fled under cover of the night in the primitive state of society at the mines stealing was a capital offense and if they were caught their lives would probably pay the penalty even now some of the injured party might be on their track and this naturally inspired them with uneasiness thus they were between two fires and in spite of the fear with which bradley had inspired them it looked as if another theft would conduce to their safety if they carried away the mustangs bradley and ben even if they hit on the right trail would have to pursue them on foot and among the sierras a man is no match for a mustang in speed and endurance ive a great mind to carry off them mustangs said mosely thoughtfully are you with me i should say so why dont you ever say something else tom demanded mosely impatiently what do you want me to say asked hadley in surprise well never mind its your way i suppose and i can rely upon you i should say so mosely shrugged his shoulders it was clearly idle to expect any great variety in tom hadleys conversation whatever we do must be done quickly he said in a quiet decided tone theyll wake up before long and there wont be any chance you tom take that near animal and ill tackle the other jest untie them quiet and easy and when i say the word start do you understand i should say so bill said hadley nodding then here goes in a few seconds they had loosened the mustangs and had sprung upon their backs now go exclaimed mosely in a energetic whisper so on their stolen horses they drew stealthily away from the camp till they were perhaps a furlong away and then putting the mustangs to their speed they soon put a distance of miles between them and their sleeping owners they would have liked to remain long enough to have a trout breakfast but that was impracticable chapter xxvi what next some persons are said to have premonitions of coming ill but this could not be said in the present instance of bradley and his young companion bradley had the shrewdness to read the real cowardice of mosely who was the leader and did not dream that he would have the courage to take the horses but then he did not know the danger in which their two visitors had placed themselves by their recent theft danger will strengthen the courage of the timid and in this case it decided mosely to commit a new theft the robbers were quite five miles away when ben opened his eyes he looked about him with sleepy eyes and it was only by an effort that he remembered the events of the previous evening it was with no misgiving that he looked for the horses when he realized that they were gone his heart gave a great bound and he rose on his elbow next he looked for mosely and hadley but of course in vain theyve stolen the mustangs he said to himself in genuine dismay and instantly seizing bradley by the shoulder shook him energetically whats the matter ben demanded bradley in amazement you neednt be quite so rough its time you were awake said ben hurriedly those fellows have stolen our mustangs whats that you say ejaculated bradley now thoroughly awake the mustangs are gone and they are gone said ben when did you find it out only just now i was sleepy and overslept myself halfpast seven oclock said bradley referring to a cheap silver watch which he had bought for a trifle from a miner at murphys who was hard up im afraid they must have been gone some time its a bad lookout for us ben so it is jake you thought they wouldnt dare to take anything no more i thought they would that bill mosely bragged so much i didnt think he had enough pluck does it take much pluck to be a thief jake well in californy it does answered bradley when a man steals a boss here he takes his life in his hand and dont you forget it if it was only a year in the penitentiary or something like that it wouldnt scare em so bad that moselys a bad lot and will likely die in his boots whats that be shot standing or swing from the branch of a tree i thought id said enough last night to put him off the notion of playin us such a trick probably he thought there wouldnt be any chance of our catching him when we were reduced to walk its likely youre right ben and i ought to have thought of that i jest wish i could set eyes on the critter at this particular minute to treat us that way after our kindness thats what riles me what shall we do jake thats to be considered blamed if i know unless we foot it and that will be no joke over these hills and through these forests we may come upon their track and overtake them when they are not expecting it i wish we might said bradley the lines about his mouth tightening id give em a lesson they are two men said ben thoughtfully and we are only a man and a boy that is so ben but ill match you against hadley he dont amount to a row of pins and if i cant tackle bill mosely then ill never show myself in frisco again i dont mind so much the loss of the mustangs said ben but im sorry that we shall be delayed in our search for richard dewey thats bad too i expect that nice young lady in frisco is awaitin anxiously to hear from him plague take that rascal mosely he broke out in fresh exasperation well jake suppose we get some breakfast and then consider what we will do thats a good thought ben we cant do much on an empty stomach thats a fact for reasons which need not be specified it was decided that the breakfast should consist of trout despite their loss both had a good appetite and when that was satisfied they became more hopeful chapter xxvii ki sing leaving ben and his companion for a time we go back to record an incident which will prove to have a bearing upon the fortunes of those in whom we are interested one morning two men taylor and oreilly who had been out prospecting came into camp conveying between them very much as two policemen conduct a prisoner a terrifledlooking chinaman whose eyes rolling helplessly from one to the other seemed to indicate that he considered his position a very perilous one at that early period in the settlement of california a few chinamen had found their way to the pacific coast but the full tide of immigration did not set in till a considerable time later and therefore the miners regarded one as a curiosity who have you got there oreilly inquired one of his miningcomrades a yeller haythen answered oeeilly look at the craythur aint he a beauty jist wid his long pigtail hangin down his back like a monkeys tail where did you find him he was huntin for gold the haythen jist for all the world as if he was as white as you or i mr patrick oreilly appeared to hold the opinion that goldhunting should be confined to the caucasian race he looked upon a chinaman as rather a superior order of monkey suitable for exhibition in a cage but not to be regarded as possessing the ordinary rights of an adopted american resident if he could have looked forward twentyfive years and foreseen the extent to which these barbarians would throng the avenues of employment he would no doubt have been equally amazed and disgusted indeed the capture of ki sing was made through his influence as taylor a man from ohio was disposed to let him alone soon a crowd gathered around the terrified chinaman and his captors and he was plied with questions some of a jocular character by the miners who were glad of anything that relieved the monotony of their ordinary life whats your name asked one the chinaman gazed at the questioner vacantly whats your name you haythen repeated oreilly emphasizing the inquiry by a powerful shake my name ki sing answered the mongolian nervously where did you come from old pigtail my name ki sing not pigtail said the chinaman not understanding the meaning of the epithet this answer appeared to be regarded by the crowd as either witty or absurd for it elicited a roar of laughter never mind what your name is old stick in the mud well call you whatever we please where do you come from me come from flisco it is well known that a chinaman cannot pronounce the letter r which in his mouth softens to l in some cases producing a ludicrous effect what have you come here for cy king or whatever your name is my name ki sing well its a haythen name anyhow remarked mr patrick oeeilly before id have such a name id go widout one intirely did you hear the gintleman ask you what you came here for you bling me answered ki sing shrewdly there was another laugh that chinee aint no fool said dick roberts what made you leave china he asked me come to amelica fol gold hi ho thats it is it what are you going to do with your gold when you find it cally it back to china and when youve callied it back whatll you do then me mally wife have good time and plenty money to buy lice of course ki sings meaning was plain but there was a roar of laughter to which he listened with mildeyed wonder evidently thinking that the miners who so looked down on him were themselves a set of outside barbarians to whom the superior civilization of china was utterly unknown it is fortunate that his presumption was not suspected by those around him no one would have resented it more than mr patrick oreilly whose rank as regards enlightenment and education certainly was not very high i say john said dick roberts are you fond of rat pie lat pie velly good returned ki sing with a look of appreciation melican man like him hear the haythen said oreilly with an expression of deep disgust he thinks we ate rats and mice like him no old pigtail we aint cats we are good christians chlistian ma dont know ghlistian said the chinaman then look at oreilly said dick roberts mischievously hes a good solid christian ki sing turned his almond eyes upon oreilly who with his freckled face wide mouth broad nose and stubby beard was by no means a prepossessinglooking man and said interrogatively he chlistian yes john wouldnt you like to be one ki sing shook his head decidedly me no want to be chlistian he answered me velly well now me want to be good chinaman theres a compliment for you oreilly said one of the miners john prefers to be a chinaman to being like you hes a barbarious haythen anyhow said oreilly surveying his prisoner with unfriendly eyes what did he come over to america for anyhow he probably came over for the same reason that brought you oreilly said a young man who spoke for the first time though he had been from the outset a disgusted witness of what had taken place and whats that demanded oreilly angrily to make a living answered richard dewey quietly as this is the first time this young man has been introduced we will briefly describe him he was of medium size well knit and vigorous with a broad forehead blue eyes and an intelligent and winning countenance he might have been suspected of too great amiability and gentleness but for a firm expression about the mouth and an indefinable air of manliness which indicated that it would not do to go too far with him there was a point as all his friends knew where his forbearance gave way and he sternly asserted his rights he was not so popular in camp as some because he declined to drink or gamble and despite the rough circumstances in which he found himself placed was resolved to preserve his selfrespect oreilly did not fancy his interference and demanded in a surly tone do you mean to compare me wid this haythen you are alike in one respect said richard dewey quietly neither of you were born in this country but each of you came here to improve your fortunes and hadnt i the right id like to know blustered oreilly to be sure you had this country is free to all who wish to make a home here then what are you talkin about anyway you ought to be able to understand without asking ki sing has come here and has the same right that you have do you mane to put me on a livel wid him in that one respect i do i want you to understand that patrick oreilly wont take no insults from you nor any other man hush oreilly said terence ogorman another irish miner dewey is perfectly right i came over from ireland like you but he hasnt said anything against either of us that is where you are right ogorman said richard dewey cordially you are a man of sense and can understand me my own father emigrated from england and i am not likely to say anything against the class to which he belonged now boys you have had enough sport out of the poor chinaman i advise you to let him go ki sing grasped at this suggestion melican man speak velly good he said of course you think so sneered oreilly i say boys lets cut off his pigtail touching the poor chinamans queue ki sing uttered a cry of dismay as oreillys suggestion was greeted with favorable shouts by the thoughtless crowd chapter xxviii the duel of the miners oreillys suggestion chimed in with the rough humor of the crowd they were not badhearted men but though rough in their manners not much worse on the average than an equal number of men in the eastern states they only thought of the fun to be obtained from the proceeding and supposed they would be doing the chinaman no real harm has anybody got a pair of scissors asked oreilly taking the chinaman by the queue ive got one in my tent answered one of the miners go and get it then ki sing again uttered a cry of dismay but it did not seem likely that his valued appendage could be saved public sentiment was with his persecutor he had one friend however among the rough men who surrounded him the same who had already taken his part richard deweys eyes glittered sternly as he saw oreillys intention and he quietly advanced till he was within an arms length of ki sing what do you mean to do oreilly he demanded sternly none of your business retorted oreilly insolently it is going to be my business what do you mean to do gut off this haythens pigtail and id just like to know whos going to prevent me at this moment the miner who had gone for a pair of scissors returned give me them scissors said oreilly sharply richard dewey reached out his hand and intercepted them he took them in place of oreilly give me them scissors dewey or itll be the worse for you exclaimed the tyrant furiously dewey regarded him with a look of unmistakable contempt there was a murmur among the miners who were eager for the amusement which the chinamans terror and ineffectual struggles would afford them give him the scissors dewey said half a dozen boys said dewey making no motion to obey them do you know what you are about to do why should you interfere with this poor unoffending chinaman has he wronged any one of you no but that aint the point said a kentuckian we only want to play a joke on him it wont do him no harm to cut his hair of course not chimed in several of the miners do you hear that dick dewey demanded oreilly impatiently do you hear what the boys say give me them scissors boys you dont understand the effects of what you would do said dewey taking no notice of oreilly much to that worthys indignation if ki sing has his queue cut off he can never go back to china is that the law squire asked a loosejointed yankee yes it is you may rely on my word ki sing if you cut off your queue can you go back to china no go backstay in melica allee time you see he confirms my statement thats a queer law anyway said the kentuckian i admit that but such as it is we cant alter it now ki sing has probably a father and mother perhaps a wife and children in china he wants to go back to them some time shall we prevent this and doom him to perpetual exile just to secure a little sport come boys youve all of you got dear ones at home that you hope some day to see again i appeal to you whether this is manly or kind this was a sort of argument that had a strong effect it was true that each one of these men had relatives for whom they were working the thought of whom enabled them to bear hard work and privations thousands of miles away from home and richard deweys appeal touched their hearts thats so dewey is right let him go oreilly said the crowd the one man who was not touched by the appeal was oreilly himself not that he was altogether a bad man but his spirit of opposition was kindled and he could not bear to yield to dewey whose contempt he understood and resented his reply was im goin to cut off the haythens pigtail whether or no give me them scissors i tell you and he gave a vicious twitch to the chinamans queue which made ki sing utter a sharp cry of pain richard deweys forbearance was at an end his eyes blazed with fury and clenching his fist he dashed it full in the face of the offending oreilly who not only released his hold on ki sing but measured his length on the ground oreilly was no coward and he possessed the national love of a shindy he sprang to his feet in a rage and shouted ill murder ye for that dick dewey see if i dont a fight a fight shouted the miners willing to be amused in that way since they had voluntarily given up the fun expected from cutting off the chipamans queue richard dewey looked rather disgusted i dont want to fight boys he said it isnt to my taste youve got to you coward said oreilly beginning to bluster i dont think youll find me a coward said dewey quietly as he stood with his arms folded looking at oreilly youll have to give oreilly satisfaction said one of the miners youve knocked him down and hes got a right to it will it be any satisfaction to him to get knocked over again asked dewey shrugging his shoulders you cant do it ill bate you till you cant stand exclaimed the angry irishman ill tache you to insult a gintleman form a ring boys exclaimed the kentuckian well see theres fair play one thing first said dewey holding up his hand if i come off best in this encounter youll all agree to let this chinaman go free is that agreed yes yes it is agreed ki sing stood trembling with fear while these preliminaries were being settled he would have escaped from the crowd but his first movement was checked no cy king we cant let you go jest yet said taylor were goin to see this thing through first oreilly was not in the least daunted by the contest in which he was to engage indeed he felt a good deal of satisfaction at the prospect of being engaged in a scrimmage of course he expected to come off a victor he was a considerably larger man than richard dewey with arms like flails and flats like sledgehammers and he had no sort of doubt that he could settle his smaller antagonist in less than five minutes but there was one thing of which he was not aware though slender dewey had trained and hardened his muscles by exercise in a gymnasium and moreover he had taken a course of lessons in the manly art of selfdefense he had done this not because he expected to be called upon to defend himself at any time but because he thought it conducive to keeping up his health and strength he awaited oreillys onset with watchful calmness oreilly advanced with a whoop flinging about his powerful arms somewhat like a windmill and prepared to upset his antagonist at the first onset what was his surprise to find his own blows neatly parried and to meet a tremendous blow from his opponent which set his nose to bleeding astonished but not panicstricken he pluckily advanced to a second round and tried to grasp dewey round the waist but instead of doing this he received another knockdown blow which stretched him on the ground he was up again and renewed the attack but with even less chance of victory than before for the blood was streaming down his face and he could not see distinctly where to hit dewey contented himself with keeping on guard and parrying the blows of his demoralized adversary its no use oreilly exclaimed two or three deweys the better man let me get at him ill show him what i can do said oreilly doggedly as long as you like oreilly said richard dewey coolly but you may as well give it up troth and i wont im stronger than you are any day perhaps you are but i understand fighting and you dont an oreilly not know how to fight exclaimed the irishman hotly i could fight when i was six years old perhaps so but you cant box one or two more attacks and oreilly was dragged away by two of his friends and dewey remained master of the field the miners came up and shook hands with him cordially they regarded him with new respect now that it was found he had overpowered the powerful oreilly among those who congratulated him was his mongolian friend ki sing melican man good fighteeknock over ilishman hullah come with me ki sing said dewey i will take care of you till tomorrow and then you had better go chapter xxix chinese cheap labor though dewey had received from the miners a promise that they would not interfere with ki sing in case he gained a victory over oreilly he was not willing to trust entirely to it he feared that some one would take it into his head to play a trick on the unoffending chinaman and that the others unthinkingly would join in accordingly he thought it best to keep the mongolian under his personal charge as long as he remained in camp ki sing followed him to his tent as a child follows a guardian are you hungry ki sing asked dewey plenty hungly then i will first satisfy your appetite and dewey brought forth some of his stock of provisions to which ki sing did ample justice though neither rat pie nor rice was included when the lunch in which richard dewey joined was over he said if you will help me for the rest of the day i will pay you whatever i consider your services to be worth all lightee responded ki sing with alacrity whatever objections may be made to the chinaman he cannot be charged with laziness as a class they are willing to labor faithfully even where the compensation is small labor in china which is densely peopled is a matter of general and imperative necessity and has been so for centuries and habit has probably had a good deal to do with the national spirit of industry ki sing under richard deweys directions worked hard and richly earned the two dollars which his employer gave him at the end of the day of course deweys action did not escape the attention of his fellow miners it cannot be said that they regarded it with favor the one most offended was naturally oreilly who despite the pounding he had received was about the camp as usual boys he said are you goin to have that haythen workin alongside you it wont do us any harm will it asked dick roberts if dewey chooses to hire him what is it to us i aint goin to demane myself by workin wid a yeller haythen nobody has asked you to do it if anybody is demeaning himself it is dick dewey and he has a right to if he wants to if he wants to hire anybody let him hire a dacent christian like you oreilly i dont want to work for anybody i work for myself this chinaman has come here to take the bread out of our mouths bad cess to him i dont see that he is workin dick deweys claim i dont see how that interferes with us of course this was the reasonable view of the matter but there were some who sided with the irishman among others the kentuckian and he volunteered to go as a committee of one to dewey and represent to him the sentiments of the camp accordingly he walked over to where dewey and his apprentice were working look here dewey he began me and some of the rest of the boys have takin over this yere matter of your givin work to this chinaman and we dont like it why not asked dewey coolly we dont feel no call to associate with sich as he you neednt i dont ask you to said dewey quietly i am the only one who associates with him but we dont want him in camp he wont trouble any of you i will take charge of him look here dewey youve got to respect public sentiment and public sentiment is agin this thing whose public sentiment oreillys well oreilly dont like it for one i thought so nor i for another it strikes me hodgson that ive got some rights as well as oreilly suppose i should say i didnt choose to work in the same camp with an irishman thats different why is it different well you see an irishman isnt a yeller heathen dewey laughed he may be a heathen though not a yellow one he said well dewey what answer shall i take back to the boys you can say that i never intended to employ the chinaman for any length of time but i shall not send him off till i get ready im afraid the boys wont like it dewey probably oreilly wont as for you you are too intelligent a man to be influenced by such a man as he all men are sensible to flattery and hodgson was won over by this politic speech i wont say youre altogether wrong dewey he said but i wouldnt keep him too long i dont mean to hodgson returning reported that dewey would soon dismiss the chinaman and omitted the independent tone which the latter had assumed the message was considered conciliatory and pronounced satisfactory but oreilly was not appeased he still murmured but his words produced little effect seeing this he devised a private scheme of annoyance chapter xxx a midnight visit this conversation set dewey to thinking though he was independent he was not foolishly so and he was not willing out of a spirit of opposition to expose his new acquaintance to annoyance perhaps to injury he did not care to retain ki sing in his employment for any length of time and made up his mind to dismiss him early the next mornng say at four oclock before the miners had thrown off the chains of sleep he did not anticipate any harm to his mongolian friend during the night but this was because he did not fully understand the feeling of outraged dignity which rankled in the soul of oreilly patrick oreilly was like his countrymen in being always ready for a fight but he was unlike them in harboring a sullen love of revenge in this respect he was more like an indian he felt that richard dewey had got the better of him in the brief contest and the fact that he had been worsted in the presence of his fellow miners humiliated him if he could only carry his point and deprive the chinaman of his queue after all the disgrace would be redeemed and oreilly would be himself again and why shouldnt i he said to himself the haythen will sleep in deweys tent why cant i creep up unbeknownst in the middle of the night and cut off his pigtail while he is aslape faith id like to see how he and his friend would look in the morning i dont belave a word of his not bein allowed to go back to chiny widout it that is an invintion of dewey the more oreilly dwelt upon this idea the more it pleased him once the pigtail was cut off the mischief could not be repaired and he would have a most suitable and satisfactory revenge of course it would not do to make the attempt till ki sing and his protector were both fast asleep all men are children when they are asleep says an old proverb that is all men are as helpless as children when their senses are locked in slumber it would be safer therefore to carry out his plan if he could manage to do so without awaking the two men oreilly determined not to take any one into his confidence this was prudent for it was sure to prevent his plan from becoming known there was however one inconvenience about this as it would prevent him from borrowing the scissors upon which he had relied to cut off the queue but he had a sharp knife which he thought would answer the purpose equally well it was rather hard for oreilly to keep awake till midnightthe earliest hour which he thought prudentbut the motive which impelled him was sufficiently strong to induce even this sacrifice so as the shadows darkened and the night came on patrick oreilly forced himself to lie awake while he waited eagerly for the hour of midnight meanwhile richard dewey and ki sing lay down at nine oclock and sought refreshment in sleep both were fatigued but it was the chinaman who first lost consciousness dewey scanned with curiosity the bland face of his guest looking childlike and peaceful as he lay by his side i wonder if he is dreaming of his distant home in china thought dewey the cares of life do not seem to sit heavy upon him though he has been in danger today and may be so still he yields himself up trustfully to the repose which he needs is it true i wonder that cares increase with mental culture doubtless it is true if i were in china threatened with a loss which would prevent my returning to my native country i am sure it would keep me awake but there can be nothing to fear now richard raised himself on his elbow and looked about him the tents of the miners were grouped together within a comparatively small radius and on all sides could be heardit was now past tenthe deep breathing of men exhausted by the days toils this would not ordinarily have been the case at so early an hour for when there was whisky in the camp there was often late carousing it chanced however at this time that the stock of liquor was exhausted and until a new supply could be obtained from san francisco necessity enforced the rule of total abstinence it would have been well if for months to come there could have been the same good reason for abstinence but as a matter of fact the very next day some casks were brought into camp much to the delighted and satisfaction of the antitemperance party finally dewey fell asleep but his sleep was a troubled one he had unthinkingly reclined upon his back and this generally brought bad dreams he woke with a start from a dream in which it seemed to him that the miners were about to hang ki sing from the branch of one of the tall trees nearby when he detected a stealthy step close at hand instantly he was on the alert turning his head he caught sight of a human figure nearing the tent a second glance showed him that it was oreilly with a knife in his hand good heavens thought dewey does he mean to kill the poor chinaman a muttered sentence from oreilly reassured him on this point now you yeller haythen ill cut off your pigtail in spite of that impertinent friend of yours dick dewey ill show you that an oreilly isnt to be interfered wid so he wants the poor fellows queue does he said dewey to himself youre not quite smart enough mr oreilly there was no time to lose oreilly was already on his knees with the poor chinamans treasured queue in his hand when he felt himself seized in a powerful grip what are you about oreilly demanded richard dewey in a deep stern voice oreilly uttered a cry rather of surprise than alarm what are you about repeated richard dewey in a tone of authority im goin to cut off the haythens pigtail answered the irishman doggedly what for ive said id do it and ill do it well mr oreilly ive said you shant do it and i mean to keep my word oreilly tried to carry out his intent but suddenly found himself flung backward in a position very favorable for studying the position of the stars are you not ashamed to creep up to my tent in the middle of the night on such an errand as that patrick oreilly demanded dewey no im not let me up dick dewey or itll be the worse for you said the intruder wrathfully give me your knife then i wont its my own the errand on which you come is my warrant for demanding it i wont give you the knife but ill go back said oreilly that wont do dont you go too far dick dewey im your aiqual no man is my equal who creeps to my tent at the dead of night do you know what the camp will think oeeilly and what will they think that you came to rob me then theyll think a lie said oreilly startled for he knew that on such a charge he would be liable to be suspended to the nearest tree if they chose to think so it would be bad for you you know it isnt so dick dewey said oreilly i consider your intention quite as bad you wanted to prevent this poor chinaman from ever returning to his native land though he had never injured you in any way you cant deny it i dont belave a word of all that rigmarole dick dewey it makes little difference whether you believe it or not you have shown a disposition to injure and annoy ki sing but i have foiled you and now here deweys tone became deep and stern give me that knife directly and go back to your tent or ill rouse the camp and they may form their own conclusions as to what brought you here oreilly felt that dewey was in earnest and that he must yield he did so with a bad grace enough and slunk back to his tent which he did not leave till morning early in the morning richard dewey awakened ki sing you had better not stay here ki sing he said there are those who would do you mischief go into the mountains and you may find gold there you will be safe melican man velly goodme go said the chinaman submissively good luck to you ki sing good luckee melican man so the two parted and when morning came to the camp nothing was to be seen of the chinaman dewey returned oreillys knife the latter receiving it in sullen silence it was not long afterward that richard dewey himself left murphys in search of a richer claim chapter xxxi on the mountain path my readers will not have forgotten bill mosely and his companion tom hadley who played the mean trick upon bradley and our hero of stealing their horses i should be glad to state that they were overtaken and punished within twentyfour hours but it would not be correct they had a great advantage over their pursuers who had only their own feet to help them on and at the end of the first day were at least ten miles farther on than ben and bradley as the two last wearied and wellnigh exhausted sat down to rest bradley glanced about him long and carefully in all directions i cant see anything of them skunks ben he said i suppose not jake they must be a good deal farther on yes i reckon so theyve got the horses to help them while weve got to foot it it was an awful mean trick they played on us thats so jake all i ask is to come up with em some of these days what would you do i wouldnt take their lives for i aint no murderer but id tie em hand and foot and give em a taste of a horsewhip or a switch till theyd think they was schoolboys again you might not be able to do it they would be two to one not quite ben id look for some help from you i would give you all the help i could said ben i know you mean it and that you wouldnt get scared and desert me as a cousin of mine did once when i was set upon by robbers was that in california no in kentucky i had a tough job but i managed to disable one of the rascals and the other ran away what did your cousin have to say he told me when i caught up with him that he was goin in search of help but i told him that was too thin i told him i wouldnt keep his company any longer and that he had better go his way and i would go mine he tried to explain things but there are some things that aint so easily explained that i wouldnt hear him i stick to my friends and i expect them to stand by me thats fair jake thats the way i look at it i wonder where them rascals are you mean mosely and his friend yes what galls me ben is that theyre likely laughin in their shoes at the way theyve tricked us and theres no help for it not just now jake but we may overtake them yet till we do we may as well take things as easy as we can youre right ben youmind me of an old man that used to live in the place where i was raised he never borrered any trouble but when things was contrary he waited for em to take a turn when he saw a neighbor frettin he used to say fret not thy gizzard for it wont do no good ben laughed that was good advice he said i dont know where he got them words from maybe theyre in the bible i guess not said ben smiling they dont sound like it perhaps youre right said bradley not fully convinced however seems to me ive heard old parson brown get off something to that effect perhaps it was thissufficient unto the day is the evil thereof perhaps it was is that from the bible yes it might have been made a little stronger said bradley thoughtfully the evil of some days is more than sufficient accordin to my notion the two explorers camped out as usual and the fatigue of their days tramp insured them a deep refreshing sleep the next day they resumed their journey and for several days to come no incident worthy of mention varied the monotony of their march toward the close of the fourth day they saw from a distance a figure approaching them who seemed desirous of attracting their attention ben was the first to see him jake said he look yonder its a chinee said bradley in surprise how did the critter come here in the name of wonder i suppose he is looking for gold as well as we the heathen seems to be signalin us hes wavin his arm this was the case the chinaman for some reason seemed to wish to attract the attention of the newcomers he stopped short and waited for ben and bradley to come up who are you my yeller friend asked bradley when he was near enough to be heard my name ki sing glad to hear it i cant say i ever heard of your family but i reckon from the name its a musical one ki sing probably did not understand the tenor of bradleys remark is there any hotel round here mr sing asked ben jocosely where two weary travelers can put up for the night nohotellee then where do you sleep me sleep on glound your bed is a pretty large one then said bradley the great objection to it is that it is rather hard ki sings mind was evidently occupied by some engrossing thought which prevented his paying much attention to bradleys jocose observations melican man wantee you he said in an excited manner whats that asked bradley melican man want me ki sing nodded where is he ki sing turned and pointed to a rude hut some half a mile away in a little mountain nook melican man thele he said come along ben said bradley let us see what this means it may be some countryman of ours who is in need of help the chinaman trotted along in advance and our two friends followed him chapter xxxii the mountain cabin at length they reached the entrance to the cabin it was a rough structure built of logs containing but one apartment on a blanket in one corner of the hut lay a young man looking pale and emaciated his face was turned to the wall so that though he heard steps he did not see who crossed the threshold is that you ki sing he asked in a low voice but why need i ask there is not likely to be any one else in this lonely spot thats where youre mistaken my friend said bradley i met that chinaman of yours half a mile away and he brought me here youre sick i reckon the invalid started in surprise and evident joy when he heard bradleys voice thank heaven he said for the sound of a countrymans voice and he turned to look at his visitor now it was bradleys turn to start and manifest surprise why its dick dewey he exclaimed you know me said the sick man eagerly of course i do didnt we work together at murphys almost side by side jake bradley exclaimed dewey recognizing him at last the same old coon now dewey whats the matter with you nothing serious but enough to lay me up for a time a week since i slipped from a rock and sprained my ankle severelyso much so that i cant use it safely ive often heard that a sprain is worse than a break but i never realized it till now has the chinaman taken care of you inquired bradley yes i dont know what i should have done without ki sing said dewey with a grateful glance at the chinaman was he with you when the accident hapened no i lay helpless on the hillside for two hours when providentially as i shall always consider it my friend ki sing came along the chinaman usually impassive face seemed to light up with pleasure when richard dewey spoke of him as his friend i tell you what ki sing said bradley turning to the representative of china i never thought much of your people before but i cheerfully admit that youre a brick a blick repeated the mongolian appearing more puzzled than complimented yes a bricka real good fellow and no mistake give us your hand youre a gentleman ki sing readily yielded his hand to the grasp of the miner he saw that bradley meant to be friendly though he did not altogether understand him had you ever met ki sing dick asked bradley yes on one occasion i had a chance to be of service to him and he had not forgotten it he has taken the best care of me and supplied me with food which i was unable to procure for myself i think i should have starved but for him ki sing i want to shake hands with you again said bradley who seemed a good deal impressed by conduct which his prejudices would not have allowed him to expect from a heathen ki sing winced beneath the strong pressure of the miners grasp and examined his long slender fingers with some anxiety when he rescued them from the cordial but rather uncomfortable pressure melican man shakee too much he protested bradley did not hear him for he had again resumed conversation with dewey is that your boy bradley asked the invalid glaring at ben who modestly kept in the background no its a young friend of mine that i came across in frisco his name is ben stanton i dont believe you can guess what brought us up here among the mountains probably you came like me in search of gold thats where youre wrong leastways that wasnt the principal object of our coming youre not traveling for pleasure i should think said dewey smiling not much since our hosses have been stole theres mighty little pleasure in clamberin round on these hills the fact is weve been lookin for you looking for me exclaimed dewey in great surprise yes and no mistake isnt it so ben ben nodded assent but what possible motive can you have in looking for me i say dewey proceeded bradley did you ever hear of a young lady by the name of florence douglas the effect of the name was electric dewey sprang up in bed and inquired eagerly yes yes but what of her can you tell me anything of her i can tell you as much as this she is in frisco and has sent out ben and me to hunt you up and let you know where she is is this true how came she here is her guardian with her asked dewey rapidly one question at a time dick the fact is shes given her guardian the slip and came out to californy in charge of my young friend ben i hope you wont be jealous of him if she trusts him i will also said dewey tell me the whole story my lad if you have been her friend you may depend on my gratitude ben told the story clearly and intelligibly replying also to such questions as richard dewey was impelled to ask him and his straightforwardness produced a very favorable impression on his new acquaintance i begin to see that young as you are florence didnt make a bad selection when she chose you as her escort now dewey said bradley ive got some advice to give you get well as soon as you can and go to frisco yourself i surmise miss douglas wont need ben any longer when you are with her you forget this confounded sprain said dewey looking ruefully at his ankle if i go youll have to carry me then get well as soon as you can well stay with you till youre ready if there was only a claim round here that ben and i could work while we are waitin it would make the time pass pleasanter there is said dewey a month since i made a very valuable discovery and had got out nearly a thousand dollars worth of gold when i was taken down you two are welcome to work it for as soon as i am in condition i shall go back to san francisco well give you a share of what we find dick no you wont the news you have brought me is worth the claim many times over i shall give ki sing half of what i have in the cabin here as a recompense for his faithful service ki sing looked well content as he heard this promise and his smile became even more childlike and bland than usual as he bustled about to prepare the evening meal ill tell you what ben said bradley well pay ki sing something besides and he shall be our cook and steward and see that we have three square meals a day i agree to that said ben when ki sing was made to comprehend the proposal he too agreed and the little household was organized the next day ben and bradley went to work at deweys claim which they found unexpectedly rich while the chinaman undertook the duties assigned him four weeks elapsed before richard dewey was in a condition to leave the cabin for san francisco then he and ben returned ki sing accompanying them as a servant while bradley remained behind to guard deweys claim and work it during bens absence the end
