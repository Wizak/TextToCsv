 chapter one at the stables weve been here a week and ive been bored every single minute said george you havent said anne youve enjoyed all the rides weve had and you know youve enjoyed messing about the stables when we havent been out riding i tell you ive been bored every single minute said george quite fiercely i ought to know oughtnt i that awful girl henrietta too why do we have to put up with her oh henry said anne with a laugh i should have thought youd find a lot in common with another girl like yourself who would rather be a boy and tries to act like one the two girls were lying by a haystack eating sandwiches round them in a field were many horses most of which the girls either rode or looked after some way off was an old rambling building and by the front entrance was a great board captain johnsons riding school anne and george had been staying there for a week while julian and dick had gone to camp with other boys from their school it had been annes idea she was fond of horses and had heard so much from her friends at school what fun it was to spend day after day at the stables that she had made up her mind to go herself george hadnt wanted to come she was sulky because the two boys had gone off somewhere without her and anne for a change gone to camp george would have liked that but girls were not allowed to go camping with the boys from julians school of course it was a camp just for the boys alone youre silly to keep feeling cross because you couldnt go camping too said anne the boys dont want us girls round them all the time we couldnt do the things they do george thought differently i can do anything that dick and julian do she said i can climb and bike for miles can walk as far as they can i can swim i can beat a whole lot of boys at most things thats what henry says said anne with a laugh look there she is striding about as usual hands in her jodhpur pockets whistling like the stable boy george scowled anne had been very much amused to see how henrietta and george hated one another at sight and yet both had so very much the same ideas georges real name was georgina but she would only answer to george henrys real name was henrietta but she would only answer to henry or harry to her very best friends she was about as old as george and her hair was short too but it wasnt curly its a pity yours is curly she said to george pityingly it looks so girlish doesnt it dont be an ass george said curtly plenty of boys have curly hair the maddening part was that henrietta was a wonderful rider and had won all kinds of cups george hadnt enjoyed herself a bit during that week at the stables because for once in a way another girl had outshone her she couldnt bear to see henrietta striding about whistling doing everything so competently and quickly anne had had many a quiet laugh to herself especially when the two girls had each made up their minds not to call one another henry and george but to use their full names henrietta and georgina this meant that neither of them would answer the other when called and captain johnson the big burly owner of the ridingstables got very tired of both of them what are you behaving like this for he demanded one morning seeing their sulky looks at one another at breakfasttime behaving like a couple of idiotic schoolgirls that made anne laugh a couple of idiotic schoolgirls my goodness how annoyed both girls were with captain johnson anne was a bit scared of him he was hottempered outspoken and stood no nonsense at all but he was a wonder with the horses and loved a good hearty laugh he and his wife took either boys or girls for the holidays and worked them hard but the children always enjoyed their stay immensely if it hadnt been for henry youd have been perfectly happy this week said anne leaning back against the haystack weve had heavenly april weather the horses are lovely and i like captain and mrs johnson very much i wish the boys were here said george they would soon put that silly henrietta in her place i wish id stayed at home now well you had the choice said anne rather cross you could have stayed at kirrin cottage with your father and mother but you chose to come here with me till the boys came back from camp you shouldnt make such a fuss if things arent exactly to your liking it spoils things for me sorry said george im being a pig i know but i do miss the boys we can only be with them in the hols and it seems funny without them theres just one thing that pleases me here youll be glad to know you neednt tell me i know what it is said anne with a laugh youre glad that timmy wont have anything to do with henry with henrietta corrected george she grinned suddenly yes old timmys got some sense he just cant stick her here timmy boy leave those rabbitholes alone and come and lie down for a bit youve run for miles this morning when we took the horses out and youve snuffled down about a hundred rabbitholes come and be peaceful timmy left his latest rabbithole reluctantly and came to flop down beside anne and george he gave george a hearty lick and she patted him were just saying timmy how sensible you are not to make friends with that awful henrietta said george she stopped suddenly at a sharp nudge from anne a shadow fell across them as someone came round the haystack it was henrietta by the annoyed look on her face it was clear that she had heard georges remark she held out an orange envelope to george a telegram for you georgina she said stiffly i thought id better bring it in case it was important oh thanks henrietta said george and took the telegram she tore it open read it and groaned look at that she said to anne and passed it to her its from mother anne took the telegram and read it please stay another week your father is not well love from mother what bad luck said george a familiar scowl on her face just when i thought wed be going home in a day or two and the boys would join us at kirrin now well be stuck here by ourselves for ages whats the matter with father i bet hes only got a headache or something and doesnt want us stamping about in and out of the house and making a noise we could go to my home said anne thats if you dont mind its being a bit upside down because of the decorating were having done no i know you want to stay here with the horses said george anyway your father and mother are abroad wed only be in the way blow blow blow now well have to do without the boys for another week theyll stay on in camp of course captain johnson said yes certainly the two girls could stay on it was possible that they might have to do a bit of camping out if one or two extra children came but they wouldnt mind that would they not a bit said george actually wed rather like to be on our own anne and i weve got timmy you see so long as we could come in to meals and do a few jobs for you wed love to go off on our own anne smiled to herself what george really meant was that she wanted to see as little of henrietta as possible still it would be fun to camp out if the weather was fine they could easily borrow a tent from captain johnson bad luck georgina said henry who was listening to all this very bad luck i know youre terribly bored here its a pity you dont really like horses its a pity that you shut up said george rudely and went out of the room captain johnson glared at henrietta who stood whistling at the window hands in pockets you two girls he said why dont you behave yourselves always aping the boys pretending youre so mannish give me anne here any day what you want is your ears boxing did you take that bale of straw to the stables yes said henrietta without turning yes sir said captain johnson if you want to act like a boy be one and say sir when you speak to me if you cant bother to remember ive got a name its he broke off as a small boy came running in sir theres a gypsy kid outside with a horse a skewbald a mangy looking thing he says can you help him the horse has got something wrong with its leg those gypsies again said captain johnson all right ill come he went out and anne went with him not wanting to be left alone with the angry henrietta she found george outside with a small dirty gypsy boy and a patient little skewbald horse its brown and white coat looking very fleabitten what have you done to your horse this time said captain johnson looking at its leg youll have to leave it here and ill see to it cant do that sir said the boy were off to mystery moor again well youll have to said captain johnson its not fit to walk your caravan cant go with the others this horse isnt fit to pull it ill get the police to your father if you try to work this horse before its better dont do that said the boy its just that my dad says weve got to go on tomorrow whats the hurry said captain johnson cant your caravan wait a day or two mystery moor will still be there in two days time it beats me why you go there a desolate place like that not even a farm or a cottage for miles ill leave the horse said the boy and stroked the skewbalds nose it was clear that he loved the ugly little horse my father will be angry but the other caravans can go on without us well have to catch them up he gave a kind of halfsalute to the captain and disappeared from the stableyard a skinny little sunburnt figure the skewbald stood patiently take it round to the small stable said captain johnson to george and anne ill come and see to it in a minute the girls led the little horse away mystery moor said george what a queer name the boys would like that theyd be exploring it at once wouldnt they yes i do wish they were coming here said anne still i expect theyll like the chance of staying on in camp come on you funny little creature heres the stable the girls shut the door on the gypsys pony and turned to go back william the boy who had brought the message about the horse yelled to them hey george and anne theres another telegram for you the two hurried into the house at once oh i hope father is better and we can go home and join the boys at kirrin said george she tore open the envelope and then gave a yell that made anne jump look see what it says theyre coming here anne snatched the telegram and read it joining you tomorrow well camp out if no room hope youve got a nice juicy adventure ready for us julian and dick theyre coming theyre coming said anne as excited as george now well have some fun its a pity weve no adventure to offer them said george still you simply never know chapter two julian dick and henry george was quite a different person now that she knew her two cousins were coming the next day she was even polite to henrietta captain johnson scratched his head when he heard that the boys were arriving we cant have them in the house except for meals he said were full up they can either sleep in the stables or have a tent i dont care which there will be ten altogether then said his wife julian dick anne george henry and john susan alice rita and william henry may have to camp out too not with us said george at once i think youre rather unkind to henry said mrs johnson after all you and she are very alike george you both think you ought to have been boys and im not a bit like henrietta said george indignantly you wait till my cousins come mrs johnson they wont think shes like me i dont expect theyll want anything to do with her oh well youll just have to shake down together somehow if you want to stay here said mrs johnson let me see id better get some rugs out the boys will want them whether they sleep in the stables or in a tent come and help me to look for them anne anne george and henry were a good bit older than the other five children staying at the stables but all of them small or big were excited to hear about the coming of julian and dick for one thing george and anne had related so many of the adventures they had had with them that everyone was inclined to think of them as heroes henrietta disappeared after tea that day and could not be found wherever have you been demanded mrs johnson when she at last turned up up in my room said henrietta cleaning my shoes and my jods and mending my ridingjacket you keep telling me to and now ive done it aha preparing for the heroes said captain johnson and henry immediately put on a scowl very like the one george often wore nothing of the sort she said ive been meaning to do it for a long time if georginas cousins are anything like her i shant be very interested in them but you might like my brothers said anne with a laugh if you dont therell be something wrong with you dont be silly said henrietta georginas cousins and your brothers are the same people how clever of you to work that out said george but she felt too happy to keep up the silly bickering for long she went out with timmy whistling softly theyre coming tomorrow tim she said julian and dick well all go off together like we always do the five of us youll like that wont you timmy woof said timmy approvingly and waved his plumy tail he knew quite well what she meant next morning george and anne looked up the trains that arrived at the station two miles away this is the one theyll come by said george her finger on the timetable its the only one this morning it arrives at half past twelve well go and meet them right said anne well start at ten minutes to twelve well be in plenty of time then we can help them with their things they wont bring much take the ponies up to hawthorn field will you called captain johnson gan you manage all four of them oh yes said anne pleased she loved the walk to hawthorn field up a little narrow lane set with celandines violets and primroses and the fresh green of the budding hawthorn bushes come on george lets catch the ponies and take them now its a heavenly morning they set off with the four frisky ponies timmy at their heels he was quite a help with the horses at the stable especially when any had to be caught no sooner had they left the stables and gone on their way to hawthorn field than the telephone rang it was for anne oh im sorry shes not here said mrs johnson answering it who is it speaking oh julian her brother can i give her a message yes please said julians voice tell her we are arriving at the busstop at milling green at half past eleven and is there a little handcart she and george could bring because weve got our tent with us and other odds and ends oh well send the little wagon said mrs johnson the one that always goes to meet the train or the bus ill get george to meet you with anne they can drive it in were pleased you are coming the weathers very good and youll enjoy yourselves rather said julian thanks awfully for putting us up we wont be any trouble in fact well help all we can mrs johnson said goodbye and put down the receiver she saw henrietta passing outside the window looking much cleaner and tidier than usual she called to her henry where are george and anne julian and dick are arriving at the busstop at milling green at eleventhirty and ive said well meet them in the little wagon will you tell george and anne they can put winkie into the cart and trot him down to the busstop right said henry then she remembered that george and anne had been sent up to hawthorn field with the four ponies i say they wont be back in time she called shall i take the wagon and meet them yes do that would be kind of you henry said mrs johnson youd better hurry though times getting on wheres winkie in the big field yes said henry and hurried off to get him soon he was in the wagon shafts and henry was in the drivingseat she drove off smartly grinning to herself to think how cross george and anne would be to find they had missed meeting the two boys after all julian and dick had already arrived at the busstop when henry drove up they looked hopefully at the wagon thinking that perhaps one of the girls was driving into meet them no go said dick its somebody else driving into the village i wonder if the girls got our message i thought they would meet us at the busstop here well well wait a few minutes more they had just sat down on the busstop seat again when the wagon stopped nearby henry saluted them are you annes brother she called she didnt get your telephone message so ive come with the wagon instead get in oh jolly nice of you said julian dragging his things to the wagon er im julian and this is dick whats your name henry said henrietta helping julian with his things she heaved them in valiantly then clicked to winkie to stand still and not fidget im glad youve come there are rather a lot of small kids at the stables well be glad of you two i say timmy will be pleased to see you wont he good old tim said dick heaving his things in henry gave them a shove too she wasnt very fat but she was wiry and strong she grinned round at the boys all set now well get back to the stables or do you want to have an icecream or anything before we start dinners not till one no well get on i think said julian henry leapt into the drivers seat took the reins and clicked to winkie the boys were behind in the wagon winkie set off at a spanking pace nice boy said dick to julian in a low voice as they drove off decent of him to meet us julian nodded he was disappointed that anne and george hadnt come with timmy but it was good to be met by someone it wouldnt have been very funny to walk the long road to the farm carrying their packs by themselves they arrived at the stables and henry helped them down with their things mrs johnson heard them arriving and came to the door to welcome them ah there you are come along in ive a midmorning snack for you because i guessed youd have had breakfast early leave the things there henry if the boys sleep in one of the stables theres no sense in bringing them into the house now are george and anne still not back what a pity henry disappeared to put away the wagon the boys went into the pleasant house and sat down to lemonade and homemade biscuits they had hardly taken a bite before anne came running in henry told me youd come oh im sorry we didnt meet you we thought youd come by train timmy came racing in his tail waving madly he leapt at the two boys who were just giving anne a hug each then in came george her face one big beam julian dick i am so glad youve come its been dull as ditchwater without you did anyone meet you yes an awfully nice boy said dick gave us quite a welcome and dragged our packs into the wagon and was very friendly you never told us about him oh was that william said anne well hes only little we didnt bother about telling you of the juniors here no he wasnt little said dick he was quite big very strong too you didnt mention him at all well we told you about the other girl here said george henrietta awful creature thinks shes like a boy and goes whistling about everywhere she makes us laugh youll laugh too a sudden thought struck anne did the er boy who met you tell you his name she asked yes what was it now henry said dick nice chap im going to like him george stared as if she couldnt believe her ears henry did she meet you no not she he corrected julian fellow with a big grin but thats henrietta cried george her face flaming red with anger the awful girl i told you about who tries to act like a boy and whistles and strides about all over the place dont tell me she took you in she calls herself henry instead of henrietta and wears her hair short and gosh she sounds very like you george said dick well i never it never occurred to me that he was a girl jolly good show she put up i must say i liked him her i mean oh said george really furious the beast she goes and meets you and never says a word to us and makes you think shes a boy and and spoils everything hold your horses george old thing said julian surprised after all youve often been pleased when people take you for a boy though goodness knows why i thought youd grown out of it a bit dont blame us for thinking henry was a boy and liking him her i mean george stamped out of the room julian scratched his head and looked at dick now weve put our foot in it he said what an ass george is i should have thought shed have liked someone like henry who had exactly the same ideas as she has well shell get over it i suppose its going to be a bit awkward said anne soberly she was right it was going to be very awkward chapter three sniffer as soon as george had gone out of the room a scowl on her face henry walked in hands in jodhpur pockets hallo said dick at once henrietta henry grinned oh so theyve told you have they i was tickled pink when you took me for a boy youve even got your riding jacket buttons buttoning up the wrong way said anne noticing for the first time you really are a fathead henry you and george are a pair well i look more like a real boy than george does anyway said henry only because of your hair said dick its straight dont say that in front of george said anne shell immediately have hers cut like a convict or something all shaven and shorn well anyway it was jolly decent of henry to come and meet us and lug our things about said julian have a biscuit anyone no thanks said anne and henry are we supposed to leave any for politeness sake said dick eyeing the plate theyre homemade and quite super i could wolf the lot we arent frightfully polite here said henry with a grin we arent frightfully clean and tidy either we have to change out of our jods at night for supper which is an awful nuisance especially as captain johnson never bothers to change his any news asked julian drinking the last of the lemonade anything exciting happened no nothing said anne the only excitement is the horses nothing more this is quite a lonely place really and the only exciting thing weve heard is the name of the big desolate moor that stretches from here to the coast mystery moor its called why asked dick some longago mystery gave it that name i suppose i dont know said anne i think only gypsies go there now a little gypsy boy came in with a lame horse yesterday and said his people had to go to mystery moor why they wanted to go to such a deserted stretch of land i dont know no farms there not even a cottage gypsies have peculiar ideas sometimes said henry i must say i like the way they leave messages for any gypsy following patrins theyre called patrins yes ive heard of those said dick sticks and leaves arranged in certain patterns or something arent they yes said henry i know our gardener at home showed me an arrangement of sticks outside our back gate once which he said was a message to any gypsy following he told me what it meant too what did it mean asked julian it meant dont beg here mean people no good said henry with a laugh thats what he said anyway we might ask the little gypsy boy who came with the skewbald horse said anne hell probably show us some messages id like to learn some you never know when anything like that could come in useful yes and well ask him why the gypsies go to mystery moor said julian getting up and dusting the crumbs off his coat they dont go there for nothing you may be sure wheres old george gone asked dick i do hope shes not going to be silly george was in one of the stables grooming a horse so vigorously that it was most surprised swishswishswishswish what a brushing george was working her intense annoyance out of herself she mustnt spoil things for the boys and anne but oh that horrible henrietta meeting them like that pretending to be a boy heaving their luggage about playing a joke on them but surely they might have guessed oh there you are george old thing said dicks voice at the stabledoor let me help gosh arent you brown just as many freckles as ever george grinned unwillingly she tossed dick the brush here you are then do you and ju want to go riding at all there are plenty of horses to choose from here dick was relieved to see that george appeared to have got over her rage yes it might be fun to go off for the day what about tomorrow we might explore a little of mystery moor right said george she began to heave some straw about but not with that girl she announced from behind the straw she was carrying what girl asked dick innocently oh henry you mean i keep thinking of her as a boy no we wont have her with us well be just the five as usual thats all right then said george happily oh heres julian give a hand ju it was lovely to have the two boys again joking laughing teasing they all went out in the fields that afternoon and heard the tales of the camp it was just like old times and timmy was as pleased as anyone else he went first to one of the four then to another licking each one as he went his tail wagging vigorously thats three times youve smacked me in the face with your tail timmy said dick dodging it cant you look behind yourself and see where my face is woof said timmy happily and turned round to lick dick wagging his tail in julians face this time somebody squeezed through the hedge behind them george stiffened feeling sure that it was henrietta timmy barked sharply it wasnt henrietta it was the little gypsy boy he came up to them there were pale streaks down his dirty little face made by tears that had run through the dirt ive come for the horse he said do you know where he is hes not ready for walking yet said george captain johnson told you he wouldnt be whats the matter why have you been crying my father hit me said the boy he cuffed me and knocked me right over whatever for asked anne because i left the horse said the boy my father said all it wanted was a bit of ointment and a bandage he has to start off with the other caravans today you see well you really cant have the horse yet said anne it isnt fit to walk let alone drag a caravan you dont want captain johnson to tell the police youre working it when its not fit do you you know he means what he says yes but i must have the horse said the small gypsy i darent go back without it my father would half kill me i suppose he doesnt care to come himself so he sends you instead said dick in disgust the boy said nothing and rubbed his dirty sleeve across his face he sniffed get your hanky said dick dont you ever wash your face no said the boy looking quite surprised let me have my horse i tell you ill be half killed if i go back without him he began to cry again the children felt sorry for him he was such a thin skinny misery of a boy and goodness how he sniffled all the time whats your name asked anne sniffer said the boy thats what my father calls me it was certainly a good name for him but what a horrid father he must have havent you got a proper name asked anne yes but ive forgotten it said sniffer let me have my horse i tell you my fathers waiting julian got up ill come and see your father and put some sense into him where is he over yonder said sniffer with a big sniff and he pointed over the hedge ill come too said dick in the end everyone got up and went with sniffer they walked through the gate and saw a darkfaced surlylooking man standing motionless not far off his thick oily hair was curly and he wore enormous gold rings hanging from his ears he looked up as the little company came near your horse isnt fit to walk yet said julian you can have it tomorrow or the next day the captain says ill have it now said the man in a surly tone were starting off tonight or tomorrow over the moor i cant wait but whats the hurry said julian the moor will wait for you the man scowled and shifted from one foot to another cant you stay for another night or two and then go after the others said dick listen father you go with the other caravans said sniffer eagerly go in moses caravan and leave ours here i can put our horse into the shafts tomorrow or maybe the next day and follow after but how would you know the way said george sniffer made a scornful movement with his hand easy theyll leave me patrins to follow he said oh yes said dick remembering he turned to the silent gypsy fellow well what about it it seems that sniffer here has quite a good idea and you most certainly cant have the horse today anyway the man turned and said something angry and scornful to poor sniffer who shrank away from the words as if they were blows the four children couldnt understand a word for it was all poured out in some gypsy talk that they could not follow then the man turned on his heel and without so much as a look at them slouched away his earrings gleaming as he went what did he say asked julian sniffer gave one of his continual sniffs he was very angry he said hed go with the others and i could come on with clip the horse and drive our caravan he said ill be all right there tonight with liz whos liz asked anne hoping that it was someone who would be kind to this poor little wretch my dog said sniffer smiling for the first time i left her behind because she sometimes goes for hens and captain johnson he doesnt like that i bet he doesnt said julian all right thats settled then you can come for clip or clop or whatever your horse is called tomorrow and well see if its fit to walk im glad said sniffer rubbing his nose i dont want clip to go lame see but my father hes fierce he is so we gather said julian looking at a bruise on sniffers face you come tomorrow and you can show us some of the patrins the messages that you gypsies use wed like to know some ill come promised sniffer nodding his head vigorously and you will come to see my caravan i shall be all alone there except for liz well i suppose it would be something to do said dick yes well come i hope its not too smelly smelly said sniffer surprised i dont know i will show you patrins there and liz will show you her tricks she is very very clever once she belonged to a circus we must certainly take timmy to see this clever dog said anne patting timmy who had been hunting for rabbits and had only just come back timmy would you like to go and visit a very clever dog called liz woof said timmy wagging his tail politely right said dick im glad you approve tim well all try and come tomorrow sniffer after youve been to see how clip is getting on i dont somehow think youll be able to have him then though well see chapter four a bed in the stable the boys slept in one of the stables that night captain johnson said they could either have mattresses sent out or could sleep in the straw with rugs oh straw and rugs please said julian thats fine well be as snug as anything with those i wish anne and i could sleep in a stable too said george longingly we never have cant we captain johnson no youve got beds that youre paying for said the captain anyway girls cant do that sort of thing not even girls who try to be boys george ive often slept in a stable said henrietta at home when weve too many visitors i always turn out and sleep in the straw bad luck on the horses said george why demanded henry at once because you must keep them awake all night with your snoring said george henry snorted crossly and went out it was maddening that she should snore at night but she simply couldnt help it never mind george called after her its a nice manly snore henrietta shut up george said dick rather shocked at this sudden display of pettiness on georges part dont tell me to shut up said george tell henrietta george dont be an ass said julian but george didnt like that either and stalked out of the room in just the same stiff offended way that henry had done oh dear said anne its been like this all the time first henry then george then george then henry they really are a couple of idiots she went to see where the boys were to sleep they had been told to use a small stable empty except for the gypsys horse that lay patiently down its bandaged leg stretched out on the floor anne patted it and stroked it it was an ugly little thing but its patient brown eyes were lovely the boys had heaps of straw to burrow into and some old rugs anne thought it all looked lovely you can wash and everything at the house she said then just slip over here to sleep doesnt it smell nice all straw and hay and horse i hope that gypsys horse wont disturb you he may be a bit restless if his leg hurts him nothing will disturb us tonight said julian what with camplife and openair and windonthehills and all that kind of thing were sure to sleep like logs i think were going to enjoy it here anne very quiet and peaceful george looked in at the door ill lend you timmy if you like she said anxious to make up for her display of temper oh hallo george no thanks i dont particularly want old tim climbing over me all night long trying to find the softest part of me to sleep on said julian i say look hes showing me how to make a good old burrow to sleep in hey tim come out of my straw timmy had flung himself into the straw and was turning vigorously round and round in it as if he were making a bed for himself he stood and looked up at them his mouth open and his tongue hanging out at one side hes laughing said anne and it did indeed look as if timmy was having a good old laugh at them anne gave him a hug and he licked her lavishly and then began to burrow round and round in the straw again someone came up whistling loudly and put her head in at the door ive brought you a couple of old pillows mrs johnson said youd better have something for your heads oh thanks awfully henry said julian taking them how kind of you henrietta said george its a pleasure georgina said henry and the boys burst out laughing fortunately the supperbell went just then and they all went across the yard at once somehow everyone was always hungry at the stables the girls looked very different in the evening because they had to change out of their dirty smelly jodhpurs or breeches and put on dresses anne henry and george hurried to change before mrs johnson rang the supperbell again she always gave them ten minutes grace knowing that they might sometimes have a job to finish with the horses but everyone was supposed to be at the table when the second supperbell had finished ringing george looked nice because her curly hair went with a skirt and blouse quite well but henry looked quite wrong somehow in her frilly dress you look like a boy dressed up said anne and this pleased henry but not george the talk at the suppertable was mainly about all the wonderful things that henry had done in her life apparently she had three brothers and did everything with them and according to her own tales she was considerably better than they were they had sailed a ship up to norway they had hiked from london to york was dick turpin with you inquired george sarcastically on his horse black bess i expect you got there long before him didnt you henry took no notice she went on with wonderful tales of her familys exploits swimming across wide rivers climbing snowdon to the top goodness there wasnt a single thing she didnt seem to have done you certainly ought to have been a boy henry said mrs johnson which was exactly what henry wanted everyone to say henry when youve told us the story of how you climbed mount everest and got there before anyone else perhaps you would finish your plateful said captain johnson who got very tired of henrys tongue george roared with laughter not that she thought it was very funny but because she loved any chance to laugh at henry henry tackled the rest of her food at top speed how she did love to hold everyone spellbound with her extraordinary tales george didnt believe a word but dick and julian thought it quite likely that this tall wiry girl could do things just as well as her brothers there were a few jobs to be done after supper and henry kept well away from george knowing quite well that she would have a few cutting things to say well she didnt care everyone else thought she was marvellous she tore off her frilly dress and put on jodhpurs again although it would only be a short time before they all went to bed george and anne went with the boys to their stable they were in pyjamas and dressinggowns both yawning as they went got your torches said george were not allowed to have candles in the stables because of the straw you know good night sleep well and i hope that that fathead of a henry doesnt come along early in the morning whistling like a paperboy and wake you up nothing will wake me up tonight nothing at all said julian with a huge yawn he lay down in the straw and pulled an old rug over him oh what a bed give me stable straw every time to sleep in the girls laughed the boys really did look very comfortable sleep tight said anne and walked off with george to the house soon all the lights were out everywhere henry was asleep and snoring as usual she had to have a separate room otherwise she kept everyone awake but even so anne and george could hear her snoring away rrrumph rrrumph rrrumph rrrrumph blow henrietta said george sleepily what a row she makes anne shes not to come with us when we go riding tomorrow do you hear anne not very well murmured anne trying to open her eyes g night george timmy was on georges feet as usual he lay snuggled there eyes shut and ears asleep too he got as tired as everyone else running over the hills all day scrabbling at scores of rabbitholes chasing dozens of remarkably fleetfooted rabbits but at night he too slept like a log out in the stable the two boys slept peacefully covered by the old rug nearby the little skewbald horse moved restlessly but they heard nothing an owl came swooping over the stable looking for mice down below it screeched loudly hoping to scare a mouse into sudden flight then it would swoop down and take it into its talons not even the screech awakened the boys they slept dreamlessly tired out the door of the stable was shut and latched clip the horse suddenly stirred and looked round at the door the latch was moving someone was lifting it from the outside clips pricked ears heard the sound of a little shuffle he watched the door who was coming he hoped it was sniffer the boy he liked so much sniffer was always kind to him he didnt like being away from sniffer he listened for the sniffsniff that always went with the little gypsy boy but he didnt hear it the door opened very slowly indeed it gave no creak clip saw the night sky outside set with stars he made out a figure outlined against the darkness of the starry night a black shadow someone came into the stable and whispered clip the horse gave a little whinny it wasnt sniffers voice it was his fathers clip did not like him he was too free with cuffs and kicks and slashes with the whip he lay still wondering why the gypsy had come the man had no idea that dick and julian were sleeping in the stable he had come in quietly because he had thought there might be other horses there and he did not want to startle them and make them stamp about in fright he had no torch but his keen gypsys eyes made out clip at once lying in his straw he tiptoed across to him and fell over julians feet sticking out from the straw bed he was lying on he fell with a thud and julian sat up very suddenly indeed awake at once whos there what is it the gypsy shrank down beside clip keeping silent julian began to wonder if he had been dreaming but his foot distinctly hurt him surely somebody had trodden on it or fallen over it he woke dick wheres the torch hello look the stable door is open quick dick where on earth is the torch they found it at last and julian clicked it on at first he saw nothing for the gypsy was in clips stall lying down behind the horse then the torch picked him out hallo look there its that gypsy sniffers father said julian get up you what on earth are you doing here in the middle of the night chapter five george gets a headache the man got up sullenly his earrings shone in the light of the torch i came to get clip he said hes my horse isnt he you were told he wasnt fit to walk yet said julian do you want him to go lame for life you ought to know enough about horses to know when one can be worked or not ive got my orders said the man ive got to take my caravan with the others who said so said dick scornfully barney boswell said the man hes boss of our lot here weve got to start off together tomorrow but why said julian puzzled whats so urgent about all this whats the mystery there aint no mystery said the man still sullen were just going to the moor what are you going to do there asked dick curiously it doesnt seem to me to be the place to take a lot of caravans to theres nothing there at all is there or so ive heard the man shrugged his shoulders and said nothing he turned to clip as if to get him up but julian rapped out at him at once oh no you dont if you dont care about injuring a horse i do youve only got to be patient for a day or two more and hell be quite all right youre not to take him tonight dick go and wake captain johnson hell know what to do no said the man scowling dont go waking anybody ill go but just you see that clip is given to sniffer as soon as its possible or ill know the reason why see he looked at julian in a threatening way take that scowl off your face said julian im glad youve seen sense clear out now go off with the others tomorrow and ill see that sniffer has the horse in a short time the man moved to the door and slid out like a shadow julian went to watch him across the yard wondering whether out of spite the man might try to steal a hen or one of the ducks sleeping beside the pond but there was no sudden clucking no loud quack the man had gone as silently as he had come most peculiar all this said julian latching the door again he tied a piece of thick string over it his side so that it could not be lifted from outside there now if the gypsy comes again hell find he cant get in what a nerve coming here in the middle of the night like that he got back into the straw he must have fallen right over my foot he said snuggling down he woke me up with an awful jump good thing for clip that we were sleeping out here tonight or hed be dragging along a heavy cart tomorrow and going lame again i dont like that fellow he fell asleep again and so did dick clip slept too his leg feeling easier how glad he had been that day not to have to drag along the heavy caravan the boys told captain johnson next morning about the gypsys midnight visit he nodded yes i ought to have warned you that he might come theyre not always very good to their horses well im glad you sent him off i dont reckon clips leg will be ready for walking on till the day after tomorrow theres no harm in giving the poor creature a few days rest sniffer can easily take the caravan on after the others it looked as if that day was going to be fun after all the horses had been seen to and many odd jobs done the four with timmy planned to set out for a days ride captain johnson said he would let julian ride his own sturdy cob and dick took a bonny chestnut horse with four white socks the girls had the horses they usually rode henry hung about looking very mournful the boys felt quite uncomfortable we really ought to tell her to come along too said dick to julian it seems jolly mean to leave her behind with those little kids yes i know i agree with you said julian anne come here cant you suggest to george that we take henry too shes longing to come i know yes she is said anne i feel awful about it but george will be mad if we ask henry they really do get across one another i simply darent ask george to let henry come ju but this is silly said julian to think we dont dare to ask george to let somebody come george will have to learn sense i like henry shes boastful and i dont believe half the tales she tells but shes a sport and good fun hey henry coming yelled henry and came running looking very hopeful would you like to come with us said julian were all going offfor the day have you got any jobs to do or can you come can i come rather said henry joyfully but does george know ill soon tell her said julian and went in search of george she was helping mrs johnson to get saddlebags ready full of food george said julian boldly henry is coming too will there be enough food for everyone oh how nice of you to ask her said mrs johnson sounding very pleased shes dying to come shes been so good this week too while weve been shorthanded she deserves a treat isnt that nice george george muttered something peculiar and went out of the room her face scarlet julian stared after her his eyebrows cocked in a comical manner i dont somehow feel that george thinks its nice he said i feel as if we are in for an awkward day mrs johnson oh dont take any notice of george when shes silly said mrs johnson comfortably filling another paper bag with deliciouslooking sandwiches and dont take any notice of henry either when shes idiotic there if you get through all this food i shall be surprised william one of the younger ones came in just then what a lot of food youve given them he said will there be enough left for us to have today good gracious yes said mrs johnson you think of nothing but your tummy william go and find george and tell her the food is ready for her to put into the saddlebags william disappeared and then came back george says shes got a headache and doesnt think shell go on the ride he announced julian looked startled and upset now you listen to me julian said mrs johnson beginning to insert the parcels of food carefully into the saddlebags just you leave her to her imaginary headache dont go fussing round her and begging her to come and saying you wont have henry just believe quite firmly in her headache and go off by yourselves its the quickest way to make george see sense believe me yes i think youre right said julian frowning to think that george should behave like a sulky little girl after all the adventures they had been through together just because of henry it really was absurd where is george he said to william up in her room said william who had been engrossed in picking up and eating all the crumbs he could julian went out of the room and into the yard he knew which window belonged to the room where george and anne slept he yelled up i say george sorry about your headache old thing sure you dont feel like coming no came back an answering shout and the window was shut down with a slam righto awfully disappointed and all that shouted julian do hope your head will soon be better see you later no other reply came from the window but as julian went across the yard to the stables a very surprised face watched him go from behind the bedroom curtains george was extremely astonished to have been taken at her word shocked at being left behind after all and angry with henry and everyone else for putting her into this fix julian told the others that george had a headache and wasnt coming anne was most concerned and wanted to go and comfort her but julian forbade her to no shes up in her room leave her alone anne thats an order see all right said anne halfrelieved she felt sure that georges headache was mostly temper and she didnt at all want to go and argue with her for half an hour henry hadnt said a word she had flushed with surprise when julian had announced that george was not coming and she knew at once that there was no real headache she was georges headache she knew that she went up to julian look i guess its because youve asked me to come that georgina wont come with us i dont want to spoil things you go and tell her im not going after all julian looked at henry gratefully thats jolly nice of you he said but were taking george at her word anyway we didnt ask you out of politeness we wanted you to come thanks said henry well lets go before anything else happens our horses are ready ill fix the saddlebags soon all four were on their horses and were walking over the yard to the gate george heard the clippityclopclippityclop of the hooves and peeped out of the window again they were going after all she hadnt thought they really would go without her she was horrified why did i behave like that ive put myself in the wrong thought poor george now henrietta will be with them all day and will be as nice as possible just to show me up what an ass i am timmy im an ass and an idiot and a great big fathead arent i timmy didnt think so he had been puzzled to hear the others going off without him and george and had gone to the door and whined now he came back to george and put his head on her knee he knew george was not happy you dont care how i behave do you tim said george stroking the soft furry head thats the best of a dog you dont care if im in the wrong or not you just love me all the same dont you well you shouldnt love me today tim ive been an idiot there was a knock at her door it was william again george mrs johnson says if your headache is bad undress and get into bed but if its better come down and help with clip the gypsys horse ill come down said george flinging away her sulks at one go tell mrs johnson ill go to the stable at once all right said the stolid william and trotted off like a reliable little pony george went downstairs with timmy and into the yard she wondered how far the others had gone she couldnt see them in the distance would they have a good day together with that horrid henry ugh the others were almost a mile away cantering easily what fun a whole day before them on mystery moor chapter six a grand day i think its got a jolly good name mystery moor said dick as the four of them went along look at it stretching for miles all blazing with gorse i dont think it looks at all mysterious said henry surprised well its got a sort of quietness and broodiness said anne as if something big happened long ago in the past and its waiting for something to happen again quiet and broody it sounds like one of the farmyard hens sitting on her eggs said henry with a laugh i think it might be a bit frightening and mysterious at night but its just an ordinary stretch of country in the daytime fine for riding over i cant think why its called mystery moor well have to look it up in some book that tells about this part of the country said dick i expect it was called that because of some queer happenings or other hundreds of years ago when people believed in witches and things like that they followed no road or path but rode where they pleased there were great stretches of wiry grass masses of heather springing up afresh and blazing its gold everywhere on this lovely april day was the gorse anne sniffed continually as they rode past the gorse bushes dick looked at her you sound like sniffer he said have you got a cold anne laughed no of course not but i do so love the smell of the gorse what does it smell of vanilla hot coconut its a lovely warm smell look whats that moving over there said julian suddenly reining in his horse they all strained their eyes to see why its caravans said julian at last of course they were setting out today werent they well they must find it very rough going thats all i can say theres no real road anywhere as far as i can see where can they be going wondered anne whats over in that direction theyll come to the coast if they keep on the way they are going said julian considering lets ride over and have a look at them shall we yes good idea said dick so they turned their horses heads to the right and rode towards the faraway caravans these made quite a splash of colour as they went along there were four of them two red ones a blue one and a yellow one they went very slowly indeed each pulled by a small wiry horse they all look like skewbalds brown and white said dick its funny that so many gypsies have skewbald horses i wonder why it is they heard shouting as they came near the caravans and saw one man pointing them out to another it was sniffers father look thats the fellow who woke us up in the stable last night said julian to dick sniffers father what a nasty bit of work he is why doesnt he get a haircut good morning called dick as they rode up to the caravans on their horses nice day there was no answer the gypsies driving their caravans and those walking alongside looked sourly at the four riders where are you going asked henry to the coast its naught to do with you said one of the gypsies an old man with curly grey hair surly folk arent they said dick to julian i suppose they think were spying on them or something i wonder how they manage about food on this moor no shops or anything i suppose they take it all with them ill ask them said henry not at all put off by the surly looks she rode right up to sniffers father how do you manage about food and water she asked we got food there said sniflers father jerking his head back towards one of the caravans as for water we know where the springs are are you camping on the moor for a long time asked henry thinking that a gypsys life might be a fine one for a time fancy living out here on this lovely moor with gorse blazing gold all around and primroses by the thousand in the sheltered corners thats naught to do with you shouted the old man with curly grey hair you clear off and let us alone come on henry said julian swinging round to go off they dont like us asking them questions they think its prying not interest maybe they have lots of things to hide and dont want us poking around one or two chickens from a farm a duck or so from some pond they live from hand to mouth these folk some darkeyed children peered from the vans as they went by one or two were running outside but they sheered off like frightened rabbits when henry cantered towards them oh well they simply dont want to be friendly she said and went to join the other three what a strange life they lead in their houses on wheels never staying anywhere for long always on the move get up there sultan go after the others her horse obediently followed the other three taking care not to step into any rabbitholes what fun it was to be out here in the sunshine jogging up and down on a horses back without a care in the world henry was very happy the other three were enjoying their day but they were not quite so happy they kept wondering about george they missed timmy too he should be trotting beside them enjoying the day as well they lost sight of the caravans after a time julian kept track of the way they went halfafraid of being lost he had a compass with him and checked their direction continually it would never do to have to spend a night out here he said nobody would ever find us they had a magnificent lunch about halfpast twelve really mrs johnson had surpassed herself egg and sardine sandwiches tomato and lettuce ham there seemed no end to them great slices of cherry cake were added too and a large juicy pear each i like this kind of cherry cake said dick looking at his enormous slice the cherries have all gone to the bottom they make a very nice last mouthful any drinks said henry and was handed a bottle of gingerbeer she drank it thirstily why does gingerbeer taste so nice on a picnic she said much nicer than drinking it sitting down in a shop even if its got ice in it theres a spring or something nearby said julian i can hear it bubbling they all listened yes there was a little bubbling tinkling noise anne got up to trace it she found it in a few minutes and called the others there was a round pool cool and blue lying two or three feet down and into it from one side fell a crystal clear spring of water tinkling as it fell one of the springs that the gypsies use when they travel this deserted moor i expect said julian he cupped his hands under the falling water and got his palms full he carried the water to his mouth and sipped it delicious cool as an icebox he said taste it anne they rode a little farther but the moor seemed the same everywhere heather wiry grass gorse a clear spring falling into a pool or tiny stream here and there and a few trees mostly silver birch larks sang all the time soaring high in the air almost too far up to see their song falls down like raindrops said anne holding out her hands as if to catch them henry laughed she liked this family and was very glad they had asked her to come out with them she thought george was silly to have stayed at the stables i think we ought to go home said julian at last looking at his watch were a good way away let me see now we want to make more or less for the setting sun come on he led the way his horse picking its own path over the heather the others followed dick stopped after a while are you sure were quite right ju i dont somehow feel that we are the moor is different here rather sandy and not so much gorse julian stopped his horse and looked round and about yes it does look a bit different he said but yet we seem to be going in the right direction lets go a bit more to the west if only there was something on the horizon to guide us but this moor hasnt a thing that stands out anywhere they went on again and then henry gave an exclamation i say whats this do come here the two boys and anne swerved over to henry she was now off her horse and was bending over scraping away at the heather look it seems like rails or something said henry very old and rusty but they cant be surely everyone was now down on their knees scraping sand and heather away julian sat back and considered yes its rails old ones as you say but what in the world were rails laid down here for i cant think said henry i only caught sight of them by chance theyre so overgrown i couldnt believe my eyes they must lead from somewhere to somewhere said dick perhaps there was a quarry or something on the moor and they ran little engines with trucks there to fetch the sand and take it back to town to sell thats about it said julian its very sandy here as we noticed good fine sand maybe there is a quarry on the moor well that way behind us goes right out on the moor so this way must lead back to some town or village probably milling green or somewhere like that yes youre right said dick in which case if we follow the lines along well get back to civilization sooner or later well seeing that we seem to be more or less lost that would be quite a good idea said henry she mounted her horse again and rode along the lines theyre fairly easy to see she called if you ride between them that is because they go so straight the lines ran steadily over the moor sometimes very overgrown and in about half an hours time henry gave a cry and pointed forward houses i thought wed soon come to some place it is milling green said julian as the rails came to a sudden end and they rode out into a small cartroad well we havent far to go now to get to the stables said henry pleased i say wouldnt it be fun to follow those lines all across the moor and see where they really lead to yes we might do that one day said julian gosh its getting late i wonder how old george has been getting on today they walked quickly along to the stables thinking of george would she have retired to bed would she still be cross or worse still hurt and grieved it was anybodys guess chapter seven george sniffer and liz george had had quite an interesting day first she had gone down to help captain johnson do clips leg again and bandage it up the little skewbald stood very patiently and george felt a sudden liking for the ugly little creature thanks george said captain johnson who to her relief had said nothing about her not having gone riding with the others now would you like to come and put jumps up for the youngsters theyre longing to do some more jumping george found that it was quite amusing to teach the younger ones how to jump they were so very very proud of themselves when they went over even a foothigh jump on their little ponies after that sniffer arrived accompanied by a peculiar little mongrel called liz liz was a bit of a spaniel a bit of a poodle and odd bits of something else and looked rather like a small walking hearthrug of black curly fur timmy was amazed to see this walking mat and sat and watched liz sniffing here and there for some time before he came to the conclusion that it really was some kind of dog he gave a sharp little bark to see what this comical creature would do when she heard it liz took no notice at all she had unearthed a small bone which smelt extremely interesting timmy considered that all bones within the radius of at least a mile belonged to him and him alone so he ran over to liz at once and gave a small warning growl liz immediately dropped the bone humbly at his feet then sat up on her hindlegs and begged timmy eyed her in astonishment then liz stood up on her hindlegs and walked daintily all round timmy and back again timmy was astounded he had never seen a dog do that before could this hearthrug affair be a dog after all liz saw that timmy was really impressed and went on with yet another trick she had learnt during the time she had been with the circus she turned headoverheels yapping all the time timmy retreated a few steps into the bushes this was going too far what was this animal doing trying to stand on its head liz went on turning headoverheels very rapidly and ended up almost on timmys front paws he had now backed into the bush as far as he could liz remained on her back paws in air tongue hanging out panting she gave a very small beseeching whine timmy bent his head down and sniffed at her paws behind him his tail began to move a little yes it had a wag in it he sniffed again liz leapt on to her four feet and pranced all round timmy yapping as if to say come on and play do come and then suddenly timmy fell upon the absurd little creature and pretended to worry it liz gave a delighted volley of yaps and rolled over and over they had a marvellous game and when it was all over timmy sank down panting for breath in a sunny corner of the yard and liz settled herself between his front paws as if she had known him all her life when george came out of the stable with sniffer she could hardly believe her eyes whats that timmys got between his paws she said its surely not a dog its liz said sniffer she can get round any dog there is master george liz youre a monkey arent you walk then walk liz left timmy and ran over to sniffer walking daintily on her hind legs george laughed what a funny little creature like a bit cut out of a furry hearthrug shes clever said sniffer and patted liz well master george when can i have clip do yon think my father has gone off with the other caravans and hes left me with ours so it doesnt matter whether its today or tomorrow or even the next day well it wont be today thats certain said george pleased that sniffer called her master george not miss it might perhaps be tomorrow havent you got a hanky sniffer i never on my life heard anyone sniff as often as you do sniffer rubbed his sleeve across his nose i never had no hanky he said but ive got my sleeve see i think youre quite disgusting said george im going to give you one of my own hankies and youre to use it youre not to keep sniffing like that didnt know i did said sniffer half sulkily whats it matter anyway but george had gone indoors and up the stairs she chose a large hanky in red and white stripes that would do nicely for sniffer she took it down to him he looked at it in surprise thats a scarf for my neck he said no it isnt its a hanky for your nose said george havent you a pocket to put it in thats right now use it instead of sniffing for goodness sake where are the others asked sniffer putting the hanky carefully into his pocket almost as if it were made of glass gone riding said george shortly they said they would come and see my caravan said sniffer they said so well they wont be able to today said george theyll be back too late i expect ill come and see it though theres nobody in it is there george was not keen on meeting sniffers father or any other of his relations he shook his head no its empty my fathers gone i told you and my aunt and my grandma too what do you do on the moor asked george as she followed sniffer across the field and up the hill to where the caravans had stood now only one was left sniffers play around said sniffer and gave an enormous sniff george gave him a shove in the back sniffer what did i give you the hanky for dont do that it gets on my nerves sniffer used his sleeve at once but fortunately george didnt notice she had now come to the caravan and was staring at it she thought of sniffers answer to her question a minute or two back you said you just played around on the moor but what does your father do and your uncle and grandad and all the rest of the men theres nothing to do there at all as far as i can see and no farmhouse to beg eggs or milk or anything from sniffer shut up like a clam he was just about to sniff and thought better of it he stared at george his mouth set in an obstinate line george looked at him impatiently captain johnson said you and your caravans went there every three months she said what for there must be some reason well said sniffer looking away from her we make pegs and baskets and i know that all gypsies make things to sell said george but you dont need to go into the middle of a deserted moor to make them you can do them just as well in a village or sitting in a field near a farmhouse why go to such a lonely place as the moor sniffer said nothing but bent over a queer little arrangement of sticks set on the path beside his caravan george saw them and bent over them too her question forgotten oh is that a patrin a gypsy message what does it mean there were two sticks one long and one short neatly arranged in the shape of a cross a little farther up on the path were a few single straight sticks all pointing in the same direction yes said sniffer very glad to have the subject changed its our way of telling things to those who may come after us see the sticks in the shape of the cross thats a patrin that says weve been along this way and were going in the direction that the long stick points i see said george how simple but what about these four straight sticks all pointing the same way too what do they mean they mean that the travellers went in caravans said sniffer giving a sudden sniff see four sticks four caravans going that way i see said george making up her mind that she herself would evolve quite a few patrins for use at school when they went for walks are there any more patrins sniffer plenty said the boy look when i leave here i shall put a patrin like this he picked a large leaf from a nearby tree and then a small one he placed them side by side and weighted them down with small stones what in the world does that mean said george well its a patrin a message to say that me and my little dog have gone in the caravan too said sniffer picking up the leaves suppose my father came back to find me and he saw those leaves there hed know id gone on with my dog its simple big leaf for me little leaf for my dog yes i like it said george pleased now lets look at the caravan it was an oldfashioned kind of caravan not very big and with high wheels the door and the steps down were in front the shafts rested on the ground waiting for clip to come back the caravan was black with red designs on it here and there george went up the steps ive been inside a few caravans she said but never one quite like this she peeped in curiously it certainly wasnt very clean but it wasnt as dirty as she expected either its not smelly is it said sniffer quite anxiously i tidied it up today seeing as how i thought you were all visiting me thats our bed at the back we all sleep on it george stared at the big bunklike bed stretched at the end of the caravan covered with a bright quilt she imagined the whole family sleeping there close together well at least they would be warm in the winter dont you get hot in the summer sleeping in this small caravan asked george oh no only my grandma sleeps here then said sniffer swallowing a sniff in a hurry before george could hear it me and the others sleep under the caravan then if it rains it dont matter well thanks for showing me so many things said george looking round at the cupboards the little lockerseats and the overbig chest of drawers how you all get in here is a miracle she didnt go in even though sniffer had tidied up there was still a distinctly peculiar smell hanging about come and see us tomorrow sniffer she said going down the steps clip may be all right by then and sniffer dont you forget youve got a hanky now i wont forget said sniffer proudly ill keep it as clean as can be master george chapter eight sniffer makes a promise george was feeling very lonely by the time the evening came how had the others got on without her had they missed her at all perhaps they hadnt even thought of her anyway they didnt have you timmy said george you wouldnt go off and leave me would you timmy pressed against her glad to see that she was happier again he wondered where the others were and where they had gone to all day there was suddenly a clattering of hooves in the stableyard and george flew to the door yes they were back how should she behave she felt cross and relieved and rather humble and glad all at once she stood there not knowing whether to frown or to smile the others made up her mind for her hallo george shouted dick we did miss you hows your head called anne i hope its better hallo called henry you ought to have come weve had a super day come and help us stable the horses george shouted julian tell us what youve been doing timmy had sped over to them barking in delight george found her legs running towards them too a welcoming smile on her face hallo she called let me help did you really miss me i missed you too the boys were very relieved to see that george was herself again nothing more was said about her headache she busied herself unsaddling the horses and listening to their story of the day then she told them about sniffer and his patrins and how she had given him a brandnew handkerchief but im sure he thinks hes got to keep it spotlessly clean she said he never used it once when i was with him theres the supperbell well only just be in time are you hungry you bet we are said dick though after mrs johnsons sandwiches i never thought id be able to eat any supper at all hows clip never mind now ill tell you everything at supper said george do you want any help henry henry was surprised to hear george call her henry instead of henrietta no thanks er george she said i can manage it was a very jolly suppertime that evening the youngsters were set at a table by themselves so the older ones talked to their hearts content captain johnson was very interested to hear about the old railway they had found i never knew there was anything like that on the moors he said though of course weve only been here about fifteen years so we dont know a great deal of the local history you want to go and ask old ben the blacksmith about that hes lived here all his life and a long life it is for hes over eighty well weve got to take some of the horses to be shod tomorrow havent we said henry eagerly we could ask him then why he might even have helped to make the rails we saw the caravans george when we had got pretty far out on the moor said julian goodness knows where they were heading for towards the coast i should think whats the coast like beyond the moor captain johnson wild said the captain great unclimbable cliffs and reefs or rocks stretching out to sea only the birds live there theres no bathing no boating no beach well it beats me where those caravans are going said dick its a mystery they go every three months dont they about that said captain johnson ive no idea what the attraction of the moor is for the gypsies it just beats me usually they wont go anywhere where there are not a few farms or at least a small village where they can sell their goods id like to go after them and see where they are and what theyre doing said julian eating his third hardboiled egg all right lets said george but how we dont know where theyve gone said henry well sniffers going to join them tomorrow or as soon as clip is all right for walking said george and hes got to follow the patrins left on the way by the others he says that he looks at the places where fires have been made on the way and beside them somewhere he will see the patrins the sticks that point in the direction he must follow hes sure to destroy them said dick we couldnt follow them well ask him to leave his own patrins said george i think he will hes not a bad little boy really i could ask him to leave plenty of patrins so that we could easily find the way well it might be fun to see if we could read the right road to go just as easily as the gypsies do said julian we could make it a days ride it would be interesting henry gave a most enormous yawn and that made anne yawn too though hers was a very polite one henry said mrs johnson sorry said henry it just came almost like a sneeze does i dont know why but i feel almost asleep go to bed then said mrs johnson youve had such a day of air and sunshine you all look very brown too the april sun has been as hot as june today the five of them and timmy went out for a last look at the horses and to do one or two small jobs henry yawned again and that set everyone else off even george me for the straw said julian with a laugh oh the thought of that warm comfy straw bed is too good for words you girls are welcome to the beds i hope sniffers pa doesnt come in the middle of the night again said dick i shall tie up the latch said julian well lets go and say goodnight to mrs johnson it wasnt long before the three girls were in bed and the two boys cuddled down in the straw of the stable clip was there still but he no longer fidgeted he lay down quietly and did not once move his bad leg it was getting much better he would certainly be able to go after the others the next day julian and dick fell asleep at once no one came creeping in at the stable door that night nothing disturbed them until the morning when a cock got into the stable through a window sat on a rafter just above them and crowed loudly enough to wake both boys with a jump whats that said dick that awful screeching in my ear was it you ju the cock crowed again and the boys laughed blow him said julian settling down again i could do with another couple of hours sleep that morning sniffer came slipping in at the gate again he never came boldly in he slid through the hedge or crept in at the gate or appeared round a corner he saw george and went over to her master george he called much to julians amusement is clip better yes called back george captain johnson says you can take him today but wait a bit sniffer i want to ask you something before you go sniffer was pleased he liked this girl who had presented him with such a magnificent handkerchief he took it carefully out of his pocket hoping to please her see he said how clean it is i have kept it very carefully he sniffed loudly youre a fathead said george exasperated i gave it to you to use not to keep clean in your pocket its to stop your sniffing honestly youre a bit of a mutt sniffer i shall take that hanky away if you dont use it sniffer looked alarmed he shook it out carefully and then lightly touched his nose with it he then folded it up conscientiously in the right creases and put it back into his pocket again now no sniffing commanded george trying not to laugh listen sniffer you know those patrins you showed me yesterday yes master george said sniffer well will the other gypsies who have gone in front leave you patrins to follow so that you will know the way said george sniffer nodded yes but not many because i have been that way twice before they will only leave them in places where i might go wrong i see said george now sniffer we want to have a sort of game we want to see which of us can follow patrins and we want you to lay patrins for us quite often on your way to your family today will you oh yes i will said sniffer quite proud to have a favour asked of him i will lay the ones i showed you the cross the long sticks and the big and little leaf yes do said george that will mean that you have passed in a certain direction and you are a boy and a dog thats right isnt it yes said sniffer nodding his head you have remembered right and were going to have a kind of game trying to pretend we are travelling gypsies following others who have passed said george you must not show yourselves when you come up to our caravans said sniffer looking suddenly alarmed i should get into trouble for laying patrins for you all right well be careful said george now lets go and get clip they fetched the patient little skewbald who came out gladly he no longer limped and his rest seemed to have done him good he went off at a good pace with sniffer the last george heard of them was a very loud sniff indeed sniffer she shouted warningly he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the hanky he waved it gaily in the air a sudden grin lighting up his face george went to find the others sniffer has taken clip she said what about going down to the blacksmith and taking those horses that want shoeing good idea said julian we can ask him all about mystery moor then and the strange little railway line or whatever it is come on they took the horses that needed shoeing there were six of them so they each rode one and julian led the sixth timmy ran happily along beside them he loved the horses and they regarded him as a real friend bending their long noses down to sniff at him whenever he came near they went slowly down the long lane to the blacksmiths there it is said george a proper old smithy with a lovely fire and theres the smith old ben was a mighty figure of a man even though he was over eighty he didnt shoe many horses now but sat in the sun watching all that was going on he had a great mane of white hair and eyes that were as black as the coal he had so many times heated to a fiery flame good morning young masters and miss he said and julian grinned that would please george and henry weve got some questions to ask you said george dismounting ask away said the old man if its about this place theres nothing much old ben cant tell you give jim your horses now ask away chapter nine the blacksmith tells a tale well began julian we went riding on mystery moor yesterday and for one thing wed like to know if there is any reason for the curious name was there ever a mystery on that moor oh there be plenty of mysteries away there said old ben people lost and never come back again noises that no one could find the reason of what kind of noises said anne curiously ah now when i were a boy i spent nights up on that moor said old ben solemnly and the noises that went on there screeches and howls and the like and moans and the sweep of big wings well all that might have been owls and foxes and things like that said dick ive heard a barnowl give a screech just over my head which made me nearly jump out of my skin if i hadnt known it was an owl id have run for miles ben grinned and his face ran into a score of creases and wrinkles why is it called mystery moor persisted julian is it a very old name when my grandad was a boy it were called misty moor said the old blacksmith remembering see misty not mystery and that were because of the seafogs that came stealing in from the coast and lay heavy on the moor so that no man could see his hand in front of his face yes ive been lost in one of them mists and right scared i was too it swirled round me like a live thing and touched me all over with its cold damp fingers how horrid said anne with a shiver what did you do well first i ran for my life said ben getting out his pipe and looking into the empty bowl i ran over heather and into gorse i fell a dozen times and all the time the mist was feeling me with its damp fingers trying to get me thats what the old folk used to say of that mist it was always trying to get you still it was only a mist said george feeling that the old man was exaggerating does it still come over the moor oh ay said ben ramming some tobacco into his pipe autumns the time but it comes suddenlike at any moment of the year ive knowed it come at the end of a fine summers day creeping in stealthylike and my if you dont happen to see it soon enough it gets you what do you mean it gets you said george well it may last for days said old ben and if youre lost on them moors youre lost proper and you never come back ah smile if you like young sir but i knows he went off into memories of long ago looking down at his pipe lets see now there was old mrs banks who went bilberrypicking with her basket on a summers afternoon and no one ever heard of her again after the mist came down and there was young victor who played truant and went off to the moors and the mist got him too i can see wed better watch out for the mist if we go riding there said dick this is the first ive heard of it yes you keep your eyes skinned said old ben look away to the coastside and watch there thats where it comes from but there baint many mists nowadays l dont know for why no now i think on it there havent been a mist not a proper wicked one for nigh on three years what id like to know is why was the name changed to mystery moor said henry i can understand its being called misty moor but now everyone calls it mystery not misty well now that must have been about seventy years ago when i were a bit of a boy said ben lighting his pipe and puffing hard he was enjoying himself he didnt often get such an interested audience as this five of them including a dog who sat and listened too that was when the bartle family built the little railway over the moor he began and stopped at the exclamations of his five listeners ah we wanted to know about that oh you know about the railway then do go on the blacksmith seemed to get some trouble with his pipe and pulled at it for an exasperatingly long time george wished she was a horse and could stamp her foot impatiently well the bartle family was a big one said ben at last all boys but for one ailing little girl big strong fellows they were i remember them well i was scared of them they were so free with their fists well one of them dan found a mighty good stretch of sand out there on the moor oh yes we thought there might have been a sandquarry said anne ben frowned at the interruption and as there were nine or ten good strong bartles they reckoned to make a fine do of it said ben they got wagons and they went to and from the quarry they dug and they sold their sand for miles around good sharp sand it were we saw some said henry but what about the rails dont hurry him said dick with a frown they made a mort of money said ben remembering and they set to work and built a little railway to carry an injin and trucks to the quarry and back to save labour my my that were a nine days wonder that railway us youngsters used to follow the little injin puffing along and it were the longing of us all to drive it but we never did them bartles kept a big stick each one of them and they whipped the hide off any boy that got too near them fierce they were and quarrelsome why did the railway fall into ruin asked julian the rails are all overgrown with heather and grass now you can hardly see them well now we come to that there mystery you keep on about said ben taking an extra big puff at his pipe them bartles fell foul of the gypsies up on the moor oh were there gypsies on the moor then said dick there are some now oh ay theres always been gypsies on the moor long as i can remember said the blacksmith well its said them gypsies quarrelled with the bartles and it wasnt hard to do that most people did and the gypsies pulled up bits of the line here and there and the little injin toppled over and pulled the trucks with it the children could quite well imagine the little engine puffing along coming to the damaged rails and falling over what a todo there must have been up on the moor then the bartles werent ones to put up with a thing like that said ben so they set about to drive all the gypsies off the moor and they swore that if so much as one caravan went there theyd set fire to it and chase the gypsies over to the coast and into the sea they must have been a fierce family said anne youre right there said ben all nine or ten of them were big upstanding men with great shaggy eyebrows that almost hid their eyes and loud voices nobody dared to cross them if they did theyd have the whole family on their doorstep with sticks they ruled this place they did and my they were hated us children ran off as soon as we saw one coming round a corner what about the gypsies did the bartles manage to drive them off the moor asked george impatiently now you let me go my own pace said ben pointing at her with his pipe you want a bartle after you young sir thats what you want he thought she was a boy of course he did something to his pipe and made them all wait a little julian winked at the others he liked this old fellow with his long long memories now you cant cross the gypsies for long said ben at last thats a fact you cant and one day all them bartles disappeared and never came back home no not one of them all that was left of the family was little lame agnes their sister everyone exclaimed in surprise and old ben looked round with satisfaction ah he could tell a story he could but whatever happened said henry well no one rightly knows said ben it happened in a week when the mist came swirling over the moors and blotted everything out nobody went up there except the bartles and they were safe because all they had to do was to follow their railway lines there and back they went up to the quarry each day the mist was there and worked the same as usual nothing stopped they bartles from working he paused and looked round at his listeners he dropped his voice low and all five of the children felt little shivers up their backs one night somebody in the village saw twenty or more gypsy caravans slinking through the village at dead of night said ben up on the moor they went in the thick mist mebbe they followed the railway nobody knows and next morning up to the quarry went the bartles as usual swallowed up in the mist he paused again and they never came back he said no not one of them never heard of again but what happened said george searchparties were sent out when the mist cleared said old ben but never one of the bartles did they find alive or dead never a one and they didnt find any gypsy caravans either theyd all come creeping back the next night and passed through the village like shadows i reckon them gypsies set upon the bartles in the mist that day fought them and defeated them and took them and threw them over the cliffs into the roaring sea how horrible said anne feeling sick dont worrit yourself said the blacksmith it all happened a mort of time ago and there wasnt many that mourned them bartles i can tell you funny thing was their weakly little sister agnes she lived to be a hale old woman of ninetysix and only died a few years ago and to think them strong fierce brothers of hers went all together like that its a most interesting story ben said julian so misty moor became mystery moor then did it and nobody ever really found out what happened so the mystery was never solved didnt anyone work the railway after that or get the sand no not a soul said ben we was all scared you see and young agnes she said the railway and the trucks and injin could rot for all she cared i never dared to go near them after that it was a long time before anyone but the gypsies set foot on misty moor again now its all forgotten the tale of the bartles but them gypsies still remember ive no doubt theyve got long memories they have do you know why they come to mystery moor every so often asked dick no they come and they go said ben theyve their own queer ways they dont belong anywhere them folk what they do on the moor is their own business and i wouldnt want to poke my nose into it id remember them old bartles and keep away a voice came from inside the smithy where jim the blacksmiths grandson had been shoeing the horses grandad you stop jabbering away there and let the children come and talk to me ive shod nearly all the horses ben laughed you go along he said to the children i know you like to be in there and see the sparks fly and the shoes made ive wasted your time i have telling you longago things you go along into the smithy and just you remember two things watch out for that mist and keep away from the gypsies on the moor chapter ten sniffers patrins it was fun in the smithy working the bellows seeing the fire glow and watching the redhot shoes being shaped jim was quick and clever and it was a pleasure to watch him you been hearing grandads old stories he said its all hes got to do now sit there and remember though when he wants to he can make a horseshoe as well as i can there thats the last one stand still sultan thats right the five children were soon on their way back again it was a lovely morning and the banks and ditches they passed were bright gold with thousands of celandines all beautifully polished said anne picking two or three for her buttonhole it did look as if someone had polished the inside of each petal for they gleamed like enamel what a queer tale the old man told said julian he told it well yes he made me feel i dont want to go up on the moor again said anne dont be feeble said george it all happened ages ago jolly interesting too i wonder if the gypsies who are there now know the story maybe their greatgrandparents were the ones who set on the bartles that misty day well sniffers father looked sly enough to carry out a plan like that said henry what about us having a shot at following the way they went and seeing if we can make out the patrins that sniffer told george he would leave good idea said julian well go this afternoon i say whats the time i should think it must be halfpast dinnertime they looked at their watches yes were late but we always are when we get back from the blacksmith said george never mind i bet mrs johnson will have an extra special meal for us she had there was an enormous plate of stew for everyone complete with carrots onions parsnips and turnips and a date pudding to follow good old mrs johnson you three girls must wash up for me afterwards she said ive such a lot to do today why cant the boys help said george at once ill do all the washingup said anne with a sudden grin you four boys can go out to the stables dick gave her a goodnatured shove you know well help even if were not good at it ill dry i hate those bits and pieces that float about in the washingbowl will it be all right if we go up on the moors this afternoon asked george yes quite all right but if you want to take your tea youll have to pack it yourselves said mrs johnson im taking the small children out for a ride and theres one on the leadingrein still as you know they were ready to set off at three oclock their tea packed and everything the horses were caught in the field and got ready too they set off happily now well see if we are as clever as we think we are at reading gypsy patrins said george timmy dont chase every rabbit you see or youll be left behind they cantered up on to the moor passing the place where the caravans had stood they knew the direction they had taken and here and there they saw wheelmarks it was fairly easy to follow their trail because five caravans made quite a path to follow heres where they camped first said julian riding up to a blackened spot that showed where a fire had been lighted we ought to find a message left somewhere here they searched for one george found it its here behind this tree she called out of the wind they dismounted and came round george on the ground was the patrin the shape of a cross the long stick pointing forwards in the direction they were going other single sticks lay there to show that a caravan had gone that way and beside them were the large and the small leaf weighted with tiny stones what did those leaves show now oh yes sniffer and his dog said dick well were on the right way though wed know that anyhow by the fire they mounted again and went on it proved quite easy to find and follow the patrins only once did they find any difficulty and that was when they came to a place marked by two trees where there was no apparent sign in the heather of any caravan marks the heathers so jolly thick here that its taken the caravans as if it were a featherbed springing up when they had gone and giving no sign of where they had passed said julian he dismounted and had a good look round no there was no sign well go on a little way he said we may come to a camping place then well know but they came to no old camping place and stopped at last in bewilderment weve lost the trail said dick were not such good gypsies after all lets go back to those two trees said george we can still just see them if its so easy to lose the way there there might be a patrin although there are no campmarks after all a patrin is left to show the way in case the ones following take the wrong route so back they rode to the two trees and there sure enough was sniffers patrin henry found it set carefully between the trees so that nothing could disturb it heres the cross and the single sticks and the leaves she said but look the long stick of the cross points to the east and we went off to the north no wonder we found no signs of the caravans they set off to the east this time across the thick springy heather and almost at once found signs of the passing of caravans twigs broken off the bushes a wheel rut on a soft piece of ground were right now said julian pleased i was beginning to think it was all too easy for words but it isnt they rode for two hours and then decided to have tea they sat down in a little glade of silver birches with an unexpected copse of pale primroses behind timmy had to make up his mind which to choose a rabbitchase or titbits from the childrens tea he chose both racing after an imaginary rabbit and then coming back for a sandwich you know its a lot better for us when mrs johnson makes sandwiches of tomato or lettuce or something like that said henry we do get them all then but when we have meat or sardine or egg sandwiches timmy gets as much as we do well surely you dont mind that henrietta said george at once you make timmy sound very greedy after all you dont need to give him any of your sandwiches now georgina murmured dick in her ear sorry georgina said henry with a grin i just cant help giving him a sandwich or two when he comes and sits down and looks at me so longingly woof said timmy and at once sat down in front of henry his tongue out and his eyes fixed unblinkingly on her he sort of hypnotizes me complained henry make him go away george i shant be able to keep a single sandwich or bit of cake for myself go and stare at someone else timmy for goodness sake julian looked at his watch i dont think we ought to spend too long over tea he said i know weve got summertime now and the evenings are nice and light but we havent reached the gypsy camp yet and after that weve got to go all the way back what about starting off again right said everyone and remounted their horses they set off through the heather soon they found it unexpectedly easy to follow the caravan route because the soil became sandy and there were many bare patches on which the marks of the wheels could plainly be seen goodness if we go to the east much more well come to the sea said dick no its still some miles away said julian hallo theres a little hill or something in the distance first time weve seen anything but complete flatness the wheelmarks led steadily towards the little hill which as they came near seemed to grow considerably bigger i bet the caravans are there said george that hill would give a nice bit of shelter from the wind that came from the sea i believe i can see one george was right the caravans were there they showed up well against the hill in their bright colours theyve even got up a washingline as usual said anne clothes flapping in the wind lets go and ask if clip is all right said julian it will be a very good excuse for going right up to the camp so they cantered straight up to the little group of five caravans four or five men appeared as soon as they heard the sound of hooves they looked silent and rather forbidding sniffer ran out and shouted hallo clips fine quite all right again his father gave him a push and said something sharp to him he disappeared under the nearest caravan julian rode up to sniffers father did i hear sniffer say that clip was quite all right he asked where is he over there said the man with a nod of his head no need for you to see him hes mended fine all right all right im not going to take him away from you said julian this is a nice sheltered place youve got isnt it how long are you staying whats that to do with you said an old gypsy unpleasantly nothing said julian surprised just a polite question thats all how do you get water called george is there a good spring here there was no reply at all the four or five men had now been joined by others and there were three mangylooking dogs growling round timmy was beginning to growl back youd better go before our dogs get at you said sniffers father sourly wheres liz said george remembering sniffers dog but before she got an answer the three dogs suddenly made an attack on timmy they pounced on him and he had hard work to keep them off he was far bigger than they were but they were nippy little things call off those dogs yelled julian seeing that george was dismounting to go to timmys help she would get bitten do you hear me call off those dogs sniffers father whistled the three dogs reluctantly left timmy and went over to the men their tails down george had reached tim and had now got her hand on his collar to stop him from chasing the other three dogs mount your horse whistle timmy and well go shouted julian not at all liking the silent sourlooking gypsies george did as she was told timmy ran beside her and they all cantered away from the unpleasant camp the men stood watching them in complete silence whats up with them said dick puzzled anyone would think they were planning another bartle affair dont said anne theyre planning something all alone out here far away from anywhere i shant go near them again they thought we were prying and spying said dick thats all poor old sniffer what a life he has we couldnt even tell him that we found his patrins useful said george oh well theres probably nothing in it not even an adventure was she right or wrong julian looked at dick and dick looked back his eyebrows raised they didnt know oh well time would tell chapter eleven a nice little plan the five of them told captain and mrs johnson about their afternoons experience as they were having supper patrins said mrs johnson so sniffer told you about those but i really dont think you should visit the gypsy camp those particular gypsies are a surly badtempered lot did you ever hear the tale of the big bartles said henry getting ready to relate it and add little bits of her own here and there no but it can wait im sure said mrs johnson knowing henrys habit of leaving her food quite uneaten once she began on some marvellous tale is it one of your tales you can tell it after supper its not henrys tale said george annoyed that henry should get all the limelight again and take the blacksmiths tale for her own its one old ben told us ju you tell it nobody is to tell it now said captain johnson you came in late for supper we waited for you and the least you can do is to get on with your eating the five juniors at the other table were disappointed they had hoped to hear another of henrys marvellous stories but captain johnson was hungry and tired old ben is a great age as you said began henry after a few mouthfuls he not another word please henrietta said the captain curtly henry went red and george grinned kicking at dick under the table unfortunately she kicked henry instead and the girl glared at her for a whole minute oh dear thought anne just as wed had such a lovely day i suppose were all tired and scratchy why did you kick me began henry in a cross voice as soon as she and george left the table with the others shut up you two said julian she probably meant to kick me or dick not you henry shut up she didnt like julian to tick her off george looked mutinous and went off with timmy dick yawned what jobs are there to do if any he said dont say theres washingup again i feel i might break a few things mrs johnson heard him and laughed no theres no washingup the woman has come in to do it tonight have a look at the horses and see that jenny the mare is not with flash you know she doesnt like her for some reason and will kick out at her she must always be kept in another field thats all right mrs johnson said william suddenly appearing stolid and competent as ever ive seen to that ive seen to everything really youre better than any stableboy william said mrs johnson smiling at him i wish youd take a permanent job here i wish you meant that said william earnestly there was nothing he would have liked better he went off looking pleased i think youd better all go to bed then as william appears to have done everything necessary said mrs johnson any plans for tomorrow not yet said julian trying to stop a yawn so if you want anything done well do it well see what tomorrow brings said mrs johnson and said good night the boys said good night to the three girls and went off to the stable gosh weve forgotten to undress and wash and everything said julian halfasleep whats the matter with us at this place i cant seem to keep my eyes open after halfpast eight the next day certainly brought a few things it brought a letter for henry that filled her with disgust it brought two letters for mrs johnson that made her start fussing and worrying it brought a telegram for captain johnson that sent him down to the station at once henriettas letter was from two of her greataunts they announced that as they would be near the stables that day and the following they would like to fetch her and take her out with them blow said henrietta ungratefully greataunts hannah and lucy would choose this very week to come along and see me just when julian and dick are here and everything is such fun cant i phone and say im too busy mrs johnson certainly not said mrs johnson shocked that would be very rude henry and you know it youre having the whole of the easter holidays here and yet you think you cant spare two days as a matter of fact i shall be glad if your aunts do take you off my hands for a couple of days why asked henry astonished have i been a nuisance oh no but ive had two letters this morning telling me that four children are coming unexpectedly said mrs johnson they were not supposed to come till three of the others left this weekend but there you are these things happen where i am to put them i really dont know oh dear said anne do you think dick and julian ought to go home mrs johnson you didnt plan for them you know they just came yes i know said mrs johnson but were more or less used to that and i do like having bigger boys i must say theyre such a help now let me see what can we do captain johnson came in looking hurried ive just had a telegram dear he said ive got to go down to the station those two new horses have arrived two days before i wanted them what a nuisance this is one of those days said mrs johnson desperately good gracious how many shall we be in the house and however many horses shall we have no i cant count this morning im all muddleheaded anne felt that it was a pity that she and george and the boys couldnt immediately pack and go home after all poor mrs johnson had thought that she and george would have gone home three or four days ago and instead of that they had stayed on and the boys had arrived as well anne hurried to find julian he would know what to do she found him with dick carrying straw for the stables julian listen i want to talk to you said anne julian let the load of straw slip to the ground and turned to anne whats up he said dont tell me its a row between george and henry again because i shant listen no nothing like that said anne its mrs johnson shes got four children coming unexpectedly before the others go shes in a great state about it and i wondered what we could do to help you see she didnt expect any of us four to be here this week no thats true said julian sitting down on his straw lets think hard its easy said dick well simply take our tents some food and go and camp out on the moor by some spring what could be nicer oh yes said anne her eyes shining oh dick thats a marvellous idea mrs johnson will get rid of us all and timmy too then and we would have a lovely time all by ourselves killing quite a lot of birds with one stone said julian weve got a couple of tents in our kit anne very small ones but theyll do and we can borrow rubber sheets to put on the heather though its as dry as a bone as far as i can see ill go and tell george said anne joyfully lets go today julian and be out of the way before the new children come captain johnsons got two new horses coming too hell be very glad to have a few of us out of the way she flew off to tell george george was busy polishing some harness a job she liked very much she listened to annes excited tale henry was there too looking gloomy she looked gloomier still at the end its too bad she said when anne had finished i could have come with you if it hadnt been for these greataunts of mine why did they have to come just at this very moment dont you think its maddening neither anne nor george thought it was maddening they were secretly very pleased indeed to think that they could once more go off entirely on their own with timmy as they had so often done before but they would have had to ask henry if her aunts hadnt written at this very lucky moment george didnt like to show how delighted she was to think of going off camping on the moor she and anne did a little comforting of poor henry and then went off to make arrangements with mrs johnson well thats a very bright idea of dicks she said in delight it solves a whole lot of problems and i know you dont mind youre thrilled at the chance arent you its really very helpful i only wish poor henry could go too but she must go out with her old greataunts they adore her of course she must said george solemnly she and anne exchanged a look poor henry but really it would be very nice to be without her for a little while everyone began to be suddenly very busy dick and julian undid their packs to find out exactly what was in them mrs johnson looked out rubber sheets and old rugs she was a wonder at producing things like that william wanted to go with them and help to carry the things but nobody wanted his help they just wanted to be off and away by themselves just the five and nobody else timmy caught the excitement too and his tail thumped and wagged the whole morning youll be pretty well loaded said mrs johnson doubtfully its a good thing that fine weather is forecast or youd have to take macs as well still i imagine you wont go very far on the moors will you you can easily get back to the stable if you have forgotten anything or want more food they were ready at last and went to find henry to say goodbye she stared at them mournfully she had changed into a smart little coat and dress she looked completely different and very gloomy what part of the moor are you going to she asked eagerly up the railway yes we thought we would said julian just to see where it goes to and its a nice straight way to follow we cant lose our way if we keep near the railway have a good time henry said george with a grin do they call you henrietta yes said poor henry putting on a pair of gloves well goodbye for goodness sake dont stay away too long thank goodness youre all such a hungry lot youll simply have to come back and get more food in a couple of days they grinned and left her timmy at their heels they made their way to the moor intending to cut out the part of the railway that ran to milling green and join it some way before that now were off said george contentedly without that chatterbox of a henry shes really not too bad said dick all the same its fine to be on our own just the famous five together chapter twelve the little railway it was a very hot day the five had had their lunch before they started as mrs johnson said it would be easier to carry that inside than outside even timmy carried something george said that he ought to do his share and had neatly fastened a bag of his pet biscuits on his back there now she said youve got your load too no dont try and sniff the biscuits all the time timmy you cant walk with your head screwing round like that you ought to be used to the smell of biscuits by this time they set off to the railway line or where they hoped it would be it took a little time to discover it running under the heather julian was glad he didnt want to walk right into milling green to find the beginning of it and then walk all the way up again anne found it by tripping over it oh she said here it is i caught my foot in a bit of rusty line look you can hardly see it good said julian and stepped in between the narrow pair of old rusty lines in some places they had rusted away and there were gaps in other places the heather had grown completely over the lines and unless the children had known that they must keep straight forward they would have lost them completely as it was they sometimes missed them and once had to do quite a bit of scrabbling about in the heather to see if they could feel them it was very hot their packs began to feel distinctly heavy timmys biscuits began to slide round his body and eventually hung below his tummy he didnt like that and george suddenly spied him sitting down trying to prise open the bag with his teeth she put down her own pack and adjusted timmys if only you didnt keep chasing rabbits and making your pack swing about it wouldnt slip she said there now its all right again tim walk to heel and it wont slip any more they went on and on up the railway lines sometimes the rails took a curve round an unexpected rock soon the soil began to look sandy and the heather did not grow so thickly it was easier to see the lines though in some places the sand had sifted over them and hidden them i really must have a rest said anne sitting down in some heather i feel i want to pant and hang my tongue out like timmy i wonder how far these lines go said dick its so very sandy now underfoot that i feel we must be getting near the quarry they lay back in the heather and felt very sleepy julian yawned and sat up this really wont do he said if we fall asleep well never want to start off with our heavy packs again stir yourselves lazybones they all got up again timmys biscuits had slithered round to his tummy once more and george had to put them right again timmy stood quietly panting his tongue hanging out he thought the biscuits were a great nuisance it would be much easier to eat them the sand got deeper and soon there were big sandy patches with no heather or grass at all the wind blew the sand up in the air and the five found that they had to shut their eyes against it i say the lines end here said julian stopping suddenly look theyre broken wrenched out of place the engine couldnt go any farther they may appear again a bit farther on said dick and went to look but he couldnt find any and came back to look at the lines again its funny he said we arent at any quarry yet are we i quite thought that the line would run right to the quarry the trucks would fill up there and the engine would pull them back to milling green where is the quarry why do the lines stop so suddenly here yes the quarry should be near here shouldnt it said julian well there simply must be more lines somewhere ones that go to the quarry lets look for the quarry first though we ought to see that easily enough but it wasnt really very easy to find because it was behind a great mass of thick tall gorsebushes dick rounded them and stopped behind the enormous spread of bushes was a great pit a sandy pit quarried and hollowed for its beautiful sand here it is called dick come and look my word theres been some quarrying here for sand they must have taken tons and tons out of it the others came to look it certainly was an enormous pit deep and wide they put their packs beside it and leapt down their feet sank into the fine sand the sides are pitted with holes said dick i bet hundreds of sandmartins nest here in may there are even some caves said george in surprise sandcaves well we can easily shelter here if we have rain some of these caves seem to go quite a long way back yes but id be a bit afraid of the sand falling in and burying me if i crawled in said anne its quite loose look she scraped some down with her hand ive found the lines called julian here look the sand has almost covered them i trod on a rail and it was so rotten it broke beneath my foot the others went to see timmy too he was quite delighted with this place the rabbitholes in it what fun he was going to have lets follow these lines said julian so they kicked away the sand from the rails and followed them slowly out of the quarry and towards the ends of the other broken lines about ten yards from these the lines they were following were wrenched apart some were flung into nearby heather and could be seen there bent and rusty the children stared at them i guess the gypsies did that when the bartles were here years ago said dick the day they attacked them perhaps i say look whatevers that great lump over there with gorse growing over it they went to see timmy saw the lump and couldnt make it out he growled warningly at it julian took up a broken piece of rail and forced back the gorse bush that had grown over and around the great lump almost hiding it see what it is he said startled they all stared why its the engine the little injin old ben the blacksmith told us about said dick it must have run right off the broken lines and overturned here and through the years these great gorsebushes grew up and hid it poor old engine julian forced the gorse back a little more what a funny oldfashioned affair he said look at the funnel and the fat little boiler and see theres the small cab it cant have had much power only just enough to puff along with a few trucks what happened to the trucks wondered anne well they would be easy enough to set upright again and put on the rails and handpushed to milling green said dick but this engine couldnt be lifted except by some kind of machinery not even a dozen men could lift it and set it on the rails the gypsies must have set on the bartles in the mist having first broken up the lines so that the engine would run off and overturn said julian they may even have used the broken rails to attack them with anyway they won the battle because not one of the bartles ever returned some of the villagers must have gone to see what became of them and have got the trucks back on the lines and pushed them to milling green said george trying to reconstruct the longago happenings in her mind but they couldnt do anything about the engine thats about it said julian my word what a shock for the bartles when they saw the gypsies creeping out at them from the mist like shadows i hope we dont dream about this tonight said anne they went back to the quarry this wouldnt be a bad place to camp in said dick the sand is so dry and so soft we could make lovely beds for ourselves we wouldnt need the tents up either because the sides of the quarry shelter us beautifully from the wind yes lets camp here said anne pleased there are quite a lot of nice holes to store our things in what about water asked george we want to be fairly near it dont we timmy find some water drink timmy drink arent you thirsty your tongue looks as if it is the way you are hanging it out like a flag timmy put his head on one side as george talked to him water drink he knew what both those words meant he ran off sniffing the air george watched him he disappeared round a bush and was away for about half a minute when he came back george gave a pleased shout hes found some water look his mouth is all wet timmy where is it timmy wagged his tail vigorously glad that george was pleased with him he ran round the bush again and the others followed he led them to a little green patch and stopped a spring bubbled up like a small fountain dancing a little in the sunshine the water fell from it into a little channel it had made for itself in the sand ran away for a short distance and then disappeared underground again thank you tim said george julian is the water all right to drink here well i can see some that is said julian pointing to the right the bartles must have put a pipe in that bank look and caught another spring there a much bigger one its as clear as can be that will do fme for us good said anne pleased its hardly any way from the quarry its as cold as ice too feel they felt and then they drank from their palms how cold and pure the moor must be full of these little bubbling springs welling up from underground that explained the brilliant green patches here and there now lets sit down and have some tea said anne unpacking the bag she had carried its too hot to feel really hungry oh no it isnt said dick speak for yourself anne they sat in the sunny quarry the sand warm to their legs far away from everybody said anne pleased nobody near us for miles but she wasnt quite right there was somebody much nearer than she thought chapter thirteen a noise in the night it was timmy who first knew there was somebody not far off he pricked up his ears and listened george saw him what is it tim she said nobody is coming here surely timmy gave a tiny growl as if he were not quite sure of himself then he leapt up his tail wagging and tore out of the quarry wheres he gone to said george astonished gosh here he is back again so he was and with him was a funny little hearthrug of a dog yes liz she was not quite sure of her welcome and crawled up to the children on her tummy looking more like a hearthrug than ever timmy leapt round her in delight she might have been his very best friend he was so delighted george patted the funny little dog and julian looked thoughtful i hope this doesnt mean that we are anywhere near the gypsy camp he said its quite likely that the lines might end somewhere near them ive rather lost my sense of direction oh goodness i do hope were not near their camp said anne in dismay those oldtime gypsies must have camped pretty near to the bartles quarry before they attacked them so perhaps the present camp is near too well whats it matter if it is said dick whos afraid of them im not they all sat still thinking hard liz licking annes hand and in the silence they heard an alltoofamiliar sound sniff sniff sniffer called george come on out wherever you are hiding i can hear you a pair of legs stuck out from a great clump of heather at the edge of the quarry and then the whole of sniffers wiry little body slithered out and down into the sand he sat there grinning at them halfafraid to come any nearer in case they were cross with him what are you doing here said dick not spying on us i hope no said sniffer our camp isnt very far away liz heard you i think and ran off i followed her oh blow we hoped we werent near anyone else said george does anyone at your camp know were here not yet said sniffer but theyll find out they always do i wont tell though if you dont want me to dick tossed him a biscuit well keep your mouth shut if you can he said were not interfering with anyone and we dont want anyone interfering with us see sniffer nodded he suddenly put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the red and white hanky that george had given him it was still clean and beautifully folded not dirty yet he said to george well it ought to be said george its for your sniffs no dont use your coatsleeve sniffer simply could not understand why he should use a beautiful clean hanky when he had a dirty coatsleeve he put the hanky carefully back into his pocket liz ran to him and fawned on him sniffer fondled the peculiar little creature and then timmy went over and played with them both the four finished their tea threw sniffer one last biscuit and got up to put their things away safely now that sniffer was about and the gypsy camp near they didnt feel it was terribly safe to leave anything unguarded or unhidden scoot off now sniffer said julian and no spying on us mind timmy will know immediately you arrive anywhere near and come hunting for you if you want to see us give a whistle when you get near no creeping or slipping into the quarry understand yes said sniffer standing up he took the hanky from his pocket again waved it at george and disappeared with liz at his heels im just going to see exactly how near to the gypsy camp we are julian said he walked to the entrance of the quarry and up on to the moor he looked in the direction that sniffer had gone yes there was the hill in the shelter of which the gypsies had their caravans it wasnt more than a quarter of a mile away blow still it was far enough for the gypsies not to discover them unless by chance or unless sniffer gives the game away thought julian well well spend the night here anyway and we can move off somewhere else tomorrow if we feel like it they felt rather energetic that evening and played a ball game in the quarry in which timmy joined wholeheartedly but as he always got the ball before anyone else did they had to tie him up in order to get a game themselves timmy was very cross he turned his back on them and sulked he looks like you now george said dick grinning and got the ball bang on the side of his head from an angry george nobody wanted much supper julian took a little aluminium jug to the spring and filled it once for everyone it really was lovely water from that bubbling spring i wonder how henrys getting on said anne spoilt to bits by her greataunts i expect didnt she look odd in proper clothes gloves and all yes she ought to have been a boy said dick like you george he added hastily both of you are real sports plucky as anything how do you know henrys plucky said george scornfully only by her silly tales i bet theyre all madeup and exaggerated julian changed the subject shall we want rugs tonight do you think he said rather it may be warm now and the sand is hot with the sun but it wont be quite so nice when its gone down said anne anyway we can always creep into one of those cosy little caves if we feel chilly theyre as warm as toast i went into one so i know they settled down quite early to sleep the boys took one side of the quarry the girls the other tim as usual was on georges feet much to annes discomfort hes on mine too she complained to george hes so long he stretches over my feet as well move him george so george moved him but as soon as anne was asleep he stretched out again and lay on both girls legs he slept with one ear open he heard a scurrying hedgehog he heard all the rabbits out for a nighttime game he heard the frogs in a faroff pool croaking in the night his sharp ear even heard the tinkle of the little spring outside the pit nobody moved in the quarry there was a small moon but it gave very little light the stars that studded the sky seemed to give more light than the moon timmys one open ear suddenly pricked itself right up then the other ear stood up too timmy was still asleep but his ears were both listening very hard a low humming sound came slowly over the night it came nearer and nearer timmy awoke properly and sat up listening his eyes wide open now the sound was now very loud indeed dick awoke and listened what was that noise an aeroplane it must be jolly low surely it wasnt about to land on the moor in the dark he woke julian and they both got up and went out of the quarry its an aeroplane all right said dick in a low voice whats it doing it doesnt seem to be going to land its gone round in a low circle two or three times is it in trouble do you think asked julian here it comes again look whats that light over there suddenly said dick pointing to the east see that sort of glow its not very far from the gypsies camp i dont know said julian puzzled its not a fire is it we cant see any flames and it doesnt seem to flicker like a fire would i think it may be some sort of guide to that plane said dick it seems to be circling round and about over the glow lets watch it they watched it yes it did seem to be circling round the glow whatever it was and then quite suddenly it rose in the air circled round once more and made off to the east there it goes said dick straining his eyes i cant tell what kind it is except that its very small what can it have been doing said julian puzzled i thought the glow might have been to guide it in landing though where it could land here in safety i simply dont know but it didnt land at all it just circled and made off where would it have come from said dick from the coast i suppose from over the sea do you think i simply dont know said julian it beats me and why should the gypsies have anything to do with it gypsies and planes dont seem to mix somehow well we dont know that they do have anything to do with the plane except that we saw that glow said dick and thats going now look even as they watched the bright glow died completely away now the moor lay in darkness again funny said julian scratching his head i cant make it out its true that the gypsies may be up to something the way they come out here secretly apparently for no purpose at all and also they dont want us snooping round thats clear i think wed better try and find out what that glow is said dick we could have a bit of a snoop tomorrow or perhaps sniffer could tell us he might said julian well try him come on lets get back into the quarry its cold out here the quarry struck quite warm to them as they went down into it the girls were sound asleep still timmy who had been with them did not wake them he had been as puzzled as julian and dick over the lowflying plane but he had not barked at all julian had been glad about that timmys bark might have carried right over to the gypsy camp and warned it that someone was camping near they got back under their rug keeping close to one another for warmth but they soon lost their shivers and dick threw off his share of the rug in a few minutes they were asleep timmy awoke first and stretched himself out in the warm morning sunshine anne sat up with a little scream oh timmy dont you nearly squashed me to bits do that to george if you must stretch yourself all over somebody the boys awoke then and went to the spring to splash their faces and bring back a jugful of water to drink anne got the breakfast and over it the boys told the girls of the aeroplane in the night how queer said anne and that glow too it must have been a guide of some sort to the plane lets go and see where it was it must have been a fire of some kind right said dick i vote we go this morning but well take tim with us in case we meet those gypsies chapter fourteen the gypsies are not pleased julian and dick went to stand where they had stood the night before trying to see exactly in what direction the glow had been i think it was beyond the gypsies camp to the left said julian what do you think dick yes thats about it said dick shall we go now he raised his voice were going george and anne are you coming we can leave our stuff here tucked away in the caves because we shant be very long george called back julian i think timmys got a thorn in his foot or something hes limping anne and i think well stay here with him and try to get it out you go but for goodness sake dont get into trouble with the gypsies we shant said julian weve as much right on this moor as they have and they know it all right well leave you two here then with timmy sure you dont want any help with his paw oh no said george i can manage thank you the two boys went off leaving anne and george fussing over timmys paw he had leapt into a gorse bush after a rabbit and a thorn had gone right into his left forepaw then it had broken off leaving the point in poor timmys pad no wonder he limped george was going to have quite a time trying to ease out the bit of thorn julian and dick set off over the moor it was a day like summer far too warm for april there was not a single cloud to be seen in the sky which was as blue as forgetmenots the boys felt too hot in their pullovers and longed to take them off but that would mean carrying them which would be an awful nuisance the gypsy camp was not really far away they soon came near to the curious hill that stood up from the flatness of the moor the caravans still stood in its shelter and the boys saw that a little group of men were sitting together talking earnestly i bet theyre having a jaw about that aeroplane last night said dick and i bet it was they who set that light or fire or whatever it was to guide it i wonder why it didnt land they kept in the shelter of big gorse bushes as they skirted the camp they were not particularly anxious to be seen the dogs sitting round the group of men apparently did not see or hear them which was lucky the boys made their way towards the place where they thought they had seen the glow some way to the left of the camp and beyond it doesnt seem to be anything out of the ordinary anywhere said julian stopping and looking round i was expecting to see a big burnt patch or something wait whats in that dip over there said dict pointing to where the ground seemed to dip downwards it looks like another old quarry rather like the one were camping in but smaller much smaller i bet thats where the fire was they made their way to the quarry it was much more overgrown than theirs was and was evidently one that had been worked at an earlier time it dipped down to quite a pit in the middle and set there was something unusual what was it the boys scrambled down into the pitlike quarry and made their way to the middle they stared at the big thing that was set there pointing to the sky its a lamp a powerful lamp of some kind said dick like those we see making a flarepath at an aerodrome guiding planes in to land fancy seeing one here how did the gypsies get it wondered dick puzzled and why signal to a plane that doesnt land it looked as if it wanted to circling round low like that maybe the gypsies signalled that it wasnt safe to land for some reason said julian or perhaps they were going to give something to the pilot and it wasnt ready well its a puzzle said dick i cant imagine whats going on something is thats certain lets snoop round a bit they found nothing else except a trail that led to the lamp and back just as they were examining it a shout came to their ears they swung round and saw the figure of a gypsy at the edge of the pit what are you doing here he shouted in a harsh voice he was joined by a few others and they all looked threateningly at julian and dick as they climbed out of the pit julian decided to be honest were camping out on the moor for a night or two he said and we heard a plane last night circling low we also saw a glow that appeared to be guiding it and we came along to see what it was did you hear the plane mebbe we did and mebbe we didnt said the nearest gypsy who was sniffers father what of it planes fly over this moor any day we found that powerful lamp said dick pointing back at it do you know anything about that nothing said the gypsy scowling what lamp well as far as i can see theres no charge for looking at it said julian go and have a squint if you dont know anything about it but i cant believe that you didnt see the light it gave last night its a jolly good place to hide it i must say we dont know anything about any lamp said another gypsy the old one with grey hair this is our usual campingplace we dont interfere with anything or anybody unless they interfere with us then we make them sorry for it the boys at once thought of the longago mystery of the disappearance of the bartles they felt quite uncomfortable well were going now so dont worry said julian were only camping for a night or two as i said we wont come near here again if you object to us he saw sniffer creeping up behind the men with iiz who for some reason of her own was walking sedately on her hindlegs sniffer pulled at his fathers arm theyre all right he said you know our clip got his leg made better at the stables theyre all right all he got was a savage cuff that sent him to the ground where he rolled over and over liz dropped down on all fours and went to lick him here i say said julian shocked leave that kid alone youve no right to hit him like that sniffer set up such a yelling that some of the women left the caravans not far off and came running to see what was up one of them began to shout at sniffers father and he shouted back soon there was quite a row going on between the men and the angry women one of whom had picked up poor sniffer and was dabbing his head with a wet cloth come on its a good time to go said julian to dick what an unfriendly lot they are except poor sniffer and he was doing his best for us poor kid the two boys went off quickly glad to be away from the men and their dogs they were puzzled about everything the men said they knew nothing about the lamp but they must know something about it nobody but a gypsy could have lighted it last night they went back to the girls and told them what had happened lets get back to the stables said anne theres something queer going on well be in the middle of an adventure before we know where we are well stay one more night said julian i want to see if that plane comes again those gypsies dont know where were camping and though sniffer knows im pretty sure he wont tell it was plucky of him to try and stick up for us to his father all right well stay said george im not particularly anxious for timmy to have that long walk home today i think ive got most of that thorn out of his pad but he still wont put his foot to the ground hes jolly clever at running about on three legs said dick watching timmy tearing round the quarry sniffing as usual for rabbits the amount of quarrying that timmy has done in this pit already is colossal said julian staring round at the places where timmy had tried to get in at some rabbithole and scrabbled out big heaps of sand he would have been a great help to the bartles when they dug out sand poor old tim your bad foot has stopped you scraping for rabbits hasnt it timmy ran over on three legs he enjoyed all the fussing he got when anything happened to him he meant to make the most of his bad foot they had a very lazy day indeed it really was too hot to do anything much they went to the little spring and sat with their feet in the rivulet it made it was deliciously cool they went and had a look at the old engine again lying on its side halfburied dick scraped away a lot of the sand that had seeped into the cab soon they were all helping they uncovered the old handles and levers and tried to move them but they couldnt of course lets go round to the other side of the gorse bush and see if we can see the funnel again said dick at last blow these thorns im getting pricked all over timmys very sensible sitting there not attempting to examine this old puffing billy they had to cut away some of the gorse before they could examine the funnel properly then they exclaimed in wonder look its very like the long funnel that puffing billy had you know one of the first engines ever made its filled with sand said dick and tried to scrape it out it was fairly loose and soon he was able to peer down the funnel quite a long way funny to think of smoke puffing out of this queer old funnel said dick poor old engine lying here for years quite forgotten id have thought someone would rescue it well you know what the blacksmith told us said george the bartle sister that was left wouldnt have anything more to do with the railway or the engine or the quarry and certainly nobody could move this great thing on their own i shouldnt be surprised if were the only people in the world who know where the old engine is said anne its so overgrown that nobody could see it except by accident i feel jolly hungry all of a sudden said dick stopping his work of getting sand off the engine what about something to eat weve got enough to last for a day or two more said anne then well have to get something else or go back to the stables i must spend one more night here said julian i want to see if that plane returns again right well all watch this time said george it will be fun come on lets go and get something to eat dont you think thats a good idea timmy timmy certainly did he limped off at top speed on three legs though really his right forepaw no longer hurt him timmy youre a fraud chapter fifteen a startling night no gypsies came near them that day not even sniffer the evening was as lovely as the day had been and almost as warm its extraordinary said dick looking up into the sky what weather for april the bluebells will be rushing out soon if the sun goes on being as hot as this they lay on the sand in the quarry and watched the evening star shine in the sky it looked very big and bright and round timmy scrabbled round in the sand his paw is much better said george though i notice that he still sometimes holds it up only when he wants you to say poor timmy does it hurt said dick hes a baby likes to be fussed they talked for a while and then anne yawned its early i know but i believe im going to sleep there was soon a trek to the spring and everyone sluiced themselves in the cool water there was only one towel between them but that did very well then they settled down in their sandy beds the sand was beautifully warm and they did not bother about putting down the rubber sheets there could not possibly be any dampness in that quarry after it had been baked so much by the hot sun i hope we wake when that plane comes if it does come said julian to dick as they lay without any covering in their soft sandy bed my goodness isnt it hot no wonder timmys panting over there they went to sleep at last but dick awoke suddenly feeling much too hot phew what a night he lay looking up at the brilliant stars and then shut his eyes again but it was no use he couldnt go to sleep he sat up cautiously so as not to awake julian i think ill just go and have a squint to see if that big lamp is lighted again down in that pit by the gypsy camp he thought he went to the edge of the quarry and climbed up he looked towards the gypsy camp and gave a sudden exclamation yes he thought its glowing again i cant see the lamp of course but its light is so jolly powerful that i can easily see the glow it makes it must be very bright looked down on from the sky i wonder if the plane is due to come now that the lamp is lighted he listened and yes he could distinctly hear a low humming noise from the east it must be the plane coming again would it land this time and if so who was in it he ran to wake julian and the girls timmy was alert at once wagging his tail excitedly he was always ready for anything even in the middle of the night anne and george got up too very thrilled is the lamp really alight again and i can hear the plane too now oh i say this is exciting george timmy wont bark and give us away will he no ive told him to be quiet said george he wont make a sound listen the plane is coming nearer the noise was now loud enough for them to search the starry sky for the plane julian gave dick a nudge look you can just see it straight over where the gypsy camp is dick managed to pick it out its very small he said smaller even than i thought it was last night look its coming down but it wasnt it merely swept low and then went round in a circle as it had done the night before it rose a little again and then came in low once more almost over the boys heads then something extraordinary happened something fell not far from julian something that bounced and then came to rest it made a thud as it fell and all four jumped timmy gave a startled whine thud something else fell thud thud thud anne gave a squeal are they trying to bomb us or something julian what are they doing thud thud julian ducked at the last two thuds they sounded so near he took hold of anne and pulled her down into the quarry calling to dick and george get down here quickly force yourselves into the caves somewhere we shall get hit they ran across the quarry as the plane swooped round in a circle once more and then again began dropping the things that went thud thud some even fell into the quarry this time timmy got the shock of his life when one bounced in front of his nose and rolled away he yelped and tore after george soon they were all safely squeezed into the little caves that lined the sides of the quarry the plane swept round once more up and then round and the thudthudding began again the four could hear that some of the thuds were actually in the quarry again and they were thankful they were well sheltered well nothing is exploding said dick thankfully but what on earth is the plane dropping and why this is a most peculiar adventure to have its probably a dream said julian and laughed no not even a dream could be so mad here we are snuggling into sandy caves in a quarry on mystery moor while a plane drops something all round us in the middle of the night quite mad i believe the planes going away now said dick its circled round but hasnt dropped anything now its climbing its going away the engine doesnt sound nearly so loud goodness when we were standing out there at the edge of the quarry i almost thought the plane would take my head off it was so low i thought that too said anne very glad that there was to be no more swooping down and dropping dozens of unknown things is it safe to go out oh yes said julian scrambling out of the sand come on we shall easily hear if the plane comes back again i want to see what it has dropped in great excitement they ran to get the parcels the stars gave so much light on that clear night that the four did not even need a torch julian picked up something first it was a firm flattish parcel done up well sewn into a canvas covering he examined it no name nothing he said this is most exciting lets have three guesses whats inside bacon for breakfast i hope said anne at once idiot said julian getting out a knife to slit the string threads that sewed up the canvas i guess its smuggled goods of some sort thats what that plane was doing i should think flying over from france and dropping smuggled goods in a prearranged place and i suppose the gypsies pick them up and take them away well hidden in their caravans to deliver them somewhere very clever oh julian is that the explanation said anne what would be in the parcels then cigarettes no said julian the parcels wouldnt be so heavy if they only contained cigarettes there ive slit the threads at last the others crowded round to see george took her torch out of her pocket so that they could see really well she flashed it on julian ripped off the canvas covering next came some strong brown paper he ripped that off too then came strong cardboard tied round with string that was undone as well and the cardboard fell to the ground now what have we got said julian excited thin sheets of paper dozens and dozens of them packed together shine your torch nearer george there was a silence as all the four craned over julians hands whew i say gosh do you see what they are said julian in awe american money dollar notes but look what they are one hundreddollar notes and my word there are scores and scores of them in this one packet the four stared in amazement as julian riffled through the packet of notes however much would they be worth julian how much is a hundreddollar note worth in our money asked george about forty pounds i think said julian yes just about that gosh and there are scores in this one packet and we know they dropped dozens of the packets too whatever is it all about well there must be thousands and thousands of dollars lying around us here in the quarry and outside it said george i say surely this isnt a dream well i must say its a very extravagant kind of dream if so said dick a dream worth thousands of pounds isnt very usual ju hadnt we better get busy picking up these parcels yes we certainly had said julian im beginning to see it all now the smugglers come over in a plane from france say having previously arranged to drop these packets in a lonely spot on this moor the gypsies are in the plot to the extent that they light the guiding lamp and pick up the parcels i see and then they quietly pack them into their caravans slip off the moor and deliver them to somebody else who pays them well for their trouble said dick very smart thats about it said julian but i cant for the life of me see why dollar notes have to be smuggled here they can be brought freely enough into the country why smuggle them stolen ones perhaps said george oh well its quite beyond me what a thing to do no wonder the gypsies didnt want us around better buck up and collect all these parcels and clear off back to the stables with them said julian picking up one near him the gypsies will be after them theres no doubt about that we must be gone before they come the four of them went about looking for the parcels they found about sixty of them and they made quite a heavy load well put them somewhere safe i think said julian what about stuffing them into one of the sandcaves i dont very well see how we can carry them like this we could put them in the rugs and tie up the ends and carry them like that said george it would be mad to leave them hidden somewhere in this quarry its the first place the gypsies would search all right well follow your idea said julian i think weve about collected all the packets there are get the rugs georges idea proved to be a good one half the parcels were rolled into one rug and tied up and half into the other good thing the rugs are nice and big said dick tying his up strongly now i can just about manage mine nicely on my back you all right ju yes come along you girls said julian follow behind us well go down the railway line leave everything else here we can easily get it another time we must leave before the gypsies come timmy began to bark suddenly that must mean the gypsies are coming said dick come on quick yes i can hear their voices for goodness sake hurry chapter sixteen the terrible mist yes the gypsies were certainly coming their dogs were with them barking the four children hurried out of the quarry with timmy at their heels quite silent those fellows may not know we were camping in the quarry panted dick they may just be coming to find the parcels and while they are hunting around we may be able to get a good start buck up they set off to where the lines ended near where the old engine lay halfburied the gypsy dogs heard them and set up a yelping and howling the gypsies stopped to see what had excited them they spied shadows moving in the distance the four children slipping away from the quarry one of the men shouted loudly hey you stop who are you stop i say but the five didnt stop they were now stumbling between the railway lines glad of georges torch and annes the boys could not have held one for it was all they could do to hang on to the heavyladen rugs quick oh quick whispered anne but it was impossible to go very quickly they must be catching us up said julian suddenly look round and see george george looked round no i cant see anyone she said julian everywhere looks peculiar whats happening julian stop something queer is happening julian stopped and looked round his eyes had been fixed on his feet trying to see where he was going without stumbling anne had shone her torch down for him but it was still dificult to get along properly julian gazed all round wondering what george meant then he gave a gasp gosh how queer theres a mist come up look its even blotted out the stars no wonder it seems so jolly dark all of a sudden a mist said anne scared not that awful mist that sometimes covers the moor oh julian is it julian and dick watched the swirling mist in astonishment its come from the sea julian said cant you smell the salt in it its come just as suddenly as weve been told it comes and look its getting thicker every minute what a good thing were on the railway lines said george what shall we do go on julian stood and thought the gypsies wont come after us in this mist he said ive a good mind to hide this money somewhere and then walk back to get the police if we keep on the lines we cant go wrong but we must be sure not to leave them or well be completely lost yes lets do that said dick who was heartily sick already of lugging along his heavy load but where do you propose to hide them ju not in the quarry wed have to walk through this awful mist to do that and wed get lost at once no ive thought of a fine place said julian and he lowered his voice remember that old engine fallen on its side well what about stuffing these packets all the way down that great long funnel and then stopping the top of it up with sand i bet you anything you like that nobody would find the packets there grand idea said dick the gypsies will be sure weve gone off carrying the money and theyll not hunt about for it long once they find the dropped packets are all gone well be halfway home by the time they try to catch us if they dare to brave this mist anne and george thought julians idea was firstrate a stroke of genius id never never have thought of the engine funnel said anne now theres no need for you two girls and timmy to walk all the way to the engine with us said julian you sit down here on the lines and wait for us to come back we shant be long well walk straight up the railway find the engine pack the money into the funnel and walk back right said george squatting down bring the rugs back with you though its cold now julian and dick went off together with annes torch george kept hers timmy pressed close against her astonished at the thick mist that had so suddenly swirled up and around them thats right keep close to us and keep us warm tim said george its jolly cold now this mist is damp julian stumbled along keeping a lookout for the gypsies he could see nothing of them but then if they had been only two feet away he could not have seen anything of them in the mist it seemed to get thicker and thicker i know what old ben meant now when he said that it had damp fingers thought julian feeling little touches like fingers on his face hands and legs as the mist wreathed itself round him dick nudged him here we are he said the lines are broken here the engine should be just over there a yard or two away they stepped cautiously away from the lines the big gorsebush could not be seen but it could be felt julian felt thorns pricking his legs and knew he was beside it shine your torch here dick he whispered thats right theres the cab of the engine see now lets circle the bush and well come to the funnel here it is said dick in a few moments look now then lets do a bit of work shoving these packets down gosh what a lot of them there are i hope the funnel will take them all they spent ten minutes ramming the packets into the wide funnel down they went to the bottom more and more followed and then at last the final one was shoved in and rammed down thats the lot said dick relieved now well pack some sand in gosh isnt this bush full of prickles its really spiteful the packets almost fill the funnel said julian hardly any room for sand still we can put in enough to hide the money all right there thats done now pull this gorsebranch over the top of the funnel my word i never knew a bush so set with spines im scratched to bits can you hear anything of the gypsies asked dick in a low voice as they prepared to go back to the lines they listened not a thing said julian its my belief theyre scared of this mist and are lying low till it clears they may be in the quarry said dick waiting there in safety well long may they be there they wont get the money now come on said julian and walked round the bush its just about here that we step out to get to the lines take my arm we mustnt get separated did you ever see such a mist in your life its the thickest fog i ever knew we cant even see our feet in the light of the torch now they took a few steps and then felt about for the rails they couldnt feel even one a bit farther i think said julian no this way but they still couldnt find the railway lines where were the wretched things a small feeling of panic came into julians mind which way should they step now to find the rails how had they gone wrong now both boys were on hands and knees feeling for the broken rails ive got one said dick no blow it isnt its a bit of wood or something for goodness sake keep close to me ju after ten minutes search the two boys sat back on their heels the little torch between them somehow weve just missed those two or three correct steps from the gorsebush to the rails said julian now were done i dont see anything for it but to wait till the mist clears but what about the two girls said dick anxiously lets try a bit longer look the mist is clearing a little there lets go forward and hope well stumble over the lines soon if the mist does clear we shall soon be able to get our bearings so they went forward hopefully seeing the mist clear a little in front of them so that the torch made a longer beam for them to see by now and again when their feet knocked against something hard they felt for the rails but they could not find even one lets shout said julian at last so they shouted loudly george anne can you hear us they stood and listened no answer george yelled dick timmy they thought they heard a faroff bark that was timmy said julian over there they stumbled along and then shouted again but this time there was no bark at all not a sound came out of that dreadful mist which had now closed tightly round them again well be walking in it all night long said julian desperately why did we leave the girls suppose this frightful fog doesnt clear by tomorrow sometimes it lasts for days what a horrible idea said dick lightly sounding much more cheerful than he felt i dont think we need worry about the girls ju timmys with them and he can easily take them back to the stables across the moor in the mist dogs dont mind fogs julian felt most relieved he hadnt thought of that oh yes id forgotten old tim he said well seeing that the girls will probably be all right with timmy to guide them lets sit down somewhere and have a rest im tired out heres a good thick bush said dick lets get into the middle of it if we can and keep the damp out of us thank goodness its not a gorsebush i wish i knew if the girls had had the sense not to wait for us any longer but to try to find their way back down the lines said julian i wonder where they are now anne and george were no longer where julian and dick had left them they had waited and waited and then had become very anxious indeed somethings happened said george i think we ought to go and get help anne we can easily follow the railway down to where we have to break off for the stable timmy will know anyway dont you think we ought to go back and get help yes i do said anne getting up come on george gosh this mist is worse than ever well have to be careful we dont lose the lines even timmy might find it hard to smell his way in this fog they got up anne followed george and timmy followed behind looking puzzled he couldnt understand this nighttime wandering about at all anne and george kept closely to the railway lines walking slowly along shining the light of the torch downwards and following carefully after a time george stopped puzzled this lines broken here she said theres no more of it thats funny i dont remember it being as badly broken as this the lines simply stop i cant see any more oh george said anne peering down do you know what weve done weve come all the way up the lines again instead of going down them homewards how could we have been so mad look this is where they break off so the old engine must be somewhere near and the quarry blow said george quite in despair what asses we are it shows how we can lose our sense of direction in a mist like this i cant see or hear anything of the boys said anne fearfully george lets go to the quarry and wait there till daylight comes im cold and tired we can squeeze into one of those warm sandcaves all right said george very much down in the dumps come along and for goodness sake dont lets lose our way to the quarry chapter seventeen prisoners together the two girls and timmy made their way carefully hoping to come across the lines that led to the quarry they were lucky they went across the gap in the lines where once long ago the gypsies had wrenched out the rails and came to where they began again and led to the edge of the quarry here they are said george thankfully now were all right weve only just got to follow these and well be in the quarry i hope it will be warmer than here brrrr this mist is terribly cold and clammy it came up so suddenly said anne shining her torch downwards i couldnt believe my eyes when i looked round and saw it creeping up on us i she stopped suddenly timmy had given a low growl whats up tim whispered george he stood quite still his hackles up and his tail motionless he looked steadfastly into the mist oh dear what can be the matter now whispered anne i cant hear a thing can you they listened no there was nothing to hear at all they went on into the quarry thinking that timmy might have heard a rabbit or hedgehog and growled at it as he sometimes did timmy heard a sound and ran to the side lost in the mist at once he suddenly yelped loudly then there was a heavy thud and no more sound from timmy timmy whats happened timmy come here shouted george at the top of her voice but no timmy came the girls heard the sound of something heavy being dragged away and george ran after the sound timmy oh timmy whats happened she cried where are you are you hurt the mist swirled round and she tried to beat against it with her fists angry that she could not see tim tim then a pair of hands took her arms from behind and a voice said now you come with me you were warned not to snoop about on the moor george struggled violently less concerned for herself than for timmy wheres my dog she cried what have you done to him i knocked him on the head said the voice which sounded very like sniffers father hes all right but he wont feel himself for a bit you can have him back if youre sensible george wasnt sensible she kicked and fought and wriggled and struggled it was no use she was held in a grip like iron she heard anne scream once and knew that she had been caught too when george was too tired to struggle any more she was led firmly out of the quarry with anne wheres my dog she sobbed what have you done with him hes all right said the man behind her but if you make any more fuss ill give him another blow on the head now will you be quiet george was quiet at once she was taken with anne across the moor for what seemed like miles but was really only the fairly short distance between the quarry and the gypsies camp are you bringing my dog asked george unable to contain her fears about timmy yes somebodys got him said her captor you shall have him back safe and sound if you do what youre told george had to be content with that what a night the boys gone timmy hurt she and anne captured and this horrible wreathing mist all the time the mist cleared a little as they came near to the gypsy camp the hill behind seemed to keep it off george and anne saw the light of a fire and of a few lanterns here and there more men were gathered together waiting anne thought she could see sniffer and liz in the background but she couldnt be sure if only i could get hold of sniffer she thought he would soon find out if timmy is really hurt oh sniffer do come nearer if its you their captors took them to the little fire and made both girls sit down one of the men there exclaimed in surprise but these are not those two boys this is a boy and a girl not as tall as the others were were two girls said anne thinking that the men might treat george less roughly if they knew she was not a boy im a girl and so is she she got a scowl from george but took no notice this was not the time to pretend anything these men were ruthless and very angry they thought their plans had gone wrong all because of two boys perhaps when they found they had got two girls they would let them go the men began to question them where are the boys then weve no idea lost in the mist said anne we all went out to go back home and got separated so george i mean georgina and i went back to the quarry did you hear the plane of course did you see or hear it dropping anything we didnt see anything drop we heard it said anne george stared at her furiously why was anne giving all this away perhaps she thought that timmy would be given back to them if they proved helpful george immediately changed her mind about feeling cross with anne if only timmy were all right did you pick up what the plane dropped the man rapped out the question so sharply that anne humped what should she say oh yes she heard herself saying we picked up a few queer parcels what was in them do you know never you mind said the man what did you do with the parcels george stared at anne wondering what she was going to say surely surely she wouldnt give that secret away i didnt do anything with them said anne in an innocent voice the boys said they would hide them so they went off into the mist with them but they didnt come back so george and i went to the quarry again thats when you caught us the men talked among themselves in low voices then sniffers father turned to the girls again where did the boys hide these packets how do i know said anne i didnt go with them i didnt see what they did with them do you think they will still have got them with them asked the man why dont you go and find the boys and ask them said anne i havent seen or heard of the boys since they left us and went into the mist i dont know what became of them or the parcels theyre probably lost somewhere on the moors said the old greyhaired gypsy with the packets well look for the boys tomorrow they wont get home in this well fetch them back here they wouldnt come said george as soon as they saw you theyd run youd never catch them any way theyd get back home as soon as the mist cleared take these girls away said the old gypsy sounding tired of them put them in the far cave and tie them up wheres my dog shouted george suddenly you bring me my dog you havent been very helpful said the old gypsy well question you again tomorrow and if you are more helpful you shall have your dog two men took the girls away from the fire and over to the hill a large opening led into the queer hill one of the men had a lantern and led the way the other man walking behind a passage led straight into the hill there was sand underfoot and it seemed to anne as if even the walls were made of sand how strange the hill was honeycombed with passages they crisscrossed and forked like burrows in a rabbitwarren anne wondered however the men could find their way they came at last to a cave that must have been right in the heart of the hill a cave with a sandy floor and a post that was driven deeply into the ground ropes were fastened firmly to it the two girls looked at them in dismay surely they were not going to be tied up like prisoners but they were the ropes were fastened firmly round their waists and knotted at the back the knots were gypsy knots firm tight and complicated it would take the girls hours to unpick those even supposing they could manage to reach right round to their backs there you are said the men grinning at the two angry girls maybe in the morning you will remember where those packets were put you go and get my dog ordered george but they only laughed loudly and went out of the cave it was stuffy and hot in there george was worried to death about timmy but anne was almost too tired to think she fell asleep sitting up uncomfortably with the ropes round her waist and the knots digging into her back george sat brooding timmy where was he was he badly hurt george was very miserable indeed she didnt go to sleep she sat there worrying wide awake she made an attempt to get at the knots behind her but it was no use she couldnt suddenly she thought she heard a noise was that someone creeping up the passage to the cave she felt frightened oh if only timmy were here sniff sniff gracious goodness it must be sniffer thought george and at that moment she almost loved the dirty little gypsy boy sniffer she called quietly and put on her torch sniffers head appeared and then his body he was crawling quietly up the passage on all fours he came right into the cave and stared at her and the sleeping anne ive sometimes been tied up here too he said sniffer how is timmy asked george anxiously tell me quickly hes all right said sniffer hes just got a bad cut on his head i bathed it for him hes tied up too and hes mad about it sniffer listen go and get timmy and bring him to me said george breathlessly and bring me a knife too to cut these ropes will you can you oooh i dunno said sniffer looking frightened my father would half kill me sniffer is there anything you want anything youve always wanted said george ill give it to you if you do this for me i promise you i want a bike said sniffer surprisingly and i want to live in a house and ride my bike to school ill see that you have what you want sniffer said george wildly only do do go and get timmy and a knife you got here without being seen you can surely get back again safely with timmy think of that bike sniffer thought of it then he nodded and disappeared down the passage as silently as he had come george waited and waited would he bring dear old timmy to her or would he be caught chapter eighteen georges trick george sat in the darkness of the cave hearing annes peaceful breathing nearby waiting for sniffer to come back she was longing to see timmy again was the cut on his head very bad a thought came into her mind she would send timmy back to the stables with a note he was very clever he knew what to do when he had a note tied to his collar then help would come very quickly indeed timmy would know his way all right out of this hill once he had been in it ah here was sniffer coming back again was timmy with him she heard sniffers sniffsniffsniff but no sound of timmy her heart sank sniffer appeared cautiously in the cave i didnt dare to take timmy he said my father has him tied up too near to him and id have waked him but ive brought you a knife look thank you sniffer said george taking the knife and putting it into her pocket listen theres something important im going to do and youve got to help im scared said sniffer im real scared think of that bicycle said george a red one perhaps with silver handles sniffer thought of it all right he said what are you going to do im going to write a note said george feeling in her pocket for her notebook and pencil and i want you to tie it on to timmys collar under his chin and set him free somehow will you do that hell run off back to the stables with the note and then anne and i will be rescued and you will get the most beautiful bicycle in the world and a house to live in said sniffer at once sos i can ride my bike to school all right said george hoping that somehow he could have that too now wait a minute she scribbled the note but she had hardly written more than a few words when a sound came up the passage someone was coughing its my father said sniffer in fright listen if you cut your ropes and escape can you find your way out from here its very twisty and turny i dont know i dont think i can whispered george in a panic ill leave patrins for you said sniffer look out for them now im going to slip into the cave next door and wait till my fathers finished talking to you then ill go back to timmy he slipped out just in time the lantern shone into georges cave and sniffers father stood there have you seen sniffer he asked i missed him when i woke just now if i catch him in here ill whip him till he squeals sniffer hes not here said george trying to sound surprised look round the cave and see the man caught sight of the notebook and pencil in georges hand whats that youre writing he said suspiciously and took it from her so youre writing for help are you he said and how do you think youre going to get help id like to know whos going to take this note home for you sniffer no said george truthfully the man frowned as he looked again at the note look here he said you can write another note to those two boys and ill tell you what to say no said george oh yes you will said the man im not going to hurt those boys im just going to get back those packets from wherever they are hidden do you want your dog back safely yes said george with a gulp well if you dont write this note you wont see him again said the man now then take your pencil and write in that notebook of yours george took up her pencil this is what you must write said the man frowning as he thought hard wait a minute said george how are you going to get this note to the boys you dont know where they are you wont be able to find them if this mist still goes on the man scratched his head and thought the only way to get the note to them is to tie it on my dogs collar and send him to find them said george if you bring him here to me i can make him understand he always does what i tell him you mean hell take the note to whoever you tell him to take it said the man his eyes gleaming well write it then say this we are prisoners follow timmy and he will bring you to us and you can save us then sign your name whatever it is its georgina said george firmly you go and get my dog while i write the note the man turned and went george looked after him her eyes bright he thought he was making her play a trick on julian and dick to bring them here so that they could be threatened and questioned about the packets and where they were hidden but im going to play a trick on him thought george im going to tell timmy to take the note to henry and shell be suspicious and get captain johnson to follow tim back here and that will give the gypsies an awful shock i expect the captain will be sensible enough to get the police as well aha im playing a trick too in ten minutes time sniffers father returned with timmy it was a rather subdued timmy with a very bad cut on his head which really needed stitching he pattered soberly across to george and she flung her arms round his neck and cried into his thick hair does your head hurt you she said ill take you to the vet when i get back tim you can get back as soon as weve got those two boys here and theyve told us where those packets are hidden said the man timmy was licking george as if he would never stop and his tail waved to and fro to and fro he couldnt understand what was happening at all why was george here never mind he was with her again he settled down on the floor with a thump and put his head on her knee write the note said the man and tie it on to his collar on the top so that it can easily be seen ive written it said george the gypsy held out a dirty hand for it and read it we are prisoners follow timmy and he will bring you to us and you can save us georgina is that really your name georgina asked the man george nodded it was one of the few times she ever owned to a girls name she tied the note firmly to timmys collar on the top of his neck it was quite plainly to be seen then she gave him a hug and spoke urgently to him go to henry tim go to henry do you understand timmy dear take this note to henry she tapped the paper on his collar as he listened to her then she gave him a push go along dont stay here any longer go and find henry hadnt you better tell him the other boys name too said the man oh no i dont want to muddle timmy said george hastily henry henry henry woof said timmy and george knew that he understood she gave him another push go then she said hurry timmy gave her rather a reproachful look as if to say you havent let me stay with you very long then he padded off down the passage the note showing clearly on his collar ill bring the boys up here as soon as they come with the dog said the man and he turned on his heel and went out george wondered if sniffer was still about and she called him but there was no answer he must have slipped away down the passages back to his caravan anne woke up then and wondered where she was george switched on her torch again and explained all that had happened you should have wakened me said anne oh blow these ropes theyre so uncomfortable ive got a knife now said george sniffer gave it to me shall i cut our ropes oh yes said anne in delight but dont lets try and escape yet its still nighttime and if that mist is about well only get lost we can pretend were still tied up if anyone comes george cut her own ropes with sniffers exceedingly blunt knife then she cut annes oh what a relief to lie down properly and not to have to sit up all the time and feel the knots at the back now do remember if we hear anyone coming we must tie the ropes loosely round us she said we will stay here till we know its day and perhaps we can find out if the mist is still about or if its gone if its gone well go they fell asleep on the sandy floor both glad to lie down flat nobody came to disturb them and they slept on and on tired out where were the boys still under the bush halfsleeping halfwaking for they were cold and uncomfortable they hoped the girls were now safely at home they must have gone right down the railway and made their way back to the stables thought julian every time he awoke i do hope they are safe and timmy too thank goodness he is with them but timmy wasnt with them of course he was padding across the misty moor all by himself puzzled and with a badlyaching head why had george sent him to henry he didnt like henry he didnt think that george did either and yet she had sent him to find her very strange still george had given him his orders and he loved her and always obeyed her he padded over the heather and grass he didnt bother about keeping to the railway line he knew the way back without even thinking about it it was still night though soon the dawn would come but the mist was so thick that even the dawn would not be able to break through it the sun would have to remain hidden behind the thick swathes of mist timmy came to the stables he paused to remember which was henrys bedroom ah yes it was upstairs next to the room that anne and george had had timmy leapt into the kitchen through a window left open for the cat he padded upstairs and came to henrys room he pushed at the door and it opened in he went and put his paws on her bed woof he said in her ear woof woof woof chapter nineteen good old tim henry had been fast asleep and snoring she awoke with a tremendous jump when she felt timmys paw on her arm and heard his sharp little bark oooh what is it she said sitting up straight in bed and fumbling for her torch she was quite panicstricken she switched on the torch with trembling fingers and then saw timmy his big brown eyes looking at her beseechingly why timmy said henry in amazement timmy whatever are you doing here have the others come back no they couldnt have not in the middle of the night why have you come then timmy woof said timmy trying to make her understand that he was bringing a message henry put out her hand to pat his head and suddenly caught sight of the paper tied to his collar at the back whats this on your collar she said and reached out for it why its paper tied on too it must be a message she untied the piece of paper and unrolled it she read it we are prisoners follow timmy and he will bring you to us and you can save us georgina henry was astounded she looked at timmy and he looked back wagging his tail he pawed at her arm impatiently henry read the note again then she pinched herself to make sure she was not dreaming oooh no im awake all right she said timmy is this note true are they prisoners and who does we mean george and anne or the whole four oh timmy i do wish you could speak timmy wished the same he pawed energetically at henry she suddenly saw the cut on his head and was horrified youre hurt timmy oh you poor poor thing who did that to you you ought to have that wound seen to timmy certainly had a very outsize headache but he couldnt bother to think about that he gave a little whine and ran to the door and back yes i know you want me to follow you but ive got to think said henry if captain johnson was here id go and fetch him but hes away for the night timmy and im sure mrs johnson would have the fright of her life if i fetched her i simply dont know what to do woof said timmy scornfully its all very well to say woof like that said henry but im not as brave as you are i pretend i am timmy but im not really im afraid of following you im afraid of going to find the others i might be caught too and theres a terrible mist timmy you know henry slid out of bed and timmy looked suddenly hopeful was this silly girl going to make up her mind at last timmy theres no grownup here tonight except mrs johnson and i really cant wake her said henry shes had such a very hard busy day im going to dress and then get william hes only eleven i know but hes very sensible and hes a boy hell know what to do i only pretend to be a boy she dressed quickly in her riding things and then set off to williams room he slept by himself across the landing henry walked in and switched on her torch william awoke at once whos there he demanded sitting up at once what do you want its me henry said henry william a most extraordinary thing has happened timmy has arrived in my room with a note on his collar read it william took the note and read it he was most astonished look he said george has signed herself georgina she wouldnt do that unless things were very urgent she never never lets herself be called anything but george well have to follow tim and go at once too but i cant walk miles in a mist over the moor said henry in a panic we dont need to well saddle our horses and go on those said william beginning to dress and sounding very sensible indeed timmy will lead the way you go and get the horses out do buck up henry the others may be in danger youre acting like a henrietta that made henry cross she went out of the room at once and down into the yard what a pity captain johnson happened to be away just that night he would have decided everything at once courage came to her when she got the horses they were surprised but quite willing to go for a nighttime ride even in this thick mist william came up in a very short time with timmy behind him timmy was delighted to have william with him he liked him but he was not very fond of henry he ran forward just in front of the horses and they followed behind both henry and william had excellent torches and kept them shining downwards so that they should not miss timmy he did go out of sight once or twice but came back immediately when he heard the horses stopping over the moor they rode they didnt follow the railway of course timmy didnt need to he knew the way perfectly once he stopped and sniffed the air what had he smelt henry and william had no idea but timmy was puzzled by what he had smelt on the misty air surely he had smelt the smell of the two boys julian and dick it had come on the air for a moment or two and timmy was halfinclined to follow it and see if the smell was right then he remembered george and anne and went on through the swirling mist the boys were actually not very far away when timmy smelt them they were still in the middle of the bush trying to keep warm and sleep if only they had known that timmy was near with henry and william but they didnt timmy led the way soon they came to the quarry but did not see it because of the mist they went round it led by timmy and rode towards the gypsy camp timmy slowed down and they took warning hes getting near wherever he wants to take us whispered william had we better dismount and tie the horses up do you think their hooves may give a warning that we are near yes yes william said henry thinking that the boy was really very sensible they dismounted quietly and tied the horses to a nearby birch tree they were quite near the hill in front of which was the gypsy camp the mist was not so thick here and the two suddenly caught sight of a dark shadowy caravan outlined against a campfire left burning nearby well have to be very quiet whispered william timmys brought us to the gypsy camp on the moor i had an idea that he would the others must be held prisoner somewhere near be as quiet as you can timmy watched them dismount he hung his head panting his tail down his head was hurting him very much and he felt decidedly queer and giddy but he must get to george he must he led the way to the opening in the hill william and henry were most astonished they followed timmy through the maze of passages wondering how he knew the way so surely but timmy didnt falter he only needed to go somewhere once and after that he never forgot the way he was going very slowly now and his legs felt queer and shaky he wanted to lie down and put his aching head on his paws but no he must find george he must find george george and anne were lying in the little cave asleep they were uncomfortable and the cave was hot so they were restless waking up every few minutes but both were asleep when timmy walked slowly into the cave and flopped down beside george george awoke when she heard william and henry come into the cave she thought it might be sniffers father coming back and she hastily put the ropes round her waist so that she would look as if she were still tied up then she heard timmy panting and switched on her torch eagerly it showed her timmy and henry and william henry was full of amazement when she saw george and anne with ropes round their waists she gaped at them oh timmy darling you fetched help said george putting her arms round his neck oh henry im so glad youve come but didnt you bring captain johnson too no hes away said henry but williams here we rode and timmy guided us whatevers happened george anne awoke just then and couldnt believe her eyes when she saw the visitors there was a hasty discussion and then william spoke firmly if you want to escape youd better come now while the gypsy camp is asleep timmy can guide us out of this rabbitwarren of a hill wed never be able to find our way out alone come on come on tim said george shaking him gently but poor old timmy was feeling very peculiar he couldnt see things properly georges voice sounded blurred to him his head felt as heavy as lead and somehow his legs wouldnt carry him the blow on his head was taking real effect now and the hurried journey over the moor and back was making it worse hes ill said george in a panic he cant get up oh timmy whats the matter its that cut on his head said william its pretty bad and hes worn out with coming to fetch us and running all the way back again he cant possibly guide us back george well have to do the best we can by ourselves oh poor poor timmy said anne horrified at seeing the dog stretched out quite limp on the floor of the cave george can you carry him i think so said george and she lugged him up in her arms hes awfully heavy but i think i can just manage him perhaps the fresh air will revive him when we get outside but george we dont know our way out of here said anne fearfully if timmy cant lead us were lost wed end up by wandering miles and miles inside this hill and never getting out well well simply have to make a shot at it said william come on ill lead the way we really must go he went out of the cave and down a passage the others followed george carrying the limp timmy but very soon william came to a fork and stopped oh dear do we go to the left or the right he wondered nobody knew george shone her torch here and there trying to remember the beam of light picked up something on the ground nearby it was two sticks one short and one long in the shape of a cross george gave an exclamation look a patrin left by sniffer to show us the way out we have to take the passage that the long stick points to oh i hope that sniffer has left patrins at every corner and every fork they took the righthand way and went on their torches making long beams in the darkness and at every place where they might go wrong they saw a patrin a message left by sniffer to show them the right way to go another cross we go this way said anne heres a patrin again we take this fork said george and so it went on until they came safely to the entrance of the hill how thankful they were to see the mist at least it meant that they were in the open air now to get to the horses said william they will each have to carry two of us at once im afraid and then just as they were making their way to where they had left the horses the gypsies dogs began to bark the place down theyve heard us said william desperately buck up well be stopped if we dont get off at once then a voice shouted loudly i can see you over there with your torches stop at once do you hear me stop chapter twenty excitement in the morning the dawn was coming now the mist was no longer full of darkness but was white and thinning rapidly the four children hurried to the horses which were stamping impatiently by the trees george couldnt go very fast because of timmy he really was very heavy suddenly he began to struggle the fresh cool air had revived him and he wanted to be set down george put him down thankfully and he began to bark defiantly at the gypsies who were now coming out of their caravans their dogs with them the four children mounted hurriedly and the horses were surprised at the double weight william swung his horses head round and set off with george sitting behind him henry took anne timmy feeling much better ran after them his legs no longer feeling so shaky the gypsies ran too shaking their fists and shouting sniffers father was amazed beyond measure why there were the two girls he had tied up and that dog he had sent off to trick the other two boys on the moor then who were these on horseback and how had they found their way to the hill how had the prisoners been able to find their way out of the hill too that was a real puzzle to sniffers father the gypsies tore after the horses but the dogs contented themselves with excited barks not one of them dared to go after timmy they were afraid of him the horses went off as fast as they dared in the mist timmy running in front he seemed very much better though george was afraid it was only the excitement that now kept him going she glanced back at the gypsies they would never catch up now thank goodness somewhere behind the mist the sun was shining soon it would disperse the strange fog that had come up so suddenly from the sea she glanced down at her watch good gracious could it really be almost six oclock in the morning it was tomorrow now she wondered what had happened to julian and dick she thought of sniffer gratefully and all those patrins he had left in the hill they would never have got out but for those she thought of henry and william and gave william a sudden tight hug round the waist for coming out in the middle of the night and rescuing them where are julian and dick do you suppose she said to william do you think they are still lost on the moor ought we to shout and look for them no called back william over his shoulder were going straight back to the stables they can look after themselves dick and julian had certainly tried to look after themselves that cold misty night but not very successfully by the time that their torch showed them that it was a quarter to five by their watches they had had enough of the bush they were in if only they had known it henry and william with timmy were just then riding over the moor not a great distance from where they were they got out of the bush damp and stiff they stretched themselves and looked into the dark night still full of mist lets walk said julian i cant bear keeping still in this mist ive got my compass if we walk due west we should surely come to the edge of the moor not far from milling green they set off stumbling in the now dim light of the torch whose battery was getting low it will give out soon groaned dick giving it a shake blow the thing it hardly gives us any light now and we simply must keep looking at the compass julian tripped against something hard and almost fell he snatched the torch from dick quick let me have it he shone it on what had tripped him and gave a delighted exclamation look its a rail were on the railway line again what a bit of luck i should think so said dick relieved this torch is just about finished now for goodness sake dont lets lose this railway line stop at once if you cant feel it with your foot to think we were so jolly near the line after all and didnt know it groaned julian we could have been back at the stables ages ago i do hope the girls got back safely and didnt alarm anyone about us theyd know we would come back as soon as it was daylight anyhow if we could follow the lines they stumbled in at the stables entrance about six oclock tired out nobody was yet up it seemed they found the garden door open left ajar by william and henry and went up to the girls room hoping to find them in bed but the beds were empty of course they went to henrys room to ask her if she had heard anything of the girls but her bed though slept in was empty too they went across the landing to williams room hes gone as well said dick in great astonishment where are they all lets wake captain johnson said julian who had no idea that the captain was away for the night so they awakened a very startled mrs johnson and almost scared the life out of her for she thought they were far away camping on the moor she was even more startled when she heard their tale and realized that george and anne were missing where are the girls then she said flinging on a dressinggown this is serious julian they might be completely lost on the moor or those gypsies might have got them i must telephone my husband and the police too oh dear oh dear why did i ever let you go camping out she was in the middle of telephoning with julian and dick beside her looking very anxious indeed when the sound of horses hooves came in the yard below now goodness me whos that said mrs johnson horses whos riding them at this time of the morning they all went to the window and looked down into the yard dick gave a yell that almost made mrs johnson fall out of the window anne george look there they are and timmy too and gosh theres henry and william what is all this anne heard the yell and looked up tired as she was she gave a cheerful wave and a grin george gave a shout oh julian oh dick youre back then we did hope you would be after you left us we went back up the lines the wrong way and arrived at the quarry again and the gypsies took us prisoners yelled anne but but how do henry and william come into this said poor mrs johnson thinking she must really still be asleep and whats the matter with timmy timmy had suddenly flopped on the ground the excitement was over they were home now he could put his poor aching head on his paws and sleep george was off her horse immediately timmy darling timmy brave timmy help me william ill take him upstairs to my room and see to that cut by this time all the other children were awake and there was such a pandemonium going on that mrs johnson couldnt make herself heard children in dressinggowns and without children shouting and yelling children pouring into the yard and asking questions william trying to quiet the two horses which were getting very excited at all this sudden clamour and all the cocks round about crowing their heads off what an excitement the sun suddenly shone out brilliantly and the last wisps of mist disappeared hurrah that mist has gone shouted george the suns out cheer up timmy well all be all right now timmy was halfcarried halfdragged up the stairs by william and george george and mrs johnson examined his cut head carefully and bathed it it really should have been stiched up said mrs johnson but it seems to be healing already how wicked to hit a dog like that soon there was the sound of horses hooves again in the yard and captain johnson arrived looking very anxious at almost the same moment a car slid in at the gates a police car with two policemen who had been sent to inquire about the missing girls mrs johnson had forgotten to telephone again to say they had arrived oh dear im so sorry to have bothered you said mrs johnson to the police sergeant the girls have just arrived back but i still dont know what has really happened still theyre safe so please dont bother any more wait said julian who was in the room too i think we shall need the police something very peculiar has been happening up on the moor really sir whats that said the sergeant taking out a notebook we were camping there said julian and a plane came over very low guided by a lamp set in a sandpit by the gypsies a lamp set by the gypsies said the sergeant surprised but why should they need to guide a plane i suppose it landed no it didnt said julian it came again the next night and did exactly the same thing swooping low and circling but this time it dropped packages sir oh it did did it said the sergeant more interested for the gypsies to pick up by any chance yes sir said julian but the planes aim wasnt very good and the packets fell all round us and almost hit us we ran for shelter because we didnt know if there were any explosives or not did you pick up any of the packages asked the sergeant julian nodded yes we did and i opened one what was in it paper money dollars said julian in one packet alone there were scores of notes and each note was for a hundred dollars about forty pounds a time thousands of poundsworth thrown all around us the sergeant looked at his companion ha now we know this explains a lot that has been puzzling us doesnt it wilkins wilkins the other policeman nodded grimly it certainly does so thats what happens thats how the gang get the dollars over here from that printingpress in north france just a nice little run in a plane but why do they throw the packets down for the gypsies to collect asked julian is it so that they can give them to someone else why dont they bring them openly into the country surely anyone can bring dollars here not forged ones my lad said the sergeant these will all be forged you mark my words the gang have got a headquarters near london and as soon as those packets are handed over to them by one of the gypsies they will set to work passing them off as real ones paying hotel bills with them buying all kinds of goods and paying for them in notes that arent worth a penny whew said julian i never thought of them being forged oh yes weve known of this gang for some time but all we knew was that they had a printingpress to print the notes in north france and that somehow the rest of the gang here near london received them and passed them off as real ones said the sergeant but we didnt know how they were brought here nor who took them to the gang near london but now we know all right said wilkins my word this is a pretty scoop sergeant good kids these finding out what weve been months trying to discover where are these packages said the sergeant did you hide them did the gypsies get them no we hid them said julian but i guess the gypsies will be hunting all over the place for them today so wed better get on the moors quick sergeant where did you hide them said the sergeant in a safe place i hope oh very said julian ill call my brother sergeant hell come with us hey dick come on in here and youll hear a very interesting bit of news chapter twentyone the end of the mystery mrs johnson was amazed to hear that the police wanted julian and dick to go out on the moors again but theyre tired out she said they need something to eat cant it wait im afraid not said the sergeant you neednt worry mrs johnson these boys are tough well actually i dont think that the gypsies can possibly find the packets said julian so it wouldnt matter if we had a bite to eat im ravenous all right said the big policeman putting away his notebook have a snack and well go afterwards well of course george anne and henry all wanted to go too as soon as they heard about the proposed jaunt over the moors what leave us out of that said george indignantly what a hope anne wants to come too so does henry said anne looking at george even though she didnt help to find the packages of notes of course henry must come said george at once and henry beamed george had been very struck indeed with henrys courage in coming with william to rescue her and anne and very pleased that she hadnt boasted about it but henry knew that william was the one mostly to praise and she had been unexpectedly modest about the whole affair it was quite a large party that set off after everyone had made a very good breakfast mrs johnson had set to work cooking huge platefuls of bacon and egg exclaiming every now and again when she thought of all that had happened up on the moors those gypsies and fancy that plane coming like that dropping money all over the place and the gypsies tying up anne and george in that hill i never heard anything like it in my life captain johnson went with the party too he could hardly believe the extraordinary tale that the four had to tell five with old timmy timmy now had a beautiful patch on his head and was feeling extremely important wait till liz saw that ten people set out including timmy for william had been included in the party too he tried to guess where julian had hidden the notes but he couldnt of course julian firmly refused to tell anyone he wanted it to be a real surprise they came to the quarry at last having walked all the way up the old railway line julian stood on the edge of the quarry and pointed out the gypsy camp look theyre leaving he said i bet they were afraid wed spread the news of their behaviour after the girls escaped sure enough the caravans were moving slowly away wilkins as soon as you get back give word to have every gypsy watched if he leaves the caravans said the sergeant one of them is sure to have arranged a meetingplace to give the gang the packets dropped from the plane and if we watch those caravans and every gypsy in them well soon be able to put our hands on the gang that spends the forged notes i bet its sniffers father said dick hes the ringleader anyway they watched the caravans move away one by one anne wondered about sniffer so did george what had she promised him last night if he would help them a bicycle and to live in a house so that he could ride it to school well it wasnt likely she would ever see the dirty little boy again but if she did she would certainly have to keep her word now wheres this wonderful hidingplace asked the sergeant as julian turned from watching the caravans he had tried to make out sniffer and liz but the vans were too far away follow me said julian with a sudden grin and led the way back up the lines to where they broke off the gorsebush was there and the old engine lay on its side as before almost hidden whatevers that said the sergeant surprised its the old puffing billy that used to pull the trucks of sand from the quarry said dick apparently there was a quarrel long ago between the owners of the quarry and the gypsies and the gypsies pulled up the lines and the engine ran off and fell over there its been ever since as far as i can see julian went round to the funnelend and bent back the prickly gorsebranch that hid it the sergeant looked on in surprise dick scraped the sand out of the top of the funnel and then pulled out one of the packages he had been afraid they would not be there here you are he said and tossed the packet to the sergeant there are plenty more ill come to the one we opened in a minute yes here it is the sergeant and wilkins were amazed to see the packages hauled up from such a peculiar hidingplace no wonder the gypsies hadnt found them nobody would ever have looked down the funnel of the old engine even if they had spotted it halfburied as it was the sergeant looked at the hundreddollar notes in the opened parcel and whistled my word this is it weve seen these before beautiful forgeries they are if the gang had got rid of this lot a great many people would have suffered the money is worth nothing how many packets did you say there were dozens said dick and pulled more of them out of the funnel gosh i cant reach the ones at the bottom never mind said the sergeant put some sand in to hide them and ill send a man to poke the rest out with a stick the gypsies have gone and they are the only people likely to hunt for them this is a wonderful scoop you kids have certainly put us on to something im glad said julian i say wed better collect all the things we left here yesterday hadnt we we went off in rather a hurry you see sergeant and left our things in the quarry he and george went into the quarry to collect the things they had left there timmy went with them he suddenly growled and george stopped her hand on his collar whats up tim ju there must be somebody here is it one of the gypsies do you think then timmy stopped growling and wagged his tail he dragged away from georges hand and ran over to one of the little caves in the sandy walls he looked most peculiar with the patch on his head out of the cave came liz as soon as she saw timmy she began to turn headoverheels as fast as she could timmy stared in wonder what a dog how could she turn somersaults like that sniffer called george come on out i know youre there a pale worried face looked out of the cave then sniffers thin wiry little body followed and soon he was standing in the quarry looking scared i got away from them he said nodding his head towards where the gypsy camp had been he went up to george and gave a sniff you said i could have a bike he said i know said george you shall have one sniffer if you hadnt left us patrins in that hill wed never have escaped and you said i could live in a house and ride my bike to school said sniffer urgently i cant go back to my father hed halfkill me now he saw those patrins i left in the hill and he chased me all over the moor for miles but he didnt catch me i hid well do the best we can for you promised julian sorry for this little waif sniffer sniffed wheres that hanky demanded george he pulled it out of his pocket still clean and folded he beamed at her youre quite hopeless said george listen if you want to go to school youll have to stop that awful sniff and use your hanky see sniffer nodded but put the hanky carefully back into his pocket then the sergeant came into the quarry and sniffer fled at the sight of him funny little thing said julian well i should imagine that his father will be sent to prison for his share in this affair so sniffer will be able to get his wish and leave the caravan life to live in a house we might be able to get him into a good home and i shall keep my word and take some money out of my savingsbank and buy him a bicycle said george he deserves it oh do look at liz simply adoring timmy and his patch dont look so important tim its only a patch on your cut sniffer called julian come back you neednt be afraid of this policeman he is a friend of ours hell help us to choose a bicycle for you the sergeant looked extremely surprised at this remark but at any rate it brought sniffer back at once well well go back now said the sergeant weve got what we want and wilkins has already started back to get somebody on to watching the gypsies once we find out who they have to report to about this forged money we shall feel happy i hope wilkins went along down the railway said julian its so easy to get lost on this moor yes he had the sense to do that after hearing how you got lost said the sergeant its wonderful up here isnt it so peaceful and quiet and calm yes youd never think that mysteries could happen up here would you said dick old ones and new ones well im glad we happened to be mixed up in the newest one it was quite an adventure they all went back to the stables to find that it was now almost dinnertime and that everyone had a very large appetite to match the very large dinner that mrs johnson had got ready the girls went upstairs to wash george went into henrys room henry she said thanks most awfully youre as good as a boy any day thanks george said henry surprised youre better than a boy dick was passing the door and heard all this he laughed and stuck his head in at the door i say do let me share in these compliments he said just tell me im as good as a girl will you but all he got was a wellaimed hairbrush and a shoe and he fled away laughing anne gazed out of her bedroom window over the moor it looked so peaceful and serene under the april sun no mystery about it now all the same its a good name for you said anne youre full of mystery and adventure and your last adventure waited for us to come and share it i really think id call this adventure five go to mystery moor its a good name anne well call it that too
