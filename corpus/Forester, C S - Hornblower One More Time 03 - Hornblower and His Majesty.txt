hornblower and his majesty cs forester mind you sir horatio said dr manifold i think this treatment of his majesty is unwise very unwise indeed doctor said hornblower politely at the last consultation of his majestys physicians said dr manifold those of my opinion were just outvoted but i venture to say sir horatio that although mere numbers were against me and it was only a trifling majority you must remember all that are most distinguished in the world of medical science were on my side naturally said captain hornblower in the matter of accumulated knowledge we were overwhelmingly superior but the question of his majestys health was left to a mere counting of heads mark my words sir horatio this business of voting by numbers without regard to position in the world will be the curse of humanity for centuries to come unless something is done about it that seems only too likely said hornblower one of his guiltiest secrets was the fact that he fancied himself a democrat and radical but in the exalted circles in which he moved nowadays he had little difficulty in concealing it because everyone he met took it for granted that he was the opposite a sea voyage for his majesty exclaimed dr manifold contemptuously build up his strength distract him from his troubles fiddlesticks a patient in his majestys unfortunate condition of mind should be kept low it stands to reason bleeding sir horatio some ounces twice a week a thorough course of purgatives with a low diet gentle confinement in the dark that would give his majestys unhappy brain a chance to clear itself of its humours and to start again anew with a tabula rasa a clean sheet sir there is much in what you say doctor hornblower was not lying when he said that it seemed quite a logical treatment of insanity in the year but at the same time he was moved with pity at the thought of his poor mad king exposed to that sort of brutality his instincts revolted against it and his reason told him that as the treatment had been tried unsuccessfully for two years now it might be as well to experiment with the reverse what he was more concerned with if the truth must be told was the responsibility of his own position this was his first command since his triumphant escape from captivity in france and since he had received the accolade of the bath at the hands of the prince regent the command of the royal yacht during his majestys madness might have been a sinecure had not this decision been taken to give his majesty a course of fresh air and change of scene sailing about the channel with his majesty on board while the sea swarmed with french and american privateers meant a grave responsibility for the captain for him hornblower looked round the decks of the augusta at the four stumpy sixpounders and the two long ninepounders fore and aft he would not be able to make much of a defence against one of those heavily sparred heavily gunned new england privateers dr manifold seemed to be echoing his thoughts of course he was saying there is no need for me to point out to you captain the need for the utmost precautions against any shock to his majesty you have received orders i fancy against firing any salute hornblower nodded and there must be no bustle and no excitement everything must be done more quietly than is usually the case on shipboard and you must be careful not to run into any storms i shall do my best doctor said hornblower a midshipman who had been perched up at the maintopmast crosstrees came sliding down the backstay touched his hat to the captain and moved hastily forward the crew assumed an attitude of expectancy here comes the king exclaimed dr manifold suddenly hornblower merely nodded a little group of men on foot came slowly down the slope to the jetty against which lay the augusta it was not until they were no more than yards away that hornblower blew a single short note on his whistle and woke the ship to life the side boys in spotless white gloves and frocks ran to their positions at the gilded gangplank the pipes of the boatswains mates twittered loudly the six men and the sergeant of the marine detachment appeared miraculously upon the quarterdeck pipe clay and buttons gleaming the two drummers with their sticks poised beneath their noses the crew fell in by divisions the officers in their cocked hats and silk stockings sword hilts and epaulettes shining in the sun in front of them the whole of the little ship was ready and welcoming at the moment when the party reached the shore end of the gangplank not a moment too early not a moment too late it was a neat piece of work there was a brief delay at the gangplank his majesty was reluctant to come on board hornblower saw the hesitation he saw the plump white hands cling to the handrails and saw them forced free again unobtrusively by two of the attendants there was a burly lordinwaiting immediately behind his majesty wearing a fine plumcoloured coat with a laced waistcoat in a contrasting shade crossed by the narrow ribbon of the thistle the bearer presumably of some historic name from beyond the border he closed up behind his majesty closer and closer the hands caught and clung again and again were forced free and the lordinwaitings ponderous stomach was planted firmly in his majestys back and propelled him almost unnoticeably but irresistibly along the gangplank so that his majesty arrived on the deck with just a shade of haste every officers hand came to the salute the boatswains mates set their pipes twittering loudly the drums of the marines beat a long roll up to the main truck soared the royal standard where its opulent folds flapped slowly open in the gentle wind his majesty had come aboard chickens and chimes what what said his majesty his clouded blue eyes caught sight of a seagull wheeling against the sky and followed it in its flight what what ducks and dutchmen what what what the little group of courtiers and attendants pressing along the gangplank gradually edged him further on to the deck then his wandering glance caught sight of hornblower standing at attention before him hillo said the king a kindly smile illuminated his face lessons going all right yes thank you your majesty said hornblower the king reached up and took off hornblowers cocked hat with its gold lace and buttons and with his other hand he ruffled hornblowers sparse hair dont let em beat you too hard he said what dont let em what good boys get guineas dr manifold had approached and was standing behind hornblowers shoulder the king saw him and cowered away suddenly in fear your majesty said the doctor bowing low but his humble tone and demeanour did nothing to reassure the frightened being before him the little court closed up round the king and herded him slowly away as before hornblower caught up his cocked hat from the deck where it had fallen from the kings trembling hand and turned away to his duties fore and maintopsls there he called cast off those warps mr white he felt he needed distraction after seeing the abject terror that had convulsed the face of his king at sight of the doctor who had tormented him the air of the sea would feel cleaner than that he was breathing now with the royal standard at the main and the white ensign at the peak the augusta nosed her way out of newhaven harbour to where her escort the twentygun corvette cormorant awaited her coming hornblower looking through his glass at her thought what a vivid comment it was on the strain to which the british navy was being subjected that his majesty king george iii king of great britain and ireland could be escorted to sea only by a twentygun corvette at a time when shipsoftheline and frigates flew his flag times were changing the royal standard at the main no longer sported the lilies of france they had been quietly dropped a little while ago in favour of the harp of ireland and in the past six months the british navy had suffered a succession of minor reverses such as could not be paralleled in the history of the last fifty years the reverses could hardly continue now that england had learned the fighting power of the united states navy she would certainly smother the infant sea power with a relentless blockade but blockade could never prevent the escape of raiders and commerce destroyers nineteen years of war with france had shown that england would have to grin and bear her losses while the slow process of strangulation went on what he was concerned about was that the augusta should not be one of those losses signal midshipman he snapped augusta to cormorant take station one mile to windward the gay flags soared up and were acknowledged by the cormorant in her station a mile to windward she was interposed between the augusta and any stray raider who might try to swoop down upon her the augusta crept out from the shore and turned downchannel on her cruise behind her stretched the cliffs of england the seven sisters and the towering height of beachy head hornblower looked over at the king and his courtiers he watched the pathetic whitehaired figure making its way here and there with uncertain steps while the shortsighted blue eyes examined everything and he came to the conclusion that undoubtedly manifold was wrong in his notion of the correct treatment surely this life this clean air and these simple distractions were better for a diseased mind than the bleedings and purgatives and solitary confinement which manifold desired to inflict the kings course had brought him close to hornblower and the vague blue eyes were studying hornblowers face again little sophia likes the sea he said yes your majesty hornblower knew that sophia was the kings favourite daughter dead these twenty years and more he had heard of the happy little holidays on the dorset coast which the king had once enjoyed with his young family the kings brow wrinkled as he struggled with his memory little sophia he said where is she now she was with me a little while ago her royal highness is on a journey sir interposed the lordinwaiting there was a perceptible scotch accent in his voice to match the ribbon of the thistle which he wore but why she didnt tell me anything about it said the king she left the message with me sir her humblest duty and respects sir but she did not have time to await your majestys return to say goodby in person her royal highness will be back again on tuesday and meanwhile hopes that your majesty will remember to be as quiet and good as if she were here tuesday said the king tuesday it is a long time to wait for little sophia but i suppose i must i will hornblowers eyes met the lordinwaitings and hornblower felt his heart warming suddenly to him the kindly little deception the dextrous hint of the need for quiet showed that this scottish lord had the sense and tact necessary for his position and his smile showed that he cherished the same kindly feelings towards the mad king as hornblower did hornblower suddenly ceased to remember how much higher the order of the thistle ranked above the order of the bath which ornamented his own breast his majesty said the lordinwaiting wishes to command your presence at dinner that gives me great pleasure sir said hornblower that was hardly a correct statement hornblower found not that the dinner was not quite excellent despite the fact that the royal cooks were flustered and unhandy in their unwonted situation the food was good and the service allowing for the cramped space of the great cabin efficient but it did hornblowers appetite no good to see the king his table cutlery limited to a spoon seated with a watchful attendant at each side and eating as clumsily as a child and daubing his cheeks with bread and milk so it was almost a relief despite the foreboding of trouble which it brought him when a midshipman slipped into the great cabin and whispered in his ear mr whites respects sir and its getting thick outside hornblower laid aside his napkin nodded apologetically to the lordinwaiting and hastened out it was only when his foot was on the companion that he realized that he had completely forgotten about making his bow to the king outside as mr white had reported it was undoubtedly getting thick long narrow bands of haze were drifting over the surface of the sea the surest indication of an approaching dense fog the cormorant to windward was already nearly invisible with night approaching visibility would soon be negligible hornblower pulled at his chin and debated what he should do shoreham harbour lay to starboard but the tide did not serve and the wind was falling it would be risky to venture into shoal water in a fog as with every captain in difficulties his first instinct was to get out to sea away from the dangerous land to seaward lay added dangers from raiders but the chance of meeting a privateer was easily preferable to the certainty of shoal water hornblower gave his orders to the helmsman and called the signal midshipman augusta to cormorant he said course south keep closer it was a distinct relief to see through the thickening haze the acknowledgement mount to the cormorants masthead while the corvette turned obediently and shook out her mainsail to take up her new station a quarter of an hour later it was too thick to see across the deck and hornblower thanked his stars he had decided to get out to sea instead of trying for shoreham harbour get that bell ringing mr white he ordered sharply aye aye sir said an invisible mr white the loud rattle of the fog bell echoed dully in the heavy atmosphere and the silence that ensued hung heavy as the augusta crept slowly over the invisible water it seemed a very long two minutes before it rang again seemingly close at hand the bell was answered by another on the port quarter thats cormorant sir said white at hornblowers side hornblower did not condescend to reply to a remark futile in its obviousness the next time the other bell sounded it seemed to be well to starboard what the hell said white the direction of sound in a fog was always misleading fog banks sometimes echoed back sound as effectively as a cliff face the augustas own bell rang long and harshly and the cormorants reply could only just be heard hornblower tried to remember all he knew about melville of the cormorant young dashing ambitious he had been posted as captain after a bold cuttingout affair somewhere on the biscay coast but it was doubtful if his qualities were such as to enable him to perform the difficult task of keeping touch with a consort in a fog again the augustas bell rang and this time he could hear no reply at all dr manifold was on deck now and approaching the sacred presence of the captain the command of the royal yacht exposed him to these plagues and hornblower felt he would gladly exchange it for that of the crankiest shipoftheline in the channel fleet that noise disturbs my patient sir said manifold i am sorry but it is a necessary noise answered hornblower i insist on its stopping there is only one man on board here answered hornblower his exasperation boiling over who can insist on anything and he insists that you go below sir i beg your pardon sir if i have to repeat myself sir said hornblower i will call a couple of hands to carry out what i say you are a boor sir i have the ear of a cabinet minister and by george sir ill dr manifold cut his speech short as hornblower turned to the midshipman at the quarterdeck with the evident intention of carrying out his threat he bolted down the companion as nearly like a rabbit as his portly dignity permitted pass the word for my steward said hornblower as he had intended doing and when the man came on deck bring me a chair and a pea jacket hornblower spent the night in the hammock chair wrapped up in the thick coat he was unwilling to leave the deck while this fog persisted it was a weary vigil and whenever he dozed off he was awakened with a start by the clamour of the fog bell at the end of the night white was standing beside him it must be dawn by now sir said white but i cant say it looks any different the fog was as thick as ever the main yard was invisible from the deck listen said hornblower sitting up tensely his ear had caught the faintest sounds somewhere astern its acute analysis told him of the wash of water the creaking of timber the rattle of cordage all blended and reduced in volume so as to tell him of the presence of a ship somewhere in the near distance then they both heard plainly and distinctly a voice in the fog say call the watch theyre speaking english said white thats cormorant then thank god go and stop the fog bell quick snapped hornblower and white was impressed enough by the urgency of his tone to run to do his queer bidding without question while hornblower still listened keep the hands quiet said hornblower on whites return i dont want a sound on board there had been something odd about the pronunciation of that word watch the vowel was broadened in a fashion no english officer would employ hornblower did not believe that it was the cormorant that lay astern there send a hand to the chains with the lead said the voice in the fog queer whispered white the explanation still had not dawned upon him he was not as quickwitted as his captain hornblower walked aft and stared through the mist over the taffrail there was just the faintest thickening there the merest most inconsiderable nucleus in the fog a ship was crossing their wake from starboard to port not yards away and unsuspecting hornblower watched until the nucleus had lost itself again in the fog over the port quarter mr white he said im going to haul my wind port your helm quartermaster the augusta swung round and headed on a course exactly opposite to that of the other ship hornblower could be confident that the distance between the two was widening steadily though slowly there was only the faintest of breaths of air to push the augusta through the water here came the king up bright and early on this misty morning attendants with him hornblower grudged the moments of distraction from his duty of staring into the fog king george straddled on the slightly heaving deck like an old sailor one way and another he must have spent a great deal of time at sea morning said the king good morning sir said hornblower foggy day what thick weather what what there was a lucidity about his manner that had been totally wanting yesterday perhaps his day at sea had really done him good a gleam of light came through the fog and suddenly there was sky to be seen overhead theres cormorant sir said white no by gad shes not a mile astern a ship was to be seen headed on an opposite course with every second her outline became clearer and sharper as they watched she wove around in pursuit of them revealing herself as heavily sparred and wellarmed with twelve gunports a side she was hastily setting all sail the white pyramids of canvas grew as if by magic in a fashion that would have been creditable in a kings ship set all sail mr white smartly now men pretty pretty said the king smiling in the sunshine whether he was alluding to the ordered bustle of setting sail or to the appearance of the pursuing ship was not apparent the augusta had all sail set as soon as the other ship and mr white was paying careful attention to their trim as she ate her way closehauled to windward it was some time before he could spare a moment to stare through his glass at the other vessel a yankee by gad he exclaimed as the red and white bars of the flag she hoisted danced into the field of his glass hoist our colours mr white but not the royal standard there was no purpose in telling the american what a prize was being dangled under his nose hornblower peered through his glass at her if she managed to work up within close range there was no hope for it he would have to surrender as the augustas sixpounder popguns would stand no chance against the others heavy metal and then hornblowers imagination boggled at the thought of what would happen next what would the americans do with a captive king the king against whom they had fought for so many weary years a generation ago he tried to picture the effect of the news in new york or boston he was so interested in the idea that he quite forgot that he himself and his career were in jeopardy american boats would swarm out to the narrows to meet them there would be jubilation and excitement and then and then there was a tradition of hospitality and kindliness across the ocean faults on both sides had brought about this war faults that might easily be forgotten when america tried as she surely would to make the poor old king as comfortable as possible the unnecessary war might end in a wholly desirable peace for one insane moment hornblower was almost tempted to risk it and he was positively shocked with himself when he realized the depths of the treason with which he was dallying it was his duty to escape with the augusta if he could for that matter she would be a captive by now if his quick brain had not steered her towards safety the moment he had first heard that american voice through the fog there was a bank of fog up there to windward once let the augusta bury herself therein and she stood a chance of safety that fool melville in the cormorant was apparently quite lost a puff of smoke from the americans bows and a fountain of water yards on the starboard quarter take him below said hornblower curtly to the lordinwaiting with a gesture at the king no said the king with a stamp of his foot and hornblower had no time for further argument clear away that ninepounder he said the long nine on the quarterdeck might perhaps shoot away a spar and save them another puff of smoke from the american and this time there was a sudden howl overhead like devils in torment she was firing with dismantling shot lengths of chain joined to a common centre rolled in a ball and fired from a gun in the course of the projectiles trajectory the chains swung out and circled screaming in the air spelling destruction to any rigging they might hit come on with that gun there have you all got wooden legs hornblower called the men threw their weight on the train tackles and ran it out the gun captain crouched over the sights as he did so the american allowed her head to fall away from the wind she showed her side and when every gunport was in view she suddenly enveloped herself in the smoke of a full broadside it sounded like some devils orchestra as the air filled with the din of the dismantling shot screaming all about them hornblower looked anxiously upward and was astonished to see how little damage had been done then he remembered the same astonishment in other battles the sea was so large the target so small by comparison a miss was so easy a hit so difficult a halliard had been cut white had already started a hand up the rigging to splice it and a long tear appeared in the maintopsail and the american had lost yards by yawing out of her course to deliver that broadside the bang of the sternchaser beside him caught him off his guard and almost startled him out of his wits he hoped no one noticed the nervous jump which nearly lifted him from the deck no one could see where the shot fell at least the american showed no sign of damage the king was standing breathing in the smell of the powder smoke that eddied round him he was clearly enjoying himself mad or no he was full of the traditional courage of his family there was no sense in repeating the order to take him below in that case for the flimsy sides of the royal yacht would be of small avail in keeping out twelvepounder balls the american was yawing again hornblower watched fascinated as gun after gun of her broadside crept into view then came the gust of smoke and the howl of the projectiles and an immense clatter aloft as everything seemed to go at once the maintopsail yard lurched lopsided its slings shot away the foretopmast was gone altogether and hanging overside ropes were parted everywhere and the little augusta lay crippled she was hardly able to move through the water and the american could overhaul her at her leisure now there could be no question of making a hopeless fight of it not with the king on board all he could do was to try to prolong the chase by keeping the augusta moving as long as possible clear that raffle away mr white he said loudly and cheerfully for the benefit of the crew focsle there cut that wreckage clear what are you thinking about the men were leaping to their tasks but the american was coming up hand over hand behind she had lost ground to leeward through yawing and now she was going about so as to get up to windward of the chase her other broadside would bear soon hornblower decided that when it did he would have to surrender he found himself wondering again how the king would enjoy a visit to boston or philadelphia and then shook off these idle thoughts to supervise again the work of clearing the wreckage and as he did so he caught a glimpse of a faint blot in the fog bank ahead something was looming out of it growing sharper every second he saw the headsails of a ship so definite was the fog bank that the headsails were illumined by the sunshine before the aftersails were visible he knew her she was the cormorant tardily retracing her course in search of her precious convoy he cheered wildly and involuntarily and the surprised crew looking in the direction in which he pointed cheered with him the cormorant came flying down to them with every sail set but as they watched they saw her upper yards thick with men as she got in her royals ready for action they gave her another cheer as she went by the american was clawing up to windward trying to get the weather gauge in the approaching duel with this formidable opponent but the fog bank had reached the augusta by now one or two little wreaths of mist drifted across her deck and then she plunged deep into it and the battle they were leaving behind was hidden from view hornblower heard the two opening broadsides each one sharp and distinct sure proof in either case of a welldisciplined crew and then the firing changed to a long continuous roll of artillery without the king on board hornblower would have turned his ship about crippled as she was to join in the fight hut he knew his duty he was about to shout an order to mr white when his attention was attracted by the approach of the king a good boy said his majesty good boys get guineas the smile on the foolish face was quite winning and charming the king brought his hand out of the royal fob pocket and put something into hornblowers hand it was not a guinea that desirable and elegant coin had disappeared from circulation altogether now that england was in arms against all the world the coin epitomized the financial straits through which england was struggling it was a spanish silver dollar with struck into it the profile of the king who had just presented it to hornblower queer legal currency for the wealthiest nation in the world thank you sir said hornblower doffing his hat and bowing low as the spirit of the moment dictated they were through the fog bank now and the sun was shining on them again lighting up the face of the king far astern the long roll of artillery came to a sudden end perhaps one ship or the other had hauled down her colours perhaps at this moment the boarders were fighting hand to hand on the littered decks perhaps after all thought hornblower it might have been better if the cormorant had not arrived in time for the battle some lives would have been saved many more perhaps if peace had resulted from an enforced visit of the king to the united states he tried once more to picture the king landing at the battery but even his imagination boggled at that
